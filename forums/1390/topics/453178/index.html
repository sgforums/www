              <p>SINGAPORE: A regular in the Singapore Navy has been suspended following charges of alleged acts of indecency committed in Australia.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) said 21—year—old Lieutenant (LTA) Benedict Ang Yong Chuean was training at the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra.</p>
              <p>The academy is a partnership between the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and the University of New South Wales (UNSW) which provides training and education for Navy, Army and Air Force cadets from Australia and 16 other defence forces around the world.</p>
              <p>Channel NewsAsia understands LTA Ang was a top officer cadet, having won the navy’s Sword of Honour.</p>
              <p>The sword goes to the top officer cadet in his or her training cohort.</p>
              <p>Australian media reports said LTA Ang was arrested on Sunday after he allegedly entered the room of a female cadet in Canberra on May 6.</p>
              <p>LTA Ang has been charged with two counts of indecency without consent.</p>
              <p>He pleaded not guilty to both charges on Tuesday in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Magistrates Court.</p>
              <p>Reports said he has been granted bail, on the condition that he not make contact with five other cadets at the Academy.</p>
              <p>MINDEF’s director of public affairs Colonel Kenneth Liow said LTA Ang was scheduled to appear again in court on August 9.</p>

              <p><strong>Previous ADFA sex scandals</strong></p>
              <p>The Academy has come under increased scrutiny over the past 12 months after a number of arrests for alleged sexual misconduct.</p>
              <p>In April last year cadets Daniel McDonald, 19, and Dylan De Blaquiere, 18, were arrested and charged over the ‘‘Skype scandal’’ at the academy after they both allegedly streamed video of a sexual encounter between McDonald and a female cadet to a room of cadets next door. Both McDonald and De Blaquiere have pleaded not guilty and are currently awaiting trial.</p>
              <p>In another incident an international officer cadet was arrested and charged after allegedly attempting to film a fellow student in the shower.</p>
              <p>Pakistani national 21-year-old Obaid Fayyaz allegedly left his mobile phone in a shower vent in August last year. He is currently on trial in the ACT Magistrates Court.</p>
              <p>The Skype incident sparked an inquiry into sexual harassment at the institution, and led to the head of the Academy being suspended. Commodore Bruce Kafer returned to work in March this year after being cleared by an official review over his handling of the incident</p>
              <p>from looks of it,it seems foreigners are played out by aussies.think spore should hire me to protect these officer spore kids! but i think like in all the SAF methods of saving their own soldiers..its simply a case of too late and too little.now australians and world would look at spore officers even with a sword of honour made of gold  at his side as just another petty thief.<br><br>Read more: <a style="color: #003399;" href="http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/adfa-cadet-arrested-for-indecent-acts-20120528-1zdpk.html#ixzz1wOYmDNrK">http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/adfa-cadet-arrested-for-indecent-acts-20120528-1zdpk.html#ixzz1wOYmDNrK</a></p>

Factoids on why it occurred, how it took place, who was in charge are premature and speculative at this juncture, pending a full and thorough investigation. If we wait for all the pieces to fall into place before a statement is issued, that could take weeks. My 2 cents.<br><br>Note: Warships at anchor are usually given precise coordinates to drop anchor. At least that's what I observed on my embed aboard USS Russell some years back (my only at-sea embed that didn't see the host vessel come alongside. OFE doesn't count.). The Russell's NO said the anchor detail took immense pride in hitting the exact spot as closely as possible when we arrived in Phuket.<br><br>Source: ABC<br><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/09/12/3009380.htm?site=darwin%C2%A7ion=news"><span style="color: #4d469c;">http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/09/12/3009380.htm?site=darwin§ion=news</span></a></div>

              <p>he is to be charged in australian court on singapores national day.</p>
              <p>lets hope he upholds the singapore name  and his sword of honor too as his last stand like i did when the aussies tried it on me on a national day too.dont expect an ounce of mercy from oz side, because if he fails ,the entire OCS can close shop and  the gold  guilded sword of honor with jewels studded on it turned into letter openers.</p>
              <p>even his death might be insufficient to repair back the damage caused by him or others.just make sure he is innocent in order to uphold the name of singapore with sword of honor or medal of honor recepients.but he is just a 21 yr old scholar with no experience in life and was even caught or played out so.............i hope mindef people wont go tell him he can do it on his own.</p>

              <p>Qns: What is going to happen if the medal of honour navy officer is charged in Australia?</p>
              <p>Ans: All the generals, trainers and senior ranking officers in OCS would be labelled as incumbent fools who are not only clumsy but weak in any decision making.They would be called LOSER army in the military world  irregardless even if they had an F-35 or even a millinium falcon in their arsenal!</p>
              <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Qns: What is going to happen if navy officer gets charged on national day?</p>
              <p>Ans: The court will laugh at singapore and its military as they could turn your medal of honour recipient into instant trash on your spore national day even.Best insult to singapore  ...so what u have the best modern military hardware!!!they say u eat shit and even your medal of honour recepients have to eat shit......dun see what so special about other sporeans....so  thats it!spore officers especially medal of honours will be viewed as common petty thieves.even an australian beggar they would say has more dignity and honour than a spore mililtary officer any day!</p>
              <p>After that incident , they would look at all spore officers sent there for training as criminals,rapists,drug dealers and homeless people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please make sure that dumb officer from navy gets his honour back or its shit for all the entire spore generals right to the top minister!if u fail to do that ,they will view u all as 3rd world rubbish as that will make them swollen headed.And the singaporeans would be viewed as mere stupid people following stupid generals who promote people to obtain a medal of honour unwisely and military  leaders who are stupid petty thieves!</p>
              <p>u cant afford to lose the case!</p>
