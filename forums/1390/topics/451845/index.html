              <p>I heard this news. It's quite upsetting to hear suicide cases. I guess the investigation is to see the reason why he committed suicide. If it's due to military stress issue, that's why it's important to plan carefully before signing up as regular. It's life commitment. Once sign-on, there's no way leave due to contract and stuff.</p>

He had too much good going for him to do such an act like ending his own life. What was not reported is that this man was actually found with his hands and feet bound. If you wanted to hang yourself, would it make sense to tie your limbs up? He also had bruises on his body, so what? He beat himself up with his own hands then decide to kill himself? </p></div>

              <p>I suggest you guys not speculate and spread rumors...whatever, wherever you hear from. Because nobody can verify if it is true and it will only add more troubles/sorrow to innocent persons.</p>
              <p>All these 'hear from who...hear from who...' - if SIB comes and ask you, what do you say? 'oh sorry, i forgot who told me....errr my this friend , that friend say...hear from their father's mother's friend's son...'</p>
              <p>Let SIB do their job and they will investigate.</p>

              Its a disgrace to the Military Air Force, (esp to Changi Air Base). Such things can take place inside the camp !! This is so disgraceful !! An explanation should be given to the family by mindef. As for the Culprits who did that to Suresh, I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE STILL HANGING OUTSIDE. MOTHER F%CK#RS!!! YOUR DAYS ARE BEING NUMBERED!!!
