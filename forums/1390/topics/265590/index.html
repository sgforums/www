            <div class='col-md body'>My brother signed on with the Air Force after graduating from NTU, but he was a QM during NS, so his example won't directly apply to you. (He's a now a LTC, after 15 years of service.) My comments are based more on I recall about the way he went about his application.<br><br>Sure, it's possible to sign on as an officer. But you must remember the SAF will respond like any civilian employer: i.e. shortlist a selected few for an interview (&amp; additional medical checkup, in this case), but won't explain the reasons behind the other rejected applications.<br><br>Your collegiate majors should also mesh with your desired job. So, generally speaking, you'll have a better chance signing on as an engineering or logistics officer. Combat is more difficult, unless you have proven leadership evidence &amp;/or testimonials from your former NS or present reservist CO supporting your application.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for this issue, my friend did some asking b4. For army, one can only sign on as a combat officer if he is a commissioned officer during his nsf days. While for logistic/engineering officers, he must be at least a 3sg during his nsf days. As for navy and air force, it is possible to sign on regardless of ur rank in nsf. So long as u have required degree, pes status, ippt. In addition, of cos all the interview and ur past record in nsf days.</div>
