            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>The commanders changes every now and then what, so the standard of the company should also change what</blockquote>There you go, you've got the hang of it. Most of these feedback is topical, provided by tipsters who'd recently gone through it.<br><br>I think that, on the whole, such myth-building is due to the frantic churning of NSF instuctors, leaving a lack of leadership continuity at the junior level. Regulars tended to end up with larger-than-life personalities too, much cuz their postings lasted longer. Those old birds "left behind" can spin their own lore which, over time, then ran on its own legs.<br><br>Can think of some personal examples. My brother happened to be posted later to the same Delta platoon as mine during the '80s, with one of my section leaders (the newest incoming NCO) becoming platoon SGT by my bro's time. So the internal promotion took place after only a year or so, or about 4 BMT intakes. But he no longer remembered me!<br><br>I remember also my platoon excavating the open ground outside our bunk overnight, ostensibly as "punishment" for trench-digging &amp; later (as we are told) to house an exercise park for future recruits. My bro told me it became a garden but no one knew its history. The episode sorta personalified NS for me: nothing's to really linger from a previous batch's time except what's in myth, no matter how memorable that experience was, be it in BMT, coursetime or unit life.<br><br>Remember the Charlie Company ghost story? The death supposedly occurred with the March 1983 batch; I'd enlisted 6 intakes later &amp; the bunk in question was one building away from mine in Delta. Honestly, none of my kakis heard about a haunting then -- I even darted past it during my secret treks to the canteen for supper -- although my memory can vaguely recall a deep apprehension over rumors about military fatalities. With such impressionable mindsets, I realized my DI or OC can pretty much claim anything &amp; who amongst us would question otherwise?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"xiongness" depends on how well you can take the different types of exercises. Some people are naturally stronger with their arms and can do more push ups than others so they wont find it as xiong.<br><br>Some people can run better. My company last time also bring whole platoon to run during the evenings(after dinner wtf?) whenever my 2wo sir dont feel like going home.<br><br>Some people hate mental torture. I remember some companies actually making soldiers clean their rifles till 11pm-2midnight. Then sergeants say go up in 15mins time i want the lights to be off. (no time to shower or prepare anything liao)  Some people really like to have their own free time. to rob them of their free time is more xiong than doing 400push ups.</div>
