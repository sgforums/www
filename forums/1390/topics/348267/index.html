              <p>skythewood, the topic Sir teraexa is deluded isn't on scholarship or SAF at all. Its about delusions and universities. Its in the scholar thread cos the thread went.. out of topic.

              <p>Sir teraexa also made slurs against poly students and said how many poly students actually make it in life, when I told him that SG non grads,and especially poly grads have superior critical thinking and independent thought than the Farmer graduates.</p>

              <p>"shameless paupers think they are no different from kings. That's because they are shameless paupers": means, a pauper with a self-checking mechanism will not think he's no different from a king. A pauper without a self-checking mechanism ie shameless, think they are no different from kings. Thus, they think that way because they are shameless (paupers), as opposed to a non-shameless pauper. Is it clear now?<br><br>My observation is farmer graduates are of such low calibre and quality, that they are a tier lower than poly grads. Do you think poly grads are better than elite uni grads? You tell me...<br><br>In any case, teraexa, upper echelon (not barring sales and MLM jobs) means earning S$8000-$10000 at 26 years old.  I know the income ranges of most industries, including start-ups. And i know how much you will draw at 26. $1K+ as a pupil. When you start at 27 you won't even draw half of that. So ...take your upper echelon dreams to farmerland where you actually have an audience who will lap it up greedily and sux your balls in agreement.</p>

              <p>Haha, by your definition of upper echelons, even a SAFOS is not considered one because there's no way he can get to that payscale by 26 (that is probably around a scheme C major-2 pay). Major-2 by 26? Maybe our PM ba.</p>
