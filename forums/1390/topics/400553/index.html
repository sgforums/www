              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Is there anyone who knows about this vocation? I'm thinking of signing on, but would like to know more about the vocation. Do you have to go through standard army regimentation, bmt training, guard duties etc? Also, what do you do when in harbour? I heard they send the recruits to shatec to study, is it true? The pay is about 1365-1965, does anyone know if there's additional like offshore travelling bonus?</p>
              <p>Sorry about the barrage of questions, very curious and interested. If anyone is a naval chef him/herself and is willing to share the pros and cons, could you drop me a msg please?</p>

              <p>the cook on the ship is really the cook on the ship. Basically he is in charge of doing the 3 meals. He has to go through BMT. You need to have a shatec cert. I am not sure if they accept people without cert NOW. But every year need to undergo FFI to check for lung disease and other medical conditions.</p>
              <p>There is offshore bonus. No guard duties on ship. Cook 3 meals and arrange for food logisitics.</p>
              <p>The cook skills of our naval ship is up to a certain standard, proper nice meal, sometimes there will be visitors they will get on the embarked ship instead of cook house. </p>
              <p>I think if you wan to go through the chef path, it is better to go through the restaurant, commis cook route. You get the proper training and you learn more things in the outside world. If you wan to sign on, your cooking skill will still be low level, and you will be worth little when you ORD. And you may need to call a younger boy "senior" when you are out. </p>
              <p>Now the sea animals are gone, most of the ship are big, with big kitchen. so you get to do your stuff easily. </p>
              <p>There is not much stuff, I remember on about naval chef, they just cook the three meals on the ships. Sometimes they fish on the ship for fishes to cook. Their cooking skills are up to standard. They do increase the chef pay drastically, to retain good chef. So the pay may be alot more than it is stated.  </p>
