              <p> </p>
              <div class="news_detail" style="font-size: 10px; direction: ltr; color: #4e4e4e; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif; line-height: 14px;">
              <div style="direction: ltr;">
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">SINGAPORE: The Committee to Strengthen National Service (CSNS) is looking into giving national servicemen a chance to pick their vocation.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said this on Tuesday, days after his visit to Finland and Switzerland.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">He had led a delegate comprising CSNS members last week to the two countries to study their conscription systems.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">Dr Ng said both countries are similar to Singapore in terms of population size and the number of men who enlist into NS each year.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">The two countries also give servicemen a choice in their vocations to optimise their contributions, and this is something that could be explored in Singapore.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">This could mean allowing servicemen some freedom to choose specific units, based on their skills and interests. This would be an expansion of the current system where servicemen are given the chance to express their preference to attend command school or not after their Basic Military Training. </p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">Dr Ng also noted the strong support for national service from employers in Finland and Switzerland, even without incentives.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">He said that's because they see the value in the qualities and skills servicemen pick up from their stints.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">So apart from better engaging employers in Singapore, there is also the option of certifying skills and values such as leadership. Dr Ng said this could be in the form of a collaboration with the Workforce Development Agency.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">Dr Ng also said that women have a role to play in the Singapore Armed Forces, even though the country will not move towards full-time NS for women.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">And, he said the current volunteer scheme could be expanded.<br>The scheme currently allows women, new citizens and first-generation permanent residents to contribute.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">But they do not undergo Basic Military Training, and contribute in more skills-related roles such as nurses and radiographers.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">NSmen who have completed their reservist cycles can also opt to continue as a volunteer.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">Another area that is being looked into is that of facilitating smoother transition between studies before and after National Service. This comes as servicemen enlist at different points based on the different education paths they take and having to wait to enrol in universities after completing their National Service.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">The CSNS recommendations are in line with the results of a survey on national service conducted by the Institute of Policy Studies recently.</p>

              <p><span>National Servicemen can expect new measures to better
              motivate, support, and recognise them, as well to help them balance
              their NS commitments with their family and career
              commitments.</span></p>
              <p>These aims were revealed by the Committee to Strengthen National
              Service on Wednesday, after it held its first meeting at the Basic
              Military Training Centre on Pulau Tekong. Over the next six months,
              the committee will gather ideas from servicemen and the public
              through focus group discussions and town hall sessions.</p>
              <p>The public may also air their views on a new website <a title="www.strengthenNS.sg" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.strengthenNS.sg">www.strengthenNS.sg</a> or through e-mail at
              <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:strengthenNS@starnet.gov.sg">strengthenNS@starnet.gov.sg</a>.</p>
              <p>The 20-member committee is chaired by Defence Minister Ng Eng
              Hen, and includes Members of Parliament, senior military personnel,
              employers, and NSmen. It was set up during this year's Committee of
              Supply Debate in March, which saw robust debate over how to better
              recognise National Servicemen in light of continued immigration and
              the need to preserve a Singapore core. In recent months, members of
              the public have responded to the news by calling for greater
              monetary incentives, including subsidies for transport, education
              and health, and time-off to rest after reservist in-camp
              training.</p>
              <p>Over the next six months, Singaporeans will be asked for
              feedback on how to beef up National Service.</p>
              <p>The Committee to Strengthen National Service, announced in
              March, will lead focus group discussions and town hall sessions
              while also conducting online consultation sessions via a new
              website, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/strengthenNS/index.html">www.strengthenNS.sg</a></p>
              <p>The Committee meeting for the first time today, expects its work
              to be done within a year.</p>
              <p>Made up of 20 members, including Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen,
              Members of Parliament,military top brass and private sector
              employers, the committee will use the feedback gathered to
              recommend measures to enhance National Service as a critical
              institution for Singapore's continued survival and success.</p>
              <p>The measures are meant to motivate servicemen to give their best
              in serving, help them balance their duties with family and work
              commitments, enhance support from families, companies, new citizens
              and the broader community, and promote recognition of servicemen's
              efforts.</p>

              <p>At the Committee of Supply Debates on 12 March 2013, Minister 
                  for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen announced that he would chair a Committee to 
                  Strengthen National Service (CSNS). In order to capture a a broad 
                  spectrum of views and perspectives on NS, the CSNS comprises a Steering 
                  Committee of 20 members from a variety of backgrounds and experiences.</p>
              <p>The CSNS will recommend measures to strengthen NS as the critical 
                  institution for Singapore’s continued survival and success. A strong 
                  defence and security protects our sovereignty and way of life. The 
                  measures should further:</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;">a. Motivate National Servicemen to give of their fullest in performing their duties;</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;">b. Help National Serviceman balance these duties with family, career and personal commitments;</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;">c. Strengthen support for NS from families, employers, schools, permanent residents, new citizens and the broader community; and</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;">d. Promote recognition and appreciation of the contributions of National Servicemen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The <strong><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/strengthenNS/about/members.html">Steering Committee (SC)</a></strong> will be supported by two Working Groups (WGs), with Second Minister for
                   Defence Mr Chan Chun Sing chairing one, and Minister of State for 
                  Defence Dr Maliki Osman, the other.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/strengthenNS/about/support_wg.html"><strong>"Support for NS" </strong><strong>Work Group</strong></a><strong> </strong>will
                   explore how to better allow National Servicemen to maximise their 
                  contributions and abilities to serve NS.  The WG will look at how 
                  servicemen can be deployed in a more meaningful way, and how to help 
                  them fulfill their duties while balancing commitments and aspirations. 
                  The WG will also look into strengthen support from various groups, such 
                  as families, employers, permanent residents and new citizens.</p>
              <p>The <strong><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/strengthenNS/about/recognition_wg.html">"Recognition and Benefits for National Service" Work Group</a></strong> will explore ways to promote the recognition and appreciation of National Servicemen's contributions.</p>
              <p>Over the next 6 months, the Steering Committee and WGs will engage 
                  Singaporeans through conversations on NS via focus groups, town hall 
                  sessions and this website. Committee members will also be participating 
                  in these activities, and surfacing the views of National Servicemen and 
                  other stakeholders on how NS can be strengthened.</p>
