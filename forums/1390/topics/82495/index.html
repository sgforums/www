            <div class='col-md body'><strong>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON FULL-TIME NATIONAL SERVICE DURATION<br><br>Q1. What are the factors that have prompted MINDEF to reduce full-time National Service duration now?<br></strong><br><br>The reduction is possible now because of a confluence of two factors.<br><br>The key driver is the transformation of the SAF over the next decade into a 3rd Generation SAF, a force that makes greater use of superior technology in areas such as comprehensive surveillance, battle-field awareness, precision strike and network-centric warfare. The 3G SAF will rely less on large numbers of soldiers, and more on the higher education levels and capability of our NS soldiers.<br><br>The transformation has already begun to bear fruit. A good example of this is the Apache Longbow helicopter. These helicopters come equipped with radar, guided missiles and data links between helicopters, which will increase their lethality.<br><br>The second factor is a 15% to 20% increase in annual intake of full-time National Servicemen over the next ten years starting from 2006. This surge in NS intake will allow us to maintain our operational readiness and standing force requirements even as we move to a 24-month full-time NS system and carry out the transformation towards the leaner 3G SAF of the future.<br><br>The SAF's training and operational standards will be maintained even with the 6 month reduction. Over the years, the SAF has significantly improved its training effectiveness through the introduction of new systems and technologies. The use of simulators, wargaming systems and Computer Aided Instruction has enhanced training effectiveness while saving time.<br><br><strong><br>Q2. When will the revised 24-month full-time National Service duration be implemented?<br></strong><br><br>The revised full-time National Service duration will be implemented for all servicemen enlisted from December 2004 onwards.<br><br><strong><br>Q3. Will in-service full-time National Servicemen currently serving 2Â½ years also be eligible for a reduction in service duration?<br></strong><br><br>Full-time National Servicemen who are currently serving their 2Â½ years of service will get up to a 2-month reduction in service duration. However, the earliest date that the ORD can be brought forward to will be 30 June 2004, to allow time for administrative out-processing arrangements.<br><br>Those who are enlisted between June and November this year for 2Â½ years of full-time NS will get a 4-month reduction in full-time NS duration.<br><br>Full-time National Servicemen returning from disruption to serve out the balance of their 2Â½ years of full-time NS will also be given a corresponding cut in their full-time NS duration based on the cohort in which they were enlisted.<br><br>The current 8-week reduction in full-time NS duration given to National Servicemen who have attained at least a Silver in the National Physical Fitness Award (NAPFA) test prior to enlistment will remain.<br><br><strong><br>Q4. Will the revised full-time National Service duration apply to servicemen in the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and Singapore Police Force (SPF)?<br></strong><br><br>Yes, the Ministry of Home Affairs will be implementing the corresponding changes for full-time National Servicemen currently serving in or who will be enlisted into the Singapore Police Force and the Singapore Civil Defence Force.<br><strong><br>Q5. Only those who are required to serve 2Â½ years of full-time National Service duration benefit from the 6-month cut. Why is a reduction not possible for those who are required to serve 2 years of full-time National Service?<br></strong><br><br>The length of full-time National Service is determined by how long it takes to train our soldiers and commanders to be operationally proficient in their duties, and how large a standing force we need to meet our defence and contingency needs during peacetime. Our units require a national service duration of 24 months to allow for up to 12 months of training and at least another 12 months for the unit to be deployed for operational duties. A reduction will result in a drop in the size of our standing force and adversely affect the ability of the SAF to meet operational requirements.<br><br><strong><br>Q6. Will the intake schedules of our local universities be adjusted to minimise the waiting time to enter university now that the duration of NS has been reduced by 6 months?<br></strong><br><br>MINDEF will be working with our local universities to better align the university intake patterns from 2007 when the first batch of full-time National Servicemen under the new full-time NS duration completes their service.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Singapore is shortening its full-time National Service by six months.<br><br>NSmen, who are 18 years of age and promoted to the rank of corporals or higher, will only serve two years instead of two-and-half years.<br><br>This takes effect from the December 2004 intake.<br><br>There will also be a graduated reduction in NS stints for batches enlisted earlier.<br><br>In a ministerial statement to Parliament on Tuesday, Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean assured the nation that the operational readiness of the Singapore Armed Forces and its ability to carry out its mission will not be affected.<br><br>Rear-Admiral Teo explained that two key factors have come together to allow for this change - the transformation of the SAF into a third generation fighting force and a projected surge in the NS intake over the next 10 years.<br><br>There will be a 15 to 20 percent increase in the annual intake of full-time NS men over 10 years from 2006.<br><br>This is because of a higher birth rate from the Dragon year in 1988, which lasted till 1997.<br><br>There will be no change for those serving two years full-time NS.<br><br>The Home Affairs Ministry will make similar cuts for those serving NS in the Singapore Police Force and Singapore Civil Defence Force.<br><br>Mindef is also working with local universities to realign their intakes from 2007 to be in line with the shorter NS stints.<br><br>The move to shorten National Service to two years was widely welcomed.<br><strong><br>A current NSman said: "I am serving my NS now, for this reduction, it is good for me because after NS I can find a job fast."<br></strong><br>A man who had completed his NS said: "I have served my NS and I think it's a good idea so they have less stress and more job opportunities."<br><strong><br>A Chinese High student said: "I think it's better for us because we get to concentrate more on our studies, if not the 2-1/2 year break will be quite long, then it will take us some time to get back on our own studying regime."<br></strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>A parent said: "It will take away six months from my son's training and he will graduate earlier, so I think the programme is good."<br><br>Another parent said: "It is good so that they can further their studies earlier at an earlier age."<br><br>A man in his mid-20s said: "Technology nowadays getting more advanced. If there is technology, why waste the manpower, the manpower can come in handy in Singapore economic structure."<br><strong><br>A Hwa Chong Junior College student said: "Actually half a year of training can be made up in secondary school or JC, to have more intense physical training." </strong>- CNA<br><br></div>
