              <p>To ensure that all NSmen are 'cardiovascular fit' to undergo the physical training, those NSmen who are aged 35 years and above are required to undergo medical screening before taking IPPT, RT and IPT. Please note that your pre-IPPT FFI is only valid till one day before your next scheduled FFI. The NSmen are required to contact their NS admin units for an appointment.<br><br><strong>Source:</strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ns.sg/"><strong>www.ns.sg</strong></a>, <strong>under the FAQ of Book IPPT section<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Medical Excuse and Examination</span></span><br></strong> <br><strong>Q1 What if I am injured or medically unfit to take my non-ICT IPPT during my qualifying window?<br></strong>It is important that you seek medical treatment on your own should you be injured or is medically unfit. The medical certificate that your doctor issued to you is recognised as valid medical excuse. However, you can only be exempted from the annual IPPT if you have a 6 months consecutive or 9 months cumulative of valid medical excuse within the same IPPT qualifying window. You are advised to contact your NS Unit to request for a medical review if you have more than 3 months of medical excuse for a particular injury that prevents you from taking your IPPT.</p>
              <p><strong>Q2 What if my 6 months consecutive or 9 months cumulative medical excuse straddle across two IPPT qualifying windows?<br></strong>You would be dealt with as an 'IPPT Defaulter' in the 1st qualifying window. Hence it is strongly encouraged that you should book your IPPT immediately after your qualifying window has started.</p>
              <p><strong>Q3 Do I need to inform my NS unit as and when I am awarded medical excuse from IPPT?<br></strong>As the onus of taking IPPT is with the individual, you should be able to determine whether your medical excuse for your injury will last beyond your current qualifying window and whether you have accumulated enough medical excuse to be exempted from the IPPT. You will need to keep records of all your medical excuses and submit to your NS Unit within 1 month of the close of your qualifying window to appeal against being dealt with as an 'IPPT Defaulter'.</p>
              <p>If you have more than 3 months of medical excuse for a particular injury that prevents you from taking your IPPT, you are advised to contact your NS Unit to request for a medical review.</p>
              <p><span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Q4 I have reached 35 years old and was informed that I need to do an FFI. What is an FFI?<br></strong></span>An FFI is a medical screening phase which NSmen will have to go through to be certified fit for IPPT. NSmen will need to undergo FFI when he reaches the age of 35, 37, 39, 40 and every year after 40. The FFI certificate issued will only be valid till your next medical screening age. Once again, the validity of the FFI is referenced from the date that you are issued with the FFI Certificate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;">You should contact your NS Unit to arrange for a FFI medical screening once you have reached 35 yrs or older. As FFI is a healthcare screening to ensure you are fit to participate in the IPPT, failure to pass your medical screening will disqualify you from taking the IPPT after you reached the age of 35 and beyond.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;">The example below best illustrates this FFI policy:<br>LTA (NS) Tan is 39 years old. He was born on 5 Jan 1965. He was overseas in early 2004 and only attended a FFI on Sep 2004 and obtained a 'fit for IPPT' FFI certificate from the camp MO. His FFI cert is only valid till 4 Jan 2005 (4 months) till he turns 40 years old. He is required to take another FFI after 5 Jan 2005 as FFI needs to be taken annually once a NSman reaches 39 years old and beyond.</span></p>
              <p><strong>Q5 Can I book for non-ICT IPPT even when I am not FFI cleared?<br></strong><span style="color: #339966;">As you can book a non-ICT IPPT session 3 months in advance, the booking system will accept your booking even if you are not FFI cleared. However, upon detecting that your FFI result is not available, the booking system will inform you that you have to complete your FFI (i.e. 'fit for IPPT') before the scheduled test date. If you have not cleared your FFI before the scheduled test date, you will be barred from the test session.</span></p>
