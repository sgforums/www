              <p>Hi. </p>
              <p>In 2008, I went for medical review and was graded PES B at CMPB. <br><br>Originally to be enlisted into BMTC School 1 for combat BMT. <br>However, when I was about to take my A levels, I was diagnosed schizophrenia by a hospital specialist and psychiatrist, and was downgraded to PES E9L9 and enlisted to SCDF in August 2009 as a clerk. During NS, I studied A Level as a private candidate. As I cannot handle the stress from both studies and NS daily role as a clerk, I started to experience symptoms of schizophrenia and sent to be warded at IMH ward for observation for two months. Upon my discharge from IMH, I continued as clerk in the fire station. However after few months, another relapse made me on MC for about a year. The officer-in-charge of me called my parents informing them that I am discharged/ exempted from NS. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">At that time, I was recovering and left with 4 months more to ORD. I then went to the office to sign some forms without collecting any official letter of declaring my discharge. I remember that it was somewhere in 2011. Since then, I was jobless and resting at home. I decided to retake my A level again, gotten average grades just enough for local university. I will be entering university this year 2013, but I wish to resume NS due to the NS Certificate of Service. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Early this month, I just requested for the resumption of NS to the Assistant Director of CMPB, a Major rank officer. After some emails exchanges, she noted that the MO replied that that my case file cannot be reopened/ case closed. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">My psychiatrist</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> in IMH  told me that my condition is stable due to medication control and I have not had any relapse for a long time. He is able to prove that I will be fit currently by writting a report to the CMPB medical officer. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Since I am able to take the stress from studies, move on with life and not having any relapse, why can't they review again by at least read my medical report?</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Right now, I re-appealed to CMPB and hope CMPB can allow me to serve to completion towards my remaining NS days balance to about 4 months to ORD for the Certificate of Service. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Can go to the Meet-the-People session or look for Defence Minister? </span></p>
              <p>Should I call up the NS hotline at 1800-3676767 to request CMPB to issue me a Certificate of Service? <br><br>Can a Certificate of Service be issued since I did served my NS, though was medically discharged officially from NS just 4 months prior to ORD?</p>

              <p>You just wan that blue paper "Certificate of Service". You should call up CMPB and asked them to reissue. Regardless, of the length of service, they will write the "reason for release" on it. But that is not going to look pretty.</p>
              <p>That cert is not very useful, because private companies don't ask for it. They dont give extra pay for guys anyway unlike public service. And for public services ... you should know lah.</p>
              <p>That cert is not very important, because when you finished your degree that will be an event that is 4 year ago. However, your mental illness will be the major obstacle for your employment in the future. </p>
              <p>If you die die wan to serve, your case is very special. You might seek help from MP or defence minister as this is beyond regular adminstration. Not forgeting, you are now a PURE civilian.</p>
