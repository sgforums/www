            <div class='col-md body'>To be picked for MP<br><br>I dunno how it was during the old days but during BMT they will have a selection where they funnel like 3-4 whole companies into 1 lecture room.Someone will give a briefing and then all those who are interested in MP will be asked to stay.One by one u will be asked to stand in front of the people who come down from SAFMPC and u will be looked at.No bow legs.Cannot be too short.Physical attributes la.Next they will ask you to write your name on a piece of paper.You are shortlisted for MP now.<br><br>Only Poly and Alvl students taken.Decent physical requirements aka not too fat.IPPT dun need pass i know people who went in IPPT fail but they will train u damn hard in School of Provost make sure u at least pass.<br>If you are not picked for command school you will be MP men if you were shortlisted.If you go command school there will be an additional interview once u finish.<br><br>To get your posting to different units<br><br>Depends on the need for manpower for your batch.Some batches come in to School of Provost are designated 6SIR batches meaning they will confirm all go 6SIR and only some will be sent to other companies.Thats if u suay.If u lucky and ur batch is an "open" batch meaning u can go mostly anywhere then u will be asked for a choice before u become an MP but its mostly up to S1 to send people where they need people.Mostly its based on your test scores during MP training if you showed good skills at writing and english you might be posted to SIB/SB.Normally your batch is either a 6SIR batch or a "open" batch.<br>The best trainee is usually given a choice of his posting.</div>
