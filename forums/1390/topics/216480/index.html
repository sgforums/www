            <div class='col-md body'>Hey,<br><br>could someone tell me a little about what its like to serve in the navy as an officer? What qualifications could you obtain? What is it like aboard a ship, what sort of training will you undergo etc.<br><br>In addition, if it is not against opsec, how many ships are there? The reason I ask is because if a person signs on as a naval officer, he will be naturally aspire towards oneday takeing command of a ship. However, as the saying goes, you can't have too many indian chiefs!<br><br>The floor is yours.<br><br>PS: Try to avoid giving answers like "sux0r" or "damn wayang" etc - Duh!

            <div class='col-md body'>i think during your OCS training, u will get to sail onboard 1 of the LST ships and sail for a few months prior to graduation. During this time, u will experience shipboard life, and also help navigate the ship(with one of the officers with u too).<br><br>Once posted to ship, usually you start as NO(Navigation officer). That name speaks for itself, of course. But keep in mind that is the bottom of the officers position onbard, and hence most likely kenna takan. Or you may also become a communications officer, whose job is to maintain contact with base, and make sure communications are flowing smoothly.<br><br>After that, it will be XO(Executive Officer) where basically u take shit from only the CO of the ship. In short, second biggest onboard. Before finally u go and become CO.<br><br>Keep in mind though, that chances are u won't be on board the same ship all ur career. You may be posted to different ships of the same platform, or to another ship of an different platform altogether. What that means is that you may be posted to a platform of ships that do minesweeping activities, but may be posted to another platform later, and that platform will do different operations.</div>
