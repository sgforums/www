            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by axle-ken:</div><div class="quote_body"></div></blockquote>I have elaborated on this topic before and I will cut and paste it here....<br><br>Hello<br><br>Let me try to help you out with this one. I am currently in service and will try to sketch out the career path, the conditions and the pay..of course without infringing on OSA. As I am not an engineering officer, I am not that qualified to speak about the tech branch and will not elaborate on it.<br><br>Basically, upon signing on, you will spend about 8 to 9 months in Midshipman Wing in SAFTI OCS. If you are a graduate, your take home pay should hover around 2000-2200. The Midshipman course is divided into 3 phases - Basic Naval Term, Midshipman Sea Training Deployment and the Advance Naval Term. In BNT, you will learn about the basic knowledge such as the Rules of the Road (the traffic code at sea), basic chart work and other navigational fundamentals which you must know for your work at sea. In MSTD, you will basically go on a cruise of between 3 to 4 weeks onboard an LST, visiting about 2 to 3 ports in the region. MSTD is generally regarded as the most fun but the toughest part of the training and most of the time you will feel tired Twisted Evil It will expose you to what the navy is all about. After MSTD, in ANT you will be given more advanced but still rudimentary training in navigation and warfare related subjects. You will also go for training deployments onboard the mine counter measure vessels and the patrol vessels.<br><br>Upon commissioning, you be posted to the ships where you will be known as an Attached Officer. You will spend 3 to 4 months learning about the ship and how to perform the duties of the Officer of the Day (OOD) - the equivalent of the army DSO. However, you will be required to know much more than them. You will learn about fire fighting, ceremonies and protocols, the SOPs for all the various shipboard activities. After that, you will be certified in a practical assessment and awarded your Certificate of Competency. Upon getting your COC, you will be posted to Naval Advanced School (NAS) for about 3 months where you will begin the training to earn your Bridge Watch Keeping Certificate (BWC) which will qualify you to keep watch onboard a ship out at sea and a Navigator Certificate which will qualify you to be a navigating officer onboard ships. This training will extend beyond the 3 months in NAS to another 3 to 4 months onboard ship. After which only you will become a Navigating Officer. Contrary to what most people think, Officers do not learn a lot of rope work or basic housekeeping stuff such as paint chipping or line throwing.<br><br>You will serve about 6 to 1 year as a navigating officer before you proceed back to NAS where you can choose a number of specialisation courses of about a month to 2 months. After graduation, you will become either a weapons officer, communication and electronics officer, mine hunting officer or an anti submarine warfare officer. I think all these terms are pretty self explanatory. You will spend about 1 to 2 years in these appointments before proceeding for a 4 months course back in NAS - The Naval Warfare Officer Course. This course will teach you naval warfighting tactics and doctrines, qualifying you to lead a team of specialists in the combat information centre of the ships to fight a battle at sea. You will return to ships to become and Ops Officer and then an Executive Officer (2nd in Command). This tour will probably be about 2 years. At this point, you should be around 29 to 30, assuming you graduate from school with a basic degree at around 23 to 24. Of course, it is also possible now to be awarded the SAF Post Graduate Award for you to pursue a masters somewhere.<br><br>Next, you will proceed to a staff tour in MINDEF/HQ RSN/ Formation HQ or go to Singapore Command and Staff College for an 8 months course called the Command and Staff Course (CSC), preparing you for a LTC appt. The staff tours will last between 2 to 3 years after which you will return to ship for a junior command, in command of the patrol vessels and the mine hunters. After that you will proceed to another senior staff appointment in the mentioned places for about 2 to 3 years before returning to hold a senior command onboard a missile corvettes, landing ship tanks or an Executive Officer or Operation Officers onboard the Frigates. The subsequent tours will be quite diverse already and I will not go further. By now, you could be between 35 to 38 perharps<br><br>As for living conditions and routines onboard ships, it varies actually. If you are onboard the patrol vessels and mine hunters, you should expect about 10 to 12 days out at sea per month on average with each sailing duration of between 2 to 3 days. If you are onboard the LST, you should expect fewer frequency of sailing but each of longer duration. The same applies for the frigates and the missile corvettes. For example, a deployment to the Arabian Gulf could last for 2 to 3 months while a deployment to an exercise say in Australia could last up to a month. If you are in harbour, your working day should start between 0730 and 0800 and end by 1700, often earlier as our philosophy is for our guys to spend as much time as possible with their families and loved ones when they are in harbour, considering the time they will spend out at sea nowadays. Living condition onboard? Again it varies. The food ranges from mediocre to great - depending on the mood of your chef. Living quarters could be cramped - 4 to 6 in one large cabin onboard the corvettes, 2 to a cabin onboard the rest of the ships with qaulity of the room varying with the most luxurious being on the Frigates and LST - the LST have ensuite showers and toilets for the officer cabins! Twisted Evil Life out at sea is pretty comfortable. Most of the time, you keep watch for about 4 hours and have a rest of between 8 to 12 hours where you pretty much free to do your own stuff - be it to read, eat, sleep or watch tons of DVD with your guys, with most the planning and preparatory work being performed prior to sailing. The scenery is often great. Of course ideally you should have a stronger than average stomach to cope with turbulent sea and have understanding partners and family who realise the nature of your work.<br><br>As for the pay, you can find that out pretty easily from the naval recruitment website. Just note that you will also have a ship board allowance of about 300 dollars. Also, the officers pay scheme is divided into Scheme A, B and C. Scheme B being the default for graduates. Scheme C being the most and requiring a interview and CO's recommendation to get it. Pay difference between scheme B and C could be as much as 800 SGD.<br><br>Ok I hopes this help...please forgive me for any subsequent inaccuracies discovered!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That means a farmer officer will be under scheme A?<br>A farmer officer (poly diploma) also requres a longer time than a degree holder to promote up the rank ladder...<br>This means that the pay is very very much lower for a diploma officer against his degree peers...<br>Btw how much does a newly promoted captain (degree holder) get for his pay?</div>
