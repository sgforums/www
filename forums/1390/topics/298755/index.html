            <div class='col-md body'>hi guys , i have been thinking about signing as a millitary police , but is it wise to sign on? my bro now in army said that actually sign on is not a bad thing , but he himself dont wanna sign on , but he said its quite good because once you sign on they give you a amount of money and after your 5 years contract they will pay you your 2 years nsf salary , that means you will get lots of money also. But then , i have been aspiring to go overseas to study for my degree in sports management. And wants to work as a sports manager. I am really in a dilemma , or should i go in army first then experience the army life first before i decide to sign on? because maybe i might not like army life. because if my bro says if i like army life can consider to sign on. Some of his camp mates have already told their upper rank people that they wanna sign on as a military police. And after their AITEC stage 2 next year in taiwan , they will be going for the interview already. So guys , can tell me the advantage and disadvantage of signing on? I am really in a dilemma. because i spent quite a lot of money on my studies , and i still wanna study and i hope i can do so while doing my bond for the sign on 5 yrs. if i sign on.</div>
