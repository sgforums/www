But then , i have been aspiring to go overseas to study for my degree in sports management. And wants to work as a sports manager. I am really in a dilemma , or should i go in army first then experience the army life first before i decide to sign on? because maybe i might not like army life. because if my bro says if i like army life can consider to sign on. Some of his camp mates have already told their upper rank people that they wanna sign on as a military police. And after their AITEC stage 2 next year in taiwan , they will be going for the interview already. So guys , can tell me the advantage and disadvantage of signing on?

            <div class='col-md body'>Eh, I thought you said you want to sign on with the police?<br><br>Whatever. You'll have to meet the criteria. Generally, the SAF won't accept all job applicants at all, contrary to as some think. With a Provost career, the emphasis won't be on technical skills (as, say, for engineering or logistics vocations) or even combat knowledge. Beyond the basic educational qualifications, I reckon your pre-enlistment MAPAS scores, the security check into your background, your interviews with them, perhaps even your BMT results (if they can't assess your personality profile) will all be factors before approval.<br><br>As for saving money to study overseas, it's a noble thought &amp; we're all young once. But take note that when you're signing on, it's a JOB as well as a CAREER move -- &amp; not a source for some sort of savings plan, per se. You'll be committing yourself 24/7, &amp; your subsequent life as well as the civilian world may not turn out as envisioned. Worse-case scenarios: your MP service becomes completely irrelevant in future job-matching (unless you work in the security line); you end up with a freshly minted degree but must compete for entry-level jobs with rivals 5 years younger (cuz they didn't serve the extended time); or you find yourself increasingly left behind in an ever-advancing KBE economy (unable to meet the specific skills stated in the job ads).<br><br>Don't end up disillusioned at the lack of prospects, simply cuz you've failed to keep your options open. Or, conclusively stick it out with the Police or SAFGU, whatever your chosen profession, once you've made up your mind. The wishy-washy mindset should end with the teenage years.</div>

But when you take off that uniform, how many people will respect you outside (for those who don't know your status in NS)?<br><br>Respect is earned. But going through OCS is a faster way of earning it in military terms..

You'll have to meet the criteria. Generally, the SAF won't accept all job applicants at all, contrary to as some think. With a Provost career, the emphasis won't be on technical skills (as, say, for engineering or logistics vocations) or even combat knowledge. Beyond the basic educational qualifications, I reckon your pre-enlistment MAPAS scores, the security check into your background, your interviews with them, perhaps even your BMT results (if they can't assess your personality profile) will all be factors before approval.<br><br>As for saving money to study overseas, it's a noble thought &amp; we're all young once. But take note that when you're signing on, it's a JOB as well as a CAREER move -- &amp; not a source for some sort of savings plan, per se. You'll be committing yourself 24/7, &amp; your subsequent life as well as the civilian world may not turn out as envisioned. Worse-case scenarios: your MP service becomes completely irrelevant in future job-matching (unless you work in the security line); you end up with a freshly minted degree but must compete for entry-level jobs with rivals 5 years younger (cuz they didn't serve the extended time); or you find yourself increasingly left behind in an ever-advancing KBE economy (unable to meet the specific skills stated in the job ads).<br><br>Don't end up disillusioned at the lack of prospects, simply cuz you've failed to keep your options open. Or, conclusively stick it out with the Police or SAFGU, whatever your chosen profession, once you've made up your mind. The wishy-washy mindset should end with the teenage years.</div></blockquote>hmm actually for both i can consider , but i think now i should really get enlist first then say bah. thanks for the feedback here , thanks a lot =)</div>
