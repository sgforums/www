              <p>that is really true. There is one driver that I indent during my NS years. He came in botak. After chatting with him, he just came out from DB like yesterday.

              <p>I say, "As a vehicle commander I order you to slow down and keep your speed not more than 60 km/h. Else you stop the vehicle and knock down 20 for me !!

              <p>Normally the drivers sent to me are still relatively obedient cos i know their specs well and any problem they (the spec as well as the driver :p) will get it from me or worse.
