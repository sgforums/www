              <p>Don't confuse people, that is another thing altogether. Azharjj is asking whether what the TS said about being given a form to choose up to 6 options during your checkup is true or not. The answer is a a straight no.</p>

              <p>Hey i am also a driver in SAF , but my education level is diploma , yes most of the drivers are either o lvl , n lvl , or school dropouts , which you say are those ah bengs etc. But i am sure they are much more hardworking and responsible than you. Wait have you even enlisted into the army? my camp have one more diploma holder and one A lvl holders , and we still mix around with the drivers in our camp , although they are not that high educated dosen't mean they are ah beng or whatsoever you said. if you think you are very highly educated and is very good. Think about what you said about drivers. Don't you think you are much more worst than them? If you don't know anything , please don't put up stupid thread like this and mislead those ppl who haven't got enlisted into the army. That shows how stupid you are. So don't say drivers are stupid , because you are also one stupid fool that dosen't know what you are talking about. Maybe i should call you a retard instead.</p>

              <p>As a logistician myself, i know what you mean but do note that in times of war, everyone has to work together and we can't do without each other. The combat units cannot do without the logistics side to provide their supply, transport as well as maintaince of their weapons, vehicles etc etc. However the logistics alone is useless in a war without the combat units.</p>
              <p>Everyone has a role to play and its important to play your role well to support the SAF and not start arguing about who requires who or the importance of any single vocation.</p>

              <p>the way you say is like saying majority of them are stupid.
              and  looked down on them. And for your more info , Drivers
              plays a big part in both combat and logistics side. If you don't
              believe me , during war time u will know.</p>

              <p>Relax. I did not say much, it is your imagination that add up the information. </p>
              <p>You remind me of some1, who spark up a series of thoughts with just a word trigger. Learn to differentiate current situation and accumulative past thoughts. When reading a text, try to pick a neutral point of view, and don't put in emotions and past memory into it. With a neutral stand, you should interpret information that is place in front of you and not over-interpret presented information.  </p>
              <p>It is a fact that most of the drivers I have met in MY CAMP IN MY PAST are Beng and cannot study one. And they acknowledge this fact. They admit themselves. </p>
              <p>Relax. You think too much. Over thinking is bad. </p>

              <p>that is really true. There is one driver that I indent during my
              NS years. He came in botak. After chatting with him, he just came
              out from DB like yesterday. He just came back, reporting to camp,
              and I am his first customer... But... when he started driving, I am
              like WOW no wonder you met and accident and go DB for 1
              week! </p>
              <p>I say, "As a vehicle commander I order you to slow down and keep
              your speed not more than 60 km/h. Else you stop the vehicle and
              knock down 20 for me !! " Then he like scold me bad words in
              Hokkien and slow down. This kind of cannot study school dropout,
              really stubborn, <strong>stupid</strong> and hard to control, no wonder even
              mono-intake also post him out... </p>

              <p>You know at the end, during 6 months before he ORD, he was not given any assignment at all. He just have to report to camp and sleep and book out.

              <p>Its ok. I do understand. Of all people here, i'm the one person who does not mince my words or hesitate to call a spade a spade or go into denial, politically correct mode. When I see stupid people, I won't delude myself that they're not. So I believe you that he is dumb. There are lots of dumb people in the world, just as there are smart people. Those who are in denial about this, dream that God made everyone with the same IQ. Then why didn't He make everyone with the same looks, fitness and height and weight? So everyone is as beautiful and all can be Ms Universe?? And if everyone is smart "in their own ways" some PC bullshit line, then do you think you are as smart as Einstein? A lot of people in this world are in denial. Dun worry i'm not one of them.</p>
