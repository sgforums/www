              <p>probably bcos the base rules of the mess are powerful enough and that there is a strong committee to oversee all aspects of mess operation and events. which means whatever rules set, they got power. anw, spill beer also db? that's lame. beer stock discrepancy, of cos will be logical to press charges.</p>
              <p>seriously, got any mess in the SAF is like 'bo cheng hu' like what octega claim?</p>

              <p>If u guess it, the mess is in reservist handling unit where the standing active unit men count is less than the enciks (trainers, about 3 ocifers/enciks to 1 men (3SG and below). Most of the trainers are from the early hokkien peng sign-on.</p>
              <p>Plus because the unit was not occupied by reservist not all the time, most of the senior officers/enciks from the nearby unit like to visit the mess rather than their own so the men got more sh*t compared to other mess.</p>
              <p>And yes, I have to admit, that was 10 years ago, dunno the condition now. Ok, other than the spill beer that was told by a senior, the rest I standby what I wrote. During that time, the chill mugs hold exactly one SAF approved tiger beer filled to the rim, although spill beer should be common, but most enciks just take advantage of this "charge you if you spill beer" story, threatening the messboy to pay for the beer if it got spill.</p>
              <p>I would just like to say, any good system is only as good as the people running it. You can have wonderful rules and regulations with tons of punishment,etc. But if the ppl running it always boh chup close-one eye, u still got the same sh*tty situation.</p>

              <p>Yah! it should be considered as work shift as more appropriate terms for the mess boy.</p>
              <p>For the NDU part the answer is that the diver cannot make mistake. It is not that there is a choice of the trainer or the trainee. Because it will really cause you your life if you fail to do so. The vocation risk is high. And believe that they are one who cannot make mistake, not even once. </p>
              <p>I dont think the diver undergo POW training. Only scout does. They undergo the so "team-building" week which is called "hell week". Which is actually nothing much in reality? Most people have diarrhea and have not eaten and dehydrated for days, dengue fever in a near death experience, insomnia have not slept for weeks, run a 42km marathon, or triathlon. So it is the mind that you cannot coped, but the body physically can coped.</p>

              <p>Haha, I dunno for the other camps and for those doing mess boy now, maybe it is more relac. For around a year, before moving to COS after I got promoted. The camp was in S. Gedong, old camp 1 (i think now no more), the camp was also famous for rat problem and mess contains the glass case containing the sand brought back from Isarel by the first batch of trainees. We also help the HQ cateen operator (Ah Goh) to sell food.</p>
