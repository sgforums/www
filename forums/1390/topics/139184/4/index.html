Given the amount of bomb disposers in the SAF, it's not too common though. Another question here, wat's the difference between the bomb disposal badge and the explosive ordinance disposal badge (the one worn with red backing)?? do they undergo the same training?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/safday/2005/images/apHolders_reservePC_sml.jpg"><br><br>Its the two other local badges worn by LTC Lee Heok Chye other than the airborne wing.</div>
