              <p>Possible charges they can throw at you. But chances are they won't, there's a lot of paperwork to go through. =) And penalty is probably MORE guard duty, but at your new unit. </p>
              <p>Have you tried asking a superior officer for help?</p>

              <p>What to do? Just go la, unless you can cough up the $$ to sell your duty.</p>
              <p>Penalty can be sign more extras, though worst scenario = charge and enter DB.</p>

              <p>Hi Botak249,</p>
              <p>Have you tried calling all the numbers given to you? If there is really no one willing to help you do your Guard Duty, do remember to bring your medicine and MC down with you to show the officers in charge. As previously mentioned by some of the other forummers, you will likely be given light Desk duties.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Can't believe the genius superior actually tried to force the sick to perform duty. Indeed shown one of the SAF 7 core value "CARE ï¼¦ï¼¯ï¼² SOLDIER"</p>
