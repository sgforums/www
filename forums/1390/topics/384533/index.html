              <p>Its always a guard personnel to find his own replacement should he not be able to do his duty. Certain units will plan reserve but not all will so its up to the individual guards to do it. Since its tekong guard duty which is not counted at all by unit, its not going to be easy to find replacement.</p>
              <p>If you die die cannot find replacement, you will have to report for guard duty and see whether they can give you some slight straining duty to do.</p>
              <p>Getting MC etc won't be useful since being on MC means you still need find someone to replace you or else you are the 1 who get in trouble.</p>

              <p>Physical injury can sometimes be given desk type job such as working in pass office rather than prowler/sentry depending on camp and their guardroom procedures so certain camps will still make personnels with TS's injury to still report for guard duty and do something within their means.</p>

              <p>Hi Botak249,</p>
              <p>Since you have got some of their numbers from the COS, you may wish to try to call them up first and see if any of them is kind enough to help you do your Guard Duty. </p>
              <p>If no one is willing to help you out, then you will have no choice but to call the COS again and see his decision. </p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Call them up and sell them your Duty. Weekend at least $70, I think. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Since your situation is not really that bad, odds are you will have to do the duty if no one help you out. If it was a high fever or something along that line, I believe it will not be too hard for them to call up another unlucky recruit to take over you.  </p>

              <p>U just call back the COS and tell him that you weren't able to find a replacement and ask him to kindly help you call them up. Be polite and humble and they will probably will treat you fairly. But thats 50/50 chance nia. But high chance they will ask you to come back and do the duty. But they will give you sentry duty la, I got people with status in my unit but they had to do sentry anyway. For MC-wise I am not too sure.</p>
