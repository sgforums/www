            <div class='col-md body'>true before you go in.. you will wonder,, whether are you bathing in the open where others and you are lookign at each other dick. when you go in during bmt, theres no door, cos,, i think due to rush of time. When you get to unit, theres door to protect your privacy, Iand of course there are some who take their own sweet time to pcc themselves inside<br><br>i hv seen those who are rushing for time. who use a water hose and bath outside the cublies, hes naked with soap outside,, with a pail of water. So this is very common.. Wait till the guys go to thailand, brunei or australia,, you will do bathing in a common area, where all of us are naked wat..with nothing on.. And if they dare to bath with underwear on. We will give them a hard look <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">     nothing to be shy off.. be proud of your asset. When t cold wind blow,, you will feel your bro is shrinking.<br><br>And when you back to civilian life after army, bathing in the open area is ok,, fine with me.. but hate it when some people will stare at our brother,,, and stroke themselves,, So i prefer enclosed areas..<br><br>These 16-17 yrs young teenager hv nothing to be shy off, you go in get a cultural shock, just make sure when you come out, be back to your normal self and don;t exhibit some of the things you learn in army  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
