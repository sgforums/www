            <div class='col-md body'>Opening of the Infantry Training Institute<br><br>Posted: 17 Aug 2007, 0930 hours (Time is GMT +8 hours)<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2007/aug/17aug07_nr.-imindefParsSub-0001-TextImage.imindefParsSubtextimage.gif"><br>Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen viewing the weapon accessories that are issued to NSmen during In Camp Training (ICT).<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2007/aug/17aug07_nr.-imindefParsSub-0002-TextImage.imindefParsSubtextimage.gif"><br>Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen viewing the In and Out Processing system at the Infantry Training Institute.<br><br>Minister for Manpower and 2nd Minister for Defence, Dr Ng Eng Hen, graced the opening of the new Infantry Training Institute (ITI) premises at Jurong Camp II on 17 August 2007. The opening of the new ITI facility is a significant milestone as it marks the establishment of all 11 Army Training Institutes. The 11 Training Institutes anchor the training system for National Servicemen (NSmen) and serve as repositories of knowledge for all the Army formations and their respective specialisations.<br><br>As MINDEF and the SAF commemorate 40 years of National Service(NS), the opening of the new ITI premises represents the Army's commitment to provide the best training for our NSmen. The training programmes at the ITI employ simulation technologies to improve training realism and effectiveness. They also take in feedback from NSmen to continuously improve the training systems and methodologies.<br><br>During the tour of the ITI, Dr Ng was briefed on the Automated In/Out Processing System, which improves the efficiency of training administration. He also viewed some of its facilities, including the NS Battalion Planning Room for the training of NS commanders.<br><br>Development of Infantry Training Institute (ITI)<br><br>National Service was introduced in 1967 to meet the critical need of defending Singapore. As more National Servicemen were released to the reserve pool, HQ Reservist Infantry (HQ RI) was established in 1971 to oversee the training system for NSmen. Subsequently, HQ RI was re-named the 1st Reserve Infantry Training Centre (1 RITC) and the 2nd Reserve Infantry Training Centre (2 RITC) was set up as the number of NSmen rose. On 15 Dec 79, 1 RITC and 2 RITC were re-designated 6 RITC and 9 RTIC under the command of 6th Division and 9th Division respectively.<br><br>As the Army grew, new training centres such as the Basic Combat Training Centre (BCTC), People's Defence Force Training Centre and Infantry Training Centre were established to meet the various training needs. On 01 Jul 04, as part of the Army's transformation, the three Centres were merged to form the Infantry Training Institute (ITI) with the aim of enhancing the training system and to optimise resources through centralisation.<br><br>Over the years, the enhancements made to our NS training system and facilities reflect the Army's commitment to provide the best training for NSmen. At the same time, the Army has continually sought ways to improve and strengthen the training of our NSmen.<br><br>The relocation of ITI from the old Tanjong Gul Camp to its new premises in Jurong Camp II provides better training facilities and easier access to main training areas such as BCTC, Pasir Laba Ttraining Area and Live Firing Areas.<br><br><strong>New Training Facilities in ITI</strong><br><br>NS Battalion Command Block<br><br>The NS Battalion Command Block, provides the infrastructure and space for key NS appointment holders to manage their Bn In Camp Training (ICT) in a more conducive environment. It can accommodate two battalions on ICT simultaneously conducting activities such as battalion headquarters (HQ) cell training, map planning exercises and discussions.<br><br>Battalion Planning Room.<br><br>The Battalion Planning Room provides a conducive environment for the training of NS Commanders and their battalions. It is also equipped with computers and planning systems.<br><br>Auditorium and Company Lecture Theatres.<br><br>The Auditorium and Company Lecture Theatres are equipped for lectures and seminars at the company and battalion levels.<br><br>Satellite Interactive Laboratory (SIL).<br><br>The Satellite Interactive Laboratory consists of 70 computer workstations. NSmen can undertake computer-based learning at a pace they are comfortable with. It also facilitates the conduct of wargaming and map planning exercises.<br><br>Gymnasium.<br><br>The gymnasium is comprehensively equipped for both general and specific training. This provides servicemen with a convenient facility to pursue their fitness regimes.<br><br>Business Centre.<br><br>The business centre provides facilities such as phone, fax and internet access so that where necessary, NSmen can deal with urgent work matters during their ICT.<br><br><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2007/aug/17aug07_nr.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2007/aug/17aug07_nr.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMO Somehow the pieces don't fit yet. The new ITI facility has to do with the merger between HQ Infantry &amp; 9th DIV (over &amp; above the latter's role as a operational command). At least, the former unit is nearby. So is the other one moving house from the other side of the island?<br><br>Or will everyone move to Lim Chu Kang once the urban warfare town is completed there?
