              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: From 
              April, the allowance for all servicemen in the Singapore Armed Forces, 
              Singapore Police Force and Singapore Civil Defence Force will be 
              increased by S$60 across all ranks.<br><br>The allowance was last reviewed in 2009, when it was increased by S$20. <br><br>With the latest change, a recruit will receive a monthly rank allowance of S$480, up from the current S$420.<br><br>In
               Parliament on Tuesday, MP Ong Teng Koon had called on the Ministry of 
              Defence to better recognise the contributions of NS men.<br><br>Mr Ong 
              said: "The SAF owes much of its success to the conscript of young men 
              from the age of 18, and regular reservist call-ups, throughout their 
              adult lives. <br><br>"However, our modern lifestyle has necessitated the
               need for our servicemen sacrifice a meaningful part of their adulthood 
              often find themselves two years late to the party, when they compete for
               universities or on the job market globally."<br><br>After factoring in 
              combat allowances, which can range from S$100 to S$300, a typical NSF 
              enlistee who is a rifleman (LCP) in an Infantry Battalion will receive 
              S$650 per month in allowances.<br><br>A typical NSF officer holding the rank of second lieutenant (2LT) will receive S$1, 150 per month.<br><br>Minister
               of State Lawrence Wong said the raise "goes one step further in 
              signalling our acknowledgment of our servicemen's commitment and 
              service", noting that the government has other recognition schemes in 
              place.<br><br>They include the National Service Recognition Award (NSRA) to recognise national servicemen through their training cycle.<br><br>The ministry is also looking at further ways to extend professional development opportunities to regular servicemen.<br><br>For
               example, the Singapore Armed Forces has joined hands with Nanyang 
              Polytechnic to introduce a Certificate in Business Management programme 
              for Warrant Officers, Specialists and Military Experts.<br><br>This is a
               bridging programme that provides these officers with a foundation in 
              the study of business management and equip them with skills such as 
              communications, computing, basic accounting and marketing. <br><br>Upon 
              successful completion of the certificate programme, servicemen would 
              qualify for direct entry into the Diploma in Business Management.<br><br>In Parliament, several members of the House including Non-Constituency MP Lina Chiam, asked for a review of the duration of NS.<br><br>"My
               main reason for advocating the shortening of NS is that since the 
              government has welcomed such a large number of foreigners into our 
              workforce in the past decade, Singaporean males urgently need to close 
              the gap as to when they start their working life," said Mrs Chiam.<br><br>In 2004, the duration of conscription was cut, from two and a half years to two years.<br><br>In
               2006, the duration of Operationally Ready NS - where NSmen were 
              required to serve reservist training - was shortened from 13 years to 10
               years.<br><br>These changes, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen, were 
              made in view of the transformation to a 3rd Generation armed forces, and
               the increasing adoption of technology.<br><br>The reduction in NS duration also corresponded with the surge in NS intake from 2006 to 2015.<br><br>But Dr Ng noted that from 2016, the cohort size will fall.<br><br>Hence, the duration of training will remain at the current periods till further review.<br><br>"Our NSmen are not the second line of defence," said Dr Ng.<br><br>"They
               don't go behind somebody. When there's a need, they are the first 
              responders to protect Singapore when our survival is threatened. So in 
              that eventuality, we have to have sufficient numbers, we need to train 
              them, we need adequate time to train and prepare them for their role 
              effectively."</span></span></p>

              <p>actually quite fair lah. not say the diploma will get them payrise or anything.</p>
              <p>Most people nowadays sign on with diploma alr, so having additional diploma is just for self-improvement only.</p>
              <p>And as for O level holders, very few now. As Wosec have to work for a couple of year, to attain the minimum equivalent of SSG, before they can go for course. by then, their pay is also beyond the diploma payscale alr.</p>
