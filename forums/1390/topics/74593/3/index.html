I cannot imagine how glad I am, to be able to go home and have a proper night's sleep!<br><br>8 days outfield, 2 exercises, and 1 wet jungle hat presentation ceremony! I can't believe I went through all that!<br><br>Network is the craziest mission I think. On the first day, we did something crazy, like walking along the track to draw enemy fire... too bad there wasn't any to report. Then the very first night, at the BSP, I saw a Guards battalion going past us with their LSV (can't believe they didn't spot me, I was just inside the vegetation by the side of the road), then when we shifted again, we ended up sleeping on a 84mm live firing impact knoll (imagine all the blinds we could have set off...). For the final link up to Elephant hill, we wanted to take a short-cut, but ended up walking even more because we were blocked by a water body... Then we climbed Elephant hill TWO times! It was Cat 1 when we climbed up the first time, and we went down to shelter. Then it lifted, and we had to climb up again, wet and smelly (think any civilian attending the parade will faint from the biological fallout). But the finale was cool... CO put my jungle hat on for me, then OC was standing there looking very pleased in his red beret. Then we met our S2 for the first time, whom described himself as a "bastard who doesn't seem like a bastard". After which, he proceeded to jam all the sleep deprived souls with technical questions...<br><br>S2: "You over there. I bet with you one month's salary that the 940A dipole has a battery inside it!"<br><br>Victim: "Uh... there isn't any battery inside the dipole what."<br><br>S2: "ARE YOU SURE?!?! Let me tell you I can bet there is a battery inside. I can even take it out to show you! Come, let's bet one month's salary. Want or not?"<br><br>Victim: (Jammed)<br><br>S2: (to another victim) "YOU! Why are you looking at me like that? Ok, how much do I owe you?"<br><br>Victim 2: (Jammed)<br><br>S2: "I know, I know, just tell me how much I owe you"<br><br>Victim 2: "You don't owe me any money sir"<br><br>S2: "SURE or NOT?? (Takes out wallet) It's ok, you can just say"<br><br>S2: (to the commanders; winks at them) "Have you told them of the 72 km route march yet?"<br><br>Question to all: Are all S2s like that?????????????????????????????????????</div></blockquote>Congratulations trooper.

When you look back after your NS years, I am sure it will be a wonderful memory.<br><br>When you go back to unit, make sure your team review all SOPs.
