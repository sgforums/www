The day will come when you can hold your head high and let people know you went, you saw and you overcame all the SHIT being dished at you. It's all in the mind, you can do it. Believe in your mental strength as that is what going to keep you going when you are at your rock bottom.<br><br>Try to tighten your boots before fast march. To reduce the occurance of blisters, you need to reduce heat and friction build up between your skin and the socks. Put in loads of foot powder in the socks. You can consider wearing a pair of thin socks, before putting on the green army socks. During fast march, make sure that each step you take, you lift your foot up, don't ever shuffle along as this is more likely to induce blisters.<br><br>Keep that chin up, trooper. You can make it, we know you will.</div>

Try to buy a pair of spandex tights (cycling tights) and wear them before putting on your no. 4 pants. This would prevent chafing on your thighs when your pants get soaked with sweat. Dun forget to powder your crotch beforehand though... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I was also a scout signaller last time, so here's some suggestions. Make sure that your signal set and frame are strapped on tight. This would prevent it from rattling against your back when you do your fast march. If you are carrying spare antennas, tie the lower bottom of antenna case to the signal set ruck, and see if you can switch over to whip antenna, while keeping the collapsible one in the case. If its possible to use the whip antenna, try to tie down the antenna to your SBO by bending it down. Put a couple of smal rubber bands on the right side of your harness (or left, depending on your preference). I know we are not supposed to do it, since the antenna might snap, but just be careful and not flex it too much....But the whip antenna thing depends on your PC or team leader.<br><br>If you are putting the signal set in your full pack, try to position the radio comfortably so that it doesn't rattle. My trick was to position the spare batteries in such a way that it pushes the signal set against the back of the fullpack, and used my jacket to fill up the space and as a cushion.<br><br>Try to adjust your SBO and full pack so that they ride high on your shoulders and not around your hips, cos' it'll really hurt after awhile.<br><br>Last thing...hang in there bro!! You can do it! And welcome to our fraternity... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

He is really good. Some of the 1 Guards recoursee are with us, and he never fails to make them laugh too. PC is very ambitious, but he hardly mixes around with us, even though he gives us prep talk.. He wants us to grab all the awards available.<br><br>The nice thing is that the bikers from the driving course also came along with their platoons. Armour and Brigade. Nice to know friends in so many places...<br><br>Here is something strange that happened to me. On Thursday, we went for a 6 km fast march. I was the rear scout with my usual signal load. Strangely speaking, I had no problems walking while the others were struggling (no signal load!) to even catch up. I am not a very strong walker. Does this have to do with walking at the back (slip stream or something?)<br><br>On Friday, just when we added combat rations to my already crazy load (I now know what it means to "stuff a kitchen sink into a field pack...") I started to get nightmares from the load. Why the difference? We only added a day's worth of combat rations, and I start to struggle with my signal set. What can I do to reduce the stress on my back? I've tried to tighten my SBO such that some of the weight rests on my hips, but it does not really seem to be working...<br><br>But I must say, this first week is rewarding... The leopard crawls, worm crawls in FBO have really given me a new respect for the human mind. Nobody wanted to drop out at all, even though the load was breaking them. It is really a sight.<br><br>I think Power PT is a reduced version from what the previous batches would have done, cos nobody actually collapsed from doing the sets. Some people tried to be funny with the instructors and memorised all sorts of things, like the number of spotlights in the background, etc.. Shack, but shiok.<br><br>I think I might be addicted to physical training after all.</div></blockquote>Good for you! You are coping well with the stresses of scout training. Yeah, signallers carry the heaviest load around...what to do? You are the commo lifeline of the team.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>There's little more you can do to reduce the stress on your shoulders, unfortunately...the best thing to do is to make sure you distribute your load...i.e. spread the things around in your full pack or ALICE pack in such a way that both shoulders would carry about the equal burden. Another way you could ease the burden is to buy some thick foam padding and tape them on your ruck's shoulder straps.<br><br>As for the combat rations, pass some to your SAW gunner/basher, and put the rest in your ruck. If possible, you could even put one or two in your thigh pockets. It really depends on your preference. If you want a warm meal of say, glutinous rice, then sandwich one of the ration packet in-between the radio and the backboard of your fullpack, or even better, your ALICE pack....after you work up a sweat, the heat from your body, plus the signal set would transfer to your ruck, and accordingly, to your combat ration...quite nice!!</div>

There was one exercise that we were playing opfor scouts against a reservist infantry unit, and one of their company's section spotted us, and the whole bladdy platoon gave chase....wah lau, we had to break contact and continue mission, running like mad dogs.<br><br>Finally, we decided to disperse and spread ourselves (cover and concealment) since it was quite dark anyway.

For the final link up to Elephant hill, we wanted to take a short-cut, but ended up walking even more because we were blocked by a water body... Then we climbed Elephant hill TWO times! It was Cat 1 when we climbed up the first time, and we went down to shelter. Then it lifted, and we had to climb up again, wet and smelly (think any civilian attending the parade will faint from the biological fallout). But the finale was cool... CO put my jungle hat on for me, then OC was standing there looking very pleased in his red beret. Then we met our S2 for the first time, whom described himself as a "bastard who doesn't seem like a bastard".
