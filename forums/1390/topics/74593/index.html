Shiok period..its a STAY OUT course.<br><br>Infantry Scout Platoon Course (ISPC) - this course is conducted at School of Military Intelligence (SMI) which teaches you the basics of being a scout/recce trooper. It is after this course that you get the coveted jungle hat. Also, you will attend this course together with your commanders (Sect Comd, PS, PC) which means they will do what you do too..<br><br>Combat Survival Training (CST) - This is the course which killed the 2SG...but i think the POW part of the CST had been taken out.. so no worries. for now, the CST is conducted seperate from the ISPC, but i heard they going to integrate it into the ISPC course, but i not sure also.<br><br>Some medic course - i forgot the name, but this is a short course which teaches you how to inject yourself as well as inject your buddy. basically poke each other with needles  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Artillery course - forgot the name too, this short course teaches you how to direct artillery fire.<br><br>thats about it. a lot of course, so very siong. esp ISPC. but the job can be fun. by the way, where you posted to?  4 SIR? 6 SIR?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It didn't say anything but it's Lim Chu Kang Camp 1 (think that's 4SIR).<br><br>I don't mind tough training, it just has to be justifiable (I am the kind who desperately wants to know the meaning of everything before I jump in). Anyway, how long is the total course? Is my status going to be like when I am in BMT (a.k.a. trainee)?<br><br>So it means that when I am learning the vehicles, I get to go home after the lessons everyday?

There won't be much harassment there. Once you are in SMI, prepared for PT exercise which involves power PT, animal PT, fast march, your bread and butter recce (all sorts of it).

I had my last stage of training in Thailand where there was a reservist armour battalion ready to pounce on us.
