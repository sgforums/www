            <div class='col-md body'>for the benefit of those who are enlisting soon i have pasted the following from the FAQ:<br><br>[/quote]<br>ok. now another new set: useful things to bring when u enlist.<br><br>1. ziploc bags of various sizes*<br>2. plastic bags*<br>3. extra handfone batteries*<br>4. sano-plast (dunno how to spell; basically some cream or oil for muscle aches!)<br>5. small torch (for use after lights off)*<br>6. some washing powder (for clothes washing)<br>7. clothes hanger (no need alot since they will probably want to standardise eventually)*<br>8. pegs (as many as possible)*<br>9. lock - usually not number locks as they will require you to pass one set of keys to your buddy<br>10. slippers*<br>11. tupperware for food like biscuits, etc.<br>12. black tape*<br>13. scissors/ cutter<br>14. pencil/pen*<br>15. clear tape<br>16. perm marker - for writing ur name / 4D number on items<br>17. snake powder - that is what they would recommend usually; you will get saf powder too.<br>18. extra batteries for your receiver, torch, etc<br>19. cloth for cleaning<br>20. nail cutter*<br>21. rubber bands (normal and those black thick ones)<br>22. masking tape<br>23. coins (for vending machine, payfones)*<br>24. orange cloth (you will need to get eventually, but you can get it inside too)<br>25. underwear (more! disposables are usually not recommended)*<br>26. own clothes for sleeping if u need<br>27. black string (for various purposes like securing items, tying your ID tag)*<br>28. small mirror (you can get inside too; for applying camo)<br><br>alot of essential outfield items you will pick up and learn after going outfield a few times. for me, my SBO always have these items<br><br>1. black rubber bands, big and small*<br>2. black tape*<br>3. spare batteries for torchlight*<br>4. ziploc<br>5. pen/pencil<br>6. writing material - the small black book - put inside ziploc*<br>7. small mirror with camo*<br>8. 2 x insect repellent tubes*<br>9. spare black string<br>10. jackknife*<br>11. more than one torchlight<br>12. half gloves<br>13. mess mug* in plastic bag<br>14. ear plug and whistle inside whistle pouch*<br>15. a roll of the cord (... forgot wat its called. anyone?)*<br>16. compass<br>17. dummy grenade and magazine  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>of course during bmt you wont have to have and you are likely not allowed to have certain things u want to get yourself (e.g. own torchlight, compass). this just serves as a guide.<br><br>and a standard rule of thumb: always secure all your items! i secure things like the torchlight and even jackknife to my sbo.<br><br>in both lists the * items are more important.<br><br>[/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ditto<br><br>[/quote]<br>now, some tips on the fullpack  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>1. for me i always keep a set of no. 4 in the fullpack in ziploc. even now i ord liao, tt pack is still in my fullpack. oh dun forget to include a pair of socks and some underwear together too.<br><br>2. i have at least 2 sets of mess tins: one for outfield use and one for inspection. same applies to mess mug.<br><br>3. extra items to keep inside that will come in handy: extra ziplocs (for keeping dirty clothes),<br><br>4. there will always be one pack with these items in my fullpack too: (kiwi brush, boot lace, lighter, candles, extra gutters). these are standard fullpack items but they may be in different packs.<br><br>5. try to get those thick, translucent white trash bag (NOT those black thin ones). put this inside the fullpack before dumping your items inside (of course all the items will be in packs in ziplocs). this is to waterproof all your stuff. if you are richer you can go and get those bags that serve the same purpose (forgot wat its called)<br><br>6. get the really small soapbox and toothpaste and toothbrush for the pack that requires them. get a full roll of toilet paper and remove its core too.<br><br>7. if u r required to put in ur PT shoes, well, last time i had 2 sets - one in the fullpack and one for use, so no need in the morning of moving out den rush to squeeze the shoes in. but of course, tt is abit luxurious, so no need to follow. anyway i used the black rubberbands to tie the shoes together, squeeze them into a big ziploc b4 putting them in.<br><br>8. eventually i could squeeze all the standard fullpack items into the fullpack without using the side pockets at all, and still have some space in the main compartment. this will be useful when u receive like 3 days of ration which u have to carry together. and eventually, my fullpack was always ready, such that, even if there are outfield ex the next day, i dun have to worry about missing items inside. can jus take and go! of course that comes with experience and own preferences.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>[/quote]</div>
