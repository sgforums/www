After all, your current situation, will at most allow you to sign on as a Tech Specialist. I'm not sure about computer engineering in the SAF as a career per se.<br><br>Best you call up the recruitment center and have a talk with them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I'm wondering - why do you feel that the private sector's not that worthwhile? I would have thought that there would be a greater range of opportunities for you there than in the military. After all, while there's only one SAF, there are many private companies out there who'll hire someone with your qualifications.<br><br>The bottom line is pretty simple, really: join the military only because you like the environment there and not because of the money. I agree that the SAF pays well, but I've seen many a regular regretting that they signed on after they got disillusioned with the thought of being a soldier all their life.<br><br>Not that I'm saying the SAF is totally bad, and neither am I saying that every person who signs on will regret it. It's just that you need to carefully examine your reasons for signing on before actually doing so.<br><br>Care to give more details on all this?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'll second Gordon's suggestion that you go through BMT first before making a final decision. As much as we try to advise you on what options you have, no words will ever do justice to personal experience. And let's face it, right now you don't know enough about the SAF to make an informed decision.<br><br>Suffice to say that the SAF is something you have to experience in order to know.<br><br>I've seen people who hated the army prior to enlistment, only to end up signing on after their BMT. Likewise, I've seen people who signed on, only to end up disillusioned and regretting their decision.<br><br>Like I said earlier, there are many private companies, but there's only one SAF. Working in the SAF may end up to be a highly positive experience for you, but it may also not be. The same goes for private companies.<br><br>However, you can always find another company if you don't like the environment at a certain company. On the other hand, if you don't like the SAF, there's nothing you can do about it but endure until your bond expires.<br><br>So I suggest getting a feel of the SAF first before making a decision.</div>
