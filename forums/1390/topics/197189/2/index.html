But honestly, right now i could not even think of any other job except for being a regular in the armed forces as a possibility for my future career.<br><br>I don't really have the desire to join the private sector, i don't really see anything worthwhile in that line of work.<br><br>Right now i am a computer engineering polytechnic graduate and i have a PES grading of C1 L3. I may plan to further my studies to get a degree so that i could at least build my mental capabilities and prove to be competent in a higher academic area.<br><br>So the thing is, what kind of vocation i am suitable for with my PES grading ? Would the armed forces still allow people (if they still wish) to continue working till the maximum age of 55, as officially said in the army website ? I would like to know better how do the other regulars feel about being in the army on a full time basis.<br><br>I would like these questions to be answered because after thinking about my last topic about being a sniper is really stupid and far-fetched, and it didn't clarify my doubts at all. Thanks for helping me out.</div></blockquote>no Army Regulars with such a low PES grading have a good future in the organisation, but that is just wat i say. u can check out wat vocation u want to sign on with CMPB.<br><br>maximum age of 55 for Specialist, 45 for Officers. for Specialists (considering your PES), there are 2 contracts until the age of 55. Premium Plan 1 is only for 10 years. whether u get Premium Plan 2 is largely based on your competency in your vocation, and whether u please your superiors or not. the second contract IS NOT CONFIRMED. so u may waste 10 years of your life for a small sum of money.<br><br>oh, btw, u may want to reconsider signing on so early. consider that after your BMT, command school (highly unlikely because u r PES C), and vocational training.<br><br>lastly, get a PES upgrade if u r serious. PES C is like u cough they scared u die. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

As much as we try to advise you on what options you have, no words will ever do justice to personal experience. And let's face it, right now you don't know enough about the SAF to make an informed decision.<br><br>Suffice to say that the SAF is something you have to experience in order to know.<br><br>I've seen people who hated the army prior to enlistment, only to end up signing on after their BMT. Likewise, I've seen people who signed on, only to end up disillusioned and regretting their decision.<br><br>Like I said earlier, there are many private companies, but there's only one SAF. Working in the SAF may end up to be a highly positive experience for you, but it may also not be. The same goes for private companies.<br><br>However, you can always find another company if you don't like the environment at a certain company. On the other hand, if you don't like the SAF, there's nothing you can do about it but endure until your bond expires.<br><br>So I suggest getting a feel of the SAF first before making a decision.</blockquote>Ok.<br><br><blockquote>agreed.<br><br>since PES C, DXO is more suitable. can work till 62.<br><br>Uniformed officer work till only 45 years old nia.<br><br>For Specialist, a 10 year contract subject to renewal.</blockquote>I've heard of DXOs, they are involved with improving the various aspects of the army ?<br><br><blockquote>which vocation r u interested in? now saf mostly accept pes A or B.. if u r pes C, i will tell u DUN BOTHER! the saf is now trying cut down on those pes C n below.. i noe of 2 enciks who were forced to early retirement bcos of their pes status, n they have been in the army for more den 20 yrs.. saf is a very heartless organisation.. n oso, ur ippt results r very impt too.. if u r pes C n ur ippt is not tat ideal, most prob u will find ur name in the lower echelon during ranking.. pls take note tat no matter how good is ur performance, once u fail ur ippt, u r out of the game..</blockquote>I'll bear your advice in mind.<br><br><blockquote>SAF doesn't give any more pension after retirement.<br>Would there be enough salary to do everything you've wanted to do that your life desires?<br><br>Don't forget,we only live once.<br>It's either you want to have a chance to experience a lifestyle of joining SICC,owning porsches,lamborghinis,living in a bungalow with swimming pool,<br>travelling around the world or having a routine 9-5 job subjected to draconian military laws and constant abuse of vulgarities from higher ups<br><br>Is that even enough for...children's education? travels? housing? electricity bills? supporting parents ? purchasing a car ? savings for retirement ?<br><br>Assuming a $5,000 pay.<br><br>Deducating 20% CPF,you'll be left with $4,000 in terms of salary. $800 to parents.$3,200 would be left.

And they won't take in PES C cadets.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

But honestly, right now i could not even think of any other job except for being a regular in the armed forces as a possibility for my future career.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">I don't really have the desire to join the private sector, i don't really see anything worthwhile in that line of work.</span><br><br>Right now i am a computer engineering polytechnic graduate and i have a PES grading of C1 L3. I may plan to further my studies to get a degree so that i could at least build my mental capabilities and prove to be competent in a higher academic area.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">So the thing is, what kind of vocation i am suitable for with my PES grading ? Would the armed forces still allow people (if they still wish) to continue working till the maximum age of 55, as officially said in the army website ? I would like to know better how do the other regulars feel about being in the army on a full time basis.</span><br><br>.... </div></blockquote>I have a suggestion. How about joining DSTA or Temasek-linked companies with strong emphasis in defense business?<br><br>I am working in one of these organizations, and I have a strong interest in military systems. On a day-to-day basis, I interact closely with my users in SAF on issues like concepts of operations, cutting-edge technologies, training and doctrine issues, etc. with the intention to solve my users' short-term &amp; long-term problems. Some of the perks include hanging out with my users in the officers &amp; specialist mess, going out-field (local &amp; overseas) with them, etc. Quite fun...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>May I suggest that you craft out a career plan for yourself, including your 5 year career objective, i.e. where do you see yourself in 5 years from now? What are your strengths &amp; weaknesses.. If you are in the service, what would be your interest? Take charge of your life, and not try to fit yourself into an organization that you want to be in.<br><br>In my opinion, if you are not clear on your career, then it would be a very damaging thing. You would be spending more than half of your conscious day at work, and if it's miserable... then ... dunno, man.. very tough to go thru life.<br><br>This is just my 2-cents worth, coming from a person who had spent 10-over years working, .. while loving my job everyday.. not exactly the people, but the job.<br><br>Good luck..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
