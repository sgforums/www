            <div class='col-md body'>Aiya,I just did they told me too.<br><br>During PTP phase,before every meal must do assisted chin ups.At least 3 sets of 10,can sometimes go to the infamous 5x15...Then 2 times a week,got weight/circuit training.At night when we had nothing on,PC siao siao can tell those zero fighters to come down and do more pulling again,sighzzz<br><br>after i came out of army then i started weight training and i realised that the PTP type training of doing chinups everyday is excessive.In fact bodybuilding principles say that as a beginner,you should not train each bodypart more than 3x a week to allow for recovery.In this light,my PTP training is gross overtraining!

            <div class='col-md body'>I am also from PTP enhanced, in fact just POPed last March.<br><br>I must say, BMT really toughens you up, even though the training is still less tough than unit life, as what I am going through now.<br><br>When I enlisted on 10 December 2003, I was a zero fighter. My PS, totally unperturped by it, made us do pull ups everyday, to the tune of 2 X 12 before every meal. For someone who couldn't do a single decent pull-up, the first three weeks were hell for me. Even with someone assisting me, I was unable to pull properly. I suffered terribly during circuit training (push-ups, the holding in "down" position especially). The situation got so bad I was using 1 tube of muscle rub a day!<br><br>Then on the Monday morning of the forth week, a miracle happened. I struggled past my first pull-up. In fact, I was so happy I treated my close buddies to some iced lemon tea, courtesy of the vending machine at the company line.<br><br>Then my weight started dropping drastically. From 76 kg, it fell until 71 kg by the end of BMT. With that, I was able to progressively pull more and more pullups. If you do a search on the archives here, I did once complain about the RT regime my company did. It was essentially a tekan session, but what it did was it enabled me to shoot from 3 pullups to 5.<br><br>The bottomline? If you go with all the training faithfully (do not report sick for all the minor problems, etc), you will find yourself improving immensely. For me, I am now pulling 7 pullups (the bike course is really sinful for my stomach!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ) In fact, when you get used to it, you will be looking at other things, such as a 6km endurance run, etc... It helps if you get caring instructors who understand the need for your muscles to recover... I was lucky in a way too...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I struggled for 6 when I first enlisted into BMT. I might not have been a zero fighter but I noe how it felt somewhat. In the beginning I was never able to do a single one handed pull up with hand tucked behind the back.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Well it felt great to break the big-O.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I trained first with SBO including rifle, then with FBO till I hit 12 with full gear on. Thereafter I trained with a platoon mate hanging on me like a leech.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>In the final IPPT nearing the end of the course I did 24. But that's nothing. I heard APS recorded 60+ pulls during his hey days.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Btw I'm an old fart Cat Y1 now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
