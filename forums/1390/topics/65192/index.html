            <div class='col-md body'>When you graduate from poly or JC, you already must be mentally prepared to be called up for service since most guys defer when in Sec 4/5(still remember?).<br><br>Anyway, don't need to worry so much about physical training the army will take care of it.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, my sympathies.It sucks, I know.I've been there man..can you imagine being told to enlist barely ten days after my last 'A' level paper?It wasn't bad enough with the all the mental stress I had to endure while having my exams and I only get that short amount of time to recharge, let alone have fun before I was shipped across the sea like some meek animal in a freighter..<br><br>Anyway, those were bygone days, I managed to survive it and it turned out to be quite okay..Sometimes in life you have to ride along with the flow and fighting it will be much more painful.I can't say when you have to ride along and when you have to resist , you'll know when the time comes.<br><br>BMT, enjoy your stay there coz unit life may be more stressful and siong, or it could be other way around.Prepare for the worst but hope for the best. Always look on the bright side of life and smile at the little miracles that God has made around you.<br><br>Good Luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>whoa sorry to hear that bro but to be honest, its better to enlist in jan. if u're april batch, when its time to go for Uni, u gotta defer, and then when u grad from uni u have to come back n serve your balance out. that is even suckier. Its better to finish it off in one shot and then go study without any balance. i have a friend who defered to go study, and he was offered a job in the states, US$15k a month. after some time, he had to quit his US$15k a month job to come back n serve out his balance. so he quit a US$15k a month job to come back and take $500 a month. can u imagine how he felt? so this is actually a blessing in disguise.<br><br>I also enlisted barely 3 weeks after my last A levels paper, but i dun actually see it as a bad thing. now i am glad that i have some time to recharge my batteries b4 going to uni, in fact because of the time i have inbetween ORD n entering uni, im planning to take 2 months to tour europe, something im sure my parents wouldn't have allowed me to do so back when i haven't entered NS yet. and im glad i will not have to come back and serve out any balance. Once im through im through with SAF.<br><br>Anyway, enjoy your BMT. unit life is worse.</div>
