That means i am a non-operationally fit serviceman who could only perform duties at bases only.<br><br>And i've been asking around about what type of vocations i would be most likely assigned to and i have grown to despise the single word: clerk.<br><br>Maybe i am being a little stupid , but i believe that i could be capable of doing something more. Something that would be worthwhile doing and decently challenging. I'd really like to learn how to handle a rifle and learn the basics of infantry movement but i don't think i'll go through such lessons during the course of my national service. Maybe i am feeling this way since i just don't think that office based jobs or desk bound jobs aren't what i like.<br><br>I talked to my friend who has signed up as a naval officer, he told me that the chances of me retaking my BMT under a different PES status would be very slim as alot of paper work is involved. He even told me to go through another medical examination to get it upgraded but there's too little time for that.<br><br>But i have no choice but to go through my modified BMT and give it my best effort, even though i would feel a little bad because i wouldn't be combat trained as a national serviceman.<br><br>So, as i promised i'll try to log onto the SAF forums and update all of you of my experiences and the experiences of other NS men while in my time in camp.<br><br>Sorry, i just need to voice it out, because i really feel this way.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yep, PES C1L3 also must do weapon handling, etc, etc. So dude, cheer up, you still got to do wat the PES A/B are doing, it is just on a less demanding scale and the eventual non-combat vocational posting: which can be tech or service lines (not nesscary must die die be clerk mah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br>However, I must also say one thing: Comment only u have been through and tasted it. I have a fair bit of friends commenting wanting to be commandos, guards, officers, sign-on, etc, etc. 1 mth into BMT, they are already swearing how sucky the army is. Somehow the local version of the armed forces has burst their ideas/dreams of what their army life should be.<br><br>So go in, get a taste of what SAF is and in the near future you may be thinking "Getting PES C is not bad after all"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> (I could be wrong, BTW  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I advice u not to be too sad or feel despair. The MO give u PES C means that there is really some health issues that may bring harm to u if u choose to do those shiong thing in PESA/B. Why not go in the army experience the culture, training, etc........... first then make the comment. I noe of many frens who initially get PES C and they feel veri sad but after going thru BMT they felt lucky they did not get PES A/B. Dun be overwhelm by ur frens bravado comments abt PES A and chiong sua stuff. Go in and experience first..............<br><br>BTW: Medic like also accept PES C ppls</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>threadstarter, cheer up. it's how u value yrself, vocation and appointment.<br><br>think of it this way, i'm doing misc. admin for my whole branch. and i'm only the person doing it. if i don't do, the whole office can't function properly. not boasting off here, but sometimes when i'm on leave or off, office will call me and ask for info.<br><br>everyone has a part to play. we are working on the ground, the frontline. w/o us, our bosses can't promote.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I've got nothing much to say, for I believe that every one else has pretty much said what I wanted to say.<br><br>But just let me add on a little something: PES C or not, when you're in the SAF, every single person has a part to play. You may end up as a clerk who helps to plan duty rosters for the officers and the specs. You may end up as a service medic who helps save lives in a 24-hour medical center.<br><br>In any case, since you're not yet in the army, you're not really in a position to gauge how good or bad your experience is going to be. I've seen far too many people who aim of being rangers, snipers, commandos, etc only to get disillusioned during their BMT and hoping that they became clerks. Heck, I know of cases of fighting fit men who smash their little fingers with a hammer in the hope that they can get downgraded.<br><br>In the end, the grass is always greener on the other side. We have clerks who wish they can be chiong sua warriors, and we have chiong sua warriors who wish they can be clerks. No one ever gets completely satisfied.<br><br>So why think so negatively? Ever heard of the Pygmalion Effect? Your experience will be negative only if you want it to be. The best thing is to go into NS with an open mind. Since you're gonna be stuck in there for the next two years, you might as well make the most of it.</div>
