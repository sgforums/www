Then they ask me to go answer charge for AWOL from IPPT some time last year. Luckily the LTA let me go without punishment. However, when i tried to book a date for IPPT online, a few days later a clerk from ATC called up and told me that i need not take IPPT as i was a full time student!!!<br><br>Now they want to charge me again because i didn't take during my lastest IPPT window. This window happens to be when i am still in school for at least 8 mths out of the 12 mths. I only started working recently after i graduate in june this year. So do i have a case to defend myself guys?<br><br>This is so frustrating because i need to take no pay leave to go for this charge.</div>

I went for NSmen briefing shortly after I ORD'ed last year, and we were told that its a must to take IPPT. If you study in SMU, NUS, NTU, or any of the 5 polys after you ORD, you need not take RT even if u fail IPPT due to the Higher Learning scheme, for the duration of your course in these institutes. For those like me who study in private schools like MDIS, SIM etc, you must take RT if you fail IPPT.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ignorance is no defence.<br><br>But since you are going to be charged, you might as well ask them to show you all the documents, including those that say full-time students are not exempted, so you are satisfied when you pay your fine.<br><br>I also had a case that I could not book my IPPT through www.ns.sg. I called and was told to book in the next window. I insisted to take my IPPT since I had already prepared myself and we found that it was a system error that prevented my booking.<br><br>In the end, I got $200 + 1/2 day pay, instead of getting charged for failing to take IPPT and going for 2 months RT.
