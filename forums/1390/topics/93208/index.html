            <div class='col-md body'>As I recall, one of the animated discussions my reservist kaki's had during training downtime - plenty of time for them when out in the field - was whether SAFPU could be considered an local elite force, in the same mold as Commandos, Guards, Navy Diving Unit, RSAF Black Knights, etc.<br><br>There wasn't a consensus. Obviously, many of its sub-units have extrajuristical military powers - eg. MPs, SIB investigators, anti-riot squad - &amp; as such SAF soldiers, regardless of rank, held them up with appropriate respect. But many of us also thought that its precision-drill unit created a negative perception, in the sense that the public thought that's all they do (beyond the "discipline master" niche within army camps).<br><br>I also believe that, come reservist, a lot of them were individually redeployed to become PDF troops, &amp; thus "looked down" upon by soldiers with frontline, ops-ready combat outfits.<br><br>But, for BMT during my time, SAFPU was definately one of the postings the better-performing recruits could aim for (besides OCS &amp; SAFINCO/SISPEC).</div>
