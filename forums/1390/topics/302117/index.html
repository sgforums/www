IA affects your grades coz u are assessed on your attendance and performance, no attendence means no performance means lower grades and lower GPA.<br><br>So far all my friends who have IA and clashed with ICT all managed to defer, even for high keys. Your unit will normally let you go if you go down on the day and talk to the CO and show him the certified letters from school and employer. The problem is NS men centre handles deferment poorly.<br>When I went overseas exchange, I had to apply 2 times for deferment b4 it was approved.<br><br>If you want to defer and you have a reasonably valid reason, you really need to make an effort with your deferment, like apply early and apply again if it fails, worst case on the ICT day go down see CO and show letters. NS should understand that as a full-time student, your committment is not to NS but to the country. Education is also important for your country. You should never compromise your grades and education for ICT, it doesnt make sense, govt pay alot directly or indirectly towards your education too.</div>

The problem is NS men centre handles deferment poorly.<br>When I went overseas exchange, I had to apply 2 times for deferment b4 it was approved. </blockquote>Not convinced. The CO can still say no -- &amp; I believe the law will back him up all the way. Can't find a NTU equivalent, but NUS's stand is clearcut: Point 7(c) in <a href="http://www.eng9.nus.edu.sg/ep/IA_intro.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.eng9.nus.edu.sg/ep/IA_intro.jsp</a><br><br>What you're saying is to report for ICT as per normal &amp; then beg your CO to release you on the spot. Sure, I've witnessed these cases before -- even with Hokkien peng who'd turned up with their bosses &amp; they pleaded like crazy in front of everyone during in-processing at the auditorium. The CO can be swayed either way, but I think he retains the authority to say no.<br><br>That said, IMO it won't reflect well on the CO's organizational skills, though. The IA schemes have been around a long time &amp; gone through a lot of finetuning to mesh with reservist obligations -- even given the more kiam-chye modular courses these days -- &amp; a CO can always mimic how his predecessor or other IHL units timed their ICTs.<br><br>For example, I just had a look at both unis' academic calendars. Both shall end their IAs by 20 June or so, while their regular term breaks extend (from early May) till the the 27 July-1 Aug week. As such, there shall be a 5-week window available for IHL units to conduct their ICTs (typically 3 weeks for high keys). Quite systematic &amp; plenty of time, lah ~lol~ At least no more March lobang like in my time, who'd tio ICT immediately after Feb exams just so my bladdy CO can fit it "last minute" into the extant SAF workyear (April to April).<br><br><blockquote>Ya, I kanna detachment 2IC for my unit next recall manning. Anyway what is the difference between area IC and detachment IC? </blockquote>Not sure I can reveal all online, but then my experience was a long time ago (the days of pagers &amp; landphones). To approximate in very general terms: an area IC commands detachment ICs living in one part of the island, &amp; they each in turn are accountable for unit reservists living in their particular constituency or HDB estate neighborhoods. Upon silent mobilisation, if he can't contact his detachment ICs, he must do their duties for them &amp; contact the men directly. If they're not contactable either, he must go down to their house &amp; deliver the notice (&amp; stick sticker) personally.<br><br>Can't win either way -- If you stay in the East, you may be in charge of 75 men cuz it's so densely populated. If you stay in the West (last time), you may be in charge of only 20 but a lot of them can live in very ulu places (Yew Tee to Neo Tiew, even though they're in the LCK-Ama Keng area, might as well be Batu Pahat-Kola Tinggi ~lol~). At least the unit indented a Land Rover for me during my 1st year. Later on, when I was told to take cabs &amp; then claim expenses, I realized I didn't have $100 ready &amp; resorted to calling my people up pre-manning &amp; bluffing them about likely activation &amp; must thus stay contactable ~lol~<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Keep in mind organizational needs, from the CO's standpoint. The first 2-3 ICTs are crucial for every ORDing unit (whether IHL or not) since it is self-reliant for the first time. For the commanders, there's no more regulars or farmers/scholars to apprentice behind. For the men, some of them are arrowed departmental i/cs or recall i/cs for the first time.<br><br>More often than not, various personnel from elsewhere are posted in too: recycled lao jiaos, holding-list lobos, make-up in-campers, IHL undergrads, etc. A lot of trial &amp; error during this period, &amp; everyone seeks to find out what works best for them.<br><br>Correspondingly, the unit has to establish an identity too &amp;, as such, a high standard of regimentation is enforced &amp; the fullest troop stength mustered every time.</div>

To plan for the ICTs, there is a lot of preparation to do. Like, Training programmes, indenting of ammo, bidding of training area like: ranges, IMT and live firing area and still got administrative work also.<br><br>So you think is easy like what you said?</div>
