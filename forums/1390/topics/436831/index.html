              I read officially somewhere that athletes are admitted separately on a case by case basis.
                      
              It is possible for the very unfit to serve NSF as a civilian, so this probably applies to them. There is no point putting someone through BMT or reservist, if they have no military utility.
              
              Patrick Tan said he "completed his junior OCS term before disrupting to study" and then served NSF as a scientist. I wonder what his rank would have been, if he even remained in uniform.

              <p>Patrck is a 1 chocolate bar guy. If he get a MD-PhD, he should really do MOCC and be a CPT instead. Quite a waste to get a higher pay.</p>
              <p>Anyway in medical field, the doctors go by seniority and cert. He would be consider as high rank in the medical field.</p>

              <p>It's your vocation and not your PES that determines whether you can book out or not. And once you're out of the BMT/trainee stage you can book in and out in civilian attire.</p>

              <p>Why would they put athletes through BMT and risk injury?</p>
              <p>I don't think equality is a big concern to them.</p>

              <p>Singapore government does not actually support the national athletes. So they will go through the normal BMT and be posted like any other boys.</p>
              <p>For example, the national waterpolo team, the boys actually volunteered for the training after work. The team is only formed during competition times.They will collect the names and registered.</p>
              <p>For Martial Arts such as muay thai, TKD, wushu, a selection is held near the SEA games. The uncles will decide who shall go.</p>
              <p>For Bodybuilding, winner of the national championship will ultimately respresent Singapore.</p>
              <p>There is no official national team for soccer, volleyball or whatever. They are actually "volunteers".</p>
              <p>However, a lot of people know how to keng, especially when you are sportsmen. Frequent injuries are common. They will usually end up as clerk, in SAFSA and always training.</p>
