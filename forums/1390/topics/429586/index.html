              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>Does anyone have any experience on this? I was an infantry specialist in my NS days and have went through 3 ICTs. My PES status was B.</p>
              <p>Two months back, I was served with SAF100 for my upcoming ICT in 4 months time. Today, I received news that I am downgraded to PES C9L9. I have been reading up on the internet but could not find any concrete advise on this downgrade.</p>
              <p>1) Will i still serve as an infantry specialist in my unit?</p>
              <p>2) Do I still have to report to the ICT in 4 months time? I reckon yes.</p>
              <p>3) If there is no change to the above 2 questions, then what does this downgrade basically do to me?</p>

              <p>Yes. By the RIGHT, your unit is supposed to automatically post you out, because you are no longer fit for this vocation. You just received the downgrade letter today. So relax and wait one or two months time, for them to arrange for you.</p>
              <p>But then, it is also stated in your NS handbook that it is the NSmen's responsibility to inform their unit about the change in their medical condition/fitness or whatever. So, when your ICT is closer, and no action is carried out. It is your responsilibity now to inform them about the change in your pes status. Apply for medical deferrment. Make  sure that you have "black and white" to state that they recognise your change in Pes status, but feel that you are fit for the current vocation.</p>
              <p>Actually, downgrade does not do much for SGT and officer because they only TALK and COMMAND. So I am sure that even if you are sitting on the wheel chair, you can still instruct your men what to do.</p>
