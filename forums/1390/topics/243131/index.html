Whether or not you choose to come back, it's your call, but I hope you are well-informed of the consequences for not coming back. Those are not exactly pleasant ones, and involve a huge headache should you choose to visit Singapore in the future.<br><br>My advice, come back and serve, it's only for 2 years. Unless you are an Australian citizen by birth, then, it'll be quite illogical do serve NS here unless you intend to settle here.</div>

If he does not come back to serve, and even if he has Australian citizenship, visiting Singapore on business in the future may land him in a huge problem, i.e arrested upon arrival.<br><br>The only case I've heard where the chap was free to go, was an American citizen, whom the US Embassy here raised a huge stinker for. This is just hearsay, btw.<br><br>Singapore does not allow one to give up their citizenship gained by birth unless he is 21. And NS Act comes into force when you are aged 16.5 for registration, and 18 for enlistment. This lag time of 3 years makes it impossible for one to apply for Australian citizenship, or even claim it as your primary citizenship because it is usually seen as the 2nd citizenship by our authorities, and therefore illegal to hold on Singapore soil.<br><br>This is why some army mates of mine had to come back and serve once they finished high school in either Australia or US. In TS's case, I believe he is under the old legislation where if you post a bond and apply to defer your NS till post-overseas tertiary education is complete, you're safe.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So just to clarify with you... even if I renounce my Singaporean citizenship and become an Australian I may still have problems with the government? i.e. I may be arrested if I choose to visit the country in the future?</div>
