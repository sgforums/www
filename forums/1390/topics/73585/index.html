Yes, sleep Basha? Ehz, depends... On what medical excuses the MO gave u during grading... If excused outfield then okie loh... Can go back bunk to sleep..<br><br>- Should you feel that you condition (Please think about it carefully) is not that serious and insist on staying combat, then the form <a href="http://content.miw.com.sg/Mindef/Static/NSRegistration/Pdf/svc_fit.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> would be the "APPLICATION FOR SERVICE-FIT VOLUNTEER SCHEME" whereby you can volunteer for combat training and stand to qualify for SISPEC/OCS together with the others<br><br>- Most prob. you'll end up Service or Technical vocationas after BMT, ranging from Technicans, ASAs etc etc...<br><br>- Remember that the fact that you're not PES A/B doesn't mean you cannot serve you country well.. All of us have a part to play in this<br><br>Hope it helps, do not that these info were dated late 1999 but there shouldn't be much changes I guess...Any1 with updated info pls correct me..</div>

The other EBMT coys do this I noe but do they still do it for MBMT coys now? Hmmm...</div>
