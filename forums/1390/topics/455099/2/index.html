              <p>I was wondering for a very long time about possibility of
                      moonlighting in SAF whether it was okay to do it outside of regular
                      working hours if youre in a combat/combat service
                      support/administrative unit where you have plenty of spare time to
                      run errands and personal stuff. But typically everybody here talks
                      about moonlighting as working a literal part-time weekend job after
                      booking out,no one raised the topic on investments like stock
                      market,commodities,derivatives and financial ventures while in
                      camp. I personally have friends in active nsf service who
                      reportedly have earned within their first year a relatively small
                      sum of SGD$100K through stock market at 20 plus year old. Cool
                      right? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was trying to remodel and reshape my thinking of how these
                      young smart investors are able to evade being categorised as
                      "moonlighting" by common definition,yet make big money through
                      other subtle untrackable means like stock brokerage houses which
                      legalises young people inclusive of nsf to invest actively and
                      generate income other than the regular allowance. Any thoughts on
                      this? A relatively new hot topic.</p>

              <p>Oh I think we missed the point here-Hypothetically lets put
                          certain considerations and assumptions to weed out anything related
                          to money borrowing by legalised financial institutions and
                          brokers,but did make that kind of money say a few hundred thousands
                          by his own merit and starting capital,with superb investment
                          foresight and intelligence,minus all the illegal and risky
                          activities which many people commonly mistaken to be the norm in
                          such trading activities or such as being the result of stock market
                          dealings. I mean to say its highly possible that a really select
                          group of young investors who studied business admin/finance-related
                          and investment theories decided to delve into stock markets in nsf
                          days to recoup and stabilise their finances for life after
                          ORD,stock rises dramatically and newfound wealth created while they
                          remain in active service-based on this situation and facts
                          alone,there is nothing inherently wrong with such investment,right?
                          because its not moonlighting at all,period.</p>
              <p>Lets put it this way,no wrongful and illegitimate wealth making
                          with legal/illegal loansharks.no harassment and potential
                          disruption to NS liability and obligation(ie literally working a
                          job in another company during weekends), just personal cash put to
                          very brilliant use. And an NSF worth $100k in net worth and beyond
                          isnt going to raise eyebrows,because its too common for people age
                          early 20s to have that kinda money in a country with rising living
                          standards. So its perfectly normal and justifiable,correct?</p>

              <p><br>this is a very classic and one good example of <em><strong>speculation</strong></em> in the stock market, or in chinese <strong><span class="mpt3">ç‚’</span></strong><span class="mpt3"><strong><span class="mpt3"><span class="mpt3">è‚¡</span><span class="mpt4">ç¥¨</span></span></strong><span class="mpt4">.</span></span></p>
              <p>the 3 listed companies you aimed are highly likely being <em>over-valuation on its </em><em>price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio)</em>.<br><strong>P/E ratio: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price%E2%80%93earnings_ratio">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price%E2%80%93earnings_ratio</a></strong></p>
              <p><br>once the "big sharks" investors kept buying/ selling the shares among themselves to jack up the stock counter price, thus creating this false sense/ speculation.<br><br>when people like you believe in its fast growth, these sharks will whack out all their shares/ vomit out, selling at high prices to people like you. they make profits via profit-taking while you buy their shares at high prices. then the next few days/ weeks, when these big sharks go hunting at other stock counters, the stock price will begin to fall for the shares that you have just bought. the price will then be fairly stagnant at that level, and so your money will be stuck at that stock counter.</p>
