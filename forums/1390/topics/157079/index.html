Pointed my rifle at my PC!<br><br>We were harbouring for the night in field camp...middle of the night my PC came to steal my buddy's rifle but I was a light sleeper and I saw him. I waited until his back was turned to me and then I push my rifle as hard as I could at his back and asked for the password. He somehow forgot the password or was too shocked to remember. (Later my encik said I gave him a bad bruise with my rifle muzzle). He said he was the PC and ordered me to move my rifle away. At the time I hated these people always trying to steal our rifles and give us extras...so I said I didn't care who he was. If he could not give the password, I would shoot. At that moment my encik heard the commotion and came with the OC.....<br><br>I nearly kenna extra...But I explained what happened and said I could not see his face, didn't recognize his voice and the PC couldn't give the password...the OC laughed it off and my PC somehow felt he couldn't punish me.
