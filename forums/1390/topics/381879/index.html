              <p>You will be getting a mixture of off and leave. Your company clerk will apply them for the entire company, and you will have to inform your PC that you are going overseas.</p>

              <p>There is NO 7 days leave. A NSF that is enlisted in Sept/Oct only has around 3~4 days of leave entitlement while the rest are off given due to burnt weekends.</p>
              <p>8th Dec POP, posting should be around 18th Dec and 21st Dec report to new unit.</p>
              <p>If you want to go overseas, inform ur PC etc since you do not have a unit yet.</p>

              <p>Block leave for BMT regardless of period of enlistment is always from the day of POP till the sunday of the following week. Even for those severely obese RECs who serve 6 months, they will have a short block leave inbetween their 6 months training to clear any of the offs and leaves they have for that 3 months before returning back to tekong for the next 3 months. This is to ensure all RECs POP/POC from tekong at about the same time and can enter training school together with as little interruption as possible.</p>
              <p>The number of leaves used in block leave regardless of enlistment month is also generally fixed at 3-4 days which is the REC's entitement for that 3 months in tekong.</p>

              <p>It could be due to the christmas holiday so they given 1 extra day since alot of units have cohesion or half day on the 24th so posting might be delayed.</p>
              <p>However this year Mon falls on 21st which is not near enough to Christmas for them to delay the 1st day of posting.</p>

              <p>From 8th to 20th its a mixture of leave and offs not only leave from 15th-20th.</p>
              <p>Anyone who wants to go overseas has to inform your PC before you POP. Its best to take initiative and inform in case they forget to ask.</p>
              <p>If everything goes according to expectation, 1st day reporting to unit will be 21st.</p>

              <p>Some coys will call their RECs back for things like range, 24km etc if they have a large enough population who did not complete it during their BMT. In a way this is to allow the REC to complete their BMT and not recourse in future.</p>
              <p>However that is subjected to the individual companies and not all will do such a thing.</p>
              <p>Most of the stuff requires you to have participated except range which generally requires a pass since unit will not conduct BTP.</p>
              <p>If you belong to 1 of the unlucky few who kanna called back during block leave then ur holiday trip just has to be cancelled since they can call u back on the off days during block leave.</p>

              <p>Down PES is ONLY for medical reasons.</p>
              <p>In BMT, almost everyone will fail SOC so thats normal. IPPT certain coy might ask u go back for extra training if you fail but not all. IPPT is BMT is not considered regardless you pass or fail anyway since the actual annual IPPT test needs to be taken at unit.</p>
              <p>The only thing you die die must pass during BMT should be range since units do not conduct BTP. Field camp just need participate in most of the activities can liao.</p>
