No more iron rice bowls, only a selected few who they think are "more capable" are offered to stay till retirement. But this is also subjected to review, if dun perform still can ask u to go. This is SAF new policy for a younger and leaner force. Keeps everyone on their toes.<br><br>But i pity some of my friends who are asked to leave,  in their 30s, family, children, house, car...... no experience. got 1 found job but have to take pay cut of 40%, a fresh poly grad's pay!<br><br>dont understand why employers' always say no experience. at least give a few hundred more lah in appreciation to services rendered to the nation.</div>
