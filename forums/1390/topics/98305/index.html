As such, the career of all IOs will be manged directly by JID and Joint Manpower Personnel Department (JMPD).<br><br><strong>What kind of career can I expect as an IO?</strong><br>The IO scheme offers a challenging and rewarding military career in SAF Intelligence at the highest level. You will be trained and systematically groomed along a specialised route of advancement in the field of intelligence. At the heart of this route of advancement is a conviction to develop each IO to his/her fullest career potential.<br><br><strong>What is the rate of promotion?</strong><br>Promotion is based on performance and potential. The better you perform and the higher your potential, the faster you move up the ranks.<br><br><strong>Are the IO salary, welfare benefits and performance bonus different from other vocations?</strong><br>No. The IO vocation enjoys the same salary (see Salary Scale), welfare benefits (see Welfare and Benefits) and rate of promotion (see Career Advancement) as other combat vocations in the SAF.<br><br><strong>What if I am intending to further my studies?</strong><br>We encourage our Officers to complete their higher education as soon as possible. Officers who have secured scholarships such as LSA will be allowed to defer from service to further their studies upon commissioning or when the course's semester begins whichever is earlier.<br><br><strong>Am I constrained to any particular courses when I attend higher studies?</strong><br>No. Applicants are welcomed to pursue all disciplines approved by the SAF. But here in the Intelligence Corps, applicants are also advised to take up job relevant courses.<br><br><strong>Do I have to work for the SAF during my vacations while I am studying?</strong><br>Yes. Depending on the need for manpower, arrangements will be made for you to be attached within the SAF while you are on studies vacation. This is to keep you updated with the latest developments in the SAF. You will be paid while on studies vacation.<br><br>Source:<br><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/io/home.asp" rel="nofollow">SAF Intelligence Corps</a></div>

IPPT stds are different much like the guy and girl NAFA test std difference. SOC will be conducted in clean fatigue and there will be some station u can skip. u need to pass IPPT to pass out from BMT. after that u go on to Tri service term (4weeks) this time the platoon will have some guys. u pretty much do the same thing as the guys (refer to OCS FAQ for more info). after tri service term, the gals will be split up into air force navy or army (of which u already know which service to enter) and then proceeding on to Service term 1, service term 2 and professional term. Navy and airforce cadets will be subject to different length of terms. (refer to OCS FAQ).<br><br><strong>OTHERS[b]</strong><br>Its not for the faint hearted. but we dont expect superwoman type either. it is a varied and interesting career and if u are up for the challenge u will love it. u either love it or hate it. u have a choice in coming to join the SAF. think before u commit. cos u are not going to get away with kenging or that sort of rubbish as u have volunteered to join. u are expected to train as hard as the guys and side by side with them. it includes field camps, route march fast march and so on. u carry the same load, u walk the same distance and do as much as the guys if not more just to keep up. there will be no such thing as ur 'aunty' visiting u to get out of exercise or field camps or marches. hygiene is something personal. u have to prepare ur so called 'extra supplies' of wet tissue and etc should ur 'aunty' choose to visit u during field camps. bear in mind that there are no facilities outfield or any special arrangements made for that time of month. instructors are impartial and will treat u as a guy. punishment includes the whole platoon and u will not be able to get away for the reason of ur being the fairer sex. the only exception is when u are medically excused. u will be under scrutiny wherever u go. in camp in ur formation in ur unit simply because u are a female. there is an expectation that u will be professional in ur job as u chose to be a soldier.<br></div>

For IO, you have to sign after receiving diploma... probably in NS after you've been selected for OCS.<br></div>

None suits me.<br><br>I was enlisted directly into SPF for national service, so i'm not an NSPI, only SC/Sgt when orded. Therefore, i totally haf no experience of army life at all.. only heard a lot from my peers and by reading this forum. I'll 25 in 2005 liao.. When i decided to go for my degree course at NUS, ( instead of signing on as a Sgt ) i was intending to join the police force as an senior police officer... however it seems harder to get in already. I oso applied for RSAF.. but din make it for the ADA interview. Hmmm.. as for the bmt , i do feel i may haf some problems as my fitness level is not really good. I managed a pass for my ippt only.. after few retests.. furthermore for ocs.. dunno whether can get in anot but of coz i am willing to go the miles shld i want to join the army. My gf is my main concern coz she isnt tat supportive of me choosing the army. Really making no headway since graduated in july... family members, gf n frds constantly asking whether i got a job...</div>
