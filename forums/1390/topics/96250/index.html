The cohort is made up of 221 cadets from the Army and 23 cadets from the Air Force, and three foreign cadets- two from Brunei and one from Thailand.  The OCTs had to undergo 42 weeks of rigorous training in leadership, military history, military law, military tactics, and weapon handling.<br><br>Two cadets, OCT Cheng Nian-Han from the Army and OCT Yew Liansheng from the Air Force clinched the Sword-of-Honour award for their sterling performances. They, together with the three foreign cadets, received their ceremonial swords from Mr Tarmugi. The OCTs were assessed on their ability to lead and motivate others, their organisational ability, proficiency in military skills and physical fitness.<br><br>Minister-of-State for Defence Mr Cedric Foo, senior MINDEF/SAF officials, Members of Parliament, students from the National Cadet Corps, and grassroots leaders witnessed this eveningÂ’s event.  Families and friends of the OCTs were also present to affix epaulettes onto the ceremonial uniforms of the newly commissioned officers.  Such public involvement and support at the parade is a reminder of the important role of total defence in ensuring Singapore's continued peace and security.[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SPEECH BY MR ABDULLAH TARMUGI, SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT, AT THE 54/03 OFFICER CADET COURSE COMMISSIONING PARADE HELD ON 2ND OCTOBER 2004 AT 6.00 PM AT SAFTI MI<br><br>Graduands, parents, ladies and gentlemen,<br><br>We are gathered here this evening to witness the beginning of a new and important phase for this commissioning class of officer cadets. Today, on the respected grounds of this parade square, we celebrate your perseverance and successful completion of the very toughest of military training, to earn your rightful place in the Officer Corps of the Singapore Armed Forces. Henceforth, you are entrusted with the duty of safeguarding the peace and security of our nation, as full-fledged commissioned officers.<br><br>In this post-Cold War and post-Sep 11 world, the challenges for those charged with the defence and security of our country have grown. This is because the range of threats has grown and we stare new threats squarely in the face. Security now takes on a far broader definition than most of us have been used to dealing with. These uncertainties in the security environment underscore the importance of having a strong defence capability. The SAFÂ’s ability to deter potential aggressors and deal swiftly and decisively with them has provided the solid security foundation upon which SingaporeÂ’s economic growth has been achieved. As commanders, your role in an operationally ready SAF is instrumental in providing continued assurance of the nationÂ’s peace and security.<br><br>As commanders, you will be responsible to lay the foundations for adaptive and resilient fighting units, capable of executing a wide spectrum of operations, both in peacetime and in operations. To do so effectively, you will need to firstly be competent in your individual professional military expertise, secondly to be able to motivate your men and, most importantly, be of good character at all times.<br><br>To be professionally competent means that you must have the knowledge and skills to accomplish your missions. Only then will your men follow you with confidence. Being competent then allows you to train your men well and imbue them with the right values and attitudes, and be conversant in their areas of expertise.<br><br>However, being proficient in tactical and technical knowledge is only one aspect of assuming command. As a leader of men, each of you shall answer for the training, morale and discipline of the men under your charge. You must ensure your men are operationally ready at all times through a balanced regime of tough uncompromising training and high disciplinary standards with sufficient emphasis on the safety and welfare aspects. Your men will see that you have their best interests at heart and be motivated to do well. Take the time and effort to know each of your men well. Give due recognition to those who have been outstanding in their performance and coach the weaker ones to keep up with the rest. In times of hardship, you can motivate them best by showing your own resilient and positive attitudes and the tenacity to overcome all adversities.<br><br>We come now to the third and most crucial aspect of being an effective leader of men, that is, good character. It entails a pledge to truthfulness, of being upright in conduct, and having the moral courage to take responsibility for oneÂ’s actions, even and especially if they turn out to be wrong. It also means the ability to do things right even when no one is watching. In this, you have as your guide, the SAF Core Values as well as the principles enshrined in the OfficerÂ’s Creed. Live and act by these values. Only when you exemplify them, and demonstrate them in your daily actions, can you be a voice of influence over your men and gain their deepest trust and respect for your leadership.<br><br>The tasks now falls upon your shoulders - the newly commissioned officers of the Singapore Armed Forces - to take on the challenges facing the nation. As you stand ready to be commissioned as officers of the SAF, another chapter of SingaporeÂ’s success story is unfolding. The SAF is the bedrock upon which rests the security and peace this nation has enjoyed for thirty-nine years since Independence. Good leadership is therefore paramount to secure our continued survival. We are confident that you are now ready to take on these challenges, and will lead the SAF to even greater heights. This Commissioning Parade symbolises the nationÂ’s trust in you to chart the way for a brighter future for Singapore.<br><br>Finally, it gives me great pleasure to witness your Commissioning Parade. As each one of you leaves this premiere Institute to assume command in your new unit, always remember your roots in the Tradition of Excellence as embodied in this Institute. And may you always uphold the OCS motto: "To Lead, To Excel, To Overcome" in all that you do. You have done us proud and I congratulate each and every one of you on your commissioning.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br></div>
