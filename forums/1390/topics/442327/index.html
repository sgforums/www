              <p>I am currently serving my 5th ICT and I never had a problem booking in and out with long 4 for years after my BMT and course-training until now! </p>
              <p>I had section and platoon fire movement training outfield and hence I chose to book in in long 4. Just when I enter my reservist camp, the sentry guard told me to fold back to smart 4 otherwise I would be denied entry despite holding a valid pass! WTF I thought? I explained to the guard my predicament and he still insisted that I fold back to smart 4 or he would not allow me access into camp. I was late then as I need to book in by 8am and I was f**cking stopped by this sentry bastard at exactly 8am. I knew I could not go topless outside with only my combat pants on. Hence, I went outside frantically to search for a toilet just to fold back to smart 4 and ended up booking in at 8.20am! I was reprimanded by my reservist commanders for being late! I was truly pissed! </p>
              <p>I was wondering how come SAF came out with so stupid dress code which must be strictly followed. I was a reservist! Just being told off and changed my dress code by an active NSF was ridiculous! Is 'smart 4' really that smart? I simply can't understand!</p>
              <p>To my astonishment, I even saw a group of US Army guys coming into my camp and all of them are wearing their version of 'long 4' and they were not told off! </p>
              <p>I did a research on the US military dress code and they do not have a dress rule as stupid and ridiculous as us! They have the option of choosing to fold their sleeves or remain in long sleeves anytime, anywhere!</p>
              <p>The concept of 'smart 4 and 'long 4' is only something we Singaporeans can understand but not others! Why can't SAF follow the global trend?</p>
              <p>Saying that SAF wants to distinguished itself from the other militaries just does not explain the idea as their current pixellized uniform and helmet is very much similar to the US military! Only the color is different!</p>
