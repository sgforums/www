              <p>I am beginning to believe that. Just look at the following cases</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) My fren whom is a ns man, has failed his ippt. Complete the cycle of RT, retake and pass. The unit told him no need to take anymore till next year. Then the HQ send a charge letter asking him to appear in court for failing to take ippt. He call up the hotline and explain, and request them to check with the unit. Did they listen? No, they ask him appear in court and explain.</p>
              <p>WTFBBQ, have to take leave to go court and explain for a mistake of theirs?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Me got deferred from my reservist unit MO. Then one week later the manpower of the same camp, ask me to report for in-camp. I told them i got official letter from YOUR mo. They say nvm, ask me report 1st day den see MO or pass the letter. I told them to dont waste my time, and go check with their medical centre. I tink they can really sense my dulaness, and actually bother to go check, rather than ignoring the problem, which is their style.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) During my NSF days, everytime report sick in camp is a torture. You report to medical centre at 8am. See the MO at 8.30. And wait 2 HOURS just to collect the medicine. I was asking the medic, why do i need to wait 2 hours just to collect the status and medicine. They told me the system needs time to load the information that the MO type in.</p>
              <p>The is another WTFBBQ case.</p>

              <p>you report sick alot ah? just 2 hours. they take 2 hours mean you miss 2 hour training, no big deal what. and people don't report sick alot anyway, like 2-3 times a year? </p>
              <p>the RT thingie, just prepare all the paper they want and sent to them, and  it will go away. deferment is always a bitch...</p>

              <p>annual RT/IPPT remind you to excerise regularly. It is a survivor mode to remind you to stay healthy and fit.  IPPT is just a standard of physical strength and mental endurance So there is nothing extraordinary for a normal body not to perform.  </p>
              <p>So, first of all change the atitude.... i think is a fair response to negative complaint.  </p>

              <p>if SAF is very organised, efficient and competent then we won't have loopholes which we could exploit to ease our pain during NS.</p>
              <p>2 hours of waiting =</p>
              <p>1) a good long breakfast without the need to swallow my food down without chewing.</p>
              <p>2) a good long smoking break... no need to huff and puff till the cigrette burns out.</p>
              <p>of course if during NS, the management cocks up and delay time, your gain. i still remember i was "given" 2 months to CBL at Sembawang Camp cos' they couldn't decide where to post me to. so they ask me to report to STTS everyday at 7.30 am to a corporal. i will report to him and then he will ask me to OTOT till 4.30 before booking out.</p>
              <p>i will go to the store room to "check stock" (the store has no stock to check) and sleep till lunch. after lunch, say hi to him, show face to indicate still in camp and went back to "check stock". maybe the corporal know who i am if he read this... haha... (corporal ben ben) during this time, i had medical appointments with TTSH and they send me for ACL reconstruction surgery and i MC for another 3 months before posting to OETI for the remaining of my NS...</p>
              <p>so cock up is good... during NS but if after ORD, not so nice liao</p>
