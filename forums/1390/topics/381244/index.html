              <p>Booking out etc depends on your unit schedule whichever vocation you get. There is no absolute weekend sure will bookout due to exercise, workload etc etc.</p>
              <p>However you can choose apply leave subjected to PS/PC etc approval if you do need to go for lessons or the test.</p>
              <p>All ur other questions do not belong to SAF related issue so its best you get your answers elsewhere.</p>
