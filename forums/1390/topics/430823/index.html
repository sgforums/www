              <p>Tell you what, my unit had a policy saying those living near camp must go to camp medical centre even on weekends. Can only go to private clinics if at night. This rule is easy to follow, right?</p>
              <p>This is not legal but even if they punish with extra, we can't do anything.</p>
              <p>It is standard rule for MC of 3 days or more to be endorsed.</p>
              <p>Hope your attitude regulars get posted out or ORD. If not, hope you can request post out if too much trouble.</p>

              <p>All these are the unit's own informal rules. You can get MC from wherever you want. I understand you obeyed them and now another person is saying MC from 3 different places = malingering.</p>
              <p>If MO say you are malingering, he is questioning the integrity of the doctor. That's why even if you bring a 10 day MC to endorse, the MO will not shorten it. MO is also a registered doctor, he has no right to do this. He also can't go back in time and see your condition then. Don't worry, you did no wrong.</p>
              <p>If they want to give you extra or charge for malingering, it is illegal. The system is they cannot punish you unless you accept it. The OC give you a summary (ie anyhow) sentence that is take it or leave it kind. If you reject it, then they must escalate to next level ie CO. This level must have evidence, ie they must go to all the doctors and make them take back their diagnosis before they can charge you with malingering. All this trouble, they rather let you go and post you out.</p>

              <p>And my camp is no where near my camp, in fact it's almost at two different ends of singapore. I didn't know i was not allowed to extend MC, it only stated that MCs more than 3 days needed to be endorsed and submitted to the MO so i thought it refers to the One go 4,5 days mc and not those with extension. </p>
              <p>I don't know how serious it is exactly, but it's the first time i got thise infection and it didn't recover well and it dragged on that's why i went to extend at a near by clinic. I didn't know it was necessary to extend in Camp... if that was the case they could have told me before i may get another extension then i would have went back to the camp medical centre since that was necessary.</p>
              <p>Yes, i will go and get the doctor's Memo, the doctors do better know whether u should rest at home or not and if they felt other wise, why would they have given me the 3 days mcs? I didn't ask for it myself.</p>

              <p>alize, stop saboing him. Yes, on paper everything is black and white. But when it comes to implementation, it can be different. Just by giving you all the weekends guard duties, you can die already. They can just accused you of stupid reasons like no saluting at officers or not polishing boots good enough.</p>
              <p><a href="../../../users/279185">II0Il00lI</a>, you are getting yourself into trouble. It is hard to believe that you are not malingering, if your condition is really serious, why don't the doctor give you 1 week mc straight. But one thing i can tell you is that if your mc is not endorsed by mo or approved by your oc/co, then it is invalid even if it is from govtment hopsitals. You will be charged awol for the days that you were not present.</p>

                  you are getting yourself into trouble. It is hard to believe that
                  you are not malingering, if your condition is really serious, why
                  don't the doctor give you 1 week mc straight. But one thing i can
                  tell you is that if your mc is not endorsed by mo or approved by
                  your oc/co, then it is invalid even if it is from govtment
                  hopsitals. You will be charged awol for the days that you were not
                  present.</p>

              <p>I've been told that they cannot give one week straight, and during my follow up the polyclinic doctor told me i can go back to polyclinic to extend the MC. What do you mean by malingering? So because i went to a government hospital and was given mc by the doctors there as they certified my illness instead of going camp MO because i was not told that it is necessary, i malingered? So you are saying that public hospital doctors lack medical expertise and intergrity as they said i have illness which i don't have? And if anyone thinks it is easy to extend ur mc u can try yourself. If even govt hospital not recognised i have nothing to say already.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">as posted to a unit recently and supposedly got into a troublesome
              matter. Yes, my MC was a bit long for chest infection, 12 days of
              continuous MC of 3 days each. I i thought it was necessary. Only
              once it was from a private clinic of 2 days, the first Mc was from
              government hospital which was 3 days and the rest of the Mcs are
              from polyclinic.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">My first 3 days MC was from NUH and the second was from polyclinic
              when the MC is over because i was told to go polyclinic if my
              condition doesn't get better. the doctor there voluntarily gave me
              3 days mc to rest at home. Then im supposed to have another medical
              appt at polyclinic the nxt monday and i when i told the unit the
              night before, they say i need to get an mc to cover myself for
              sunday.( I didn't know about it as im new to this unit) And since
              im still genuinely sick, i went to the private clinic below my hse
              as poly not open on sunday.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">The unit say i can get from private clinic and the clinic gave me 2
              days MC. The next morning after my medical appt, the doctor say
              that my conditions still not better and i needed more rest, so she
              gave me 3 days mc( again i didn't ask for it), and she say that i
              can go back to extend my mc if needed. So on thursday i went again
              and the polyclinc gave me rest until weekend.Note that all the mcs
              were given to me, and if i was chaokenging, will polyclinic give me
              so many MCs? In addition, my condition is infectious, what good
              will it do to let me go back? Affect more ppl so more ppl will fall
              sick?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">That night, i was requested by PC to endorse mc the next day. The
              MO immediately took me as malingering, though he did emphasised
              that he didn't mean im malingering but he's attitude showed
              otherwise. Then he even asked about my school and my grades and i
              told him i was from a JC then he asked my grades, which wasnt good.
              Then he said that he had straight As and more... why did he do
              that? After that, he didn't really listen to my explanations. He
              say i'm not supposed to go A&amp;E unless im dying.. but my parents
              and many other people also go there for fever, what's wrong? It's
              not like my camp forced me to go back to get mc or anything , so i
              thought it was okay to get mc outside. And they accepted it
              whenever i told them my MC extended. Now they accuse me of
              malingering and everyone's attitude was damn bad to me. I feel very
              indignant, maybe it's my fault for not going camp MO but it is true
              that i was given MC for my real illness. </p>

              <p>Dont talk bullshit. You better get your chest infection checkout at SGH. Do a proper X-ray to ensure your lungs is clear. NUH is lousy. Chest infection at such as Bronchitis, Pneumonia can take as long as two weeks. Some people ever take months. Some never recover.</p>
              <p>Chest infection is uncommon illness. Most doctor cannot diagnose it properly.</p>
              <p>I suggest you better do a proper medical checkup, highlight "tuberculosis". My friend just got diagnosed for it. TB is coming back, some individual can get it despite of vaccination.</p>
              <p>On the SAF adminstration perspective, you should endorse the MC and etc. You know what to do, just follow the adminstration protocol.</p>

              <p>Yes but slight correction: seeking MP's help <em>first </em>is a grave offence. SAF does not allow you to air dirty laundry in public. According to SAF, you must complain to your OC, if cannot then CO, then Armed Forces Council before you can seek MP's help. :)</p>
