On top of that all, his S3 was missing half the time and he acted on behalf of his S3 and did a bloody good job.<br><br>Tell your friend, prove himself in BMT/OCS..... and if he wants to sign on... go for laser surgery to remove his tatts if it affects him later.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>1) why muz declare got tattoo? wat diff does it make? </blockquote>I think it's part of the larger governmental SOP; they ask these questions when arrested or applying for a civil-service job too. The most obvious rationale is about image, since it's usually phrased as "what design &amp; where is the tattoo?" - so the post about SAF Provost exclusion seems logical. They may screen your background if the design has other connotations beyond pure vanity, given S'pore past history with secret societies.<br><br><blockquote>2) is having a tattoo gonna affect his army life? will he be barred from sispec, ocs or any other courses? </blockquote>I can vouch for the mono-intake: no. Had one guy directly under my charge - the full "lang zi ming, shang xin ku" on his back - &amp; I was wondering what I got myself into cuz he reported with a gelled-up, super-long yellow mane as well (it was December 1987) when I picked him up at CMPB. Turned out to be very malleable, &amp; I recommended retaining him as a mortarman. The irony is my battery had 2 pai-kia recruits - non-tattooed - &amp; for some reason they were paired up as buddies. Instead of fireworks, they bonded relatively well for supposedly secret-society rivals, but were poorer performers during BMT &amp; were posted out.<br><br><blockquote>3) will he be differentiated from other enlistees w/o tattoos?</blockquote>Overall, unlikely, since recruits are recruits. The other trainees &amp; the DI's may be curious, if not wary, of his background if the tattoo is more insidious, but that's all. It's still the usual suspects whenever a serviceman stands out negatively: the Blur king, Gabra king, Keng king, Sabo king, Tuang/Skive/Snake king, Idle king, Koon King, YaYa king, MC king, BoBo/WoWo shooter, Zero fighter (chin-ups), Topo general, One-Stripe/Two-Stripe/Three-Stripe general (YaYa LCP/CPL/SGT respectively), etc. In other words, "performance"-based.</div>
