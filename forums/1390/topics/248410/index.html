            <div class='col-md body'>i don't know if this is an appropraite thread, so Mods can close it if it isnt <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">.<br><br>but it seems to me serving NS, ghost stories are part and parcel. be it first hand experience or word of mouth. everyone will have herad or have a story to tell.<br><br>so i thought it would be nice to share a few stories. i shall get teh ball rollin<br><br>This one, one was told to me by my brother, he has since ORd'ed and he has experienced this first hand, i believe him because he isnt a guy who bullshits.<br><br>he was in mohawk coy, and during field camp he was on guard duty at the oil palm plantation site i think. he told me it was late at night and he was walking around his camp site with his buddie, apparently cos the sergants during his batch was very xiong, he kept to the spacing rule and he walked some distance ahead of his buddy,  then reaching a point of the patrol route  he saw someone squatting on the ground, he descibed the guy was wearing admin and wearing specs, (maybe it was someone sh-itting ROFL) then my brother challenged password to him, he repeated it some times apparently, but the guy ignored him. then my brother then thought who the f*** wears admin in field camp?,then that guy squatting started rocking back and forth and muttering, my brother then ran like hell back to his buddy and both of them decided to just go back to basha and sleep.<br><br>when he told me this story first thought in my mind was "lousy sentry" and "KENG AR". but my bro is a serious person so i do believe him.<br><br>the next one is told to me by school 1 people, i heard it during BMTC and in my current unit where i have friends from different companies from sch 1.<br><br>and this is a very disturbing story to me because ive met people who do not know each other,  and from different coys. but thier story is erieily similar.<br><br>it generally goes like this, if u tio prowling duty. you walk round around the school. the story always takes place at the same area, the path in school 1.<br>in front of the stadium swimming pool, and the club looking place on the right  and the sea from the left.<br><br>it generally goes like this, before the turn at the end of the SOC ground the 90 degree one that will lead to the path along the sea. they will spot a white figure at the corner which will dissapear, then they will carry on to the area in front of the swiming pool, which will have lots of coconut trees. then around there there would be a piercing scream. and the scream will continue until u leave the general area. my friend told me he and his buddy ran like fook.<br><br>one story involved the tekong dogs, i don't know if anyone knows "xiao hei" the cute fat black dog at school 1. he would follow companies on route marches. it is supposedly said the dogs are very "sensitive" and can help ward off the ghosts. thus the tekong RP's let the dogs laze near the guardpost<br><br>the story was the same circumstance, and when the pair reached the swimming pool area xiao hei started barking up a tree. and i heard when someone chased the dogs away on the duty before, the pair got sick the following day.<br><br>my current unit friend says theres also a coward dog that turns and runs away when they reached that particular area. LOL.<br><br>anyway it may be figments of imgination or storys made up or who knows? but it certainly is entertaining, jap soldier stories from warrents, suiciding RPs -  toyols! in my current base. etc etc, everyone has one</div>

(although its hard walking alone in ulu place at night)<br><br>my theory is that since im an atheist, if the devil shows a ghost to me he will force me to believe in spiritual beings thus turn to god, and stab himself in the back, so right now as an atheist i am already locked on to hell and he wont disturb me, its kinda comforting in a way.</div>
