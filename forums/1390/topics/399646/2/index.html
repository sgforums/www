              <p>Anyway, I'll leave it to green-square shooters like you to press "Auto Colour" on the drop-down menu so you can slavishly claim that you have your colour-balance right.  I guess your photography's so pitiful that you need to grasp at straws like that to feel adequate.   Maybe one day you'll progress to P and have a graduation ceremony while you're at it. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Second, wow, you know what a white lens is - you want a medal for that or something?  If I was really going to go pro, I'd be using a stack of primes with nothing below f/1.8, but by by wetting yourself over something as common as the 24-70 and 70-200, you're just showing how pathetically little you know.</p>
              <p>Third, like I said before, it's just painfully pitiful that you would make a court case out of white balance.  Why don't you write to NatGeo, or email Magnum to complain that their photographers don't have the correct white balance?  Do you have any inkling of how stupid you sound? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Okay, I'll cut you some slack.  You get excited by five grand a month, so I suppose spotting anything with a red band would have you ruining your underwear immediately.  You really are one of the little people.</p>

              <p><br>Not me Canon is the one to grade them as professional. why wiht money can buy anything. That's with money. That does not mean you have money always. but with enough money, you can make any purchases. anyone with money 'enough; to pay for any purchases of photographic equipment can buy 'professional grade' of lenses and bodies. but it does not make them professional.  "l" is the grading canon give for their higher end lenses. painted white for professional because it will not conduct as much heat as black painted body, a thought for peopl who uses the lenses under hot sun (e.g soccer matches, or tennis matches).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>oh and your photos i lied. its not white balance problem. under bright sun will cast bright reflective light off any surface. either the floor is all blue of the surrounding enclosure all all bright blue. your photos were taken under bight sunlight thus the blue cast. that's why post processing and color correction filters comes in. why i left a point for you to correct me you never? you have been pressing shutter with a brain switched off. just like making a silly post in this thread. its not white balance lah <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
