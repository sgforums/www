              <p>oh and your photos i lied. its not white balance problem. under

              either the floor is all blue of the surrounding enclosure all all
              bright blue. your photos were taken under bight sunlight thus the
              blue cast. that's why post processing and color correction filters

              <p>I've been and gone, man - that was back in 2005.  I had to tie off a few loose ends in Singapore, but once that was done I packed up and moved back to Melbourne.</p>
              <p>You're right, though, LRRP is 8 years and strike is 7 years - most of my company guys ended up doing LRRP.  Maybe I was too old for their liking by the time I got back, but even then I never even got called up for IPPT.  Guess they lost me in the paperwork.</p>
              <p>The funniest thing is that even though they didn't call me back for reservist, I spent enough time at Hendon to make up for it.  A fair number of my batch boys are either at battalion or Force Line, and I was at Club 33 for beers at least once a month. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Anyway, to summarise, fullofshit2005.</p>
              <p>1) You think 5 grand a month is a big deal<br>2) You've never been offered even as much as 5 grand a month<br>3) You obviously don't know enough about the SAF to know what LRRPs do but you want to act like a twenty-star general<br>4) You believe hobby gear like the 5D and 50D are "professional"<br>5) You're obsessed about tiny things like white balance, which professionals don't make a fuss about<br>6) You think that Canon would bother to sue you because you called the 5D professional and they didn't</p>
              <p>What's that all add up to, sport?</p>
              <p>You're a teensy, eensy little turd with delusions of adequacy, ordinary things give you a hard-on, and yet you are so pathetically lacking in perspective as to speak to your superiors with an air of equality.</p>
              <p>It's been amusing, but you're now boring.  Go find someone else to annoy, killer - daddy's busy.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I have recently been turned down twice on the spot during job
              interviews, out of nine such interviews, these two were in my top 3
              list of companies I would like to work.</p>
              <p>Though I have found a position, I was still bewildred and called
              the interviewer up a week later to ask if he'd remember me.
              Fortunately, he did and I boldly asked why as to I was turned down
              since I thought I met their companies requirements and more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This was what he told me, "I'm really sorry Mr. Tao but we
              need people who can be dedicated to this job around the year.
              We cannot pay you 2 months salary every year for nothing
              la."</p>
              <p>I was shocked, as if I had a choice to choose whether I needed
              to re service or not? If you want to blame, don't blame me, blame
              my country. Not only was I infuriated but saw how NS was in fact a
              disadvantage so large yet unavoidable to Singaporean men, I shared
              and would like to know if anyone else has experienced this?</p>
              <p>I really want this to end, how am I supposed to help Singapore
              grow as a nation when it itself is the thing holding me back? I go
              in, 2 months, come out bald, get lesser pay, find lousier job.
              Waste my life, cannot even work overseas full-time. What's the
              point of NS really?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, if anyone has words of advice to our younger
              generation on how to avoid re servicing or making sure NS doesn't
              screw up your life, share it with us. Not to sound unloyal or
              ungrateful but there are sometimes I wish I was not born
              Singaporean, much as I like the country itself I can't stand that
              simply being a citizen here means you are shackled for life.</p>

              <p>somehow I get the impression that this post is just to rant against NS....but I'll give U the benefit of the doubt....</p>
              <p>like mentioned by others in the thread...reservist...or ICT if U prefer...is reimbursed by MINDEF...so the only thing sickening about it is the paperwork...or the ICT itself...depending on how U look at it...</p>
              <p>anyway...going by the excuse given(I wouldnt even think of it as reason)....I dont think the entire company is made up of foreign talents or females...</p>
