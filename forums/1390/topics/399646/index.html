              <p>I have recently been turned down twice on the spot during job interviews, out of nine such interviews, these two were in my top 3 list of companies I would like to work.</p>
              <p>Though I have found a position, I was still bewildred and called the interviewer up a week later to ask if he'd remember me. Fortunately, he did and I boldly asked why as to I was turned down since I thought I met their companies requirements and more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This was what he told me, "I'm really sorry Mr. Tao but we need people who can be dedicated to this job around the year. We cannot pay you 2 months salary every year for nothing la."</p>
              <p>I was shocked, as if I had a choice to choose whether I needed to re service or not? If you want to blame, don't blame me, blame my country. Not only was I infuriated but saw how NS was in fact a disadvantage so large yet unavoidable to Singaporean men, I shared and would like to know if anyone else has experienced this?</p>
              <p>I really want this to end, how am I supposed to help Singapore grow as a nation when it itself is the thing holding me back? I go in, 2 months, come out bald, get lesser pay, find lousier job. Waste my life, cannot even work overseas full-time. What's the point of NS really?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, if anyone has words of advice to our younger generation on how to avoid re servicing or making sure NS doesn't screw up your life, share it with us. Not to sound unloyal or ungrateful but there are sometimes I wish I was not born Singaporean, much as I like the country itself I can't stand that simply being a citizen here means you are shackled for life.</p>

              <p>Uh, the company doesn't have to pay you a cent for the time you serve reservist, in camp training.</p>
              <p>They just have to fax in the make up pay claim form endorsed by your employer. The govt will pay you, not the company you work for.</p>
              <p>So the guy who gave you the reason about having to pay you 2 months for nothing is pure absolute bull. Simply put, they just don't want you lar, coz their reason very lame.</p>

              <p>you sound like you're making this up ... have you really served already ? </p>
              <p>which NSman doesn't know about make up pay claims ? ... and what kind of reservist you go through that needs you to go back for two months a year ? low key, 7 days, high key, 20 plus days ..... but yours, each time, two months ??!?!?!?! ...... </p>
              <p>and who say you cannot work overseas ? thousands leave every year after their full time NS for studies and work overseas, no ? Just get an exit permit, which is automatically granted.</p>
              <p>you are really a young chap waiting to go into tekong, aren't you ?</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I have recently been turned down twice on the spot during job
                      interviews, out of nine such interviews, these two were in my top 3
                      list of companies I would like to work.</p>
              <p>Though I have found a position, I was still bewildred and called
                      the interviewer up a week later to ask if he'd remember me.
                      Fortunately, he did and I boldly asked why as to I was turned down
                      since I thought I met their companies requirements and more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This was what he told me, "I'm really sorry Mr. Tao but we
                      need people who can be dedicated to this job around the year.
                      We cannot pay you 2 months salary every year for nothing
                      la."</p>
              <p>I was shocked, as if I had a choice to choose whether I needed
                      to re service or not? If you want to blame, don't blame me, blame
                      my country. Not only was I infuriated but saw how NS was in fact a
                      disadvantage so large yet unavoidable to Singaporean men, I shared
                      and would like to know if anyone else has experienced this?</p>
              <p>I really want this to end, how am I supposed to help Singapore
                      grow as a nation when it itself is the thing holding me back? I go
                      in, 2 months, come out bald, get lesser pay, find lousier job.
                      Waste my life, cannot even work overseas full-time. What's the
                      point of NS really?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, if anyone has words of advice to our younger
                      generation on how to avoid re servicing or making sure NS doesn't
                      screw up your life, share it with us. Not to sound unloyal or
                      ungrateful but there are sometimes I wish I was not born
                      Singaporean, much as I like the country itself I can't stand that
                      simply being a citizen here means you are shackled for life.</p>

              <p>Like everyone else, I smell bullsh*t. Either from you or the company.</p>
              <p>I suspect you because any full-blooded local male who has done reservist would know that the correct term is 'reservist' and not 're service', and that by law you can be called up for up to 40 days, not two months.</p>
              <p>Also, any established local company who hires local males would know that the reservists take no-pay leave during their ICT stints and claim for loss of pay from the government. It does not cost the company a single cent. I doubt that the HR department of the company would be so stupid to not know that (though there are enough idiots out there, of course.....)</p>
              <p>So I suspect that the bullsh*t comes mainly from you. After all, if we were to believe you, then following the company's logic, they would have NO local males working for them, period.</p>
              <p>Either that, or they were just trying to get rid of you with a lame excuse. Live with it.</p>
