              <p>Well to start I was enlisted on the 10th of April. I am a diploma in mechatronics graduate thrown in with the A level batch. During BMT, I went for an AEO interview and I was one of the 4 who were selected of of hundred of A lvl applicants for the post. At the final interview, they offered all 4 of us LSAs and I happily (then) signed on the dotted line. My performance was fine, Gold for IPPT and I passed every component well enough. Everything was supposed to go smoothly, or I thought so.</p>
              <p> Posting order came out, and I was posted to sispec instead of ocs, of course I was stunned. Though I knew the contract stated that I need to make it to OCS, I don't see why I didn't make it. I called up air force, and they told me my BMT results couldn't make it. They said they had a leeway of picking you up from the top 30% instead of the usual 10%, and they said my name even wasn't in the top 30%. Well, it couldn't be possible that I screwed my SIT test and peer appraisal THAT bad. I personally felt the only guy from my section who was posted to OCS was just "average", IPPT silver and stuff, not very vocal blah blah (no offense to him). I'm sure the factor was that it was because he had 5 As in his A levels, and since I'm a diploma holder, no matter what my GPA is, they would'nt bother. Despite having a GPA of 3.86 and a place in NUS Mechanical Engineering, they passed on picking me? Well at least RSAF did give me a chance, but what was CPC doing seriously?</p>
              <p>So...now I'm already into my last week in BSLC, I'm no longer hoping for a crossover because I don't want to give myself false hope again.</p>

              <p>Very good GPA results and I'm happy for you. But sad to say, because you are not an A level holder nor a scholar. Most people in OCS are scholars and studied in JC.</p>

              <p>I thought the air force would be a good career opportunity based on the following reasons :</p>
              <p>1) I took the aerospace elective in my final year, and am planning to do the same for the course in Uni. (cross fingers and hope I'll dow ell enough). So at least I wouldn't lose out to the A lvl grads.</p>
              <p>2) To me, this acts as a "bridge" between my poly and uni. education. Since air force is very academic, and what I'm be doing in air force is at least related in a way to what I'm going to study in Uni., better than let my brains rot while digging fire trenches and shell scrapes.</p>
              <p>3) To be honest, $_$ face? If I'm not wrong, the LSA is already one of the lower end scholarships SAF offers. But full sponsorship of studies, plus getting paid $2k a month while I study, and the 5 figure sum i get at the end of the course, is very enticing in return for 4 years of my time.</p>
              <p>4) My family isn't exactly very well to do, so I hope by signing on, it can relief my family's "financial burden".</p>
              <p>5) I have my own personal pride. Everyone does. Would anyone like to be a garbage collector or toilet cleaner? With educational qualifications aside, I bet no one does. I feel that way too. (you get what I mean?)</p>

              <p><strong>KrU :</strong> Lol good question. 17 weeks through and I'm already beginning to see the dark side of things, and to think that I was so enthu before coming into army.

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Evangel :</strong> Supposedly, I have to finish serving my 2 years 1st, then break for studies in 2010, and then go back after studies to serve another 4 years. But the contract stated 4 yrs and 5 mths after some calculations here and there.</p>
              <p>Ah yes, the <strong>system</strong>. I actually did get the opportunity to speak with the CO and OC about this off-hand. they were telling me the system chooses the individuals based on merit, like <em>blah blah blah blah...</em>and that the system is flawless.</p>

              <p>Broaden your horizons. If you're looking for a job to work for in short term and gain some experiences, the SAF technical and logistics are great places. Not the combat side. Serve a reasonably short contract eg. 6 years and then you must leave while you're still in your 20s. Do not even think of staying as a career.</p>

              <p><strong>Evangel :</strong> Supposedly, I have to finish serving my 2 years 1st, then break for studies in 2010, and then go back after studies to serve another 4 years. But the contract stated 4 yrs and 5 mths after some calculations here and there.</p>
              <p>Ah yes, the <strong>system</strong>. I actually did get the opportunity to speak with the CO and OC about this off-hand. they were telling me the system chooses the individuals based on merit, like <em>blah blah blah blah...</em>and that the system is flawless.</p>
              <p>Well, until now, I still don't know exactly why I ended up where I am right now. All they can tell me is "Your BMT results cannot make it". I want to know exactly which part, but they wouldn't disclose to me. So maybe its the SIT Test or peer appraisal that did me in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>mamamamama :</strong> I think another thing is the batch I went in with. If I went with a poly batch, I would've stood a better chance of getting into OCS. Just heng-suay only lor.</p>
              <p>But don't be discouraged, there ARE and WILL BE diploma holders in OCS, because I have talked to officers who are, so i don't think the 3.86 matters or not LOL.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Well to start I was enlisted on the 10th of April. I am a
                  diploma in mechatronics graduate thrown in with the A level
                  batch. During BMT, I went for an AEO interview and I was one of the
                  4 who were selected of of hundred of A lvl applicants for the post.
                  At the final interview, they offered all 4 of us LSAs and I happily
                  (then) signed on the dotted line. My performance was fine, Gold for
                  IPPT and I passed every component well enough. Everything was
                  supposed to go smoothly, or I thought so.</p>
              <p> Posting order came out, and I was posted to sispec instead
                  of ocs, of course I was stunned. Though I knew the contract stated
                  that I need to make it to OCS, I don't see why I didn't make
                  it. I called up air force, and they told me my BMT results couldn't
                  make it. They said they had a leeway of picking you up from the top
                  30% instead of the usual 10%, and they said my name even wasn't in
                  the top 30%. Well, it couldn't be possible that I screwed my SIT
                  test and peer appraisal THAT bad. I personally felt the
                  only guy from my section who was posted to OCS was just "average",
                  IPPT silver and stuff, not very vocal blah blah (no offense to
                  him). I'm sure the factor was that it was because he had 5 As in
                  his A levels, and since I'm a diploma holder, no matter what my GPA
                  is, they would'nt bother. Despite having a GPA of 3.86 and a place
                  in NUS Mechanical Engineering, they passed on picking me? Well at
                  least RSAF did give me a chance, but what was CPC doing
                  seriously?</p>
              <p>So...now I'm already into my last week in BSLC, I'm no longer
                  hoping for a crossover because I don't want to give myself false
                  hope again.</p>

              <p>Not veri vocal does not mean that they are not gd leaders. Some BMT commanders might find vocal pple veri wayang and kaopeh?</p>
              <p>Peer apprisal plays a part too. Perhaps they are more well-liked than u?</p>

              <p>If you are really passionate about the army, den fight for your dream. Be the cream of BSLC and cross over. You have another chance after ASLC too.</p>
              <p>But from your response, I can feel that you are unsure. If you are truly passionate, what is a small setback to you? Pick yourself up and fight.</p>
              <p>It's a open secret that it is not advisable to sign on with a poly diploma. But since you are going on university and gunning for a LSA, why not?</p>
              <p>But you wont be able to rise thru the ranks as fast as the scholars, but u should be able to retire as a LTC at least (can someone confirm?)</p>
              <p>I think most pple here would advise you to enter unit first and see for yourself what SAF is really like.</p>
              <p>After your 2 years, and another 4 years of studies, you can still sign on your AEO. (except that no scholarship and free school fees lor)</p>
              <p>Most of my peers who signed on regretted it. They could have earned much more outside.</p>

              <p>The sad fact is SAF needs more Men than officers. Since you signed on the dotted line already, there is no turning back. A lot of people I know in the army are given empty promises of being an officer if they performed well enough. They signed on with that promise not knowing what is their posting result (OCS or SISPEC?). Not a very wise move. I guess they didnt meet the 'standard'.</p>
              <p>Take it as another life lesson. Promises that havent materalise are just empty promises.</p>

              <p><strong>Evangel :</strong> Very true! Happens in the corporate world anyways. Maybe this one hit me bad because it seemed huge, a scholarship and a potential career in 1 interview in front of 4 sirs, and of course happy on the part where I was 1 of the 4 selected to sign. (poly pride +1!!)</p>
              <p><strong>KrU : </strong>Thanks for the compliment and advice! But I doubt I can keep it up, the degradation of the english language has begun to set for me in since I entered NS. Thinking about it now, I would feel better if I DID'NT crossover into OCS, have to go through another headache on whether to sign or not LOL</p>
              <p><strong>eac :</strong> Absolutely right. I can only sign again if I get into OCS.</p>

              <p>Well thats that...I just finished my 28km route march earlier today, and I'm finally free from the bonds of sispec!</p>

              <p>It wasn't OCS for sure..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Neither was it ASLC (Thankfully)...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's CBRE =.=</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So I guess thats just it, dreams crumble away just like this. Maybe it was a sign that I shouldn't sign on with army, fate perhaps sealed the deal for me.</p>
