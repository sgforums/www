            <div class='col-md body'>Just had an interesting evening with 2 Mexican and 1 French exchange students. Over food, I was curious if they had conscription over in their countries.<br><br>In Mexico, there is conscription, but its like a "lucky draw" system. Once the males turn 18, they turn up at the recruitment center, put their hands into a box, and pick up a ball, if its black they need to serve, it its white, they don't have to serve. Both didn't enlist, but they mentioned that they think that its crazy to be in the military.<br><br>The French guy was absolutely against conscription.saying that being made to do compulsory military service is a totally Nazi kinda thing. And asked who are we kidding man...this is 2007, there ain't gonna be no wars to fight. He views people whom serve in the military to be mentally unsound.<br><br>Why am I thankful? Because I know for a fact that NS has prepared a nation that is ready to act and we know what to do when we encounter a crisis.They were not bothered by the need for a strong military force. Mexico I understand as they are door-to-door with Uncle Sam and the big guy can protect them, the French I understand because they have got the French Foreign Legion to do the dirty work for them. And their attitudes towards work is also totally different from us. I will post more tml...too darn tired now.<br><br>Cheers,<br>SpecOps87<br>Sincere Blessings To Those Whom Are Willing To Pay For The Price Of Our Freedom With Their Sweat And Blood. Salutes!</div>

Sure it's got a lot to improve upon, but without it... you won't be singing the Majullah Singapura. That is, of course, if you treasure this as your homeland. haha<br><br></div>
