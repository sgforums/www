              <p>Just bring what is in ur fieldpack cos anything else is illegal.</p>
              <p>I once heard from someone in another platoon that during field camp got someone in their platoon bring mosquito repellent spray etc and kanna sign 1 extra. Nothing that is not SAF issued can be brought out to field camp unless ur sgts say u all can.</p>

              <p>Really reminds me of my own field camp cos mine was 1st wk of Nov many yrs ago and it was also wet weather... 3-4 days rain out of 7 days, feeling just sucks when u and all ur stuff all become soaking wet and freezing cold</p>

              <p>can survive one. field camp is not as shiong in bmt as compared to combat units. </p>
              <p>and remember to dig yr shellscrape a distance away from the latrine point! that time during my field camp somebody went to pee into another person's shellscrape late at night. damn noob.</p>
              <p>after field camp u will be totally shag and yearn for a good bath back in yr tekong chalet lol. </p>

              <p>It's much easier than it sounds, seriously.</p>
              <p>I think maybe the most shiong part of your field camp will be the route march there, and then the shellscrape digging. You'll enjoy BIC even though it's quite tiring crawling all the way because it means return to coy line, lol</p>
              <p>Actually there is a lot of waiting, and just sitting around doing nothing, because there's so much to plan and do on the commanders' side, and only so many commanders to go around.</p>
              <p>You'll learn group movement and attack, and get to fire blanks. Might be fun, because I heard from some of my friends that their group 'missions' were really improvised and 'exciting'. But in my case there was too much to learn on the spot, whole section ended up cocking up every single drill and getting punished for that.</p>
              <p>There is night training i.e. night walks so on and so forth, but I think it's just an excuse for tekan when the commanders start doing funny things in the darkness like steal equipment or mislead recruits, then punish the platoon for not sticking together.</p>
              <p>In fact for my field camp I was sleeping much earlier each night as compared to back in coy line. And it varies from coy to coy, but we managed to take a 'shower' on the 4th day at Rocky Hill camp. Really helps boost your morale.</p>
              <p>All in all I really enjoyed my field camp, actually. But it will be a different story if it rains, so do pray that it doesn't rain during your field camp.</p>
