This is in line with the United NationsÂ’ (UN) plan for full handover of defence responsibility to the independent nation in May 2004. Army News brings you the complete story to on SAFÂ’s mission in support of Timor-Leste.<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/armynews/fireworks/birth_r1_c1.gif"><br>30 August 1999<br>In a UN-sponsored referendum, 78.5% of the population of East Timor (now Timor-Leste) voted to separate from Indonesia.<br><br>Days following 30 August 1999<br>In retaliation, soldiers and militia destroyed towns and killed civilians in East Timor.<br><br>15 September 1999<br>The United Nations Security Council approved the establishment of a multinational force to restore peace and security in East Timor. Known as the International Force in East Timor, INTEFET was led by Australia.<br><br>25 October 1999<br>The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution establishing the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor, or UNTAET, which had a wider mandate than INTERFET.<br><br>20 May 2002<br>Nationhood was declared and East Timor was renamed Timor-Leste. The nationÂ’s first president is Mr Xanana GusmÃ£o.<br></div>

They are gentle, innocent people, ever so ready to wave and smile to strangers. Simplicity is perhaps the beauty of this land, the people and their way of life.<br><br>The land, people and way of life in Timor-Leste are worth protecting. Our SAF peacekeepers recognised this and have dedicated their time and effort to this cause.<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/armynews/fireworks/purpose_r1_c1.gif">The SAF peacekeepers carried out the mandate passed by the UN Security Council Resolution:<br><br>1. To provide assistance to core administrative structures critical to the viability and political stability of Timor-Leste.<br><br>2. To provide interim law enforcement and public security and to assist in the development of a new law enforcement agency in Timor-Leste.<br><br>3. To contribute to the maintenance of the external and internal security of Timor-Leste.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/armynews/fireworks/threat_r2_c1.jpg">The SAF peacekeepers are exposed to constant security challenges and threats in Timor-Leste. Internal security has always been a serious concern. Civil unrest and riots such as that in Dili in December 2002 continue to threaten the stability of the country.<br><br>External threats to the stability of Timor-Leste are also a cause for concern. The peacekeepers need to be vigilant, cautious and pro-active at all times as they face very real threats posed by ex-militia elements and terrorism.<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/armynews/fireworks/achievement_r2_c1.jpg">Over the past four years, our SAF peacekeepers have made significant contributions to Timor-Leste. The most obvious is the constant maintenance of peace and stability in the patrol areas. For example, the Singapore Company Task Force clocked up more than 6000 hours of successful patrols from March to October 2003.<br><br>Also noteworthy are is the first-class medical care provided by the SAF Medical Team and the smooth and efficient functioning of the SAF LST and helicopter detachments that had provided support to the various UN operations in Timor-Leste.<br><br>Our peacekeepers, including MG Tan Huck Gim who served as Force Commander of UNMISET from August 2002 to August 2003, made notable contributions at the Peacekeeping Forces (PKF) HQ. MG Tan oversaw the continuous tactical and operational improvements within PKF and the development of capacities of the local defence forces to ensure a sustainable security environment in Timor-Leste.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/armynews/fireworks/achievement_r6_c1.jpg">Our peacekeepers also contributed to Timor-Leste over and above their primary responsibilities of maintaining peace and providing support to the UN operation. Here are a few examples of the additional contributions by SAF personnel that have made differences to the lives of the Timorese:<br><br>1. The SAF Medical Team organised medical workshops for the local health staff in hospitals and provided microscopes to clinics to help build the healthcare services and facilities in Timor-Leste.<br><br>2. The SAF Medical Team also did a study of birth complications in Timor-Leste and subsequently developed a life-saving package for Timorese midwives and traditional birth attendants. This package proved to be so effective that it is being considered by the UN for use as the basis of a national intervention strategy.<br><br>3. Our peacekeepers conducted classes to teach English to Timorese children in schools.<br><br>4. Our peacekeepers also donated and installed water pumps in villages so that locals can easily collect water.<br></div>
