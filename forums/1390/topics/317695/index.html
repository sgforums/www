            <div class='col-md body'><p>hey guys, i'm having the interview soon. I would greatly appreciate anyone's help for the interview. Those who went thr caould you kindly share the qns, what to expect/ what to prepare. Flying has been my ambition since young like everyone of you guys here. So kindly help me as much as possible. It will be greatly grealy appreciated. Anyway, just wanna ask what if i can't make it to OCS? does it really means the end? i'm not really the wayang type in BMTC. not really a REC the surg always mention and talk abt. I have seen many types of ppl going OCS- from slackers to average ppl in BMTC to wayang ppl. SO how do they actually choose? For me, it seems like a good A lvl results is a 70% confirmation alrdy. shld i mention to my pc abt my pilot stuff and ask for his advice? Anyway i think is hard for me to go OCS. Does that mean it's my end of my pilot intake selection? Thanks guys</p></div>

              <p>if your passion is in the SAF. Military aviation. Warfare...then airforce la. SIA can wait til after retirement. for the interview, just be yourself. they will sure ask you about your passion for flying and what have you done with it. as long as you are passionate and honest, you'll make it. the interview is not hard. they are nasty, but just tolerate. as for ocs and all...its really see how la. from some ppl say, as long as u are socially sound, ippt pass/silver (contradictory theories), bmt don't cock up, den they will close one eye and take you into airwing. well according to pilot&amp;cdo, a black knight told him that the rsaf have under-table means of getting ppl into ocs. so yeah...don't worry yet la. clear your medical and all first. go bmt, then u worry abt ocs. you are still in j2 right?</p>
              <p>ya i was told that its good to let ur pc know cuz he will look out for you and stuff. what tt means? i'm not clear. but a pilot fren of mine told me the pc will ask anyway, and then just let him know lor. and he said 6 ppl from his bunk applied for rsaf and all 6 got into ocs. yup...rsaf also increasing fleet la. more f-15s, 6 seahawks, 4 new AWACS, and even maybe more apaches? who knows? and one a/c is used by many many people lor. not one man one plane like USofA. haha! well, what is meant to be will be. you'll feel much better. most imptly is take good care of yr health. =) all the best!</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Thanks eac, del_co. i'm currently in bmtc 2 (april batch). my sis test is like nxt week. because i don't wayang in coy at all don't really rush ppl or wat although i help my friends. generally i'm just quiet. i was thinking shld i really wayang? But i do perform well in my coy like ippt gold, shooting was good 30/32 although not best shoot. I just like don't wayang cause i really think platoon mates will dislike you. Anyway, my pc was telling us that he doesn't really care abt wayang anot, he just write wat he sees. I just feel damn diff and uneasy if i try to wayang or show leadership. Personally i am quite a slacker in coy. recently just got caught for doing some stupid stuff with my friends by pc. gave us guard duty on vesak day. damn. i'm starting to think chances of getting to ocs is slim. i heard from most that pc words are the final call. like has the most weightage. All my surg was saying u guys think the oc/pc are dumb? they can spot who's wayang who's not. But my pc kept kept saying it doesn't matter. Anyway, my pop is like ard a mth from now and RSAF haven't confirm my interview date yet. they say they will call my coy line, told me not to be worry. My friends were saying that the ppl who score better for the test get the first few interview. Is it true? Anyway, delco are u flying for RSAF alrdy?</p></div>
