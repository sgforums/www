However, if you want to break an arm, for eg, there are better ways to do it than trying to do it from an arm lock position. Eg.

Found it damn dumb and i asked the instructor why. He told me that is supposed to allow the student to learn more about the lock, rather than defending himself.<br><br>As i progressed furthur, it started to get more dynamic. They emphasise alot on blending into the attack. Meaning standing there to catch the fellas wrist would basicly get you killed. You have to start moving to into the person's attack and subdue him without any contact from the opponent.<br><br>In many of the cases you will have to utilise the opponent's momentum when he attacks to subdue him and thats the point of time where aikido gets very useful.<br><br>Ok...i can't really describe all those techniques in words but it is really not  as static as you think it is.<br><br>Now you were comparing other martial arts with aikido....which imo, is not exactly fair. Every martial arts have their strength and weakness. For example, judo and jujitsu, they are better developed in ground grappling as compared to aikido in fact...the moment the aikidoka is on the ground, most of the locks wun work anyway.<br><br>But on the otherhand, aikido is very good when it comes to conservation of strength. You perform maximum damage with minimum effort.<br><br>So basicly with different martial arts, there comes different SOPs. It depends on how well you want to take them.<br><br>Now i dun really agree with your last sentence though, i believe that depending on the training and circumstances, any one with a good martial arts background would be able to access and get themselves in a more favourable situation during a combat situation.It is just a matter on how skilled you are. There is no such thing as who does it better. There is only such thing as whether you get yourself alive that matters.<br><br>But as far as i am concerned in this topic, aikido, judo and jujitsu really itsn't the best martial art for a conscript army. All of them take too long to master.<br>I am not sure about krav magar *spelling* but if it really works for the israeli army, then i guess it should work for our's too.</div>

Soldiers now also dun learn unarmed combat which was v based on tkd last time.Now, they learn close combat.It is a mixture of many martial arts and has been modified to simple techniques to cater the needs of SAF.Many sae that its v 'wayang'. However, some of its techniques are actually quite useful. Like two hand choke, i saw it is almost the same found in other martial arts too. At least, u got learn something is better than none.If the real danger happens to you and without any training, i doubt anyone knoes wat to do. They always sae the most simple technique is the most effective. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I still think aikido is more suitable for the law enforcement units than military. Mainly, the police need the 'Control &amp; Restraint' to arrest the criminals. However, the military need more aggressive martial arts to kill not arrest. Also, in the battlefield, it is very rare cases for u to abandon yr rifle. U would rather use yr rifle to whack the enemy rather than go n lock him rite. In SAF, they included the locks in CCT due to the need to perform duties at airport  n etc..Not due to combat needs. One more impt thing, even we teach the soldiers Krav maga also no use.They may have the reaction or speed.But they wont have the power or impact to take the opponent down.Why!!!Cos due to SAF TSR and safety. To toughen up your punches, u need to train up yr wrist and knuckles. If u dont and have a weak wrist, most likely u will get injured and sprained yr wrist. Best way to condition it is to do knuckle pushups and more.. which many are not allowed in SAF. In SAf, many things muz follow the book and follow lesson plans.How to train like that?</div>
