            <div class='col-md body'>I thought we already mentioned about the SAF unarmed combat many times before in this forum.Why repeated it again?Anyway, if u ask for  jiu jitsu/judo or aikido, they are all the ground fights or throws that u all have learnt in ICCT(intermediate close combat) or ACCT (Advance close combat). It is just that they are the simplified ones to make it easier for the men to master. For TKD, u only learn it during BCCT in bmt.But also, it is v simple ones that is about white to yellow belt level only. The skill level of TKD in singapore is not very high too.It is more like a sport(Olympic TKD) than martial arts compare to TKD in korea.SAF dont realli have the time to train the men into gongfu masters.Like I sae before, the main objective of SAF unarmed combat is that the men are able to fight back bare handed instead of kanna whacked, but not definitely will win. U all argued about the kinda martial arts suitable for SAF is pointless. Cos NSF in the units do not have the enough time to master them well. SAF dont treat unarmed combat seriously also.</div>

Punches and kicks!!All the camps got sandbags rite?Or u expect the UCIs to ask all the 100 men to line up in a straight row and one by one to kick or punch a sandbag.Then it is up to u to go n train on the sandbag yrself. If u can master yr turning kick or 1 punch can ko pple then it is enough liao. The instructors have already taught u the techniques.It is up to you to go n try it out and train up.U muz have self training on yr own.Like studying, the teachers can only teach u, but u have to rely on yrself to study and improve also ma. Even the instructors teach the u best techniques also no use, cos u nv go n practice or train it up.</div>

Their jobs are often dangerous and need proper and professional kinda training.SAF could spend the money to employ professonal instructors from outside just to teach them. But for the normal combat units, do u know how many men are there?If the instructor charge SAF $60 a month for each person, u know how large the sum of money or expenses is to SAF. Do u knoe y all the UCIs are all tkd trained n not other martial arts.Cos tkd is the most common practiced martial arts in spore.So SAF will just trained these pple up who are black belters in tkd with unarmed combat to teach the combat units. This means kinda 'free labour' for the SAF and it can save alot of money. How do u expect SAF to find so many krav maga or aikido instructors to teach so many units?Train the UCIs with aikido or krav maga then ask them go n teach?Impossible.Training takes time.To be gd, they need at least 1 to 2 yrs of training.By that time, ORD lor!!How to teach?</div>

Its just not the time, but also the money.SAF wont spend so much money on the NSFs. Y ADF, Gurkhas or SOF get to learn aikido, krav maga or even karate?It is v simple.Cos they r the elites,regulars and their numbers r not so huge. Their jobs are often dangerous and need proper and professional kinda training.SAF could spend the money to employ professonal instructors from outside just to teach them. But for the normal combat units, do u know how many men are there?If the instructor charge SAF $60 a month for each person, u know how large the sum of money or expenses is to SAF. Do u knoe y all the UCIs are all tkd trained n not other martial arts.Cos tkd is the most common practiced martial arts in spore.So SAF will just trained these pple up who are black belters in tkd with unarmed combat to teach the combat units. This means kinda 'free labour' for the SAF and it can save alot of money. How do u expect SAF to find so many krav maga or aikido instructors to teach so many units?Train the UCIs with aikido or krav maga then ask them go n teach?Impossible.Training takes time.To be gd, they need at least 1 to 2 yrs of training.By that time, ORD lor!!How to teach?</div></blockquote>Aikido... no aikido... in that i agree with you. Have the people who are recc aikido actually practising aikido themselves? Or is it just something they 'heard'.<br><br>Aikido has no place in the military because:<br><br>1) It's principles haven't really been proven. Where Aikido have been practiced by a public services group, it is usually that of the 'harder' variety, and that means it is very close to Jap Jiu Jitsu. So why not just go for JJJ?<br><br>2) Even  if it is conceded that its principles really do work, it will take a very very long time for anyone to be proficient at the art. This is admitted by Morihei Ueshiba himself.<br><br></div>

All these techniques r easy and v effective.Even krav maga uses them also.Somemore u are wearing boots leh.Imagine one kick to yr opponent!!Even though U anyhow kick also nvm.U knoe how painful it is or not.Dun believe, u can try on your army friend next time.C whether can bring him down.In martial arts, u must b flexible. The kinda tkd u always learn in singapore which is restricted to kicking the body or head onli is known as the sport tkd.But martial art TKD is totally diff.It emphasises on punching also.I knoe some very gd old tkd fighters that can ko pple using punches onli too.But ,they belong to the older generation from gay world last time.Cos they treat TKD as martial arts not sport.Some of them were even champions in all style martial arts championships last time. Due to political problems in spore tkd now, the standard of tkd is not what it used to be.</div>

I know that you can kick anywhere I want in a real fight.  But the fact of the matter is, try to twist your body into a side kick position with all the gear on, and you will realize 1) the weight slows you down, and 2) the weight causes a lot of stress on your joints ~ increasing the odds of you spraining a joint or two.</div>

Black belt so?Black belt is only the starting of TKD.To b a master of tkd, you need to be at least 5 dan and above.Somemore, it is battle proven by the koreans during the both korea and vietnam wars.Go read this forum http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=157576</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMO, whether TKD or jyujutsu or aikido or taiji. the training has to be frequent enough for it to really be useful. something like 1-2 hours a day, everyday.<br><br>otherwise, your grunts would just return to punching and kicking each other like your typical ah beng.</div>
