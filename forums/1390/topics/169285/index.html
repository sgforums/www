You will be posting in on next Monday, and will be going through a 12 weeks course, it's like another BMT, with live firings, route marches and defence exercise (i.e. trench digging). It is NOT a 8 to 5 job, but a shift work. You will take combat pay.<br><br>In PLAB, it's not quite like standing at SFT/TFT. Trust me, you will have lots of experience, learn lots of things and yar, you will do things more than just standing gates.<br><br>Once you graduate from course, you will know. Best of luck.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
