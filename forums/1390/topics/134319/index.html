The 30-rds m16 mag was a "improvisation" and do not fit well into the rifle. the loose attachment makes feeding very poor.<br><br>2. Feeding is poor because blanks are wedged into the chamber and cut by the bolt, thus creating a "double feeding"-like IA.<br><br>3. Very often blank attachment is not screwed to maximum tightness, this lead to gas escaping and thus not creating enough blowback for the rifle's action cycle to complete.<br><br>4. Poor maintenance by operators, partly due to lack of exposure to the weapon by their superiors themselves, leading to many people unfamiliar with the weapon.<br><br>During live-firing, SAW fires reliably with most IA caused by magazine attachment issues.</div></blockquote>The SAW was on trial with the Marines and NavSpecWar in 1986.That would place the model to be either the Mk 1 or the Mk 2.<br><br>Current model in usage is the Mk3A.The removable barrel did solve a lot of problems with overheating and carbon foulup,which was hard to clean initially.<br><br>Many operators broke their butts and general problems faced by operators included worn out sears and bipod legs being jammed and unable to retract.</div>
