In terms of battle field scenario... each could possibly be a winner depending on the person himself. Doesn't mean because he's SAFOS so he's got all the brains and the analytical skill set to win a war game. And doesn't mean a farmer has the perfect ability to micro-manage and use tons of field experience to pwn the safos dude.<br><br>it really depends, and in SAF there are stories to attest to the ability of each grp of officers, both scholars and farmers. In my short time in conscription, i've met both kinds... and i feel strongly there should not be such inherent bias... both have their good and (very) bad points.<br><br>however, i agree SAF should level the playing field and let poly students have a more decent chance to get SAFOS.

And by decent I would mean a very good COM for dip holders and at least scoring 4As for A levels. Having S papers ( old system) was even a bench mark in the giving out of these awards as there are many people vying for the scholarship.</div>
