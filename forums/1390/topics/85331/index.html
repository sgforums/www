            <div class='col-md body'>i would like some clarification about combat vocations available to pes c nsf<br><br>i am recently downgraded by the medical board. my pes status is c2l2 for 3 months. my current vocation is m113 driver.<br><br>i would like to know if my new pes status will require me to acquire a new vocation, or if i could still continue as a driver.<br><br>my csm is in a dilemma about what to do with me. firstly he cannot post me out because of my short downgrade period and also because there is a lack of drivers in my company. however, i am eager to get out of this horrible vocation. can my csm force me to continue as a combat driver regardless of my pes status? or is he prohibited from doing so according to the policies of the saf.<br><br>i am also wondering about the reason what i am given such a short downgrade period. i am currently suffering from severe flat feet and this condition has been present since i was very young. i believe such a condition is permanent and cannot be corrected unless surgery has been performed. so why am i given a temporary downgrade only?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>i would like to know if my new pes status will require me to acquire a new vocation, or if i could still continue as a driver.</blockquote>I doubt the SAF will re-train you again, unless the system's undergone a complete policy makeover since my time. It involves just too much coordination/logistics to underwrite for such infrequent casualties. My guess is you'll get redeployed elsewhere within the same unit, subject to vacancy (CQ, mess boy, et al). That way, you're nobody else's "problem" since you don't have to be posted out.<br><br>That's what happened to my Arty mate, also a M113 driver. He ended up following the rations truck - not as switched-off as you think - all the way through reservist service. [BTW In reservist, a downgraded soldier won't even get redeployed, internally or kicked out, unless he's really a hard-up case; the most they'll do is excuse you from IPPT &amp; formal parades &amp; stuff. That's my experience, anyway.]<br><br><blockquote>"can my csm force me to continue as a combat driver regardless of my pes status? or is he prohibited from doing so according to the policies of the saf."</blockquote>No, it's outside of his control, since the downgrade is done by MMI. Talk to your BC or PC, once your medical center has validated your new reclassification.<br><br><blockquote>"why am i given a temporary downgrade only?"</blockquote>No idea; flat feet are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, I guess. It could be 6 or 9 months next time round. Maybe your MO can explain the diagnosis, once he's able to read your new medical docket.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wow, u seem to be very clear about the way saf works moxie. i doubt that my pc has the same amount of knowledge as u do; he seems to give the impression that i am obliged to continue as a m113 driver, just that i will be excused from all physical activities. i have asked my csm twice about what appointment i would be holding, but he said that he doesnt know where to place me, so my problem is left hanging in the air.<br><br>i am also not very clear about what my rights are. i believe that my l2 status prevents me from participating in combat activities, but if my superiors command me to drive the m113, do i have the right to refuse them?<br><br>the situation is dire because we are moving outfield tomorrow! and yet, no one has bothered to clarify what i would be doing.. sigh, if my downgrade has a length of six months, i will definitely be posted out, my csm says. just my luck..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>'Afraid I can't help you further, bro. The obvious thing is not to blow matters up detrimentally, though the options are there: eg. bypass the change of command to seek a meeting with the CO or, if you really wanna create repercussions, get your Member of Parliament to write a letter on your behalf (expect your immediate superiors to get reprimanded by divisional higher-ups as a result).<br><br>Best if you &amp; the PC/CSM try to resolve it among yourselves. One way for you would be to report sick after each (unwilling) field-exercice participation, so that the MO - nee the "Attend B" chits - would be legally &amp; morally on your side. Might as well get the system to work for you, since you're not keng-ing anyway. See who blinks 1st, at unless until your next Medical Board.<br><br>In the longer run, I'm not sure they can post you out; the system is such that they're obliged to retain you in some capacity as much as possible. But, since you're primarily the unit's responsibility, they could send you to a <strong>conversion course</strong> if they take the initiative. But the idea of <strong>re-course</strong>, i.e. kick you out &amp; let another neutral-middleman outfit find you another "job", I dunno how prevalent or feasible it is - unless some kind of lobo appointment is conveniently available &amp; ad-hoc arrangements can be made. It's more likely they'll attempt the latter approach within your own unit.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh well, my csm has decided to keep me as a driver. this totally sucks. i wondered if he has the right to do it, so i approached the MO. to my disappointment, he said i can continue as my medical condition doesnt really affect my role as a driver.<br><br>that's true in a way. a driver doesn't really need to run about except during the timed drills when we need to run here and there, or during simulated vehicle breakdowns, when we need to route march. what i really dont like is the moving up and down the vehicle, which involves a lot of jumping. when they punish us by making us run, i really dont know whether i have the right to refuse doing it.<br><br>i wonder how i can make my case valid to the MO. my medic advises me to ask my specialist to write another letter to MO, saying how it affects me, but i'm afraid it will be a bit lame.<br><br>If i miss too many outfield training, maybe they will see the light and let me change vocation. right now, i have missed section vehicle training and live firing due to eye infection.<br><br>it's amazing how army can change one's thinking. i never liked sore eyes (i doubt anyone does) because it's painful and disgusting, but in the face of prolonged outfield training i have now, this ailement seems heaven-sent. sigh..<br><br></div>

I suppose you can also (legitimately) report sick during a field exercise, but you'd better forewarned your CSM or MTO about generally preparing a relief driver just in case, or risk being branded a sabo king if you left them shorthanded. Not advisable to refuse complying with an issued order; that's a chargeable offence &amp;, no matter how unjust you feel, attempting a Chee Soon Juan-style martyring stunt is, basically, burning bridges with superiors you're gonna otherwise work with for a while.</div>
