You either got to do your job damn well that you shine among your peers, or you can be a F*ed-up-soldier-who-dunno-your-own-job but you have the right connections and know how to PR with key people within the top management..

              <p><br>well.. those extra things I talked about, helps when everyone among you seems to be scoring as well as you are on the score system.. imagine you get Gold yearly, your job skills are good, your BMI is perfect, BUT when everyone of your peers are getting the same, how the management is going to remember? In other words, you are just as "average" as your peers are (because all you all are so damn good on the score system).</p>
              <p>I have seen real-life examples of people who are not-so-good on their job and still manage to shine among the management. It's a dog-eat-dog world out there, same goes for the army too.. We all have to accept it..</p>

BTW only SAFOS or President's Scholars are considered scholars in the army. The top brass does not recognise award holders like SMS as scholars. If you don't believe, you can ask someone who's above the rank of Maj. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p></div>

              <p>If you are worried about the 45 limit thing, it is not a problem to find a job in sg. The real problem is the lifestyle you get acustom to during your sign on years, it is not just a pay cut you need to deal with, it is lifestyle change also.</p>
              <p>That is why alot of regulars (farmer ocifer, lao encik) end up selling away their condos and buy HDB and end up with jobs like driving taxi, sell insurance because chances are, they might end up working for people they tekan in the service, seriously think, u really want to work under a ginna u tekan?</p>
              <p>And do realise that army experience is NOT work experience. Work experience encompasses your tech skills and networking circle and more. Your value when u ORD at 45 is just the same as a fresh grad at 26. The worst part is, they can work for less, can you?</p>
              <p>Seriously think, it is not just 10-20 years, it is a whole life thing. I know it may be hard to comprehend why must 20 year old need to think so far into his 40s but believe me, u must, I was lucky enough to work in unit that oversees NS units and u get alot of weird stares why a soldier is saluting a comfort taxi because a Major is driving it...and he is paiseh to park his car in the NS lot because his chow keng LCP clerk drives a BMW 5 series (even the NS CO drives a nissan sunny sia). They say ocifer very glam but come to reservist, even a chow LCP can sia suay them easily.</p>

              <p>Oh i just googled it seem like its become a private forum. it was the premier forum for industry gossip for every industry and got a lot of juicy info cos insiders always leak out there one. It had pretty good info on local grad farmers. Its awfully obvious from the above that you're using SAF as a shelter cos you beh kan. Pls dun waste taxpayers' $$$. Plus, you will definitely end up like one of these sorrowful jealous ranters who now need to use forum as <strong>support group</strong> to mutually affirm each other of their jealousies- therapy on the cheap they say. Worst case may end up in <strong>IMH.</strong></p>
