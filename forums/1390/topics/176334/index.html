            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Quirinus:<br><strong>As every person who's gone through Basic Military Training at BMTC Tekong knows, enlistees are asked to complete an Express Interest (EI) Survey that asks them whether they would or would not like to be a commander during their period in National Service.<br><br>OCs and PCs in BMT have often been reported to have persuaded (sometimes quite forcefully) their recruits to select "Yes" to be a commander. At times, PCs and OCs may use peer pressure to get recruits to select "Yes". On other occasions, officers may even use near-intimidation by asking all who intend to select "No" to see them repeatedly until they are assured the answer will be "Yes".<br><br>My question is:<br>[b]Is this Ethical? Are BMT commanders keeping their recruit's welfare and wellbeing in mind when they do this?</strong><br><br>I ask this because now that I'm in a command school, I've come across a few trainees who SHOULD have and WANTED to select "No" but didn't do so because of similar persuasion. These trainees suffer more than the rest of us and most eventually find ways to OOC anyway.<br><br>What is the highest rank an NSF specialist can be promoted to? Some people said it is second sergeant n first sergeant.<br><br><strong>What are your views on this?</strong>[/b]</blockquote></div>
