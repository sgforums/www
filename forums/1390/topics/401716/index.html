              <p>Hey,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I just started work at my new camp (fresh out of BMT) as a clerk and I have been told that I am earmarked for an overseas posting that could be as long as 9 months or 1 year.  I don't know where I'm going yet (my superiors have no idea either) but I've been told that I'm supposed to learn the ropes of being a clerk for a few months before going overseas.</p>
              <p>I really really don't want to go and my parents are also against it. I am in PES C9 and need to see my doctor very regularly (like at least once a month) to manage my condition and modify my medication. I am told that I need to go for an FFI - would it be significant in determining whether I go or not? What should I do?</p>
              <p>Is there anyone else who has been in this situation before? Or anyone who knows someone whose been in this situation before. The little I've read on other forums about this suggests that if you really really don't want to go there may be options for you? Any help would be very very appreciated. I am a bit desperate right now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>I think they wanna to let him try but since he's OOC from BMT, the MO should refer him to a specialist board if they cannot decide whether they wanna to downgrade him to E or not. Furthermore he not fit to go back to BMT.</p>
