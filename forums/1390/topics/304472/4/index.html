              <p>lol. its what makes NS fun!</p>
              <p>honestly, i guess it differs from person to person. if you're that easily affected by another man's language, that shows you how insecure or weak you are as a person. how do you survive in the world if you can't even tolerate this minor issue?</p>
              <p>my platoon, we used to giggle and laugh when our cwo started
                          swearing at us. "chao chee bye la! you think you all very lao jiao
                          issit? laugh somemore! stand still la! i make you lie down on the
                          parade square and roll from one end to the other end then you know!!"</p>
              <p>but
                          i did notice that my standard of english did decline slightly after i
                          orded. took me some time to pick up proper english again. still picking
                          up the pieces. but, on the upside of it, i learned basic malay! which
                          proved entertaining and useful!</p>
              <p>and if you're really disagreeable to vulgarities, i think its double standard to start name calling at others. using degrading terms like " neanderthal", or "ilk".</p>
              <p>you may not use the word "fuck", but your words have the intention to hurt others, so what's the difference between you and those crude people whom you detest? no difference at all, except that you use prettier words.</p>
              <p> as a matter of fact, you're even worse than them. at least they don't dress up in a robe of hypocrisy and act holier than the next man and point fingers at their faults and think that they're better than them.</p>

              <p>Oh read from page 3 onwards,where she can't follow simple English statements. Can't tell the difference between "combatant's job" and "after a combatant", can't follow simple statements I made that she plainly admitted that the Bumi policy is not feasible. I used the word "admitted" and "bumi policy not feasible" and she still can't get that I said she was referring to the bumi policy as not tenable. How much simpler can plain English be? And I told her Pakistan and North Korea can withstand world pressure to disarm because of their powerful military and she can't understand that either. She stated fighting with the guys from page 2 onwards. You can discount page 1. This dumb broad can't seem to understand simple plain English, think she should get a 100% refund for her stupid liberal local arts degree.</p>

              <p>My husband is in the army and he is an officer and a gentleman. I've not heard him use profanities before, though I am not sure if he uses it at work.</p>
              <p>Honestly, the use of profanity has no correlation with the effectiveness of the commander nor indicative of the respect given to his men. An army commander may choose to refrain from profanities yet motivate and lead his men effectively, over and beyond another who does. Also, a commander may not use profanities yet show his men even less respect than another who does. Like rooki here as dumbdumb! rightly pointed out, she claims to fight for values like respect for humanity and assumes a moral ground against military violence, yet she exhibits more crassness and judgmentalism in her views and things she says about other people. </p>
              <p>I fully agree with Edwin that respect has to be earned,and one should not assume he should be respected by virture of being human. As we can see, there are lots of detestable humans around, like rooki, so being human is hardly sufficient criteria for respect heehee!</p>
              <p>And this rooki person, errr other than her highly questionable intelligence in comprehending simple language after she has the gall to say Singapore guys have "their brains and language faculties wrecked by NS", it's obvious that she doesn't have friends to talk to.</p>
              <p>Malaysia's crime plagues are such common talking points among Singapore because we're such close neighbours and so many of the citizens of both countries visit the other. People discuss this all the time here and it's so bad that international reporters from BBC, TIME and FT write about it (not just straits times) and there's even Malaysian crime internet forums and blogs, it's common knowledge....she actually says SG's crime situation is like M'sia and PAP kool-aid...hahaha.. doesn't she have friends to talk to? Guess not. Heehee!!!</p>

              <p>To sum the on the current crime rate, I think it is best to describe
                      from last year’s statistics of 588 murder cases and 3,177 rape cases
                      that;</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Every day, more than one person was murdered </strong></span>(1.6 per day)</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Every day, more than eight women were raped </strong></span>(8.7 per day)</p>
              <p>statistics released by the PDRM show that Malaysia had more than 125,000 cases of "hard" crime in 2002 alone. This figure has not declined over the past two years.</p>

              <p>The only reason I brought up bumi was that many Singaporeans seem to have a genetic aversion to it. It will never stay in place for long, and so it can be discounted as a factor against unification. Without bumi, unification is much more palatable.</p>
              <p>God, take off all your freaking blinders already. 'Malaysia high in crime?' Get real. Go live in Malaysia and stop swallowing propaganda/biased reports. The Singapore government are just loving you all for your ignorance and manipulativity. And it's not like Singapore is entirely crime free.</p>
              <p>Dumbdumb, please tell me English is a foreign language to you, if you think 'ilk' is a profanity.</p>
              <p>Allright. You say<em> </em><strong><em>Pakistan and North Korea can withstand world pressure to disarm
                                      because of their powerful military.</em> </strong>Does Singapore aspire to be like them? If so, well...I really have nothing more to say to you. A powerful military is a flagrant waste of resources, as the starving NKeans have shown. What, you think all aid is channeled to Kim's Neverland?</p>

              <p>Good that you're happily married to your viet wife cookie. I understand many men fail to get local brides and resort to arranged marriages as a last resort. But please try not to be so insecure next time, ok? Repeating the phrase that foreigners are good for you like a broken record just seems like you're trying to delude yourself. <strong>Face it, Singaporean men cannot even hold a candle to the worst of foreign men. You can change this, however, by not swallowing everything the almighty government tells you to, including the lie that NS is 'good'.</strong></p>

              <p>i'm not talking about the language used. but rather the intention of using a particular word.</p>
              <p>words like "fucker" is from the english word too, but like you said, its a degrading term thus not respecting the party whom you intended the word on. i think the more important point is what you intend to use with the word, and not the word itself, as pointed out by some sgforumer</p>
              <p>"chee bye" is a word from the hokkien language. is the hokkien language of lesser class than english? not to me. its just another language, who's to say that english is of higher class than hokkien. a polite gentleman who speaks in hokkien is of higher class than a crude drunk who is sprewing english profanity.</p>
              <p>in the end, you're just like the neanderthals you despise. except you use prettier words.</p>

              <p>Wow...just wow.</p>
              <p>The only reason I brought up bumi was that many Singaporeans
              seem to have a genetic aversion to it. It will never stay in place
              for long, and so it can be discounted as a factor against
              unification. Without bumi, unification is much more palatable.</p>
              <p>God, take off all your freaking blinders already. 'Malaysia high
              in crime?' Get real. Go live in Malaysia and stop swallowing
              propaganda/biased reports. The Singapore government are just loving
              you all for your ignorance and manipulativity. And it's not like
              Singapore is entirely crime free.</p>
              <p>Dumbdumb, please tell me English is a foreign language to you,
              if you think 'ilk' is a profanity.</p>
              <p>Allright. You say <strong><em>Pakistan and North Korea can
              withstand world pressure to disarm because of their powerful
              military.</em></strong> Does Singapore aspire to be like them? If
              so, well...I really have nothing more to say to you. A powerful
              military is a flagrant waste of resources, as the starving NKeans
              have shown. What, you think all aid is channeled to Kim's
              Neverland?</p>
              <p><strong>Why the hell can't countries accede to each other
              peacefully? Why must they act like complete buffoons parading their
              military tin toys in front of each other, as if they're in some
              kind of playground arguing over who's having the biggest
              stick?</strong></p>
              <p>Good that you're happily married to your viet wife cookie. I
              understand many men fail to get local brides and resort to arranged
              marriages as a last resort. But please try not to be so insecure
              next time, ok? Repeating the phrase that foreigners are good for
              you like a broken record just seems like you're trying to delude
              yourself. <strong>Face it, Singaporean men cannot even hold a
              candle to the worst of foreign men. You can change this, however,
              by not swallowing everything the almighty government tells you to,
              including the lie that NS is 'good'.</strong></p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Categorically;</p>
              <p>1) Singaporeans have an aversion to the bumiputera policy because we are living proof that it doesn't work. Some smart Malaysians realise that as well, and come over to Singapore. Being smart, they actually run and have run some of our biggest companies like SIA. They would never have had such a chance if they stayed in Malaysia.</p>
              <p>2) Neither Singapore nor Malaysia is crime free, and Malaysia, having a higher population, would definitely have a greater number of crimes, all things being equal. Having no idea what the crime rate relative to the population is, I say both sides give this a rest, unless they have hard numbers to quote.</p>
              <p>3) The point dumbdumb was making (and I have been making since the start of this thread) is that words by themselves do not hurt. It is the context in which they are used that hurt people. Thus, vulgarities in and of themselves are not degrading--I have shown that they can bond people. Your little flamewar with cookiecookie, even though it doesn't contain any vulgarity on your part, was still insulting.</p>
              <p>4) Again, you miss the point. which is that the political leaders of those nations are able to achieve their political goals because of the military. Regardless of the political system or the morality of the goal, you have to admit that the military is the ultimate guarantor of their political power. Looking at it on the flip side, we enjoy Pax Americana today because of the military power of the USA--this peace has allowed both Malaysia and Singapore to thrive and prosper.</p>
              <p>5) As I said, read your history. Or your biology. It is so improbable as to be impossible that all sides will lay down their arms. Simple logic will tell you that a situation where everybody does not have weapons is highly unstable; in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. So it is with weapons as well. And your description of toys on the playground is a vast oversimplification. Your arguments here have shown that you are not stupid, so go do some reading!</p>
              <p>6) Again, a personal attack and oversimplification that is beneath ALL OF US. This is a very interesting discussion that has transcended the original topic. Let's keep it civil. Also, if you feel that the best that Singapore can offer is worse than the worst that the rest of the world offers, you either have to travel around Singapore or the world more. :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To keep it on topic, Short Ninja makes a good point about the difference between combat and other vocations in the army, and the applicability of vulgarity in each instance. And so it is with all situations. The use of vulgarity, like the use of humour, is situational. Using it when the time is right can greatly enhance the effect of your message. Unless someone can justify that the use of vulgarity is never justified, I would say you have lost the argument.</p>

Sorry fat ass, my wife is very Singaporean, and i wouldn't have it any other way! Short ninja, you're so right. This M'sian sow is frustrated she didn't place herself in the fateful M'sian gang rape crime scenes, and is in Singapore selling her soul working her ass off here cos our country pays her double the wages of her hometown, she dreams and wishes that Singapore has many rapes as M'sia so perhaps she could finally get some.</p>

              <p>Look, none of that is relevant unless you can come up with meaningful numbers, i.e. murders or rapes or robberies relative to population size. If  a country has a population of 10 million, and 10 murders a year, versus a country of population 100 million, with 50 murders a year, the country with more murders is still safer, even though the absolute number of murders is higher! Do you get what I mean?</p>

              <p>This is not for you Edwin, it's to display the brutal truth to the Msian fatty who wishes she had some by the rapists at home, reports that make her blood boil. The truth hurts and she can't handle it!!!</p>
              <p>And i love to show it cos I know every word, every punctuation, every inspector and politician's quote, every international journalist byline makes her smelly blood boil!!! Every single letter, every single sentence, every ounce of truth sears her soul.</p>
              <p>If you believe the deluded fat M'sian cow that it's not crime-plagued, sure.. check out these M'sian reports by one of their politicians, Lim Kit Siang. Cops there are so 'good' at doing their jobs, so 'above board' and so 'capable' that they have a campaign entitled<span style="color: #ff0000;"> "GOOD COPS SAFE MALAYSIA"</span>!</p>
              <p>i see.. indeed.. M'sia's crime rates are indeed just like Singapore's. That such campaigns with such fantastically hilarious names could exist!!! if you can fathom a relatively crime free place with a campaign name as above, I think you're stupid enough to join her league and perhaps you should be her first suitor.</p>
              <p>Parliament Member in M'sia, Lim Kit Siang has a blog, which he regularly writes about his views and plans for the country, and chief of the issues he wants to tackle is the rampant crime rate.  When Abdullah first took on the PM job, one of his main promises was to combat the heinous crime wave of M'sia. When that is a PM's core promises and agenda upon succession, do you think the crime situation is anything like what deluded cow says?! She even has the fat cheek to deny to all of us that we have been fed "local propaganda" so as to save her (pig)skin, yet all the news reports were from INTERNATIONAL news agencies.</p>
              <p>Your request for facts and figures has dutifully been given, and you did not bother to read the international news links, that much I know from your weak response of "population".</p>
              <p>Do you think M'sia's (24 mil) population is anything like Indonesia (234 mil) or Thailand (64 mil)'s? Go freaking do your own research online on those countries' crime situation and M'sia's and stop bothering us with your politically correct BS. A M'sian himself (a human rights activist and lawyer) in the M'sian news report says that M'sia is becoming the CRIME CAPITAL of ASIA. Another M'sian mother in the M'sian news report says the crime rate is at its worst since its independence 50 years ago! Do you realise how deluded and silly you sound now when you came up with the weak shit of a  "depends on the population" whimper?</p>
              <p>Please read and not talk nonsense before reading to act the hero retard. Everyone in this thread besides the deluded fat M'sian cow unanimously agrees so your 'noble' desire to act just and reserved stinks and frankly, makes you look a tad stupid.</p>
              <p>The parts in bold and scarlet red are meant to raise the blood pressure of the deluded.</p>

                                                          Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi’s <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>five-prong strategy
                                                          announced yesterday to combat the rising crime index is not impressive
                                                          at all – too little, too late and too indifferent in lacking
                                                          seriousness and commitment by Abdullah to make Malaysia safe again for
                                                          its citizens, visitors, tourists and investors.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Under Abdullah’s premiership, crime has reached endemic dimension
                                                          with Malaysia gaining an international notoriety as a country unsafe

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>When he became Prime Minister on Oct. 31, 2003, Abdullah pledged
                                                          that one of his top priorities would be to reduce crime to restore to
                                                          Malaysians their fundamental right to be free from crime and the fear
                                                          of crime, whether in the streets, public places or the privacy of their
                                                          homes.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Today, Malaysians feel even more unsafe from crime than when he became Prime Minister.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Abdullah had raised great hopes about his commitment to create an
                                                          efficient, incorruptible, professional and world-class police service
                                                          to declare an all-out war against crime when he set up the Royal Police
                                                          Commission which came out with 125 recommendations, the most important
                                                          of which was the proposal for an Independent Police Complaints and
                                                          Misconduct Commission (IPCMC).</p>
              <p>All such high hopes of Malaysians for a world-class professional
                                                          police service to keep crime index low to make the country safe for the
                                                          people, visitors and foreign investors have been dashed to the ground
                                                          in the past four years.</p>
              <p>All these high hopes have come to nought. The proposal of an
                                                          effective IPCMC has been killed, replaced with a clawless and toothless
                                                          Special Complaints Commission proposal.</p>
              <p>Under Abdullah’s premiership, the police fought a losing war against
                                                          the rising crime index, which had worsened from 156,315 cases in 2003
                                                          to 224,298 cases in 2007 – a sharp rise of some 45% in the past four
                                                          years.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The crime index crashed through the 200,000 barrier for the first
                                                          time in nation’s history with rape more than doubled from a daily

                                                          unsafe from the crime of rape, with the risk of rape more than doubled
                                                          than when Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad handed power over to him four years
                                                          ago.</p>
              <p>Abdullah’s multi-pronged anti-crime strategy announced yesterday has
                                                          fallen like a damp squid as nobody believes that it will have any
                                                          effect to make Malaysia at least as safe for personal safety and
                                                          property security when he became Prime Minister four years ago.</p>
              <p>When will Abdullah wake up to realize and admit that crime in
                                                          Malaysia has become endemic under his premiership, and that the
                                                          prevalent feeling of citizens, visitors, tourists and investors that
                                                          they have lost the sense of personal safety and property security is
                                                          one of the greatest failures of his premiership?</p>

              <p>KUALA LUMPUR: With an eye to early elections, Malaysia is beating the
                  drum about its healthy economy, but surging crime levels offer a stark
                  reminder that the government has yet to deliver on key law-and-order
                  promises.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> <strong>Malaysia expects to host more than 20 million tourists this
                  year as it marks its 50th anniversary of independence, but burglaries,
                  shootouts in shopping malls and motorcycle-borne bag snatchers are just
                  some of the hazards visitors could face. (yikes!)<br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong></strong></span>In recent months, public attention has been riveted by the murder of a
                  Mongolian model whose body was feared to have been blown to bits and
                  the theft of a cargo of $13 million worth of computer chips in northern
                  Penang.<br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Police figures show that crime in Malaysia rose 14 per cent last year
                  to 225,836 incidents against 198,017 in 2005, and the proportion of
                  serious crimes, such as murder, rape and armed robbery, grew 26 per
                  cent.</span></strong><br><br> Though the government paints a rosy picture of the economy, crime is
                  being fuelled by a volatile mix of factors that includes a huge migrant
                  labour force, the rising cost of living and a vast gulf of deprivation
                  between rich and poor, one analyst said.<br><br> “Having a more effective police force would help,” said political
                  analyst and activist Chandra Muzaffar, adding that crucial reform steps
                  suggested in 2005 by a sweeping inquiry into Malaysia’s police force
                  had yet to be carried out. “That is a pity and it shows a lack of
                  political will and an inability to exercise one’s authority,” he said.</p>
              <p>Opposition politicians say the government has not fulfilled promises to
                  rein in crime and cast doubt on police data, saying they do not reflect
                  the true problem because<span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>people lack confidence in the force, and leave

This is a Singapore forum, registered on Singapore soil, you are even probably in SG working here cos of the impossibly low salaries back home,  I won't speak for all Singaporeans but I believe most agree with me.
