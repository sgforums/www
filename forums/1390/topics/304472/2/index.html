              <p>I feel vulgarityis OK in the army as war is babaric and uncivilised. So have to train to be able to mentally tough enough to take abuses. In times of war, the enemy will also not treat you much as a human, they will try to break you in whatever ways they can think of. Vulgarities in SAF is already quite tame compared to the abuses and hashness in war. Come and go also those few words and hand signs.</p>
              <p>Vulgarities can't hurt you as long as you don't take it at heart. One ear in, other ear out. If you want to threat vulgarities and swearing as a sin, it is the person doing it that commits the sin, not you, just pity that fella. Hahaha</p>

              <p>The SAF Seven Core Values Are:</p>
              <p>Loyalty to Country - When you use vulgar languages, what kind of image are you projecting to the public about SAF? What about the foreigners? By ruining SAF's image through the use of uncivilised languages and humiliating your own people by showing such crude behaviours, are you showing loyalty to your country?</p>
              <p>Leadership - How do you lead other people when you can't even behave like you are civilised? In the first place if you can't even project a clean and proper image of yourself, how do you command respect from others?</p>
              <p>Discipline - Again, a lack of display of civilised behaviour reflects a lack of discipline within. You can't even bother to be nice and show respect to your man, where's the discipline in that?</p>
              <p>Professionalism - Obviously, a person who can't even use proper languages can't be very much professional. </p>
              <p>Fighting Spirit - Nothing to say.</p>
              <p>Ethics - Obvious. If you think there's nothing wrong ethically with using crude languages, humiliating your men, and verbally bullying them, fine by me.</p>
              <p>Care for Soldiers - Having said so much, I don't think an explanation is needed here.</p>

              <p>LOL at the above post...</p>
              <p>Please remember that it's the SAF core values...so please take it into the context of a organisation filled with fighting men and women.</p>
              <p>Loyalty to Country-Yah, when i fuck one of ours, it IS loyalty to country. Cus if i don't fuck him and he doesn't learn, that fella will one day be a liability to myself, my unit and possibly my country. If you can't tahan a few swear words, God help you IF you're captured and tortured. We'll see how loyal you become then.</p>
              <p>Leadership-You mentioned a civilised, clean and proper image. Forgive me but i've yet to see my commanders wearing torn and tattered uniforms, unshaved and shoving food into their mouths with their hands in the canteen. Commanders lead by example, by way of inspiring their men to  run faster, jump higher and fight harder. If you can't, never mind. Can train. It's those that can't be bothered, that deserves a good phucking.</p>
              <p>Discipline-You don't follow the rules, you get a warning. The next time you don't follow, you get a screwing. Nuff said.</p>
              <p>Professionalism-It's in the commander's professional interests to train up good soldiers. But if the soldier is not professional enough to give a phuck, he WILL get phucked. Same as how your teachers teach you in school. They teach, but you don't learn, it's YOU who fail the exams.</p>
              <p>Fighting Spirit-I always preferred hearing "NBCB, don't let the phuckers chabut!" as opposed to something like "tally ho men, let's not let  them run away now shall we? pip pip!"</p>
              <p>Ethics-If you have no qualms with your friends using vulgarities on a daily basis but your eyes start twitching when a superior screws you, you not only have ethical double standards but a disdain of authority figures in general as well. Seek professional help.</p>
              <p>Care for Soldiers-This means not going soft on you. Oh hell no.</p>

              <p>Seriously, I don't get annoyyoumust's pre-occupation with swearing. There have always been swear words and they will always be swear words. They exist because, sometimes, there is a need to emphasise what you are saying with some shock value.</p>
              <p>Thus, swear words are a useful part of normal discourse in the correct situations. The old flash video about the usefulness of the word 'fuck' is pretty right when you think about it :)</p>
              <p>Besides, the best military leaders and the best military organisations have generally been criticised for being vulgar. Patton for one is famous for providing whorehouses for his men, while Former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt had this to say about the US Marines:</p>
              <h1 style="margin: 0pt; font-size: 12px;">“The Marines I have seen
                  around the world have the cleanest bodies, the filthiest minds, the

              <p>The aggressor would surely send an envoy to congrads us for attaining the next plateau of civilisation and have the most gracious army that had ever appear on the face of planet earth before the war. Behind their backs, they would be congratulating themselves that they have found a quick and easy way to break our boys without the need to fire a single shot. Just throw whatever valgurity at us and all our ranks would break into disarray, unable to comprehend that there are such raw insults exists, throw into total mental chaos and all jumping down HDB flats to die.</p>

              <p>Dude... the world is full of contradictions, get used to it! Take a look at the other militaries and its the same everywhere. Like it or not it is the best way to do things! The high ideals are to inspire, and the vulgarities are to enforce. Ultimately, things get done.</p>
