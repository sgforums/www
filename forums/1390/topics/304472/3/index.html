              <p>No need to get pissed off here. I think we are going off track, and that is because the original poster knows that he has lost the argument. I think most of the posters here have convincingly shown that vulgarities are part and parcel of any military establishment. In fact, I would go so far as to say that vulgarities are the most efficient and economical method of 'persuasion' when the shit hits the fan. </p>
              <p>Rooki, please open your eyes and read more about history before you make your statements. Throughout history, the nations with the most freedoms also have the strongest military. This military is the force that guarantees the survival of the nation so that the freedoms may thrive. The threat of violence may not be the only factor ensuring peace, but it is a critical factor. Whether they want to serve or not, all those in the military like Hellraiza are paying for the freedom you enjoy to come to this forum to air your views. You should at least show some appreciation for that.</p>

              <p>Soldiers are not the first in line for the peace progress, but i believe they are definitely the last resort.</p>
              <p>Take Iraq. Warnings? Saddam laughs in the UN's face. Peace talks? What talks? Sanctions? Well we'll just have to find alternate sources. And that's where the soldiers come in. Contrary to what some might believe, countries don't send in invasion forces over some small slight they suffered. You say war is babaric and soldiers are neanderthals. So what about Sun Tze who turned war-waging into an art? Neanderthals are the small street gangsters who fight and run. War is based on TACTICS. And for brilliant tactics. YOU NEED BRAINS.</p>
              <p>Problem with Singaporeans is, they're so comfortably esconced in the peace and freedom they now have that they forgot that in 1942, and during the Confrontation, our guys died defending that freedom.</p>

              <p>It may be ironic, but the life is full of contradictions ; ). The reason Gandhi (in his later days) didn't need violence was because the British had a sense of fair play. He was the exception, not the rule. Generally throughout history, the peaceful, non-violent groups get wiped out. Look at the Jews at Masada against the Romans, for one. If you are depending on your opponent's sense of humanity in order to win, you have already lost.</p>
              <p>If we look at it from an evolutionary/game theory point of view, if everybody was non-violent, then the first person to be violent would gain tremendous advantage, because there would be no one to stop him. Thus, more people would 'convert' to be violent, until a certain equilibrium is reached where it is equally advantageous to be violent or non-violent.</p>
              <p>I say again, read your history. Freedom isn't free. It is bought with the blood of those who are willing to die for others; even those who look down on them. The greatest, freest, civilisations have roads paved with blood. The very fact that you are alive today is because your ancestors have fought and killed other humans for the right to live.</p>
              <p>Vulgarities are far more than what you classify them as. Vulgarities may be used as verbal violence, but they are also used to bond, to create a sense of camaderie, to identify a group. I may call my friend a fucker, but does it necessary rob him of respect? Not at all. To classify them as crude, blunt tools is in fact vulgar :). Besides, not everybody deserves respect by virtue of the fact that they are human. Respect has to be earned, regardless of whether you are a street bum or King of the World. More to the point of vulgarity in the SAF, I don't care if my soldier doesn't like me calling him a fucker if doing so jolts him into action and saves the lives of himself and his mates. At least he is alive to complain about it.</p>

              <p>its ok to use vugularity ba i guess. but the fking problem is some use vugularity even when there is no need for e.g giving instructions or doing for no fking reason (like the way i type).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I mean if lets say a soldier misbehave then vugularities is ok but the issue is some commanders is using vugularities for no reason even in giving cmds etc. Dono how to talk properly n decide when to use vugularities to enforce discipline then dont be a commander or lead ppl  thats wad i feel.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Also, something for you to remember till the day you ORD.... holding hands with your gf while in uniform is not an offence and doing so does not tarnish the SAF's image!</p>

              <p>You are much dumber than I earlier estimated.<br><br>You support the idea of not separating so you're either a M'sian or been living under a rock. Then you admitted yourself that "a bumi policy - untenable anyway" and then blamed Singapore's leaders for separating from M'sia? You shot yourself in the foot but then again you've done that repeatedly throughout all your posts, why should we be surprised? Hahah!<br><br>As a sidenote, i'd much rather be middle class in an independent Singapore. If Singapore never separated from M'sia and we were all M'sians, we would be either one of the working class majority living in a developing country struggling, conversely if we were affluent to rich, we'd be routinely carjacked, robbed, burgled, our wives raped and then killed.<br><br>Countries that did not separate from a larger country that they could be depending on now, boasting powerful armies and using their military might to wield political power are US, Switzerland, UK, Russia and China while countries with powerful armed forces are invariably rich and politically influential and can pretty much execise their "freedom" and pursue their agendas for their betterment eg Israel, Taiwan, South Korea, Turkey and India. Yet more have stood their grounds against world pressure to disarm for humanitarian objectives because of their military prowess eg North Korea, Pakistan.<br><br>You are so ignorant about what's going on in the world and are stuck under a 100-ton rock, still reminiscing like one of those fools who didn't know that the war was over 40 years after US dropped the atomic bomb, dreaming abt the days when Singapore and M'sia were one, yet admitting that it's not feasible (which further proves how stupid you are).<br><br>Who's complaining about foreigners? They have to be around to buy and rent our properties, spend more money to stimulate the economy and eat at our otherwise empty french restaurants. We love them! Moreover there's enough of SPGs among your kind who constantly volunteer to suck their __ so they'll hang around long enough to push rental revenue up. Good! We know you are an SPG since you have stated plainly your distaste for anyone who's been conscripted, which includes all Singaporean males. It's good, we see you as one of those chattels that help keep the foreigners 'entertained' and 'amused' in their tenure here, (we see the economic merit) so they won't go. <br><br>You should take your idiotic arguments and potshots that hold no water elsewhere, ideally to a place with people whose IQ levels commensurate with yours, since apparently everyone here thinks you can't cease to make a fool of yourself with your stupidity.<br><br>Anyway, no eligible officer I know will ever fancy someone as dumb as you and who looks as good as a trashcan so you will never ever be the wife of sombody important. Should go screw someone who is as handsome and rich as Gandhi, your idol.</p>

                                      betterment," If Singapore and Malaysia were one, no doubt it would be much more powerful than either country now. Also, NK and Pakistan aren't exactly in very rosy situations despite "standing their grounds against world pressure to disarm for
                                      humanitarian objectives". There's a reason why there are sanctions and boycotts against them.</p>
              <p>Wow, what a tirade you've made against SPGs and foreigners. No need to mask that with your knowledge that they are 'necessary', your insecurity shows through obviously enough. Improve yourself and refrain from calling women who are beyond you 'chattel', and perhaps you'd get more poontang and stop being so bitter.</p>

              <p>Hi.</p>
              <p>I'll just like to point out a couple of likely scenarios if your average Singaporean male did not serve his National Service.</p>
              <p>First example ; Pedra Branca will not be an issue. Why? Because we won't be having our RSN missile corvettes patrolling around that rock and our NDU guys hanging their legs and MP5s out of helicopters overhead to ensure that our right to national sovereignty is not threatened. We can face other foreigners in the eye and know that we are not a country of total wusses.</p>
              <p>Secondly, imagine the cost of your PUB bill without the presence of an SAF. Malaysia would play havoc with the water rates. Maybe a ringgit per litre for all you care. Maybe lima puloh sen. Price of an essential good goes up, the rest of the market follows suit. Everything in your life, from buying a bowl of laksa, buying a packet of panadol, having a baby, rises up tremendously. Inflation occurs. Trade deficit tumbles. Economics, baby. Singapore is reduced to a third-world country, where you take a shit in a little hut with no flushing, and an ah pek comes around at 5am daily to dispose of the daily human waste of your kampong. Yeah, kampong. The government probably wouldn't be able to afford to build HDB flats for you. Don't talk about NEWater and desalination plants - we won't be able to afford those, either.</p>
              <p>As was mentioned, Gandhi is the exception, not the rule. The Swiss were not invaded during World War 2 by Nazi Germany not because they marched up and down the Alps on hunger strikes, but because they had a dedicated and committed military that could stop German panzers in their tracks coupled with the serious terrain advantages. History has shown that emulating the Swiss model is a more reliable and efficient way of ensuring your survival.</p>
              <p>There are very wide political, economic and social implications if we were to dump NS, and if you are not aware of them, then well, I would advise you to do take some time to ponder a little.</p>
              <p>Have a nice day.</p>

              <p>And when did I ever say that NK and Pakistan’s leaders use the advantages

                                                      citizens? Do you think the leaders of NK care about the sanctions or boycotts? Don’t you
                                                      know that they make their money through weapons export? You didn’t know that

                                                      local university since you can’t follow simple arguments, misconstrue the
                                                      simplest statements and even dream up nonsense when I clearly said you ADMITTED
                                                      the bumi policy doesn’t work. It's like what, the 3rd thing you can't understand in plain simple English after you got confused by Hellraiza's simple English about women not wanting to do a combatant's job. Talk about having brains and language faculties "wrecked by NS". You didn't serve NS so what's your excuse for this retardation?</p>

              <p>Hi.</p>
              <p>I'll just like to point out a couple of likely scenarios if your
              average Singaporean male did not serve his National Service.</p>
              <p>First example ; Pedra Branca will not be an issue. Why? Because
              we won't be having our RSN missile corvettes patrolling around that
              rock and our NDU guys hanging their legs and MP5s out of
              helicopters overhead to ensure that our right to national
              sovereignty is not threatened. We can face other foreigners in the
              eye and know that we are not a country of total wusses.</p>
              <p>Secondly, imagine the cost of your PUB bill without the presence
              of an SAF. Malaysia would play havoc with the water rates. Maybe a
              ringgit per litre for all you care. Maybe lima puloh sen. Price of
              an essential good goes up, the rest of the market follows suit.
              Everything in your life, from buying a bowl of laksa, buying a
              packet of panadol, having a baby, rises up tremendously. Inflation
              occurs. Trade deficit tumbles. Economics, baby. Singapore is
              reduced to a third-world country, where you take a shit in a little
              hut with no flushing, and an ah pek comes around at 5am daily to
              dispose of the daily human waste of your kampong. Yeah, kampong.
              The government probably wouldn't be able to afford to build HDB
              flats for you. Don't talk about NEWater and desalination plants -
              we won't be able to afford those, either.</p>
              <p>As was mentioned, Gandhi is the exception, not the rule. The
              Swiss were not invaded during World War 2 by Nazi Germany not
              because they marched up and down the Alps on hunger strikes, but
              because they had a dedicated and committed military that could stop
              German panzers in their tracks coupled with the serious terrain
              advantages. History has shown that emulating the Swiss model is a
              more reliable and efficient way of ensuring your survival.</p>
              <p>There are very wide political, economic and social implications
              if we were to dump NS, and if you are not aware of them, then well,
              I would advise you to do take some time to ponder a little.</p>
              <p>Have a nice day.</p>
