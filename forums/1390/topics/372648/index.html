              <p>WHEN Lieutenant (LTA) Kok Khew Fai threw himself onto one of his
              recruits to protect him from a stray grenade - and both soldiers walked
              away unscathed - little did the National Service officer realise the
              course of his life would dramatically change after his act of bravery.</p>
              <p>One year ago, LTA Kok was bound for Nanyang Technological University to
              study aerospace engineering, two months before completing his National
              Service. <br><br>But those plans have changed. <br><br>Yesterday, the
              21-year-old received a SAF Merit Scholarship to study aeronautical
              engineering at Imperial College in London, almost a year after he was
              conferred a top military award for his act of bravery. <br><br>Son of a welding supervisor and housewife, LTA Kok will start his studies in October. <br><br>His
              father Kok Han Kuan, voice brimming with pride yesterday, said he was
              thankful his son has been given the scholarship and hopes he will do
              his best.<br><br>"As a parent, I am very happy and proud," said Mr Kok,
              51. "There is no way I would have imagined that I could afford to send
              him overseas to study."<br><br>LTA Kok has two siblings - a brother, 25, studying hospitality at a private school and a sister, 18, studying at a polytechnic.<br><br>According
              to Mr Kok, his three children share a bedroom in the family's
              three-room apartment, and despite the cramped conditions, LTA Kok has
              always been a disciplined student. "Since he was young, we didn't need
              to worry about his studies," said Mr Kok.<br><br>LTA Kok said he had
              thought about signing on with the air force as an Air Engineering
              Officer when he was a recruit, but did not meet the requirement because
              he was not a Singapore citizen.<br><br>Then a permanent resident - his parents had moved to Singapore from Ipoh, Malaysia, when he was in primary school - LTA Kok shelved the idea, but later obtained his citizenship in 2007.<br><br>Towards the end of his National Service stint, he thought of signing on again, and applied for the scholarship.<br><br>"I thought SAF might offer a fulfilling career and I can learn a lot and contribute, so I decided to sign on," said LTA Kok.<br><br>During
              a grenade live throw exercise in March last year, a recruit under his
              charge accidentally dropped a live grenade which landed behind them 2m
              away. <br><br>LTA Kok had seconds to react before the grenade exploded.<br><br>The
              officer instinctively pushed the recruit down close to the wall of the
              throwing bay and threw himself over him to shield him from the blast.<br><br>Both soldiers were unhurt.<br><br>Saying
              he wasn't sure if the SAF Medal for Distinguished Act he received had
              boosted his chances of securing the scholarship, LTA Kok said he went
              through the same interview process as other applicants.<br><br>Indeed,
              the straight-A student from Jurong Junior College sat through at least
              three interviews - and none of the interviewers brought up the grenade
              incident, he said.<br><br>"I feel very honoured that I have been given
              this chance by the SAF to go on this scholarship," said LTA Kok, who
              received the award from Minister for Education and Second Minister for
              Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen yesterday, along with 19 others.<br><br>Responding
              to queries, a spokesman from the Mindef Scholarship Centre said: "To
              qualify for the SAF Merit Scholarship, applicants must have good
              academic and military performance as well as strong leadership
              qualities."<br><br>LTA Kok's life hasn't changed much since the grenade incident, he said, but friends who know about it sometimes tease him by calling him "hero".</p>

              <p>And p/s: which 'scholar' can almost went to NTU engineering, a
                  well-known 100% dumping ground for the lousiest biggest loseriest
                  JC students and come from "Jurong JC",? Elite my arse. more like farmer 'scholarship'. the rubbish
                  contrived shit at the end of the article about whether he got the
                  SMS, a farmer scholarship through the interviews or through the his
                  heroic act does nothing more than throw up suspicions on the whole
                  rubbish thing.</p>
