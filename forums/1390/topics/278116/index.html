Vice versa, a soldier having mental illness may not even need to go four counseling.<br><br>To be downgraded, u have to go through SAF's own psychiatrist(ususally a LTC), in which you will be boarded and requires to go for periodic review. Ususally PES is given as temp status. Why? This is to prevent kengsters to keng siao to downgrade. (As I have no idea you are true case or just a kengster so be warned, if u try to keng this, be prepared to face the consequences)<br><br>Implications:<br>Ur condition will be kept secret unless ur condition will affect  other around you, in such case, the MO will inform ur CO. Thereafter, it will be up to your CO's discretion to let which of your superior to know.<br><br>Of course,you cannot control these people's mouth because I know of big-mouth people who just cannot keep secrets, within few hours, the whole camp knows the fellow's condition.<br><br>Second, people being people, you cannot stop others who know your condition to be skeptical. This means, even though u are true case, u will still kena subject to "you are a chow kengster" treatment. You have to accept this fact. Doesn't mean you are true case liao, people will be nice to you, doesn't really work this way in SAF.</div>
