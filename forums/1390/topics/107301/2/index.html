Put it this way: As a recruit, I didn't even make half of the $240 mentioned here. Not so much low standard of living (a night at an Orchard disco cost $50/- then) but a case of the SAF paying NSFs peanuts &amp; justifying that they're already providing meals &amp; abodes.<br><br>My time was the days when log PT was a tekan standard; we even jogged with them in Tekong, &amp; also while carrying medicine balls. I could still recall my DI proclaiming "You Delta Donkeys had it good" - we're Delta Dragons, honest ~lol~ - cuz when HE was a recruit the unfit were running with sandbagged fullpacks (already banned then).</div>

I just learnt from my CO that there is combat pt 3 &amp; 4 but SPT have not taught us about it so maybe it is not going to be implemented.<br><br>PT 2 is not cooling down, its just more training BEFORE cooling down.<br><br>Yes, i foresee that it is going to be tiring, even "us" (those who went thru commander training) found it challenging too.<br><br>Well, the ATEC/SPT guys told us that they used it in 3SIR as trial and results came encouraging. They studied the 3 companies, 1 do this new type PT the other 2 used old PT. The company with new PT as it WAS SAID TO US performed way better.<br><br>But my friends who just got back from 3SIR told me it's the other way round. weird.</div>
