            <div class='col-md body'>Bloody hell, what is SAF trying to do now. The new PT training syllabus makes one super shagged even before the actual training starts.<br><br>basically.. the new PT syllabus includes, Weights drill, Combat PT, Modified Warm-up, modified 5BX. climbing drill, 275m Shuttle run, etc<br><br>Just finished my new PT training package.... sprained my back in the process. haha.<br><br>anyway..  it is "scientifically proven" to be more effective form of PT than the past   circuit training/gym combo.<br><br>THey used 3SIR for studies and results were encouraging.<br><br>December intake recruits onwards will be on this new syllabus.</div>
