            <div class='col-md body'>That is one of the greatest problems with having a career in the SAF.<br><br>There is just not industry recognition of skills learnt in the army. Even the Army driving licence is not equivalent to a civillian licence! Absolutely disgraceful. I know the problem though: SAF training is watered down to fit the demands of a conscript army. There is seldom anyone who fails an army course (Except Lazerlord's course mate who i gather failed spectacularly).<br><br>The worst vocation is infantry. there is no need in the civillian world for someone who can hump a heavy load over long distances (The bangaldeshis and Chinese work for much much less) and who can dig (ditto) and who can shoot and things and blow things up (criminal offences in the civillian world). This is a problem facing infantry all over the world, but the SAF infantryman has it worse because of the watered down training and the lack of operational experience.  The only civvy qualification I got out of the army was some CPR cert. And considering the quality of training I received, I am not going to put myself in a position to be sued for negligence!<br><br>Back to topic: I once met a taxi driver who told me he was ex-SOF. Dunno if he is just a walter mitty type of character but he told me something that I think rings true: That many people think the overseas ranger course is damn prestigious when in fact overseas trainees cannot fail the course unless they get injured, etc.<br><br>Also met another ex-capt taxi driver. He din say much though. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
