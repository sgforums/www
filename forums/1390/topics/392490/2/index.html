              <p><br>The allowance given to NSF is quite enough given the fact that they stayed in n take meals in the camp. Anyway to sidetrack for a moment, many of the NSF also got downgraded to some psychological problem, it could be that they cannot stand in their given vocation.</p>

              <p>National Servicemen or NSFs, are conscript soldiers. As the concept implies, the governing body is not obliged to pay them anything, salary or otherwise. However the law makes this provision for the servicemen.</p>
              <p>This allowance is not a salary. Since the servicemen are conscripts, the allowance are given to them for personal use, something akin to your parents giving you allowance when you attend school though they are in no way obliged to do so.</p>
              <p>Somebody mentioned that maybe we do provide them a market rate salary, and maybe hold the bulk of this monies and only release it on ORD or ROD. To give servicemen a proper salary comparable to the regulars is not economically feasible and would probably tax our government expenditure. Also this would demoralize the regular service as they do not feel as though they are appreciated for committing to the service as opposed to the NSFs who are there in passing.</p>
              <p>Maybe i can suggest that as a recognition for NSFs, further education should be subsidised for them or maybe even tax exemptions. Maybe this is not done so those who do not serve feel as if they are second class citizens. But i still feel that NSFs and NSmen deserve further recognition. The amount of subsidy can be pegged or comparable to the approximate loss of income should the servicemen have entered a tertiary education instead of NS and found work subsequently.</p>

              <p>I think if we all want to be helpfull not give suggestions that are not really feasible.</p>
              <p>I have served in NS and i don't think that it can or should be reduced any further, unless the situation has changed and it really is feasible to do so. Some countries can afford to have shorter National Service, then thats good for them. But you have to see what trainings the soldiers receive. IF there are all rifle men, foot soldiers, then i say a year of intensive training can produce you a decent foot soldier. However, our NSFs are given training beyond that, for command school, to operate Tanks, Artillery, some Command Control and Communication systems and other specialized vocations that require additional training.</p>
              <p>So One year is definitely not enough. If you extend or shorten the liablity based on the vocation, then some people won't want to be posted to certain vocations or command school as OUR systems require. </p>
              <p>You have to understand that the needs of Singapore Militarily is very different then that of other countries.</p>

              <p>It can be done la....Most of what the vocations learn can be completed within one year. The rest of the NS is just repeating what one has learned during training / specialized training. Perhaps if shortening to 1 year is too much, then have a graduated reduction to 1 1/2 years...learn from the progress and eventually shorten it to 1 year.</p>
              <p>If you say "<strong>You have to understand that the needs of Singapore Military is

              <p>It can be done la....Most of what the vocations learn can be completed within one year. The rest of the NS is just repeating what one has learned during training / specialized training. Perhaps if shortening to 1 year is too much, then have a graduated reduction to 1 1/2 years...learn from the progress and eventually shorten it to 1 year.</p>
              <p>If you say "<strong>You have to understand that the needs of Singapore Military is very different then that of other countries.</strong>", then may I ask u: what are the militaries of other countries with conscription and how fundamentally different is ours from theirs?</p>

              <p>Training can be done. But there are other things that take place after that. We still need assesment provided by ATEC, more practice to make them truly competent.</p>
              <p>So in that way, if you take a serviecman who has the NAPFA requirements, then he'll be only serving 1yr 10 months.</p>
              <p>3 months BMT, 6-9 months command school and/or vocation training. Thats already a year. So lets say he's more or less a qualified soldier. But he has no real field experience. That is why we have overseas exercise, exercise with other services within SAF, ATEC and such. All this require preparation and such.</p>
              <p>The way the SAF is managed is that some factions are almore entirely managed, run and composed of the NSFs/Nsman with the exception of only the leadership thats really at the top.</p>
              <p>For there to be proper confidence and proper capability they have to be extensively trained and assessed. Throwing a soldier trained or otherwise into the battlefield without making sure that he CAN do the job and making sure that he has enough experince is as good as sending him to his death.</p>
              <p>AND the requirements of Singapore is a little different that other countries primarily because we lack strategice depth. Should war come, ideally, we need to project our defensive line well into the enemy space so that our civillians are safe, our infrastructure is still there so that we can recover from war. Because of this we need to train in places other than our own.</p>
              <p>If we want to bother we National Service at all, might as well make sure that it is done properly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, we are getting away from the topic. I believe it is whether we should increase the allowance of the NSFs to be comparable to the Regulars. I maintain my answer to be No. The allowance is sufficient. The SAF (not counting the police force and SCDF who have additional allowance to make provisions for such cases) provides pretty much a complete range of basic necessities from food, shelter clothing (with the exception of underwear, but i'm sure we can manage - these things are what the allowance is for btw, miscellaneous things) and such.</p>
