              <p><br> i mean if NS is to reduce to 1 year, i think there is not enuf time
              to serve, serving National service actually start on the 2nd
              year, 1st years is all basic and course training, my ex bf in
              Officer cadet course already took a year to train, if u said let
              them go after 1 year, then train for what, no service rendered.
              Then it should not be call as national service but rather
              training course. Basically those peoples who compare us again to
              Taiwan, German or even israel, you hv to look at it clearly, the
              environment, demographic, populations, etc etc must be factor in to
              determine the situation, just like my hometown in taiwan, at any
              one time, we got 500,000 young soldiers ready to fight a war,
              no need to recall or mobilise anything, with so much young men, our
              young men dun hv to serve so long,  but their reservists is
              longer than singaporeans, and in country like Israel and Germany,
              their soldier bring their weapon home, at any one time, they are
              ready to go for war with full order, unlike ours, have to take
              taxis lah, feeder service bus lah, MRT lah...by the time old uncle
              army arrive, i think i already get raped by the enemy liao.</p>

              <p>sg govern collect more than 2000m in foreign levy each yr, which is equivalent to SGD8.3K per servicemen monthly. Assuming 20K soliders are enlisted for 24 month national service, the country collected SGD 4.1K per NSF per month.</p>
              <p>The money should be used as rightful compensation for Singaporean male who contributed their time to the nation. Why pay market rate for everything and the same for the NSF? The NS relieft is nothing as compare to the levy collected from having all the foreigners working in this country. It need not be paid as salary as I say, it can be deferred payment either in the form of education fund for NSF or higher HDB subsidy for male citizen. The amt of subsidy should vary with the amt of foreign level collection.</p>
              <p>Who can let us know where does this foreign levy go to in this country?</p>

              <p>I think u r right lah, who like to be force, for nothing, go to prison for 2 years with parole for what?? and sometime, it can be worst than prison.</p>
              <p>1k dun satisfy many today, even a supermarket or MacDonald staff also can earn more than that..so to speak.</p>
              <p>I suggest a BAIL out, since singapore is running like a financial corporation, 1k per month, if anyone can paid 24k to govt, you dun have to serve NS, Bail yourself out of it. If no money, look for me in joo chiat, i charge only 5% per an..and i guess, all these rich young boys of singapore will pay, even 50k also can pay just to bail themselve out of NS, all useless bums.</p>
              <p>Govt on the other hand, take all these money to buy professional soldier like the Gukhas or the french legion, very loyal, so the Govt will save the cost of training and all those wasting time exercises...out source the whole total defend to foreign soldier, after all, we got many foreigner here already</p>

              <p>Haha.</p>
              <p>BTW, I'm not from within the SAF, Mindef or the Singapore
              Government. Atleast not currently. I was previously an Officer and
              i have ORDed early last year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I validate the National Service Liability Service because i did
              scrutinise it when i was in the service.</p>
              <p>My point is that it is not valid to compare us to other
              countries because our needs are different. Maybe Germany feels that
              their Conscription libility service is sufficient, but note that
              their own military personnel disagree, they say that the amount of
              training is so little that they shouldnt even bother. This may be a
              political move.</p>
              <p>Singapore has certain contingency plans and needs for the SAF.
              This requires this specific training package.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the government impose a curfew and made it so that you only
              get minimum food. You would be upset. And if i use your argument
              that other people in other countries are doing it. Like those
              poorer countries and such. What is your response? That is other
              nations. NOT how we do things in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If we want to take this discussion further. Can you recommend
              where can we trim the National Service. IF it can be done, then
              tell the Government how. Don't just say lessen the time, and
              increase the allowance and what not when you dont know how to do
              things yourself. It is in Singapore's best interest to decrease the
              liability, to put these people back into the economy, to decrease
              defence expenditure. But we cant do it. Not now anyway. Maybe if
              things change in the future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not a firm supporter of the Government, I disagree with them
              on many points. But this, national service is important.</p>
              <p>And if you have gone through it, you will know that it is not in
              terms of defence that we benefit. People grow in a way in NS in a
              way that you can't anywhere else.</p>

              <p>An assumption about the german army does nothing to support your grounds. I was an A Tech with the rank of 3SG and did 2 1/2 years of NS....I can tell you many ways in which technicians can cut down training time. Combat side, I wouldn't know.</p>
              <p>I'm not going to go into details here but it sure beats....no offence my friend, your myopic view. I'm sure as a commissioned officer, you know a lot more about the SAF than me but then, that's it. You are not able to understand how other armies in the world function yet you can say the SAF is different. It makes your argument little better.</p>
              <p>Yes I have grown up in the SAF, millions of other males have too but the POINT is, we do not need the SAF to grow if you are willing to look at the world beyond our shores. Perhaps because you are just out of NS and have not studied in an overseas institution or worked overseas before, your view is rather myopic. The world is out there my friend.</p>

              <p><br>I think we are failing to agree as we are arguing from different perspective.</p>
              <p>I'm coming from the needs and requirements of Singapore while you are seeing the requirements of other countries and what they are doing and how we can achieve what they have.</p>
              <p>Also, the issue with germany is not an assumption. You can do some research on the conscription in germany and see the many criticism from their own military.</p>
              <p>Anyone can argue the needs and such, but these things will only prove itself when real war strikes, which i'm sure we all hope will not happen.</p>
              <p>Plus the technician and combatant needs are different, that is true. But you can't shorten the liability of a technician and make combatants serve longer. That way noone will want to be a combatant. The morale and motivational issue is already huge at the combatant side. We dont really need to make it worse.</p>
              <p>And you still have failed to give any examples (atleast a few) on how to shorten the liability. If you want to stop at basic training, and skip the assesment and experience that second year provides, then fair enough. Maybe for technicians its enough to just teach you the theory on being a technician then expecting that the person can perform.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS. If you want to argue rationally, there is no point in personal attacks like calling me Myopic. You want to assume that i have no experince overseas when i lived 8 years of my life outside Singapore.</p>
