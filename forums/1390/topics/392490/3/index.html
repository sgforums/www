              <p>I dont follow the pay of  the national service boy
              anymore. During my time, we were paid an 'allowance' of abt 180SGD
              per month to serve the nation. The average salary for a factory
              workers than was abt 700-1000SGD. Is the government still paying an
              'alllowance' for compulsary national servce? if so why?</p>
              <p>My view is that since Sg govern is preaching mkt driven
              rate for everythings in our country, including Ministers
              salary, why are we not paying a market rate salary to our
              national servicemen? We may not have the money in the past the
              the early day but now, I dont beleive we cannot affort to pay
              the annual intake of say 10-20K new servicemen the right

              <p>Training can be done. But there are other things that take place
              after that. We still need assesment provided by ATEC, more practice
              to make them truly competent.</p>
              <p>So in that way, if you take a serviecman who has the NAPFA
              requirements, then he'll be only serving 1yr 10 months.</p>
              <p>3 months BMT, 6-9 months command school and/or vocation
              training. Thats already a year. So lets say he's more or less a
              qualified soldier. But he has no real field experience. That is why
              we have overseas exercise, exercise with other services within SAF,
              ATEC and such. All this require preparation and such.</p>
              <p>The way the SAF is managed is that some factions are almore
              entirely managed, run and composed of the NSFs/Nsman with the
              exception of only the leadership thats really at the top.</p>
              <p>For there to be proper confidence and proper capability they
              have to be extensively trained and assessed. Throwing a soldier
              trained or otherwise into the battlefield without making sure that
              he CAN do the job and making sure that he has enough experince is
              as good as sending him to his death.</p>
              <p>AND the requirements of Singapore is a little different that
              other countries primarily because we lack strategice depth. Should
              war come, ideally, we need to project our defensive line well into
              the enemy space so that our civillians are safe, our infrastructure
              is still there so that we can recover from war. Because of this we
              need to train in places other than our own.</p>
              <p>If we want to bother we National Service at all, might as well
              make sure that it is done properly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, we are getting away from the topic. I believe it is
              whether we should increase the allowance of the NSFs to be
              comparable to the Regulars. I maintain my answer to be No. The
              allowance is sufficient. The SAF (not counting the police force and
              SCDF who have additional allowance to make provisions for such
              cases) provides pretty much a complete range of basic necessities
              from food, shelter clothing (with the exception of underwear, but
              i'm sure we can manage - these things are what the allowance is for
              btw, miscellaneous things) and such.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, its true that we serve to protect the country. But still
              it is not extirely ridiculous of us to expect some recognition and
              compensation. We give up the prime of our lives training for the
              war we hope will never come. Atleast there could be some
              gratitude.</p>
              <p>Some subsidy in the form of local tertiary education is not
              entirely ridiculous. We did loose all that time. If we didn't go
              through NS and got into UNI, we would be working 2 more years
              earninig 2k+++. Which the girls and those who don't serve already
              benefit from.</p>

              <p><br>Ok, firstly, the move to shorten the conscription of the military was primarily a political move. Military personnel and senior officers maintain that 9 months is too short to train a competent soldier.</p>
              <p>South Korea's 21 months is more or less comparable to our 22months (Passed Napfa) or 24 months (Failed Napfa).</p>
              <p>Taiwan however is trying to move from a conscription military to a volunteer military so the chages that they are making cannot really be compared to us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And when i said forward defence, i meant that aside from receiving basic traininng in Singapore, we train in other countries so that the soldiers learn to adapt to fighting in different environmental conditions (as opposed to learning to fight specifically in the environment of the foreign countries that we train at). Other countries have the luxury of maintaining a defensive line within their borders. Where in Singapore do we draw a defensive line? Would you like fighting to be taking place in the basket ball court of your estate? No!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lets break it down again, if you want to argue, try to propose something shorter so that we can achive the <strong>same training</strong> in a <strong>lesser time</strong>.</p>
              <p>3 months - BMT</p>
              <p>6-9 months - Command School/ Vocation Training</p>
              <p>1 Year -  Ops Preperation and  Ops Evaluation. Standby duties.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Notice that the Command School and Vocation Training only minimally trains our soldiers for war. How to Operate a weopen, how to react and such. We don't do anything large scale to simulate a battle involving complex elements. SO at the end of the first year, what you have is basically trained soldiers with no real experience.</p>
              <p>Its like giving an individual education up till the level of Masters or a Doctorate and Finance and making him a Head of a Bank or at the Minimum a Senior Executive/Vice President in a Bank. It just doesnt make sense.</p>
              <p>The Second year is when most of the important action takes place. This is where we make sure that these are truly soldiers, not just men trained to use guns. Once all this is done, they are on Standby Duty. This is REAL Active Duty where they are on standby should any conflict arise. They will be the first to be activitated while the Reseve Corps is getting Ready to back them up. And please note that the active duty is only like 3-5 months. All the Training for 3-5 months and your reservist duties.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And its not like the Liability period is not being revised, it has already dropped from 2.5 years to 2 years. Further reductions can be made if we can be assured that similar results can be obtained by a shorter training period.</p>
              <p>There are people in MINDEF looking into this constantly, alot of manpower is allocated to shaping the training process, things are always changing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the end of 2 Years, Singapore does produce soldiers. Competent Soldiers. Foriegn militaries are amazed at how fast we train soldiers. They praise the level of proffesionalism of our conscripts, the depth of their knowledge.</p>
              <p>We have NS, so that we are more or less assured Safety. If you dont want to do a proper job at it, then don't bother doing it. Just maintain the minimal regular force to match our population and geographical size.</p>
              <p>AS it is, looking at how Singapore is defended, i can say that event he US (the so called best military in the world) would be hard pressed to take Singapore. (and this is not a discussion this is a FACT)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not contesting that the other conscript armies are poorly defended.</p>
              <p>But note that South Korea does not need to have simulated ops because they are actually engaged for duty. Though the conflict has subdued somewhat, the military still maintain a presence on the border on actual duty.</p>

              <p>Firstly, what has the concept of forward defence has to do with the length of service? Pls note that I am not asking you what forward defence means.</p>
              <p>Secondly, even though S. Korea's 21 months is close to our 21-22 months but they have plans to reduce it even though they are technically at war with the North.</p>
              <p>Taiwan is reducing its conscription tenure despite warm cold relations with China. Well of course for Sg to reduce to 3-4 months is ludicrous, perhaps like what I mentioned, 18 months initially for the SAF would be a good thing to look at and eventually reducing. Considering the great influx of foreigners these days, no one is guaranteed a job right after 2 years national service. Reducing it to 1 to 1 1/2 years would go a long way towards boosting the GDP and productivity of the nation.</p>
              <p>Seems that you have no idea why Germany with a conscription tenure of 9 months, is able to maintain a world class military. You sound like someone from inside SAF. Well, to be honest I have no idea about Germany's way of training but it only takes some common sense to wonder why Singapore can't do the same. Given that to reduce our conscription from 24 months to 12 months is a tad drastic, surely 18 months is something the SAF can look at. After all, we still have yearly reservist committments.</p>

              <p><br>i mean if NS is to reduce to 1 year, i think there is not enuf time to serve, serving National service actually start on the 2nd year, 1st years is all basic and course training, my ex bf in Officer cadet course already took a year to train, if u said let them go after 1 year, then train for what, no service rendered. Then it should not be call as national service but rather training course. Basically those peoples who compare us again to Taiwan, German or even israel, you hv to look at it clearly, the environment, demographic, populations, etc etc must be factor in to determine the situation, just like my hometown in taiwan, at any one time, we got 500,000 young soldiers ready to fight a war, no need to recall or mobilise anything, with so much young men, our young men dun hv to serve so long,  but their reservists is longer than singaporeans, and in country like Israel and Germany, their soldier bring their weapon home, at any one time, they are ready to go for war with full order, unlike ours, have to take taxis lah, feeder service bus lah, MRT lah...by the time old uncle army arrive, i think i already get raped by the enemy liao.</p>

              <p>Haha.</p>
              <p>BTW, I'm not from within the SAF, Mindef or the Singapore Government. Atleast not currently. I was previously an Officer and i have ORDed early last year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I validate the National Service Liability Service because i did scrutinise it when i was in the service.</p>
              <p>My point is that it is not valid to compare us to other countries because our needs are different. Maybe Germany feels that their Conscription libility service is sufficient, but note that their own military personnel disagree, they say that the amount of training is so little that they shouldnt even bother. This may be a political move.</p>
              <p>Singapore has certain contingency plans and needs for the SAF. This requires this specific training package.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the government impose a curfew and made it so that you only get minimum food. You would be upset. And if i use your argument that other people in other countries are doing it. Like those poorer countries and such. What is your response? That is other nations. NOT how we do things in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If we want to take this discussion further. Can you recommend where can we trim the National Service. IF it can be done, then tell the Government how. Don't just say lessen the time, and increase the allowance and what not when you dont know how to do things yourself. It is in Singapore's best interest to decrease the liability, to put these people back into the economy, to decrease defence expenditure. But we cant do it. Not now anyway. Maybe if things change in the future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not a firm supporter of the Government, I disagree with them on many points. But this, national service is important.</p>
              <p>And if you have gone through it, you will know that it is not in terms of defence that we benefit. People grow in a way in NS in a way that you can't anywhere else.</p>
