They would prefer that he didn't tell them where to go, give them traffic tickets, or stand ready in our airports with M16s. The sheep would much rather have the sheepdog cash in his fangs, spray paint himself white, and go 'Baa'. Until the wolf shows up. Then the entire flock tries desperately to hide behind one lonely sheepdog."<br>-Col Dave Grossman On Combat<br><br>wolves have their places, too; they cull the old, sick and genetic failures and keep the flock healthy. then again, this is also a diffcult concept for some.</div>

You are training to be commando ok? last time used to be much worse, they can make you "everything out of your cupboard", "everything in" for half a day, or make u "duffle bag overhead". Nowdays commando training has toned down alot already because of all the training safety regulation. The idea of all these verbal harassing is just to make you strong, not to become a weakling that whines at everything. That is wat commando training is all about...to make you think that nothing is impossible, and let u redefine where your limit really is...i stil remember my officer's fav line "Can be done understand??"<br><br>Anyway, shouting "commando" is to instil into you a sense of belonging to this elite organisation. But of cos u have to earn the qualification to be there. And after u get your red beret you will definitely feel so proud to be part of commando. Imagine whenever you step into any camp with your red beret on, i can bet all heads will turn to look at you, just because everyone knows what it takes to done that red beret. So if u think shouting "commando" is stupid? please get out of there, u dun deserve to be there</div>

Guess the degree of toughness varies and you somehow fell into the more extreme vocation. Aniway..to a person who is tough, tough training would be moderate but to someone who is not....moderate training will be hell. So just have to adapt i guess.. And shouting...hmm..kinda hated it too when pple shout at me. But after some time when u understand the culture and the purpose of them doing that..i guess it will shed some light...But ill discpline wise..matter of individual bah...<br><br>Really hard to imagine if theres a war and someone is shouting... Pte xyz...Prone down please..the enemy have seen you...<br><br>Like i always say. Xi guan chen zi ran...Ming tian hui gen hao....

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, a commando must be mentally tough but don't risk your life for it. If you don't like it, fail the course. Not everyone covets the red beret.<br><br>Instructors spewing vulgarities isn't as bad as instructors ignoring training safety - think for the dunking incident and the SOF drowning. If trainees don't get respect, why am I not surprised that fatal accidents happen at SAF.</div>
