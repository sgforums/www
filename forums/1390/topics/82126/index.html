            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ADVANCING DEFENCE MEDICAL RESEARCH THROUGH JOINT COLLABORATION: STATE-OF-THE-ART RESEARCH COMPLEX OPENS AT NUS CAMPUS<br></strong><br>More than 200 scientists, researchers and doctors will synergise their efforts to develop and harness advanced capabilities in human sciences, biomedical sciences and chem-bio defence to ensure that the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) servicemen are protected from chem-bio hazards, as well as to manage their health and enhance their performance, on and off the battlefield.<br><br>RADM(NS) Teo Chee Hean, Minister for Defence, officiated at todayÂ’s opening of the DSO (Kent Ridge) Building and the SAF Military Medicine Institute (MMI). The Building houses the Defence Medical &amp; Environmental Research Institute @ DSO National Laboratories (DMERI@DSO), the SAFÂ’s Military Medicine Institute (MMI) and some research laboratories of the NUS.<br><br>Said Mr Quek Gim Pew, Chief Executive Officer, DSO: Â“The DSO (Kent Ridge) Building is DSOÂ’s third and latest research complex. We hope that this building will become the focal point for joint collaboration in human sciences research, which will eventually translate into enhanced safety, survival and performance of our national servicemen.Â”<br><br>In addition, this new research complex provides a critical boost towards strengthening the defence and national security ecosystem, which includes DSO, Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA), Singapore Technologies (ST) Engineering, Temasek Laboratories, local universities, and the research institutes under the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR).<br><br>Said Mr Quek Gim Pew, Chief Executive Officer, DSO: Â“By co-locating our research facilities with other research institutes such as the NUS, we hope to promote greater scientific exchange and interaction between our scientists and the researchers from other organisations. We are confident that this synergistic partnership will create exciting opportunities for DSO researchers and scientists to generate critical capabilities and unique solutions that meet the SAFÂ’s demanding and unique operation requirements.Â”<br><br>The DSO (Kent Ridge) Building, which spans a total gross floor area of 21,000 square metres over 14 floors, was conceptualised in 1997. The groundbreaking ceremony for the building was officiated by Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Tony Tan, on 29 January 2001.<br><br>DMERI@DSO currently occupies six floors of this new research complex. The mission of DMERI@DSO is to spearhead, coordinate and conduct biomedical, human sciences, environmental protection and chem-bio defence research to enhance the safety, survival and performance of the SAF personnel. <strong>DMERI@DSO has made significant contributions towards defence and national security in three key areas - developing defences against against chem-bio threats; protecting the SAF servicemen against injury and wounds; and enhancing soldier combat effectiveness under extreme battlefield conditions. </strong><br><br>Integrating its various critical services under one roof, the MMI occupies four floors in the DSO (Kent Ridge) Building. The MMI is now a one-stop, servicemen-centric quality health care service provider in deployment medical support, musculoskeletal injury care and rehabilitation, psychological care, trauma stress support, visual care and performance enhancement, as well as cardio-pulmonary assessment and support.<br><br>While DSO spearheads the development of new technology in defence science, the MMI serves as a portal to introduce new technologies and capabilities into the military healthcare system. <strong>The MMIÂ’s role in the defence ecosystem is to ensure the efficient sustenance of our soldiers through the delivery of quality healthcare in areas of specialist medical and dental care as well as medical grading.<br></strong><br>Some of the DMERI@DSOÂ’s current research work include:<br><br><strong>Studies on heat stress</strong>: To mitigate heat load as well as to prevent and manage heat stroke, researchers at DMERI@DSO have developed an individual cooling vest based on evaporative and conductive cooling principles, as well as a core-body temperature heat-stress monitor. These products have undergone field trials in the SAF with encouraging results.<br><br><strong>Myopia studies in DSO</strong>: Currently, more than 80% of the SAF pre-enlistees are myopic with the trend increasing at an alarming rate. To address the high endemic rates of myopia among SAF servicemen and in our population, DMERI@DSO adopts a multi-pronged approach to tackle this trait. This involves:<br>(a) Studying the genetic causes and mechanisms of myopia development<br>(b) Quantifying the impact of myopia on operational and combat activities<br>(c) Studying effective methods for correcting myopia suitable for the soldier.<br><br><strong>Studies on neck injury</strong>: DSO leads a team of local researchers from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and the National University of Singapore (NUS) to collaborate with the Air Force Research Laboratory of the USA on a project to mitigate injuries to pilots during manoeuvres such as ejection. This collaboration promises enhanced safety for both Singapore and US pilots.<br>Said BG(DR) Wong Yue Sie, Chief of Medical Corps, Singapore Armed Forces:  Â“DMERI@DSO is MMIÂ’s strategic partner. MMI works closely with DMERI@DSO to transfer the lab research into the field. This include DMERI@DSOÂ’s studies in vision care and myopia, obesity management, soldier injury prevention, performance enhancement, psychological resilience and predisposition.Â”<br><br>The completion of the DSO (Kent Ridge) Building marks an important milestone in human sciences research in Singapore. More than just the completion of a building, the opening of the DSO (Kent Ridge) Building and the MMI demonstrates the commitment of the Singapore defence R&amp;D community in leveraging on technological advances to deliver unique solutions to sharpen the cutting edge of SingaporeÂ’s national security.<br><br>-- Mindef news release.<br><br></div>
