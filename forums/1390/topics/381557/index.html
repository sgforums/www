              <p>Why not? The "worst" thing that could happen is that they send you for check-up. but since you are really injured, nothing is going to happen to you anyway.</p>
              <p>In fact, it is good to get things settled as soon as possible, so you got nothing to worry about later.</p>

              <p>I don seem to understand why u need to inform NS HRC now? ur appt for specialist is Jan2010 and your ICT is Jun 2010.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if u want to defer based on medical reason, either u have medical leave for long term during your ICT period or u r being excused ICT by MO. Even if u r downgraded, u still have to attend ur ICT unless u r posted out of ur current unit.</p>
              <p>i am replying based on experience. So if u want to defer, then u better have some supporting document from specialist to be submitted to MO. As for when to send the supporting document, u have to think carefully. it affects whether u wil be excused for ICT.</p>

              <p>Go for your specialist review first, then book a medical review with your unit/division HQ MO through ns.sg so that he can assess you. Then depending on situation, he may put you up for medical board or give you the required excuses. Your ICT is in June, medical boards usually can be done within a month or two, excuses usually are given out on the day of medical review itself, so it doesn't affect you at all if you go in Jan or Feb.</p>

But the SAF100 is such a negative catalyst that trigger all the troublesome medical appointment, review, insurance claim. Why they even bother to call me up, waste my time? Sianz. </p></div>
