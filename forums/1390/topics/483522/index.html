              <p>SINGAPORE - Distraught, he locked himself in the toilet and phoned his mother.</p>
              <p>In
               between sobs, he then told her how he was being bullied by his peers 
              and superiors and that he was unable to cope with his duties in the 
              army.</p>
              <p>But more worryingly, he threatened to end his life, 
              prompting his parents to bring his condition to the attention of his 
              superiors and the army.</p>
              <p>Bryan (not his real name) has Asperger Syndrome, a form of autism.</p>
              <p>He
               was enlisted as a full-time national serviceman (NSF) in 2012, but 
              after a difficult year, he was exempted from the service in March last 
              year.</p>
              <p>Last week, his father wrote in to The New Paper after 
              reading about Private (Pte) Ganesh Pillay Magindren, 23, the NSF who was
               found dead at the foot of his Sengkang condominium last July. (See 
              report right, below.)</p>
              <p>"I wanted to share that what my son went through was similar to Pte Ganesh," he told TNP in a subsequent phone interview.</p>
              <p>Bryan's father first noticed unusual behaviour in his son in kindergarten.</p>
              <p>"I thought something was wrong with him when he would just sit there and not interact with other children," he said.</p>
              <p>Bryan was taken to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed him with Asperger's, said the father.</p>
              <p>"He's not able to socialise normally, has trouble articulating and has compulsive behaviours.</p>
              <p>"But other than that, he was normal. He's not mad. He even took his A levels and did well," he said.</p>
              <p>The father said he had initially encouraged his son to go through national service.</p>
              <p>"Bryan
               was originally very excited to be enlisting. I also thought it would be
               an opportunity for him to become more independent and learn how to be 
              around people," he said.</p>
              <p><strong>FIT FOR ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES</strong></p>
              <p>Bryan
               was given the Physical Employment Status (PES) E, which meant he was 
              fit for administrative duties and was required to go through only a 
              month-long basic military training (BMT) course.</p>
              <p>"Everything was 
              fine during his BMT and he was getting used to being in the army. But 
              things changed when he was posted to his unit as a storeman.</p>
              <p>"His 
              superior kept finding fault and labelled him as lazy and stupid. She 
              also regularly punished him with weekend confinement barely two months 
              into his posting," said the father.</p>
              <p>His fellow army mates also bullied and made fun of him, said the father.</p>
              <p>"They didn't understand his mental condition and why he behaved differently from a normal person," he said.</p>
              <p>His only child would return home depressed and grouchy.</p>
              <p>"Bryan
               became afraid to return to camp. He also had terrible mood swings and 
              nightmares where he would wake up screaming," he said.</p>
              <p>The final straw came when Bryan told his parents about his suicidal thoughts.</p>
              <p>"I couldn't stand seeing him in that state. As parents, we had to do something," he said.</p>
              <p>Bryan's
               parents complained to the Military Medicine Institute and Bryan was 
              referred to a psychiatrist from the Psychological Care Centre and a 
              counsellor.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, his parents engaged a private psychiatrist.</p>
              <p>"Things improved for a while. He became more relaxed and the suicidal thoughts went away," he said.</p>
              <p><strong>ALLEGED MISTREATMENT</strong></p>
              <p>But as the alleged mistreatment by Bryan's superiors and peers continued, his condition regressed.</p>
              <p>"My
               son was on the verge of a complete mental breakdown when he was 
              ostracised and alienated in camp after his condition came to light. Not 
              even the counselling could help him any more," said the father.</p>
              <p>And
               just as Bryan's parents were feeling helpless, a medical review was 
              called and Bryan was given the lowest PES status, PES F, which exempted 
              him from national service, in March last year.</p>
              <p>"We're very lucky that he managed to get the right attention and help before something drastic happened.</p>
              <p>"That
               said, there is a system to help these mentally-ill soldiers. It all 
              depends on the people around them and whether there are any gaps in the 
              system," he said.</p>
              <p>The father also commended the military counsellor who helped his son.</p>
              <p>"My
               son would not have kept his sanity and may have done something drastic 
              if not for the counsellor. We are thankful for him," said the father.</p>
              <p>Bryan is now pursuing a diploma in psychology at a private institute.</p>
              <p>Said his father: "His condition has improved since his discharge and now that he is without the pressures of the army.</p>
              <p><strong>About PTE Ganesh</strong></p>
              <p>Private (PTE) Ganesh Pillay Magindren, 23, was found dead at the foot of his Sengkang condominium in July last year.</p>
              <p>The full-time national serviceman (NSF) was seeing a psychiatrist regularly for schizophrenia.</p>
              <p>The
               day before his death, Captain Jessie Goh had given him 14 days of extra
               duties for not signing a logbook, reporting late for work and 
              unsatisfactory work performance.</p>
              <p>She was the manpower officer at 
              24th Battalion Singapore Artillery and directly in charge of Pte Ganesh 
              when he was posted there in November 2012. He was assigned to clerical 
              work as an administrative support assistant.</p>
              <p>In the inquiry into 
              his death, State Coroner Imran Abdul Hamid said he had died from 
              multiple injuries sustained from a deliberate fall from height and that 
              he had known it would lead to his death.</p>
              <p>Mr Imran also said Pte Ganesh's army unit had lapses in managing his mental illness.</p>
              <p>An
               army directive said camps are supposed to keep a medical register of 
              servicemen with psychiatric illnesses. But Khatib Camp did not, the 
              coroner said.</p>
              <p>Unit commanders who are in charge of servicemen with
               psychiatric problems would need to be informed by a letter from the 
              Personnel Management Centre. But Pte Ganesh's unit did not receive any 
              such letter about his condition until a day before his death.</p>
              <p>Following
               the inquiry, the Ministry of Defence said in a statement that it will 
              study the State Coroner's findings carefully to improve and tighten its 
              procedures to ensure better compliance by Singapore Armed Forces units 
              in dealing with soldiers with mental problems.</p>

              is in regimentation and discipline.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Being in
              a uniformed organisation, you’ll have to obey orders from your
              superiors. Thus some of you may feel a sudden lack of freedom to do
              what you want and you may find yourself having difficulties
              accepting authority initially.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Regimentation and
              discipline build strong character and toughness, so that you’ll be
              tough enough to handle difficult combat, crime-fighting or rescue
              situations without giving up or breaking down.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">When you
              first enlist into NS, you may have concerns of being in a new
              territory, with new faces and new things to do. But don’t let this
              get to you. Just remember the saying that “when the going gets
              tough, the tough gets going”.</span></p>

              like you do or react to situations like you would. Instead of
              trying to select your type of people, you should cherish the
              diversity. This is a chance for you to learn more about your fellow

              you, you’ll have a much better appreciation of Singapore’s cultural

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Story by Benita Teo</p>
              <p><strong>Serving in the military is certainly no mean feat. And
              when the security of the nation is in one’s hands, mental strength
              is as important as, if not more so than, physical
              fitness.</strong><br> <br> When the going gets tough, it is often helpful to talk it out with
              a trusted family or friend. But, even with the best of intentions,
              not everyone is able to fully comprehend the intricacies of
              military life.<br> <br> To help the servicemen and women of the Singapore Armed Forces
              (SAF) cope with the challenges of their military roles, the
              counsellors of the SAF Counselling Centre (SCC) are always ready to
              lend a listening ear. In fact, the team at SCC provides
              professional counselling services not only to all members of the
              Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and SAF, but also to their
              families.<br> <br> <strong>Learning to live the military life</strong><br> <br> Unlike civilian counselling centres, the SCC comes under military
              mandate, and its primary purpose is to provide mental health care
              to ensure that servicemen are able to carry out their duties
              efficiently.<br> <br> Of the types of cases the SCC sees, Mrs Marlene Koh, Head of
              Education and Prevention Services, noted that the majority were
              Full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) with adaptation issues. "Not
              everybody is used to dealing with authority. They all came in as
              students who only had to take care of their own studies."<br> <br> She added: "The second, smaller group would be Regulars with career
              or family issues. A third group comprises families and soldiers
              affected by critical incidents that happened around them, for
              instance training incidents or a death in the family."<br> <br> Servicemen in distress may seek help directly with the SCC through
              two channels: face-to-face sessions or the 24-hour SAF Counselling
              Hotline. On top of these, a Family Support Helpline is also
              available for the family members of soldiers deployed overseas who
              are in need of assistance.<br> <br> <strong>Eyes and ears on the ground</strong><br> <br> To help junior and senior commanders to identify and assist men
              under their charge who are at risk of emotional distress, the SCC
              conducts regular workshops. In addition to basic counselling
              skills, stress management and suicide prevention are also taught at
              the workshops.<br> <br> Ms Cheryl Chia, an SCC counsellor with 14 years of experience,
              explained that equipping commanders with these skills is essential
              because "they are the eyes and ears on the ground".<br> <br> Another set of eyes that the SCC relies on to spot at-risk
              servicemen are the paracounsellors - Regulars who volunteer to help
              look after the mental welfare of servicemen at the unit level. To
              be appointed as paracounsellors, they have to go through a five-day
              course organised by the SCC that teaches basic counselling, suicide
              prevention and crisis management skills.<br> <br> Military Expert (ME) 3-3 Sulinder Singh, a Logistics Warrant
              Officer, has been a paracounsellor in his unit, 201 Squadron (SQN),
              since 2010. And being a familiar face in the unit means that
              servicemen know what to expect when they confide in him -
              trustworthiness.<br> <br> "I'm quite approachable, and they know that if they talk to me, it
              will be confidential."<br> <br> <strong>Allaying fears</strong><br> <br> Besides assuaging doubts over client confidentiality, the
              counsellors and paracounsellors also dispelled the stigma of
              seeking help.<br> <br> "(For) those who are in a position of command, it may be a 'face'
              issue," said SCC counsellor Lawrence Yap. "But so far, I've not
              encountered any clients (Regulars) who claimed that attending
              counselling affected their careers."<br> <br> ME3-3 Singh echoed his sentiments: "Is there a stigma attached to
              people in the unit who see paracounsellors? No, not at all. They
              are not mentally ill, we just need to help them find the right way
              to organise their thoughts."<br> <br> <strong>The counsellor is in</strong><br> <br> Help for a distressed soldier often begins with a visit to the
              Medical Officer (MO) with complaints of symptoms of stress. Said Ms
              Chia: "Usually they will say that they are unable to sleep or eat.
              When the MOs probe deeper and realise that the problem goes beyond
              a medical issue, they will refer them to us."<br> <br> At the SCC, the soldier will be assigned a counsellor. Through the
              sessions, counsellor and soldier will work together to identify the
              problems and set goals towards overcoming them. The counsellor will
              also impart skills such as stress or anger management
              techniques.<br> <br> When facing mental turmoil, a soldier may despair and lose his
              sense of self. One approach a counsellor may take is to remind him
              of his capabilities.<br> <br> "Counselling is about instilling a sense of hope," said Mr Yap, who
              specialises in substance and drug addiction counselling. "Everyone
              has it in them to overcome a difficult situation. We just need to
              help them see that they are not as helpless as they think they are,
              and that the situation is not as hopeless as they think it
              is."<br> <br> SCC counsellors also work with psychiatrists and psychologists from
              the Psychological Care Centre (PCC) at the SAF Medical Corps'
              Military Medicine Institute to provide all-round care to the
              soldier. PCC psychiatrists prescribe medication for conditions like
              depression while psychologists run tests to ascertain if a
              behavioural problem is linked to a learning or intellectual
              disability.<br> <br> <strong>Helping others help themselves</strong><br> <br> With the ever-evolving social landscape, counsellors must stay
              up-to-date on new behavioural problems or addictions, such as
              social media addiction.<br> <br> Mrs Koh also pointed out that there are now more cases of
              servicemen suffering anxieties about not performing well or meeting
              expectations, and that many expected others to solve their
              problems.<br> <br> Mr Yap agreed: "To change, clients have to take personal
              responsibility for their actions."<br> <br> Nonetheless, the counsellors take comfort in the knowledge that
              they are changing lives for the better.<br> <br> Mrs Koh remembered a recruit who had attempted suicide after his
              girlfriend of four years ended their relationship and started
              seeing a friend of his behind his back. Mrs Koh helped him
              acknowledge his feelings of hurt and disappointment, and taught him
              constructive ways of managing his anger.<br> <br> The recruit started to improve his relationship with his family and
              make new friends in his unit. Nine months later, he was finally
              able to move on from the break-up.<br> <br> Ms Chia also recounted a recent case: "I had a client who wanted to
              kill himself. But after working with his unit and the psychiatrist,
              just before his ORD (Operationally Ready Date) he said, 'You gave
              me hope. Even though life ahead will be challenging, at least I
              know now that there are people who care, and that there is more to
              life than thinking about hurting myself.'"<br> <br> She added: "He even baked us cupcakes as a 'thank you'. It's the
              little things like these (that let me know I’ve made a
              difference)."</p>

              <p>Handling a mentally ill soldier is not easy. They require proper
              attention and a suitable working environment for them to thrive,
              said psychiatrists contacted by The New Paper. For this to happen,
              the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) has to take ownership of its
              soldiers, Dr Ang Yong Guan said.<br> <br> Dr Ang, who is in private practice, was the head of the
              Psychological Care Centre (PCC) at the Military Medicine Institute
              during his 23 years with the SAF from 1986 to 2003.<br> <br> He said that of his 4,500 patients, there are fewer than 10 cases
              of full-time national servicemen (NSF).<br> <br> "I forward each NSF's case to the SAF. I believe the organisation
              should be responsible for its own soldiers," he said.<br> <br> But he thinks that the majority of these cases do not get picked
              up.<br> <br> "(When I was at PCC) I always made it a point to monitor those
              soldiers who had severe mental illnesses. I would even call their
              private psychiatrists to find out more.<br> <br> "Only if the organisation's leaders are committed to monitoring and
              helping these patients can they be given the right attention and
              help," Dr Ang said.<br> <br> Consultant psychiatrist Ken Ung of Adam Road Medical Centre said
              that when a soldier is found to be mentally ill, steps should be
              taken to ensure he is placed in a suitable working
              environment.<br> <br> Dr Ung, who sees about 30 to 50 cases of NSFs a month, said that
              superiors and colleagues should also understand that problematic
              soldiers may not always be trying to play the system.<br> <br> BE UNDERSTANDING<br> <br> "There are cases where the superiors are very understanding and
              sympathetic towards their condition and always willing to listen to
              them, and (the patients) thrive," he said.<br> <br> But those who had difficult bosses could lead to a downward spiral
              of the soldier's condition, he said.<br> <br> "I've had such patients who became more and more depressed,
              constantly had nightmares. Parents would complain about their
              behaviour and some even had suicidal thoughts," he said.<br> <br> Superiors should give their subordinates the benefit of the doubt,
              said Dr Ung, adding that they should be proactive and take the time
              to find out if their soldiers are all right.<br> <br> "The SAF is a microcosm of society. It's inevitable that you will
              get soldiers who are mentally ill. So you should learn how to
              handle and manage them."<br> <br> The Ministry of Defence (Mindef) said in a statement on Tuesday
              that it will study the State Coroner's findings carefully to
              improve and tighten its procedures to ensure better compliance by
              Singapore Armed Forces units in dealing with soldiers with mental
              problems.<br> <br> This article was published on April 12, 2014 in The New Paper.</p>
