Nobody wants to fail any exams, it's not our fault, why do we have to pay such a heavy price just to defer NS?<br><br>Why should we go through more than the girls? Why couldn't we have the equal chance as girls to re-take O levels without going to a private school? We've already lost out to them on ns, I don't see why I have to lose out to girls just because of NS, girls should lose out to us as we've contributed more to the nation and not the other way round.<br><br>You know how ridiculous it is to re-take five subjects when you only need to re-take one? The deferment rules should change especially since polys now start term at april which means majority of guys can start poly before 18 even if they re-take O levels.
