              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>I have a question for all you guys who have either completed National Service, doing it now or going to do it soon. My question is this:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">How does Singapore National Service affect Singaporean Identity?</span></span></span></strong> </p>
              <p>So how do you think singapore National Service effects your identity?</p>
              <p>Does it shape you? Give you a bonding experience?</p>
              <p>I'm interested to hear your thoughts</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-US">Thanks</span></p>

              <p>reduce to 1 yr is not the problem.</p>
              <p>the problem comes when your "enemies" (*ahem* friendly competitors) starts to question the fighting capabilities of your armed forces, and starts to coerce your country for concessions through threats of force of arms.</p>
              <p>ultimately, singaporeans will end up paying the price for those "concessions", either in blood, cash, women or watever you have.</p>

              <p>Spore boosted to have the advance technology and capabilities of 1st class weapons. So, in my opinion, why still not reduce to 1 yr?</p>
              <p>Everything is computerised and what the boys need to learn more is the handling the computerised weapon/technology and not running here and there like a mad dog. And with those bad eggs/sadists in the army, making life more terrible to the boys.</p>
              <p>I am not saying we totally scrape off the excerises part, but mindef and ministers can at least consider the options of reducing the ns. Not totally shut off any ideas. Just like the old guards, wont want to listen to the grounds till nasty things happen (GRC won by opp) then they start to wake up.</p>

              <p>After 2 yrs, some immediately look for jobs while others go further studies. By the time they completed their studies, how old already? And then go to work, attached, married...how old already? And decided to plan for a baby, how old already? And also will mounting debts....that is why our 2 yrs ns is taking away their boys opportunities.</p>

              <p>I do agreed the serving ns will make one more mature then those
                      people who never serve ns before. They are more discpline too. That
                      I agreed.</p>
              <p>After 2 yrs, some immediately look for jobs while others go
                      further studies. By the time they completed their studies, how old
                      already? And then go to work, attached, married...how old already?
                      And decided to plan for a baby, how old already? And also will
                      mounting debts....that is why our 2 yrs ns is taking away their
                      boys opportunities.</p>

              <p>to help singaporean man, i recommend that govt gives all newly wed singapore couple (at least man or women must be singaporean who has served his NS) be given a free HDB 4 room flat at $0 dollar, but the couple must remain married for at least 15 years before they can sell their unit.</p>
              <p>but if they have one child, the couple can sell their unit after 10 years instead of 15.</p>
              <p>if the couple have two child, the couple can sell their unit after 7 years instead of 15.</p>
              <p>if the couple have three child, the couple can sell their unit after 5 years instead of 15.</p>
              <p>if the couple have four child, the couple can sell their unit after 4 years instead of 15.</p>
              <p>couple with 4 children, will also enjoy full GST refund annually for 20 years based on income tax return, plus monthly govt subsidies up to $1,000 dollar and a pair of free return air ticket to any country. </p>
              <p>additional children will give couple special advance placement in applying for school, new HDB flat, car COE discount, blah blah blah...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>these additional pro-family expenses will need to be covered, but the govt cant afford to dig into its reserve nor cut its expenses in other department.</p>
              <p>therefore, i will propose that any singaporeans who remain single after the age of 30 must pay 10% "left on the shelf, cant get married income tax".</p>
              <p>if they cant get married by age of 40, they must pay 25% "Stuck on the shelf, hopelessly cant get married income tax".</p>
              <p>by age of 50, they must pay 50% "Rot on the shelf, give also no one want income tax".</p>
              <p>by age of 60, they will be allow to be exempt from the taxes under the "govt give up on you, you can go and rot in the old folk home alone" special tax exemption clause.</p>
