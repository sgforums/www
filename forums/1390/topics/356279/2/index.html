              <p><a href="../../../users/252516">M@nvvhore</a>, so what vocation are you serving in currently? Are you in a combat unit?</p>
              <p>I think if you're genuinely interested in becoming an SOF trooper, you should see if you have a chance to speak to some of the members. I guess you can show up at their SAF day booth or something.</p>
              <p>But remember, the military is a career. You don't join for fun, and you must prepare to make it a life long career. Also, are you a spec or an officer? Officers rotate out of SOF more frequently than enlisted men, so that's something else to consider.</p>
              <p>In any case, don't be motivated by all the stuff you see in movies. It's a physically and mentally demanding profession, and your life is on the line when your country demands it. If you just want to be a "badass" like the guys in the movies, then the world's safer if you're not trying out for the SOF.</p>
              <p>Military pay generally isn't going to be as good as if you graduate from university and have a white collar job. People don't do it for the money.</p>
              <p>I'd definitely say give yourself a little more time in the army to see if you like the regimented lifestyle.</p>

              <p>i suggest you wait till you get enlisted and try the life as a green soldier then make your comments cos being in special forces doesnt always mean wearing black kit and storm buildings everyday. There will be still jungle training etc to do. There are times you also have to do mundane military tasks and also endure everyday army bullshit. There are guys i know who are fit and have the could do everything the army ask to do, but they hated the bullshit and would not signed on even if their lifes depend on it.(Myself included <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">)</p>
              <p>Also its not all about physical brawn and able to stand hardship and pain. You still have to be able to grasp diving physics and calculations for demolitions. If you dont have the aptitude for it, you will never get selected.</p>
              <p>For a person who claim interest in the unit, you lack thinking. if a green infantry unit could have snipers, why shouldnt a specialised unit have snipers? Anyway i am not here to flame, but your posts just screamed of fanboy.</p>

              <p>ok, why specialist should have snipers? well, i can think of loads of reasons. if the SOF was say...um..deployed somewhere. but they needed snipers. well, instead of carting a ggroup of green snipers, they use SOF snipers, which 1) doesnt involve the whole army then and 2) adds for morale and much better team work for theres a higher chance that they will know each other. ANd if they were deployed somewhere that they needed their expertise in so and so AND they needed snipers, well, the snipers will be struggling cause they didnt have the same trainning as the rest. I mean snipers that could of in trouble, or the situation need be, could cut their losses and join the rest of the team. The SAS do this. BTW most special forces of the world eg. SAS, delta, SEALs, Green berets, GIGN, GSG9 etc trian their OWN snipers so i cant see why SOF dont either. major disadvantage. So no i dont lack thinking.</p>
              <p>And i know you need thinking and smarts.Thats why theres SELECTION and Thats why  i always facinated with Special forces. These guys hve to be both mentally and physically tough and both smart and atheletic- i wanted to see if i could take that trainning and abuse myself.  Ok, i dont wanna be flamed or seen as just a dickhead but u know, i hope u guys understand. i know you have to be tough and i could be the one that goes home crying to mummy or i could be the one that excells. i know  and the reason why i brought up snipers was becuase i recently saw a documentary on utube bout the history of snipers and they a few days back, wached Jarhead. so yeh...kinda got me hooked. but im not the kinda guy that would jump around pretending to be a sniper in my undies.</p>

              <p>Don't give me cock-and-bull stories about "common sense" when you simply have no idea what you're talking about.  For example, you didn't know that the 1993 cohort that passed selection was from a range of different formations, did you?  You didn't know that many of the guys who sign up for selection would only consider signing on if they passed selection, did you?</p>
              <p>Were you ever part of the Commando formation?  How much time have you spent at Hendon Camp?  Apart from one

              <p>But remember, the military is a career. You don't join for fun,
                  and you must prepare to make it a life long career. Also, are you a
                  spec or an officer? Officers rotate out of SOF more frequently than
                  enlisted men, so that's something else to consider.</p>
              <p>In any case, don't be motivated by all the stuff you see in
                  movies. It's a physically and mentally demanding profession, and
                  your life is on the line when your country demands it. If you just
                  want to be a "badass" like the guys in the movies, then the world's
                  safer if you're not trying out for the SOF.</p>
              <p>Military pay generally isn't going to be as good as if you
                  graduate from university and have a white collar job. People don't
                  do it for the money.</p>
              <p>I'd definitely say give yourself a little more time in the army
                  to see if you like the regimented lifestyle.</p>

              <p>Just one thing to add - the nature of the training certainly increases your chances of being involved in a BOI at some point or other.  Not giving away too many details, but try picturing your being investigated when a trainee dies under your charge, and consider carefully if your career plan accommodates for that.</p>

              <p>The current SOF commander was from my batch in 1CDO.  He has a degree and could more than easily find a white collar job, but he chose to come back and serve.  I personally know a number of ex-SOF NCOs who finished their contracts and are making pretty good money in white-collar jobs now.  Just because they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">choose</span> to join SOF doesn't mean that they don't have any other options.</p>

              <p>ok, why specialist should have snipers? well, i can think of
              loads of reasons. if the SOF was say...um..deployed somewhere. but
              they needed snipers. well, instead of carting a ggroup of green
              snipers, they use SOF snipers, which 1) doesnt involve the whole
              army then and 2) adds for morale and much better team work for
              theres a higher chance that they will know each other. ANd if they
              were deployed somewhere that they needed their expertise in so and
              so AND they needed snipers, well, the snipers will be struggling
              cause they didnt have the same trainning as the rest. I mean
              snipers that could of in trouble, or the situation need be, could
              cut their losses and join the rest of the team. The SAS do this.
              BTW most special forces of the world eg. SAS, delta, SEALs, Green
              berets, GIGN, GSG9 etc trian their OWN snipers so i cant see why
              SOF dont either. major disadvantage. So no i dont lack
              thinking.</p>
              <p>And i know you need thinking and smarts.Thats why theres
              SELECTION and Thats why  i always facinated with Special
              forces. These guys hve to be both mentally and physically tough and
              both smart and atheletic- i wanted to see if i could take that
              trainning and abuse myself.  Ok, i dont wanna be flamed or
              seen as just a dickhead but u know, i hope u guys understand. i
              know you have to be tough and i could be the one that goes home
              crying to mummy or i could be the one that excells. i know 
              and the reason why i brought up snipers was becuase i recently saw
              a documentary on utube bout the history of snipers and they a few
              days back, wached Jarhead. so yeh...kinda got me hooked. but im not
              the kinda guy that would jump around pretending to be a sniper in
              my undies.</p>

              <p>Then and only then should you seriously start to think whether or not the army life is for you. I have always advised people to do BMT first before deciding whether or not to sign on.</p>

              <p>ok, why specialist should have snipers? well, i can think of
                  loads of reasons. if the SOF was say...um..deployed somewhere. but
                  they needed snipers. well, instead of carting a ggroup of green
                  snipers, they use SOF snipers, which 1) doesnt involve the whole
                  army then and 2) adds for morale and much better team work for
                  theres a higher chance that they will know each other. ANd if they
                  were deployed somewhere that they needed their expertise in so and
                  so AND they needed snipers, well, the snipers will be struggling
                  cause they didnt have the same trainning as the rest. I mean
                  snipers that could of in trouble, or the situation need be, could
                  cut their losses and join the rest of the team. The SAS do this.
                  BTW most special forces of the world eg. SAS, delta, SEALs, Green
                  berets, GIGN, GSG9 etc trian their OWN snipers so i cant see why
                  SOF dont either. major disadvantage. So no i dont lack
                  thinking.</p>
              <p>And i know you need thinking and smarts.Thats why theres
                  SELECTION and Thats why  i always facinated with Special
                  forces. These guys hve to be both mentally and physically tough and
                  both smart and atheletic- i wanted to see if i could take that
                  trainning and abuse myself.  Ok, i dont wanna be flamed or
                  seen as just a dickhead but u know, i hope u guys understand. i
                  know you have to be tough and i could be the one that goes home
                  crying to mummy or i could be the one that excells. i know 
                  and the reason why i brought up snipers was becuase i recently saw
                  a documentary on utube bout the history of snipers and they a few
                  days back, wached Jarhead. so yeh...kinda got me hooked. but im not
                  the kinda guy that would jump around pretending to be a sniper in
                  my undies.</p>

              <p>thats what i am trying to imply... hey i wanna screw Angelina Jolie, but everyone knows its impossible. Talking and actual attempt is two different things.</p>
              <p>Watching movies does not really gives you a lowdown to army life...they just skimmed through the daily bullshit and sorts. And believe me there are people in the army who prioritise bullshit than actual soldiering...</p>

              <p> well you know about diving watches and its owners...</p>
              <p>About the misleading bullshit, only those who are in the know have the info, and if ithe person does not need to know, he doesnt.</p>
              <p>i had an ATGM coursemate who is are with "them" and he does not go around talking about it. And If he didnt ask any questions during the course, i would have thought he was mute....very quiet guy.</p>
