              <p>That doesn't mean you know how it goes in SOF.  I ask

              <p>I suggest you sit quietly by the side and let the guys who know
              what they're talking about do the talking.  Stop trying to

              <p>So <a href="../../../users/252516">M@nvvhore</a>, you're only 16? Well, that doesn't mean you can't aspire to join the SOF.</p>
              <p>But you'll want to give yourself a little more time to find out about other options before you enlist. The main thing you can work on for now is you physical fitness. Go run 5km everyday and see if you can get your 2.4km timing to go into the 8min range.</p>
              <p>Also, one thing I remembered too about the SOF guys...they all have colorful medical histories. I was in the same room once for a medical check-up in PLAB with about 8 to 10 of them. When the doctor asked about past injuries, it took about a half an hour for them to finish describing their various broken bones and stuff.</p>
