              <p>For all those who has yet to pack their stuff for enlistment day,
              here's a list of "essential items". Well, if you are garang enough, you
              may always try to enlist with nothing other than the clothes you wore.<br> <br> 1) Non-camera handphone.<br> (All handphone with cameras are prohibited items. A good choice of
              handphone for BMT are those &lt;$100 non-cam phones from 7-11. Don't
              bring expensive phones to BMT. Also, you are NOT ALLOWED to carry
              handphone around in camp, and handphones can only be used inside your
              bunk. Theft is also a concern)<br> <br> 2) Portable/ battery-operated handphone charger<br> (you are expect to make ur phone last until you book out.)<br> - Can ignore if<br> - You plan to use your phone for SMS only<br> - You have spare batteries or spare handphone<br> <br> 3) Hangers<br> (You are expected to use hangers not only for hanging clothes, and also for drying clothes too. Around 5 will do.)<br> <br> 4) extra PT shirts and shorts. <br> There will be 5BX everyday at 0530hrs, plus PT later in the day. Unless
              you are willing to re-wear your sweaty shirts, better buy 2 or more
              sets or PT shirt and admin shirt.<br> <br> 5) Coins<br> get at least $10 coins. You would miss spending money. And only near
              the end of BMT then are you allowed to go to the canteen. meanwhile,
              the drinks vending machines would do.<br> <br> 6) Money<br> As mentioned in 5, you will not have any chance to spend money. And you
              are strongly encouraged to go straight home when you book out. So,
              bring just enough money for your taxi fare. Again, theft is an issue.<br> Bring $2 for haircut. (no no, haircut is not free.)<br> <br> 7) 1 set of toiletries.<br> toothbrush, toothpaste, shaver etc. the set that they are going to issue are for show only. Ask your sergeant to explain.<br> <br> 8) Bank acc. number.<br> There will be talks by Aviva insurance asking you to sign up for their
              $100k coverage. fees will be deducted via giro, thus the need for your
              bank acc. number. It is highly advisable to sign up. (People DO die in
              BMT)<br> <br> 9) Bring some books, magazines along. can be shared around or for
              topics of discussion. If you are close to your instructors, they might
              even lend you a couple of FHMs. =D<br> <br> Things not to bring:<br> 1) Lock. they will issue you with a combination lock. They will not let
              you use your own lock anyway. so ignore the recommendation list they
              gave.<br> <br> 2) Food and snacks. No food allowed until you are given permission to bring snacks in. Rats are an issue in some buildings.<br> <br> 3) Handphone charger, camera handphones. even if you can sneak it in,
              you won't be able to bring it back out. and if caught, be prepared to
              stay back over the weekends.<br> <br> 4) PSP, nintendo DS etc.<br> Recruits are not allowed to bring in these. Wait for permission to be given.<br> <br> 5) playing cards. no gambling is allowed. <br> <br> Don't fool around with your weekends by being a clown. <br> <br> <br> What to expect on enlistment day:<br> <br> Going there:<br> Queue up at pasir ris interchange for SAF shuttle bus to SAF ferry
              terminal. There will be soldiers ushering enlistees and guests.<br> Do not drive to SAF ferry terminal directly. It is not open for access by vehicles other than the shuttle buses.<br> <br> At SAF ferry terminal:<br> everyone will board the ferry for P.Tekong. Everyone are to bring along
              their NRIC, concession pass etc, as they will be scanned for headcount.<br> <br> P.Tekong:<br> Parents and enlistees will be separated after reaching P.Tekong jetty. <br> Parents will be given a guided tour of the camp grounds.<br> Enlistees will be ushered to surrender their NRIC for SAF 11B, and
              collect their slingbag. A contact number for their company line will be
              given, to be pass to parents for purpose of emergency.<br> <br> Enlistees will proceed to auditorium for swearing in, followed by address by CO of BMT sch, in presence of parents.<br> <br> after swearing in, Recruits will have last meal with parents at the cookhouse, before falling in and starting army life.<br> Your equipment will be issued to you thereafter. Please replace faulty
              items and uniforms, before the given deadline, or you will have to
              replace them out of your own pocket.<br> <br> And after that, you will soon have your dreaded haircut. no point
              shaving your head outside, unless you plan to shave bald or cut until
              really short cause they will still want their $2 profit and shave you
              again. Bring exact change.<br> Tip: Don't let the tranny cut your hair. Observe and you will understand why. Take your time.<br> <br> Lights out at 2200hrs. <br> <br> For confinement week of BMT, its still the honeymoon week, and they
              won't be too demanding. Things will get progressively tougher. <br> Life would be boring in the first few weeks, with all the talks and
              lectures. Be mentally prepared. It is not like the POW camp you
              imagined.<br> <br> All the Best for your enlistment day!</p>
