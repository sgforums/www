            <div class='col-md body'>SAF backing us up? Not very likely... But then they'll still get you if something happened to the camp and you didn't take action.<br><br>Usually one would try to apprehend the person breaking in through non violent means... force is only used when the person is resisting or acting aggressively. Deadily force is only applied when there is a serious threat to life or property... for example... according to the ROE it's justified to cap somebody who who see planting a bomb or trying to set fire to something... but only after one has challanged and confirmed the situtation.<br><br>In any case, the use of firearms is a very serious matter and one can expect them to pick it to the bone... can you imagine the paperwork and investigation? Also, what if you cap somebody and it turns out to be a misunderstanding?</div>

It was during my brother's parent's visiting day in Nee Soon camp. My parents and brother withnessed a group of armed (with parangs and steel bars) gangsters went into camp to settle an old debt. At that time, most bengs are enlisted in Nee Soon camp while A level batch enlisted in Tekong. Common to have fights in the coffee shop outside the old guardroom.<br><br>Anyway, the guards and guard comm, under the instruction of the DO (maybe higher authority?!?!?) ran away from the guardroom with their rifles and ammo fearing that the gangsters may grab their rifles. Chaotic! family, NSF alike running around for cover.<br><br>(2) Another story, happened at night in 1984 i think. Old Commando camp, gangsters entered the camp too. Old camp was quite open on top of a hill. Don't have the details cos my brother didn't say much.<br><br>Having heard these first hand stories, i strongly believe similar incidents may have happened during those days.<br><br>Having served as a DO in the mid 90's, i was certainly not trained or briefed to handle crowd control. Guards are more concerned not to lose thier live ammo (you guys know what i mean) The group of transvettes tried forcefully to enter my camp once (2am if i remember), apparently under the invitation of a staff sgt. Guardcomm panicked big time and the guardroom totally lost control. Thank fully they were not armed, not even with a half dick haha.<br><br>Anyway, good old days, I strongly believe camp are much better protected these days.</div>

Precision bombing techniques. Nowadays if got pai kia chiong into camp, DO can just call in the F-15 Strike Eagle to do precision bombing. Thats why Spore Air Force bought these new airplanes recently.</blockquote>no lah.....SG so small......even precision bombing will cause area-explosion and damage the camp itself....how can? somemore, later the top army brass people will charge you for vandalising and destroying SAF property.

KNN! overseas armies all chiong one loh. their idea is "go into battle and take down the enemy regardless of how much it takes" instead of "go into battle and take down the enemy using as little ammo as possible and if possible, save all ammo as you've to do paper work later".<br><br>haiz......read in the news a few days back about the british army. one of their comrades kenna shot by terrorists. the rest of his fellow army mates all go berserk and defy army orders. they get into the Apache, strap themselves on the wings of the copter, and all chiong into the enemy base and succeded.<br>by right cannot strap people onto wings of apache, but they are real men and don't care liao.<br><br>if it's SG army in the same scenario, then the soldiers will ask platoon SGT, and platoon SGT will ask platoon commander, platoon commander will seek 2IC advice and 2IC will ask OC. OC will then consult Base 2IC and Base 2IC report to CO. CO will do some paper work and feedback to top brass paper generals. paper generals sit in office and do real paper work.....haiz....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>    quote:Guards are more concerned not to lose thier live ammo (you guys know what i mean) The group of transvettes tried forcefully to enter my camp once (2am if i remember), apparently under the invitation of a staff sgt. Guardcomm panicked big time and the guardroom totally lost control. Thank fully they were not armed, not even with a half dick haha.<br><br>one thing i noticed about SG army is that they're overly concerned about rounds and don't dare to fire when it's needed. it's like, losing one bullet will kill the whole holy government and country like that.....then when real war comes how? do we still have the time to sign in, sign out, stock-take the ammos? then our planes/tanks also need to carry clerks inside to record the number of rounds/missles/shells fired also is it? when battlion chiong to fight real war, got side-kicks to record the rounds fired and update the armskote accordingly also? </blockquote>It's easy to say "I will shoot the crap out of them if it was me!" but if your career, future or reputation is on the line, will you be so sure that it will be still the same? You can never truly understand how one feels in that situation unless you have been in one before.<br><br>You keep saying "if real war come how?". We wait for real war to come first loh... This is not real war, Pai Kias or ah guas try to get into an army camp is much more different from a real war. Also you quoted a member and say something along the line where "call police for what? ... means you're not capable of handling the situation". I want to ask you arh.. if you dun call police how? Even after you pin them down you want do what? End up still have to hand over to police... like as if u can keep them in DB liddat... =,=<br><br>If I were the guards, I would not have fired any rounds too even if they were armed. (Unless they start climbing over the closed gate den different story.) Handing such situation over to the police is the best. OH and btw if you try to say something like "in war can call police meh?", my only reply for you is to use some logic and common sense. This is not any terrorist case, there is no need for us to expand rifle rounds when such case can be easily solved by the police.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Nikar2:</div><div class="quote_body">(ignito)<br><br>that's total rubbish. in real war, how do u use mininal level of force? that means, you wait for terrorists/invaders to fire at you, you block the shot, then fire back 1 round(cannot waste too much precious SAF bullets mah!), they block and fire 3 rounds, then you fire 2 rounds, they shoot rocket launcher, then you throw smoke bomb and fire 1 round? KNN! overseas armies all chiong one loh. their idea is "go into battle and take down the enemy regardless of how much it takes" instead of "go into battle and take down the enemy using as little ammo as possible and if possible, save all ammo as you've to do paper work later".<br><br>haiz......read in the news a few days back about the british army. one of their comrades kenna shot by terrorists. the rest of his fellow army mates all go berserk and defy army orders. they get into the Apache, strap themselves on the wings of the copter, and all chiong into the enemy base and succeded.<br>by right cannot strap people onto wings of apache, but they are real men and don't care liao.<br><br>if it's SG army in the same scenario, then the soldiers will ask platoon SGT, and platoon SGT will ask platoon commander, platoon commander will seek 2IC advice and 2IC will ask OC. OC will then consult Base 2IC and Base 2IC report to CO. CO will do some paper work and feedback to top brass paper generals. paper generals sit in office and do real paper work.....haiz....</div></blockquote>its either u haven served ur ns yet , or u never read THE ROE thru out ur ns life before.<br><br>for ur infor , example , in iraq , MOST of the overseas soldiers u talking abt went into the battle with the orders of "only shoot when u r shot at" . unless u r dealing with a official army , then thats a different case. under the ROE , good guys always on the losing end.<br><br>and nope , those british soldiers did not defy any orders.<br>and nope , by right they can be strapped on to the attachment of the wings in times of emergencies. and this is not the 1st time soldiers strapped themselves on it  , juz that its not reported.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly, the bottomline is that I believe that the Singapore Armed Forces (Navy, Airforce, espcially Army) AND the Government will not support you.

            <div class='col-md body'>Lol.  Nikar2 is either really a pre-enlistee, or a troll.<br><br>Advice: Wait til u read ur first ROE card from the SAF before posting this kinda nonsense.<br><br>We are talking about ah bengs and pai kias with at best metal clubs and parangs, u wanna compare with terrorists with RPGs. (in ur fantasy world known as ROCKET LAUNCHER)<br><br>We talk about apples, u compare with orange juice. Apple can just put in plastic bag, and u talk about orange juice must pour in glass or cup or else will spill.<br><br>Hokkien got 1 saying, "One East, One West."<br>Chinese got another, "Chicken talk, Duck Speak."<br><br>You think all of the SAF personnel won't dare to squeeze the trigger when we really need to? U're wrong. As guard duty personnel, failure to perform functions in order to safeguard SAF property or personnel without a justifiable reason is a chargeable offense as well. So how?<br><br>Just to entertain you.  If a dumbass decides to stop outside the camp gate, brandish a gun, he'll be fair game if he does not comply with the guard personnel's instructions as well.<br><br>An incident that happened a long time ago.  Grass cutters sneaked into the camp on a sunday to cut grass cos the workers were illegal overstayers.  When the camp guards responded, they were orderd to load, cock and safe.  Front buggers even had bayonets attached.  Why? Cos the DO considers the grass cutting equipment to be a potential weapon as well.<br><br>An Army is an organization that functions on orders.  All our asses are covered by "orders."  If we are ordered to shoot by a superior officer, and the order is legal, we'd better shoot or else we are the ppl who will be in trouble.<br><br></div>
