            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I believe there are ROEs included in the SOP in the event such an incident happen. Also, its not that SG soldiers have no balls, but they are slightly more reliant on somebody to take the lead. If the guard com. or DO, loads and orders every one to take aim. Sets an example by firing the 1st shot, the rest will follow. Thus, someone whom is able to think clearly and be cool under such circumstances will be able to handle it beautifully.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Are a lot of the people here talking ORDed a long time ago and hence see it fit to blast the current batch of NSFs without even truly knowing what stuff they are made of?<br><br>I dunno about you, but in the camps where I've done guard com, the mentality was that as long as you are clear on the ROE, you'll know what to do. The ROE also has plenty of things to say on how to handle pia kias or people making trouble at the gate.<br><br>The bottom line is, don't let anybody who's not supposed to enter get into the camp... and the guys are more or less authorized to take whatever means to make it happen.<br><br>Shooting people is just one of this, but typically it's not encouraged unless those jokers where armed or about to cause some serious damage to you or the camp. But it's quite clear wat, when I was on guard com and I see some pia kias trying to enter the camp (assuming they can even get past the locked gate), I'll just turn out the guards and do riot drill, form a line of shields and batons with the shooters behind, call the DO, activate police loh.<br><br>If they start trying to climb the gate or toss molotov cocktail, start beating them with batons or worst come to worst, fire for effect loh. I'd rather one of the rioters buy it then my own men get injured or killed because we were holding back. I think our NSFs can do the job when it comes to it, not that it's easy but what's with this assumption that our guys are all too soft to fight when push comes to shove? Can you aim and shoot a rifle? Is a guy trying to harm you? What's the issue then?<br><br>Think any bunch of pia kias will still KBKB at this point? Maybe in the 70s, but now is a different era liao.</div>
