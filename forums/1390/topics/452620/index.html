              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A new study has placed National Service (NS) as a key indicator of integration for foreigners.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The report by the 
              Institute of Policy Studies seeks to examine what immigrants ought to 
              do, in order to be regarded as a full participating member of Singapore 
              society.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The study covered some 2,000 local and foreign born citizens.<br><br>They were asked several questions on what they thought were social markers of integration.<br><br>The study showed some perceptual gaps, which researchers said are cause for fault-lines within the community.<br><br>The biggest area of incongruence - that a son of a new citizen undergoes NS.<br><br>About
               70 per cent of Singaporeans feel it is an important indicator of 
              integration, while only about 40 per cent of new citizens think so.<br><br>The
               other top areas of divergent viewpoints are - a new citizen getting on 
              well with workplace colleagues, being gainfully employed, and having the
               ability to speak conversational English.<br><br>More Singaporeans than new immigrants feel these are all important attributes for integration.<br><br>The
               study also showed that Singaporeans who tend to be less inclusive are 
              tertiary educated, come from the middle income group, have strong family
               ties and are more nationalistic.<br><br>Researchers said it boils down to the group that feel the most threatened by the presence of foreigners.<br><br>However, the study also showed that Singaporeans embrace multi-racialism.<br><br>The
               study showed they do not expect foreigners to discard their cultural 
              identity, even as these foreigners embrace core beliefs held by 
              Singaporeans, such as meritocracy and religious tolerance.<br><br>On the
               policy implications of the study, researchers said the Singapore Armed 
              Forces may need to reach out more at the community level.<br><br>For example, in convincing first generation new citizens of the value of National Service.<br><br>They added that more could be done also to facilitate the learning of English among foreigners.<br><br>They have also called for more transparency in data on immigration.<br><br>These include details on specific sectors foreigners are employed in and the criteria for obtaining a PR status.<br><br>Researchers
               added businesses should also think about programmes to improve 
              workplace relations between Singaporeans and foreigners.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>

              <p>Previously integration was by two languages. Singlish and Pasar Malay.</p>
              <p>The young ones spoke Singlish  - Malay, Chinese, Indian, Sikh, Eurasian boys and girls spoke Singlish. The elders who spoke no English spoke Pasar Malay - Malay, Chinese, Indian, Sikh, Eurasian elders all spoke Pasar Malay. And there was harmony. There was the kampong spirit.</p>
              <p>When the kampong was gone, it was Singlish and Pasar Malay that held the community together. Slowly Pasar Malay fell away to disuse, as the younger generation grew up unable to speak Malay and were encumbered with Mandarin. Housing policy design to prevent ethnic enclaves affected the Malays and Indians only. They Chinese were everywhere, struggling with English and Mandarin. Gone also were the dialects, namely Hokkien, Cantonese, Teochew, and Hainanese. These were only spoken by the elders.</p>
              <p>The aloofness came about. We don't know the names of our neighbours, even after living next to each other for a number of years.</p>
              <p>Pol Pot tried to destroy the past and want to replace Cambodia culture with a new order as quickly as possible.</p>
              <p>Here the government did that insidiously. And now is trying to reverse the damage by integration and reviving the kampong spirit.</p>
