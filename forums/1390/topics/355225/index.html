              <p>OOC from spec course still can get posted to be an intel spec? Like that whats the point of finishing the course...</p>
              <p>Anyway, care to say more about your medical condition since without much info, you can't expect people to say much.</p>
              <p>Intel Specs don't really chiong sua anyway so how would that affect your condition, whatever it is of cos.</p>

              <p><br>Dont worry too much.</p>
              <p>1. if you have seizure they would immediately post you out.</p>
              <p>2. Talk your boss nicely and they will do revocation for you.</p>

              <p>My own suggestions on some of the ways you can go abt doing it :</p>
              <p>1) Check and confirm what is this Intel Spec about? The scope of this vocation. Is it consider a combat or service vocation. YOu may want to check with the chief clerk as he/she is the best person to ensure you are correctly posted to a vocation related to your PEs status. Pes E has limited vocations. Mainly either storeman or clerk.</p>
              <p>2 ) Talk to your direct superior or OC on your medical condition and see what they say.</p>
              <p>3 ) If you confirm that your vocation really has to go outfield, talk to the MO and seek his opinion. I find that excusing you outfield is of no use. He may not excuse you as Pes E is already excuse outfield according to medical directive. Even if you are L3. Ask him instead to write a memo stating that Pes E is automatically excuse outfield and tell him to state your condition that going outfield will trigger your condition. You cna only stay in base. Request him to recommend for revocation inside the memo if possible. Or he may MB you again to recommend revocation officially.</p>
              <p>Anyway, i hope it helps you. Unless something happens to you inside this unit, else revocation or post out request needs to be done more tactfully.. Becoz once inside a unit, it will be difficult to get out or revocate as alot of admin works got to be done.</p>

              <p><br>Ok.... seems like your PES E should be a perm since you say you are epileptic. Otherwise can you confirm??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>An Intel Spec is resposible for command post and drawing map overlays when deployed with the unit. May or may not be required to be reconissance trained (need to confirm). So yes. outfield is almost next to impossible. Did you OOC from ASLC??</p>

              <p>Enough has been said by the others. You should consider revocation if your condition is impairing you</p>

              <p>Hi guys, thanks for the advice, to SBST390, ya, my status is
              perm, and i ooced from ASLC. and to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fatum</span>, i dunno wat u meant by "i know
              what's ails you already" but, fyi, even after my attacks i stilll
              continued with my course and did my section battle course and
              almost get my golden bayonet until the very last week then they
              ooced me. And, hope you can really understand the feeling of those
              epileptics out there.</p>
              <p>It's true that staying indoor does not mean i won't go into
              seizure, however, if u compare the chances, it will probably be
              higher if i'm outdoor. and, as you know how fuck up the camp medics
              are, the response time will be much slower in outdoor. Please don
              see everyone as chao keng like those "regulars" did. thanks alot.
              By saying that, you've not just offended me, but most of the
              epileptics out there. SAF is so fuck up is becoz there are ppl like
              you who thinks everyone as chao keng, and to those who chao keng,
              pls don make ppl like us your scapegoat.</p>

              <p>oh ? .... so you know exactly what I'm trying to say, eh ? .... </p>
              <p>for someone who's so garang as to "almost" get a silver bayonet, I'm surprised to see you dissing the SAF in such a turnaround ....</p>
              <p>now you're an int spec, the ones who prepares the sand tables and stick little pins into the maps as the encik calls out MGRs to you, under shade in a nice command tent, thought most of the time you'd be INDOORS, not a sec com who charges around in the jungle, wearing muddy underwear, getting bitten by bugs, being wet and cold and hungry ..... does that equates a higher risk still ? do you mean to say that an encik screaming at you indoors is a different thing from an encik screaming at you outdoors ? ... or maybe having to dig a shit hole outdoors makes a difference, or maybe it's the combat rations ? ... or maybe it's the thought of burnt weekends following the unit around ? ... or maybe you'd be startled by a backfiring 5 tonner ? ....</p>
              <p>it appears to me, that you're simply still not satisfied with your posting, that you simply do not like the idea of going outfield anymore .... where is your line mister ? admin spec in an 8 to 5 place ? ...</p>
              <p>do you know why the SAF is farked up, don't blame people who get suspicious of chao kengs, why not blame the chao keng themselves, if you're not one yourself ?</p>
              <p>Sure, you're not chao keng, you made the connections yourself, you said the words ... prove it.</p>

              <p>Who ever said people who do well in SAF cannot scold the organisation and say it sucks? Its a well known fact that is does so whats wrong with saying that? I was nominated for Company Best Soldier during my time and i still say the organisation sucks even if some people have treated me well.</p>
              <p>There might be good and really hardworking people in the organisation but as a whole, it just sucks.</p>

              <p>Hi everyone again,</p>
              <p>To <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fatum</span>, you'll understand if you're an epileptic. There's no point in arguing with you, it's just like talking to a wall. Perhaps, to you, "indoor" and "outdoor" doesn't make a difference, that's becoz you're non-epileptic. I believe, for most NSF, we won't want to risk out lives serving this dread-ridden 1 yr 10 mths NS. FYI, I've been thru much worser stuffs in my previous companies which ppl termed it as the most shiong, so don come and bullshit with me about weekends, insect bites and watever shit. Perhaps, you're also ignorant, coz, alot of passionate regulars whom i know are now trying to get out of the system, no matter how good they are, the system just sucks. Also, dkcx and I are just trying our best to get the best out of NS even though we hate it so much, but why waste that NS life. Anyway, the purpose of me coming up with this topic is to clarify my doubts and not to find ways to "escape" in your point of view, didn't expect ppl like you to reply, but doesn't matter, it spices things up and make this topic interesting.</p>
              <p>To everyone, I've asked my boss, from what i'm told, he said becoz my unit that i'm currently in is undergoing operational phase, thus, there's a need for the S2 branch to "chiong sua" for e.g tactical movements, and a bit of sect comd leading. Also, there will be an intel course which involves recce in May. I have clarified my doubt with my boss during interview, he told me they have actually requested me to be posted out due to my frequency of the attacks and they need someone who can go outfield.</p>
              <p><br>A Big thanks to those who gave me advice, like dkcx, patiepie, lokey and rednano, really thanks alot to you guys.</p>

              <p><br>agree with you my man, no point risking ur life or ur health just for this short 2 yrs or less of service. totally not worth it.</p>
              <p>to me i think it's fair la, if you're certified by the docs and specialists that you are indeed required to downgrade, it means you genuinely have a health issue that isn't worth risking.</p>
              <p>whatever it is, take care of ur heath dude, and enjoy ur new posting. :)</p>

              <p>Truth be told, any S1 dept would be truly idiotic to put an epileptic on operational duty...And it would not be fair to anyone who has to carry the slack if he has a seizure in the field.</p>
              <p>Base/sedentary duties would suit him because it would be in the best interest of him and his mates/team/superiors/.</p>
              <p>In any case, TS should clarify with his Chief Clerk over the job scope of his Intel Spec posting. That will determine his next move. Speculation here doesn't help anything at all.</p>

              <p>is your epilepsey a "recent" condition, you must have known that you were epileptic BEFORE you were enlisted, no ? .... how come you were graded combat fit then ?</p>
              <p>Did you declare your condition before enlistment ? The system sucks cos you were graded combat fit inspite of your declaration ? So you went through BMT, and got posted to SISPEC, knowing your condition ? So the system failed you at pre-enlistment, during BMT, during SISPEC, and even after you were posted out ? ... now that I've put it this way, that's altogether a bit hard to swallow, neh ?That's why I said, I think I know exactly what ails you ....</p>
              <p>You weren't concerned enough about your own medical condition when you were in BMT, in SISPEC, and were garang enough to "almost" (ah, I like this, almost) get the silver bayonet, but you are now very concerned now that you were posted out ? or you were one of those fellows who "discovers" a lot of latent and dormant medical conditions never seen before in pre-enlistment days ? ...</p>

              <p>Seriously Fatum, fyi , I do know someone who pass NAPFA to get the 2 months reduction for BMT then upon enlisted, he get OOC for BMT later get downgraded to Pes E perm, I don't know abt the TS motive but if he's like the guy I know, I would say it's a pretty smart move. Btw being epilepsy does not mean that he's less fit than any of us, like the guy I know, if he can pass NAPFA surely he's fitness is certainly at a certain level, the guy I know happened to have epilepsy attack whenever he's tense otherwise he's as normal as any of us.</p>
