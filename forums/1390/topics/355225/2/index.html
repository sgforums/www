              <p>Seriously Fatum, fyi , I do know someone who pass NAPFA to get
              the 2 months reduction for BMT then upon enlisted, he get OOC for
              BMT later get downgraded to Pes E perm, I don't know abt the TS
              motive but if he's like the guy I know, I would say it's a pretty
              smart move. Btw being epilepsy does not mean that he's less fit
              than any of us, like the guy I know, if he can pass NAPFA surely
              he's fitness is certainly at a certain level, the guy I know
              happened to have epilepsy attack whenever he's tense otherwise
              he's as normal as any of us.</p>

              <p>Hi to everyone,</p>
              <p>Seems like there are alot of comotions, firstly, i'm an epileptic even b4 i enlist, i didn't declare becoz i thought of trying to earn more during the service. It's my fault that i didn't declare, one thing is becoz my first attack was in 2004 and the last in 2005, so total i had 2 attacks b4 enlisting. Anyway, i got kanned by the MOs for not declaring. No medications were given at that time, and, since it's dormant for 3 years, which is 2008, so, i didn't declare. Even before i enlist, i already know how fucked up the system is since my brother was once a regular.</p>
              <p>So, until recently, the attacks came back, i was given medication called tegratol at 200mg.And, my license are already revoked. <strong>So, according to Fatum, those "aspiring epileptics" if there's such a thing, pls do not have the attacks coz your license can be revoked if you can control.</strong> Also, my rank will be revert back to CPL soon, as told by my boss. Anyway, gotta book in tml at 9am, so, won't type much, and hm, i'll only see this forum next book out i guess. Thanks alot, this topic is interesting with Fatum. And, thanks alot to you guys. =)</p>
              <p>Seriously, i think this Fatum guy is a fucked up person, he's lucky not to be under me.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway on a serious note, IIRC about 10 years back the Singapore Medical Association actually did prepare guidelines regarding certifying people "fit to drive".</p>
              <p>Guidelines went something along this lines:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ol>
              <li>No brain lesion (Can't remember if it was a structural brain lesion)</li>
              <li>Seizure free for min 3 yrs</li>
              <li>EEG testing normal</li>
              <li>Not on anti-epileptic drugs for min 1 yr</li>
              </ol>
              <div>However, I think nothing came out of this an epileptics are still not allowed to drive.</div>

It's my fault that i didn't declare, one thing is becoz my first attack was in 2004 and the last in 2005, so total i had 2 attacks b4 enlisting. Anyway, i got kanned by the MOs for not declaring. No medications were given at that time, and, since it's dormant for 3 years, which is 2008, so, i didn't declare. Even before i enlist, i already know how fucked up the system is since my brother was once a regular.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">So, until recently, the attacks came back, i was given medication called tegratol at 200mg.And, my license are already revoked. <strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">So, according to Fatum, those "aspiring epileptics" if there's such a thing, pls do not have the attacks coz your license can be revoked if you can control.</strong> Also, my rank will be revert back to CPL soon, as told by my boss. Anyway, gotta book in tml at 9am, so, won't type much, and hm, i'll only see this forum next book out i guess. Thanks alot, this topic is interesting with Fatum. And, thanks alot to you guys. =)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Seriously, i think this Fatum guy is a fucked up person, he's lucky not to be under me.</p>

              <p>Aiyah, why must you always be so cynical? Usually I can smell
              the kengsters a mile away. I don't think this TS is one of

              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway on a serious note, IIRC about 10 years back the Singapore
              Medical Association actually did prepare guidelines for medical
              practitioners regarding certifying their patients fit to drive.</p>
              <p>Guidelines went something along this lines:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ol>
              <li>No brain lesion (Can't remember if it was a structural brain
              lesion)</li>
              <li>Normal EEG</li>
              <li>Seizure free for 3 years and off all anti-epileptic drugs for
              min 1 year</li>
              </ol>
              <div>However, I think nothing came out of this an epileptics are
              still not allowed to drive.</div>

              <p>WAHAHAHAHA ... nail on ! ... and I was right, wasn't i ? ... </p>
              <p>at
              least the chap was honest about not declaring an existing medical
              condition even before enlistment, he could have easily lied about
              getting it only during sispec ... a tiny credit to him perhaps .... </p>
              <p>but
              of course, like I said ... if something were to have happened to him
              .... whose fault would it have really been ? the person who failed to
              declare anything ? ... or the "farked up system" who would naturally
              have failed to provide for and anticipate for a medical condition
              that's not even stated on his medical records in the first place ?!?!?!
              ... So who's farked up ? ... he's now feeling bitter towards the system
              he tried to smoke through in the first place ? ...</p>
              <p>He's lucky he got through BMT and most of sispec without major mishaps, with-holding of important medical information, he could have been killed .... I think such cases should be a chargeable offense ...</p>
              <p>and you're right, the kid should learn some responsibility ... time to wake up your idea corporal !</p>
              <p>come to think of it ... how did the "farked up medics (TS sic) dealt with his previous attacks ? ... he's still around and typing wasn't he ? ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Ya, to chanjyj, I've been told that (must be responsible etc.) after my attacks come, and got kanned by alot of ppl. And, you know, most of the ppl at my age got driving license, and, ya, i'm one of those who wanted to have one, so i didn't delcare at all to any organisation, thinking back, if i drove and the attacks came, it would be disastrous...</p>
              <p>One thing i'm quite curious is how the TP knows of my condition and had my license revoked</p>
              <p>And...speaking of which, i'm quite embarrassed, it's like i'm causing alot of trouble instead of contributing. My intention were simple, just to earn more, but, i didn't know that the attacks will haunt me again and coz so much trouble..</p>
              <p>I've learnt from my mistakes and not to be selfish.</p>

Such people must declare their epilepsy condition when applying for a driving license. Once declared, application will automatically be rejected. For those who have already obtained their driving licenses, it is their duty to inform the authorities should they develop epilepsy subsequently. <br><br>In 1997, the Singapore Medical Association prepared medical guidelines for medical practitioners in Singapore to assist them in advising and certifying their patients with regards to fitness to drive. <br><br>The guidelines recommended that people with epilepsy may be allowed to drive a private vehicle if a person has:<br><br></span>

              <p>Narrow minded view.</p>
              <p>Eldaazure: Dont get upset. Wait you have another relapse, how? I am sure that your unit officers will post you out, because they also wanted to save their skin. After all, it is 2 years of NS, it is not worth to get injured ... Need to be selfish and save your skin too. </p>
              <p>But driving please, for the sake of yourself and others . You know what to do.</p>
              <p>THere is nothing wrong, going through BMT without declaring, Sick people dont usually want to keep reminding themself that they are unwell and usually forgot about it. I would encourage people to forgot that they are unwell and treat things as normal, for sake of good mental health.</p>
              <p>Eldaazure, if you have seizure in the outfield, there is really nothing the medics can do, but to wait for you to recover. <strong>So for the sake of your own psychological needs, it is better to stay in the office</strong>. It is really not comfortable to let people around worrying about you and starring at you when you relapse. </p>
              <p>Not to worry things are fine. I have seen people that are in worse condition than you. So humm. You are still the OK type.</p>

              Sick people dont usually want to keep reminding themself that they
              are unwell and usually forgot about it. I would encourage people to
              forgot that they are unwell and treat things as normal, for sake of
              good mental health."</p>
              <p><strong>I disagree. You are causing alot of headaches if anything happens to you.</strong></p>
              <p>"Eldaazure, if you have seizure in the outfield, <span style="color: #ff0000;">there is really
              nothing the medics can do, but to wait for you to recover</span>."</p>
              <p><strong>I don't know about this. Are medics allowed to jab him with diazepam; assuming it's in his kit? (TS may carry it with him for emergencies).</strong></p>

              <p>For the CMPB screening, it is best to dig out the medical records to declare as downgrading is difficult but, not many people do that.  </p>
              <p>diazepam injection is only given by MO, I dont remember it is a store item in BCS level. Seizure normally last for 1-3 mins. Just that it look scary.</p>

              <p>1. Nobody said dig out medical records mah. You said (I quote) "<span style="line-height: 16px; color: #333333; font-size: 14px;">THere is nothing wrong, going through BMT without declaring". <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">I think it is very wrong.</span></span></p>
              <p>2. Diazepa m - TS may have his own medicine "backup"?</p>
              <p>3. Depends on the type of seizure he is having.</p>
