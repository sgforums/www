              <p>I did something dumb.</p>
              <p>So, I am strictly banned from RSO. I can only RTU back to camp medical centre. <br>I am only able to RSI or call ambulance/ go A&amp;E hospitals for urgent medical problems. <br><br>So far, I only RSO at polyclinics/ TTSH. I never go private doctors/ GPs.</p>
              <p><br>I want to know how and if is it possible to get back this privilege withdrawn from me? <br><br>If I defy/ ignore this restriction order, will I be charged?<br><br>Am I right to say that I am being "marked down" by one of them: PS/ PC/ OC/ CSM/ MO?</p>

              SAF</span></span></strong><br> <br> 1. Overview<br> The military justice system in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is
              expected to treat every service personnel fairly and equally,
              regardless of race, rank or vocation.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"> <br> 2. Multi-levelled Approach</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The military justice system is based on the SAF Act, which was
              implemented in 1972. All servicemen are subjected to the SAF Act,
              SAF Regulations, and orders of whatever form issued pursuant to
              them.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">While discipline is paramount in the military, not all offences
              committed by SAF servicemen are dealt with by formal investigations
              and charges. Essentially, offenders can be dealt with either by way
              of informal or formal punishment systems.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"> <br> 3. Informal Punishment System<br> Commanders are empowered to mete out informal punishments like
              push-ups and weekend confinement to servicemen who have committed
              disciplinary breaches, like being late, sluggish, or improperly
              dressed.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">4. Formal Punishment System<br> If the offence that a serviceman committed is of a more serious
              nature, he may be formally dealt with by his disciplinary officer
              by way of a summary trial, or brought before a subordinate military
              court (more commonly known as the General Court Martial or
              GCM).</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">(a) Summary Trial</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The offences that can be dealt with by summary trial are
              essentially military offences, such as absence without leave
              (AWOL), non-compliance with lawful orders or insubordination.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">Depending on the rank of the serviceman in question, and the type
              of the disciplinary body hearing the case, the possible sentences
              that may be imposed can vary, and these can include fines or
              detention.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The summary trial is carried out in accordance with relevant SAF
              regulations, and the records of the summary trial are sent to the
              office of the Director, Legal Services of the SAF.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">(b) General Court Martial</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The General Court Martial exists as a separate forum from that of
              the summary trial. Unlike the summary trial, the GCM can deal with
              a wider range of offences, and can impose a wider range of
              punishments including imprisonment and discharge, on top of
              sentences like detention and fines. The GCM is also a more public
              and open forum, and its proceedings are conducted using similar
              legal rules and procedures as those used in a civil criminal
              court.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">Generally, only serious offences investigated by the Military
              Police Command, and which are referred to the office of the
              Director of Legal Services, will result in the accused serviceman
              being charged in a GCM. In such a case, a military prosecutor will
              draw up a formal charge sheet and present it before the GCM.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">General Courts Martial can be further sub-divided into two
              categories, namely the Panel Courts Martial - consisting of a
              President and usually two other members, and Judge Courts Martial -
              consisting of a single President only.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">Currently, the practice is for military offences to be heard by
              Panel Courts Martial, while civil offences like misuse of drugs and
              penal code offences may be dealt with by a Judge Court Martial.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"><br> The current policy is also for an NSman, who is or was a District
              Judge in the Subordinate Courts, to preside in a GCM. There are
              currently 10 NSmen who have been appointed by the Armed Forces
              Council to perform duty as President of a court martial. They are
              rostered by the Registrar of the Subordinate Military Court to hear
              cases during their in-camp training. In the case of a Panel Court
              Martial, the other two members are rostered from among some 155
              military officers appointed by the Chief of Defence Force.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"> <br> 5. Ways to Seek Redress</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">There are numerous safeguards and avenues set out in the military
              justice system for an SAF serviceman to seek redress if he is
              unhappy about the punishment imposed on him.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">Generally, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with an informal
              punishment meted out to him may request a higher level commander to
              review the punishment, or request for formal disciplinary
              dealing.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">In the case of a summary trial, a serviceman brought before the
              disciplinary officer may elect instead to be tried by a court
              martial. Alternatively, an aggrieved serviceman may request that
              his conviction or punishment imposed at the summary trial be
              reviewed by MINDEF's Director Manpower (a delegated authority of
              the Armed Forces Council).</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">In the case of a GCM, a serviceman may choose to be represented by
              a lawyer or an SAF defending officer if his case will be heard by a
              court martial. The SAF has about 200 trained defending officers.
              While an SAF defending officer comes free to the serviceman, he has
              to bear the cost of engaging a lawyer. At the end of the trial, a
              serviceman who is dissatisfied with the decision of the court
              martial may petition the Reviewing Authority (the AFC or a
              committee of its members) for a review of his case. The serviceman
              can also appeal to the Military Court of Appeal (MCA) for a
              reconsideration of his conviction, or his sentence, or both.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The MCA, when convened to hear an appeal, sits as a panel of five
              members. Heading the MCA is a President, who is appointed by the
              Chief Justice. By law, he must be a person qualified to be a Judge
              of the Supreme Court. The current President of the MCA is Justice
              Choo Han Teck. Four other members - two civilian members who are
              qualified legal practitioners with at least five years experience
              each, and two senior military officers - make up the rest of the
              MCA. The MCA is the highest court in the military justice
              system.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"> <br> 6. Impartial Hearings<br> It is important to recognise that the GCM and the MCA are tribunals
              headed by presidents who are outside the SAF chain of command.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">Being an "outsider", the president of these forums will hear the
              case impartially like any other civil criminal case. The
              proceedings in the GCM and the MCA are also heard in a public
              forum, and these military courts adopt many of the same legal
              procedures and safeguards as that used in the civil criminal
              courts. All servicemen formally charged with an offence can bring
              their case to these forums.</p>

              (APC) and the former Zone Provost Company (ZPC). Its duties include
              most of the important ceremonial duties required within the SAF as
              previously handled by the APC, and a traffic platoon which ensures
              the compliance of traffic regulations by military personnel on the
              road as well as performing escort duties. It also performs regular
              raids for contraband and/or miscreants on various camps of the SAF

              well trained for handling the varied scenarios that they find
              themselves in. This is also the platoon that enforces the public
              image of the SAF by booking offenders who smoke in uniform and
              commit other offences in uniform while in the eye of the
              public.</em></span> It is worth noting that they perform
              undercover security operations for high-key events like the
              National Day Parade and the Youth Olympic Games. The security of
              Mowbray Station is overseen by a platoon who is also in charge of
              registering and detaining suspects and offenders of military crimes
              in holding cells. The station is similar to a civilian police
              station and it is usually the first stop for detainees before their
              transfer to the detention barracks after conviction in military
              courts, or a temporary holding cell for servicemen placed under
              Closed Arrest. The investigative branch for the SAF, the Special
              Investigation Branch (SIB) investigates higher-order military
              crimes that requires specialised handling. Since 31 December 8,
              MPEU has heralded the inclusion of a new branch within its ranks.
              The Security Support and Protection (SSP) Branch is involved in
              sensitive operations so no further information is available.</p>

              <p><br> The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) is a 2,000-bed acute tertiary
              psychiatric hospital situated on a 25-hectare campus at
              Buangkok Green Medical Park. Set amidst serene surroundings,
              IMH offers a comprehensive range of psychiatric, rehabilitative and
              counselling services for children, adolescents, adults, and the
              elderly.</p>
              <p>IMH’s tradition of care started in 1928. We were the first
              mental hospital in Singapore, starting with some 1,000 patients.
              Since then, many advances have been made in treatment, training,
              and research. Our treatment integrates evidence-based therapies,
              supported by the departments of clinical psychology, nursing,
              occupational therapy, and medical social work, to provide holistic
              care for our patients. IMH is equipped with modern facilities, with
              50 wards for inpatients and seven Specialist Outpatient
              Clinics.</p>
              <p>IMH was the first mental health institution in Asia to receive
              the Joint Commission International Accreditation in 2005, a highly
              coveted international accreditation for healthcare
              organisations. </p>
              <p>Over the years, IMH has gained a reputation for quality
              research. In 2008, the Ministry of Health,
              Singapore, entrusted IMH with a S$25 million research
              grant to implement translational and clinical research into the
              causes of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.</p>
              <p>IMH also plays a key role in training the next generation of
              mental health professionals in Singapore. We train psychiatrists
              and mental health professionals through the NHG-AHPL Residency
              Programme for psychiatry and through collaborations with the local
              tertiary institutions.</p>

              initiatives</strong><br> <em>Posted: 12 November 2012 1930 hrs</em></p>
              <p>Minister of State for Health Dr Amy Khor announced in Parliament
              on Monday two new community-based mental health initiatives
              designed to improve Singaporeans' access to mental
              healthcare.<br> <br> "We are developing Assessment and Shared Care Teams (ASCAT), which
              are specialist-led mental health teams based in the community, in
              order to improve access to mental health care. We are also
              developing Community Mental Health Intervention Teams (COMIT) to
              provide improved access to counselling and psychotherapy services
              in the community," said Dr Khor.<br> <br> Dr Khor also said that the Institute of Mental Health's (IMH)
              occupancy rate for the past three years averaged at about 80 per
              cent and that the hospital has sufficient capacity for new
              patients.<br> <br> There are currently about 2,000 beds across public hospitals in
              Singapore dedicated to mental health patients, with the majority in
              IMH.<br> <br> Responding to queries from Member of Parliament Mr Hri Kumar Nair
              on the criteria for admitting patients to IMH, Dr. Khor said those
              with conditions such as schizophrenia and depression may be
              admitted for closer monitoring.</p>

              <p><em>The SAF seeks to promote the well-being of every serviceman
              by providing<br> counselling support for those whom might be facing difficulties
              coping with their<br> personal or work/training related problems. Servicemen who are
              experiencing<br> difficulties can seek help through the avenues described
              below.</em><br> <br> <strong>Commander interviews</strong> of all recruits are conducted
              within 48 hours of enlistment into full-time NS. Regular interviews
              are subsequently conducted on a monthly basis during the PTP/BMT
              phase. Special interviews are also granted upon request. Servicemen
              can highlight their difficulties during these interviews for
              assistance.<br> <br> <strong>Orientation Officers</strong> identify, assist and counsel
              BMT recruits with adjustment<br> and/or other personal problems.<br> <br> <strong>NS SAF Counselling Hotline</strong> is a 24-hour
              confidential telephone<br> counselling service provided by the SAF Counselling Centre. Manned
              by<br> trained counselling personnel, the SAF Counselling Hotline offers a
              crisis<br> and telephone counselling service to all servicemen. Callers
              may<br> choose to remain anonymous. Face to face counselling is also

              counselling<br> services and provides another avenue of help at the unit level for
              those who<br> need help to deal more effectively with their problems.

              <p><em><strong>Being psychologically prepared is all about knowing
              what to expect and being prepared for it.</strong></em></p>
              <p>To be better prepared, you can participate in Total Defence
              activities and Open Houses organised by the SAF/SPF/SCDF.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you should also talk to your family members and friends
              who have lived the NS experience. The more you discuss with others,
              the more comfortable and mentally prepared you’ll become.</p>
              <p><strong>Because NS life is different from civilian life before
              enlistment, there are many adjustments you need to
              make.</strong></p>
              <p>A good way to cope is to get support from your buddy and fellow
              recruits. They are going through the same tough training as you, so
              talking to one another will help relieve some tension.</p>
              <p>In most evenings during your leisure time, you’ll also have some
              time to call your family or loved ones to talk. They can give you
              emotional support during NS.</p>
              <p>You can have a one-on-one interview sessions with your officer
              to highlight any problems you may have. If you have a personal or
              family problem that need to be addressed, do let the officer
              know—he may be able to give you some advice or time off to settle
              your problems.</p>
              <p>Life in NS revolves around structure, routine and discipline.
              This helps us stay united as a uniformed organisation as well as
              imparts the rigours necessary to protect our nation and
              citizens.</p>
              <p>This does not mean there is just work and no play. In fact,
              after a few weeks in NS and you’ll find new friends and new reasons
              to smile!</p>
              <p><strong>As a soldier, one of the biggest adjustments you’ll have
              to make quickly is in regimentation and discipline.</strong></p>
              <p>Being in a uniformed organisation, you’ll have to obey orders
              from your superiors. Thus some of you may feel a sudden lack of
              freedom to do what you want and you may find yourself having
              difficulties accepting authority initially.</p>
              <p>Regimentation and discipline build strong character and
              toughness, so that you’ll be tough enough to handle difficult
              combat, crime-fighting or rescue situations without giving up or
              breaking down.</p>
              <p>When you first enlist into NS, you may have concerns of being in
              a new territory, with new faces and new things to do. But don’t let
              this get to you. Just remember the saying that “when the going gets
              tough, the tough gets going”.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Following are some
              tips on what you can do to prepare yourself
              psychologically:</em></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Adopt a positive perception</li>
              <li>Build up physical stamina</li>
              <li>Develop good working attitude and habits</li>
              <li>Overcome psychological stress</li>
              <li>Adopt teamwork spirit</li>
              <li>Learn to be independent</li>
              <li>Set realistic expectations</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can also speak to your friends or family members who have
              been through NS. Ask them to share their stories. The sharing will
              help you reduce some of your fears, uncertainties and doubts.</p>
              <p><strong>During NS you’ll be living with different
              people.</strong></p>
              <p>Because these people come from different backgrounds, they may
              not think like you do or react to situations like you would.
              Instead of trying to select your type of people, you should cherish
              the diversity. This is a chance for you to learn more about your
              fellow mates and their cultures.</p>
              <p>You’ll find that you have many opportunities to absorb the
              different cultures—during training, eating, chatting or just seeing
              and listening. Take these opportunities and learn from people
              around you, you’ll have a much better appreciation of Singapore’s
              cultural diversity.</p>
