Within the first few minutes we took down the OC, CSM and PCs, and the rest of them just stayed there for the rest of the afternoon with nobody making any tactical decisions.  Eventually the umpire said it was boring and asked us to let them overrun the position.<br><br>It would have been extremely easy for them to overrun our position, if anybody had stopped to think things through - all they needed to do was get one section to flank us, while the rest of the company provided covering fire.  It's not our fault they panicked.  Well, maybe it is. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
