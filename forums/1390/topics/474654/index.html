              <h1>SAF in considering tweaking IPPT</h1>
              <div><em><strong>Standing broad jump could be scrapped, push-ups added
                  and run increased to 3.2km. </strong></em></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Servicemen who struggle to pass the standing broad
                  jump station may get a lifeline.
              <p>The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is looking at tweaking the
                  Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) and could scrap the
                  standing broad jump.</p>
              <p><strong>Changes which also include introducing push-ups as a test
                  criterion and increasing the distance of the run from 2.4km to
                  3.2km, could kick in as early as April next year.</strong></p>
              <strong> </strong>
              <p><strong>The IPPT, which was introduced in 1979, was last revised in
                  1982.</strong></p>
              <p>The current IPPT is made up of five test items: sit-up, standing
                  broad jump, chin-up, 4 x 10m shuttle run and the 2.4 km run.</p>
              <p>Though the SAF has declined to confirm the changes, only saying
                  that it “constantly reviews its training system to stay relevant”,
                  many servicemen would welcome the removal of the standing broad
                  jump, the single most-failed station in the IPPT.</p>
              <p>About 116,000 people take the IPPT every year and while the
                  Ministry of Defence did not reveal pass rates, it was reported in
                  2011 that more than 50 per cent of them pass their test yearly.</p>
              <p>Servicemen who fail their IPPT must attend remedial training of
                  20 physical-training sessions over three months.</p>

              <p><strong>MINDEF's Response to Feedback on IPPT </strong><br></p>
              <p>We thank Mr Keith Wee, Mr Yeo Yujin, Mr Elgar Lee, Dr Yik Keng Yeong 
              and Mr Lee Kek Chin for their feedback in their forum letters "Review 
              system for NSmen who fail IPPT" (dated 9 September 2013), "Let's not 
              make life even more difficult for NSmen", "Review incentives for passing
               IPPT", "Don't take soft options when going gets tough" (all three dated
               14 September 2013) and "Incentive to pass IPPT: Good health" (dated 17 
              September 2013) respectively.<br> <br> The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) recognises that our Operationally Ready
               National Servicemen (NSmen) have to balance the demands of work, family
               and National Service duties. MINDEF and the Singapore Armed Forces 
              (SAF) are therefore committed to helping NSmen train for and achieve 
              their required fitness standards.<br> <br> The Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) serves as a baseline 
              measure of physical fitness. It comprises various stations designed to 
              measure different components of physical fitness. Appropriate standards 
              are set according to gender and age of our servicemen.<br> <br> To help NSmen prepare for the IPPT, the SAF has implemented the enhanced
               IPPT Preparatory Training (IPT), a voluntary programme designed to 
              improve fitness levels by setting progressive Personal Performance 
              Targets (PPTs). NSmen who achieve their PPTs within the first nine 
              months from the start of their IPPT window will not have to attend 
              Remedial Training (RT), even if they fail to meet the IPPT standards.<br> <br> The SAF has set up four Fitness Conditioning Centres, which serve as 
              one-stop centres for fitness testing and training for NSmen, in Khatib, 
              Maju, Bedok and Kranji. We have also enhanced over 100 fitness corners 
              with IPPT training facilities across Singapore as part of the 
              IPPT-in-your-community initiative, which NSmen can make use of to train 
              at their own convenience.<br> <br> It is the duty of our NSmen to meet their annual IPPT requirement as 
              their physical fitness is critical to the operational readiness of the 
              SAF. For NSmen who have attained good results in their IPPT, we 
              recognise their efforts by giving a small monetary sum.<br> <br> We are encouraged by Dr Yik's support for the IPPT system and his 
              comment that standards should not be lowered for the sake of 
              convenience. We also welcome Mr Lee's view that achieving a healthy body
               is an incentive in itself to perform well in the IPPT. Once again, we 
              thank the various NSmen for their feedback. The SAF seeks to continue 
              improving our fitness training system as well as regularly reviews our 
              IPT and RT programmes to ensure their efficiency and effectiveness.<br> <br> <br> <strong>COL Ng Ying Thong<br> ACGS (Training)<br> Singapore Armed Forces<br> </strong></p>

              <p>Every soldier, airman and sailor may have to undergo a new physical fitness test from next year.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Armed Forces is looking to change the Individual 
                  Physical Proficiency Test, or IPPT, for the first time since 1982.</p>
              <p><strong>Key changes are expected to include the scrapping of the standing 
                  broad jump station and adding push-ups as a testing criterion, The 
                  Straits Times has learnt.</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Servicemen will also have to run 3.2km instead of the current 2.4km to test endurance over longer distances.</strong></p>

              <p><strong>1967:</strong> National service begins. Physical fitness test
                   includes running 4.8km in 30 min, and completing 9.6km in 70 min while 
                  wearing the skeletal battle order.</p>
              <p><strong>1979:</strong> Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) 
                  introduced for all full-time national servicemen and regulars. Test - in
                   army t-shirt, slacks and boots - includes push-ups, sit-ups, chin-ups, 
                  half-knee bends and the 2.4km run.</p>
              <p><strong>1981:</strong> Knee-bends are excluded.</p>
              <p><strong>1982:</strong> IPPT now made up of sit-ups, chin-ups, shuttle
                   run, standing broad jump and the 2.4km run. Soldiers now wear singlet, 
                  shorts and running shoes.</p>

              <p>The Singapore Armed Forces plans to change to the Individual Physical 
              Proficiency Test (IPPT) and set up a new volunteer military corps, 
              according to<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/saf-soldiers-ippt-likely-change-next-year-20131023"> a report</a> by The Straits Times.<br><br>Come
               next April, the standing broad jump requirement is expected to be 
              replaced with a push-ups component. The endurance run distance will be 
              set at 3.2km, up from the current 2.4km.<br><br>This is the first time the IPPT, which is taken by about 166,000 people yearly, will be changed since 1982. <br><br>A new volunteer corps targets women and permanent residents in their 30s and 40s will also be set up, according to<a href="http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/no-ns-draft-women-role-them-volunteer-force"> Today. </a><br><br>Those
               who join the volunteer corps will also go through combat training, put 
              on uniforms, and be subjected to call-up every year. There will also be 
              support and logistics roles for those who are medically unfit.<br><br>Defence
               Minister Ng Eng Hen commented that women and PRs can also play 
              “meaningful military roles”, as SAF needs “different subsets apart from

              <p>Because most guys don't understand it's more technique driven, than a raw burst of strength. It's more a coordination of arms and legs at take off, and most guys fail at that, iincluding me, until I knew how to correct it. </p>
              <p>Some guys suck at movement coordination, I admit I am. </p>

              <p>I often used the leg press equipment in the gymnasium to train for my NS Non-ICT IPPT and manage to achieve at least a pass if not better.</p>
              <p>I wonder is it let of the proper training on the use of these 'SBJ' equipments that resulted in our NSmen failing to make the grade to be free from RT because it pretty seem at this stage that the 3.2km run and the push-up is like double the efforts discharge from our arm strength and endurance. Hmm.. </p>
