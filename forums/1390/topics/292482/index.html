            <div class='col-md body'>Depends on what he sign on as....the different scenarios I can think of is...<br><br><strong>Specialist (Sergeant and then slowly promote to Warrant officer)</strong><br>A professional career, very demanding job.<br><br><strong>Officer</strong><br>Equally demanding, longer hours than specialists, but higher prospects, higher pay, highly respected.<br><br><strong>Special Forces</strong><br>Elite people from SOF (Special Operations Force) or NDU (Naval Diving Unit), these are highly trained "professional killers" in a way, with even higher pay, prestige, but much more dangerous job.<br><br>Specialists can crossover to officers midway, its possible, though rare.<br><br><strong>Time - The Sacrifice</strong><br><br>A military person is under orders, when order comes, he cannot discuss and see whether he should obey - he has to follow. His schedule and time is at the mercy of his higher superiors - even if he is an officer.<br><br>Normal days is like normal office hours outside, 5-day work week, except some Saturdays got to join whole unit for outdoor running.<br><br>Sometimes may have to go a few days of continuous training, etc, which you may not be able to see or contact him.<br><br>Whenever sent overseas for training, can be min 2 weeks to 2 months overseas, with few chances to contact.<br><br><strong> The Reward </strong><br>If he's an officer, you can look forward to a military wedding, with all his fellow officer friends all dressed in white and drawing their ceremonial swords on your wedding day.<br><br>His pay will also be very stable and good, if he's an officer, confirm you can buy condo by the time he reach 35. and he can definitely buy a good car within 2nd year of service.<br><br>At end-of-contract and retirement, he also gets a lumpsum which is quite handsome.<br><br><strong>Danger</strong><br>Training and operations is relatively safe with alot of safeguards and systems. There're also comprehensive insurance schemes, just in case something really happens. He'll be well taken care of.<br><br></div>
