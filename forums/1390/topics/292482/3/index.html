            <div class='col-md body'>No, your contract starts from when you sign it. (Some can be backdated to enlistment? Not too sure about this. But it definitely starts before the two year NSF liability is up.) There may be additional bond periods if you take up the scholarships or study awards.<br><br>This brings up another point. NSF liability for regulars is not two years. i.e. if you decide to quit after 2 years as a regular, you still have to serve some remaining time to fulfill your NS liability. I'm not so sure what this ratio is.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>But most importantly, best if he can go into OCS then see how are things first before signing on</blockquote>Someone else vaguely touched on this earlier, but to remind: there may be institutional obstacles if you sign on &amp; then try to change vocations midstream. OCS comprises 3 terms (Tri-Service, Service &amp; Pro) while SISPEC has 2 (BSLC, then either ASLC or the support-arms Schools). The system may not let newbie regulars revocate that easily if they're already in the OCS Pro Term or in trade course during SISPEC. Not saying it's impossible, but it'll be dealt with more on a case-by-case basis with various possible impediments n the way (suitability, availability, career potential, sabo kings).<br><br>Lagi best to sign on either during BMT, or earlier in leadership training, or after settling into unit life (if you like your posting), or with a degree after NS (can definitely revocate, albeit as a "farmer" regular).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I always very objective on the propects of signing on with the SAF.<br><br>I sign on as a specialist with the Army and already served the force for 6 years, doing quite okay. I obtain IPPT Gold every year.<br><br>Army provides you alot of exposure too, i makes alot of coperate world friends too. Personally, there is alot of naive people still inside the forces that thinks that Army will feed  them for life which is not true. You need to earn it, you need to sacrifice time, friends, and even your loved ones.<br><br>I will be leaving the forces next year when i get my degree next year, if your bf is considering getting a degree but only had a specialist post, then better dont sign on.</div>
