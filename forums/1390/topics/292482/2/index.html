            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>i have 4 poly grad friends who signed on as officers under the 3 year scheme. of which, 3 is totally regretted now... only 1 the super duper ex-npcc is still okay.</blockquote>Sounds like they weren't properly advised, on the outset. A diploma is a IHL credential &amp;, not only that, it's not a general certificate either like A Levels or even a BA degree. Poly grads are also supposed to be the most practical-inclined of servicemen &amp;, as such, shall presumably desire to apply when they've studied for.<br><br>Many of them sign up for engineering &amp; technical capacities in the various military branches, as a result. Of course, getting an officer commissioning will also influence their decisions, but it's not the foremost one as some (presumably NSF) posters here think. Rather, the serious careerist's goal is to first determine an appropriate vocation.<br><br>I don't disagree that some Poly grads remain gung-ho enough to opt for the combat arms. They do comprise the majority of job opportunities in the Army side but, it's well-known now, the farmers lose out to the scholars in the career paths there. Perhaps more damagingly, any Army-trained regular who does not re-upp for a second contract will enter the civilian job market competing with fresh-faced job seekers for the same entry-level employment, yet much older &amp; without correlated experience on his resume. That's why they end up as insurance agents or whatever.<br><br>So, on the one hand, IMO combat regulars will be busy with full-time 24/7 duties for about two-thirds of their first contract, due to operational postings -- &amp;, despite all the material benefits (can definitely afford to buy a car, compared to their civilian peers), the lack of free time is quite disillusioning for their girlfriends &amp; wives too, beware. Yet they may have to rebuild their working life from scratch if they doesn't carry on thereafter. But signing on as an engineer or technician, regardless of as officer or NCO, may entail a different occupational path in order for the SAF to make the most out of his academic expertise. This route is something I don't think every serving officer is informed about to properly advise, unless he's with a more-specialized outfit &amp;/or has signed on the exact vocation which the wannabe is aiming for.</div>
