            <div class='col-md body'>People tend to view themselves as individuals and as such put out their own individual interest ahead of what is so called 'common interest'. I guess the way the world is today certainly does not help our cause, we live in a globalized world with open markets, as such competition for jobs and opportunities are steep. Thus, the conscription armies of today have to factor this in and find ways to allow individuals to serve their nation and at the same time not lose out in this 'rat race'. One way would be to set up a fifth university solely for full-time national servicemen, based on the model of Amercian and Canadian colleges which allow students to do certain credits of their univeristy programme and transfer their credits over to say NUS or NTU or any other foreign universities come the end of their term of service. I believe doubts will be raised as to feasibility of this vis-a-vis  to our nation's defence, especialy for those in the combat side. However, I believe that with shrude man power management and streamlining of operational and training needs, with the innovation of new technologies, our men will be afforded the time to do their studies while serving. Furthermore, we aren't talking about a regime of a full degree, but rather credits that will allow soldiers to attain academic knowledge while serving their nation. Of course it'll be tough, but it'll certainly bridge the knowledge gap which most NSFs face after a two year haitus from academia.<br><br>Not fogetting soldiers who aren't persueing a univeristy degree. Individuals who are thinking of persueing a poly diploma or an ITE or O-level cert can also benefit from this. A insitution can be set up to tailor courses which will assist these indivudals in their academic persuance. I mean it is a novel idea, a school drop out enters the army, does his O-levels while serving ns and gets reasonable results which gets him into poly or an ITE course.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think NS is basically your first exposure to the real world. You will learn that this world is unfair, why does the minister's sons mostly or in fact all either get into OCS or become clerks that does not need to do a single guard duties even when they are Pes C1 which means that they are eligible to do guard duties just like any one of us.<br><br>To me the scariest part of NS is actually after you ORD. You have to pass IPPT every year, if you fail you have to attend remedial sessions. I, myself ord 1 year ago, i have to juggle 2 jobs, one day job and another night job.<br>I am not afraid of IPPT in fact i been training regularly. I make time to run every night around 1 a.m. down the park under my house after i finish my night job.  I pass 4 stations out of the five station 5 points each. The only station i fail is my shuttle run. My boss is threatening me if i had to attend a RT session, he will not hesitate to sack me. I just feel that the most important stations in IPPT is chin ups and 2.4 km run. I pass these 2 stations with 5 points. I really wish the SAF to be kind maybe they could grant an NS guy a subsidary pass if he manage to pass 4 stations.<br><br>Look at some of the regulars in the army, they are fat and some of them cannot even pass their IPPT despite they have all the access to the gym which is just a stone drop distance from their office, yet most of them rather go for canteen breaks to eat roti pratas with eggs or chicken cutlets. I am just dissappoint that my main bread n butter is at stake cause i cannot pass shuttle run. I mean whats the point of running for 10 seconds to grab some blocks.</div>
