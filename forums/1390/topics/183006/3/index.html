            <div class='col-md body'>The importance of NS differ for everyone.  Everything has its own pro and cons. On the micro level it can be said to be aa waste of 2 years. Due to globalisation everything is moving rapidly. Remaining stagnant for 2 years is really a big economical disadvantage. It has been estimated that for a graduate 1 year in monetary term is 30k or more (please do not look at starting pay but look at the precious time for investment too. starting early also means a better earning and also promotions). On a macro level a country will always need a army for time of emergency. Emergency refer to internal strife or war. The army need not be strong enough to destroy a army of 10 million though being able is a best scenario. It must be strong enough to hold the enemies back till helps arrive. This is also one of the reason for our avid friendship building and also participation in the UN. Being able to deter can be equivalent to saving the country.</div>

I mean whats the point of running for 10 seconds to grab some blocks. </div></blockquote>Actually there is a VERY good reason why sprinting and sudden changes in direction are important in the military. When you sprint from cover to cover, you are using the muscles that are important for shuttle run. If you take the time to train, about an hour a day 3 times a week, you'll save yourself a world of grief. In fact, you will find in the field, that aerobic fitness (which you need for 2.4) is seldom really needed.<br><br>And the image of army regulars as being a bunch of overweight, overpaid losers who cant survive in the outside world is sadly mistaken. The ratio of overweight regulars to fit regulars isnt even 40/60... its less than 25/75. Yes, this 25% does give the rest of us a bad image. But the Army cracks down hard on them. In case you didn't know, the performance bonus for Regulars is also affected by our IPPT results, and our BMI.<br><br>And as for pay... a job in the Civil Service will usually pay about the same, with equivalent qualifications. A teacher with a degree from NUS and a diploma in education from NIE (which is NORMAL, not exceptional!!!) for instance, would earn the same than, or more, than an LTA with an equivalent degree from nus. Im using the rank of LTA cos this would be the rank a uni grad officer would be at, when his teacher counterpart has just finished NIE.<br><br>And as for not being able to survive outside the service... Ill tell you if I ever decide to leave, how im coping!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
