              <p>Hello.</p>
              <p>I am going to be age 18 this year, I was born in July 1995.</p>
              <p>I withdrew from JC in Jan 2013 and have been accepted into NP for a full-time diploma course. <br><br>Before the JAE result was posted, I had to do the NS pre-enlistment documentation. <br><br>I called up the NS hotline at <strong><em>1800-3676767</em></strong> and CMPB told me to do so as per instruction as the system listed me not studying at that point in time. CMPB then later told me to submit the JAE posting result to CMPB for a deferment application.</p>
              <p>I received the JAE posting result just last week and was posted to NP. I tried to apply for the NS deferment online at <em><strong><a href="http://www.NS.sg">www.NS.sg</a></strong></em>, but the system only showed that I had registered for medical checkup on the 22 Feb 2013. I called CMPB up again and the customer service officer told me the same thing on the computer system.</p>
              <p>I emailed an image screenshot of my JAE posting result with my NRIC attached to the NS Call Centre at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="mailto:contact@ns.sg">contact@ns.sg</a></strong></span>. Hopefully, I would be able to get the NS deferment to pursue the polytechnic full-time diploma, and to also postpone my medical checkup till my graduation 3 years later.</p>
              <p>I would like to know is there anything steps that I missed?</p>
              <p>Though it is pending approval now, what would the deferment application likely be?</p>
              <p><br>Thank you for your attention.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Disruption from full-time NS for Polytechnic diploma or its equivalent qualifications [For NS-liable ITE graduates only]<br><br>Frequently Asked Questions<br><br> <br>Q1. What is the current deferment cut-off age for ITE students to pursue polytechnic studies?<br><br>A1: 21 years old as at 1 Jan of course commencement year.<br><br>Q2. If an NS-liable ITE pre-enlistee does not meet the deferment cut-off age of 21 years old but is accepted into polytechnic, will deferment be granted?<br><br>A2: Deferment may be granted on a case-by-case basis. The pre-enlistee may approach the Central Manpower Base (CMPB) to apply for deferment.<br><br>Q3. If an NSF with ITE qualifications met the deferment cut-off age of 21 years old as at 1 Jan of the course commencement year and was accepted into a polytechnic before enlistment, but chose to proceed with NS first, will disruption be granted to him?<br><br>A3: No. This is because he had an opportunity to defer for polytechnic studies, but had turned it down to proceed with NS first.<br><br>Q4. If an NSF with ITE qualifications did not apply for admission to the polytechnics before enlistment, will disruption be granted to him?<br><br>A4: No. This is because he had already been given the opportunity to defer for studies, but chose not to take it.<br><br>Q5. How does an NSF with ITE qualifications apply for disruption to pursue polytechnic studies?<br><br>A5: NSFs who are eligible for disruption may approach their respective unit Manpower Officers to apply for disruption. Disruption will be granted in their 2nd year of NS.<br><br>Q6. When will the revised deferment and disruption policies be implemented?<br><br>A6: The revised policies will be implemented for all NS-liable ITE students graduating from Dec 2011 onwards.<br><br>Q7. Do the revised deferment and disruption policies apply to ITE students who are accepted into MOE-funded diplomas courses (i.e. Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) and La Salle) and the ITE Technical Engineer Diploma?<br><br>A7: Yes.<br><br>Q8. Can a pre-enlistee who already has a first education bar qualification be granted deferment or disruption to pursue polytechnic studies?<br><br>A8: No. MINDEF exercises flexibility by granting deferment from full-time NS to enable pre-enlistees to attain up to first education bar before enlistment. Hence, for those who have attained a first education bar qualification, deferment and disruption will not be granted to pursue polytechnic studies.<br><br>Q9. Can disruption be granted for NSFs to pursue private diplomas?<br><br>A9: No. MINDEF provides added opportunity only for ITE NSFs to pursue local polytechnic studies, which is the mainstream educational pathway.<br><br>Q10. Can disruption be granted for GCE 'N'/'O' level NSFs to pursue polytechnic studies?<br><br>A10: No. The current deferment cut-off age of 19 years old (for Sec 4 students) and 20 years old (for Sec 5 students) as at 1 Jan of the course commencement year, would have provided sufficient opportunities for them to pursue polytechnic studies before enlistment.<br><br>Q11. If an NSF's polytechnic admission application was rejected prior to his enlistment, must he apply for the same institution during full-time NS, so as to be eligible for disruption?<br><br>A11: No. The pre-enlistee can apply for different institutions before enlistment and during full-time NS.</p></div>
