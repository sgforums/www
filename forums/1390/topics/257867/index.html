            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone!<br><br>I have recently been reading and looking through the MINDEF website, and have been surfing for information about the military etc. I just came across this forum and was impressed by the amount of sharing you guys have posted.<br><br>Anyway, IÂ’m a female, currently working and am 26 yrs old. IÂ’ve always been very interested in defense, army and wartime affairs since I was little, and IÂ’m now badly regretting not joining the SAF straight after I graduated from uni. I suppose it never occurred to me that I could actually realize my dream of becoming part of SingaporeÂ’s armed forces Â– itÂ’s sort of been a long-term fantasy only.<br><br>But after reading up about some of the female servicewomen in the SAF, it has changed that mindset and given me inspiration to return to this interest again; IÂ’m now seriously considering a career with the SAF. My only concern is if IÂ’m too late for it? I know that the Air Force, for example, has an age limit for officers at 27, and most men who sign up would have had years of experience by the time they reach my age.<br><br>What does anyone think about this? Medical-wise, I have no health issues and physical fitness-wise, thankfully, IÂ’m very active and love running, cycling, rock-climbing and many sports etc. All and any advice would be greatly appreciated!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>interest is one thing, career is another thing..<br><br>ultimately the decision rest on you, and i do not think its too late to sign on.<br><br>Do note that the age for retirement in the armed forces is 45 for officers(since you have a uni degree... you should get an officer role). And after 45, looking for suitable employment is quite an uphill task, though not necessarily impossible.<br><br>And since you have an active lifestlye, i think fitting into the military regime would not pose a serious problem.<br><br>good luck in your considerations!</div>
