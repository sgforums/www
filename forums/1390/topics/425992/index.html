              <p>The imposed gender-role of male-mandatory military service is pure sexism.</p>
              <p>Society treats men like shit these days. So much expectation being a male-person.</p>
              <p>Even after wasting 2.5 years of the best part of our youth (and not considering the waiting time) have to cut hair short every year for reservice and dye it black again.</p>
              <p>Compensation for people who's jobs depends on productivity (i.e. research) or commission (i.e. sales) are completely unfair.</p>
              <p>People who didn't have to waste time in NS, i.e. females, and foreigners, etc should pay higher tax.</p>

              <p>Each county got is own policy and training and depends on the duration of the training.</p>
              <p>For Spore, seriously speaking, the duration is too long.</p>
              <p>It should have to be further reduce.</p>

              <p>That is for sure.</p>
              <p>Why make our boys suffer?</p>
              <p>Wouldnt reduce to 12 mth to 12mth is the idea duration for the boys?</p>
              <p>Mindef and ministers should think of the boys future. Not solely on defence but on spore economy too.</p>
              <p>Dont be selfish, dont always think of defence. Our boys need to be out asap to fight against PRs and foreigners for the ricebowl. Our boys are falling behind......</p>

              <p>I think 2 years is pretty good privilege already. I reckon not many people understand the reason for the active and 10 year cycle thing, hence all the distaste for national service.</p>
              <p>In fact, if one gets posted to a lobo unit doing pointless things day after day, he'll see national service more as a waste of time than someone in a fully operational unit  striving to stay operational.</p>
              <p>From my experience, if you want your national service days to be fulfilling, don't chao keng and get yourself posted to a lobo unit to begin with. If you are fighting fit, just do your best, some days may suck, but end of the journey, you know you did the best for yourself, and no one else.</p>

              <p>Well, someone who is going to take on a new job doesn't know what to expect either. As for advertisements from mindef, I reckoned they are targetted more at regular sign ups.</p>
              <p>Which real world profit making organisation in this world is not practising what you mentioned above? Honestly, that 2 years of active service will wake up your idea what abit of shit is compared to the more fucked up shit you face when you get out of it.</p>

              <p>1 yr duration: 2 months BMT, remaining 10 months service.</p>

              <p>Alternatively, NSF who want to volunteer for command school may do so but must sign a voluntary extension of an extra half-year service i.e. that makes his NSF duration become a total of 1 &amp; a 1/2 years.</p>
              <p>NS for females:-</p>
              <p>6 months duration: 1 month BMT, remaining 5 months service.</p>

              <p>SBS2601D: Whatever time you have spent in NS is considered as time served for National Service. For some people time may pass quickly because they are in combat, for some there would be a lot of saikang time. But whatever it is, precious time still passes on. Male Singaporeans will lose 2 years of precious time and lag behind S'porean females as well as foreigners, in terms of further studies and career progression.</p>
              <p>You were probably a commando man to have done 9 months of training for the red beret. Perhaps they could modify &amp; reduce the training to adapt to the local needs &amp; requirements.</p>

              <p>SBS2601D: Whatever time you have spent in NS is considered as
              time served for National Service. For some people time may pass
              quickly because they are in combat, for some there would be a lot
              of saikang time. But whatever it is, precious time still passes on.
              Male Singaporeans will lose 2 years of precious time and lag behind
              S'porean females as well as foreigners, in terms of further studies
              and career progression.</p>
              <p>You were probably a commando man to have done 9 months of
              training for the red beret. Perhaps they could modify &amp; reduce
              the training to adapt to the local needs &amp; requirements.</p>

              <p>So women should only be allowed to wear skirt and stay in the kitchen?</p>
              <p>These days there are just too much artifical societal pressure imposed for men (even in this day and age where we are not cavemen any more), with all the stupid western machismo-ideals; where male-persons are supposed to be emotionally strong and independent, and have to act tough all the time, or risk being bullied by aggressive muscle-for-brains macho-apes.</p>
              <p>I've seen plenty of women who look and are physically more "manly" than me, why aren't they serving? Why are PES C and below serving, when PES A female-people aren't?</p>
              <p>Besides, there are other less physically demanding saikang positions in NS for everyone to waste their youth away, and also for reservice.</p>

              <p>Go BMT. Whoever likes to "serve" so much can sign on as their own personal "choice", while the rest can move on to real jobs. Those who have already wasted their youth serving 2.5 years or more should be fairly compensated.</p>
