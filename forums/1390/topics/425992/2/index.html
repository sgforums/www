              <p>Not just NS, alot of laws in singapore favour women, ie; women's charter.</p>
              <p>Till date, I've served NS and several high key ICTs already. Waste of my time and company's time. My company is not supportive of me going ICT too, end up the women colleagues in my department have to take on my workload, on top of their already heavy workload.</p>
              <p>When I returned from ICT, alot of things at work for me to clear also. So, the 2 weeks after ICT, I would be doing OTs every night for 2 weeks!</p>
              <p>Not say ppl complain alot (no smoke without fire) but it is really unfair to be born male in Singapore. I've came so far, don't think I'll go for sex change ops or migrate out. Waiting for MR to come faster.</p>

              <p>Well, the issue is not whether people enjoy NS or not, but whether NS is good for us or detrimental. Just because guy enjoy the experience does not mean that it is worth the time, money, effort, or energy right? Just like playing CoD for 12 hours through the night could be enjoyable and and it gives people a break, but it is obviously a big bloody waste! </p>

              <p>SBS2601D: Whatever time you have spent in NS is considered as time served for National Service. For some people time may pass quickly because they are in combat, for some there would be a lot of saikang time. But whatever it is, precious time still passes on. Male Singaporeans will lose 2 years of precious time and lag behind S'porean females as well as foreigners, in terms of further studies and career progression.</p>
              <p>You were probably a commando man to have done 9 months of training for the red beret. Perhaps they could modify &amp; reduce the training to adapt to the local needs &amp; requirements.</p>

              <p><br>You are very wrong. On all counts. Especially the last paragraph. My "long" training, is not long by most standards.</p>
              <p>Very clearly either you have not served. Or you never bothered to see the logic of serving.</p>
              <p>Which is fine.</p>
              <p>We don't need people like you in need.</p>
              <p>I don't feel that I lagged behind. In fact, NS gave me a break from studying and allowed me to refocus on what I want.</p>

              <p>Like I've said, NS isn't all about military training. There are loads of sai-kang females can waste a significant part of their youth on, and come back to reservice and cut their hair every year.</p>
              <p>I passed out completely due to my body overheating since I don't sweat enough and poor physique during road-marches, but I still have to waste my time as a sai-kang specialist storeman after BMT and working with aholes and all that darkpolitics inside.</p>
              <p>Yes most men are physically stronger than most women, but that's not necessarily the case for all. There are plenty of women who are tougher than me for instance. Further, society expects ALL men to be emotionally and physically tough and beast-like (which isn't the case for every guys), but women don't have to live by this stupid expectation, and that is in itself sexism.</p>

              <p>And as I've already said, if you love the military so much then fine. Go sign on.</p>
              <p>For the rest, BMT and f-off. And for those who have already wasted their life in NS for 2.5 years or more, they should be compensated.</p>
              <p>NS isn't for everyone. After having served NS and encountering so many a-holes inside, I don't feel SG is worth my life defending anymore, especially having to fight with these kind of low lifes. I'd probably bring my family and friends to safety when the time comes like what most ministers would.</p>
              <p>And back to the focus of this topic. NS for males only, and having to do reservice every year and abide by the stupid rule (have to cut hair, dye it black, various risk of being $$$fined$$$ or worse, etc) just because we are born as guys, is just blantant sexism. </p>
              <p>People who suffered from permanent physical damage while being an underpaid slave to NS should also be able to sue the military. </p>
