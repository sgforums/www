              <p>Berner, I know in a way I'm venting and thus sound unreasonable.</p>
              <p>However, 2 years is a really long time, especially as a part of our youth, and I definately don't feel that we are properly compensated or even appreciated (especially for those who had served 2.5 or even longer). Seeing the corruption of "white-horse" companies also made me kinda pissed.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the annoying fact that males still have to be forced to cut our hair short and dye it black whenever we return for reservice; and losing our commission-pay and sacrificing performance to compete with others who doesn't have to serve. Some of the nsmen who lost equipments, or something risk having to pay fines on top of that or worse, despite of the sacrifices they've already made.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But most importantly, and which is the focus of this thread:</span></strong></p>
              <p>Again, with the point of having females serving NS, it doesn't necessarily have to be hardcore military service. There are loads and loads of sai-kangs and guard-petro duties that most women can help out with, and waste their (now ONLY) 2 years with the people who are born as males. For the fitter and manly-looking females (I've seen plenty), they can go for training as men.</p>

              <p>I fully agree that this issue should be addressed too.</p>
              <p>Also, I think society have too many stupid-machismo rules and pressure for men to adhere to in modern day, especially as influenced by the western media; while luckily, modernized eastern cultures (such as in Japan, S.Korea, Taiwan, etc) seems to be progressing the other way. But that's for another topic in a different forum.</p>

              <p>NS active service can be shortened to 1 year, but at what cost? BMT can finish in less than 2 months, very simple, no book out on weekends and a lot lesser sleep for the guys lor.</p>
              <p>My time when I did two and the half years, just the first year alone was spent on course till I got my specialist badge, then managed to touch unit. People who keep saying NS should be shortened to 1 year or less obviously have no idea how an active unit operates and the kind of training they undergo to get them up and operational. I thought it was pretty fantastic they cut ICTs from 13 to 10 cycles already.</p>
              <p>They can cut to 5 cycles if you want, just make sure each cycle is 1-2 months stretch lor.</p>
              <p>As for income taxes, we pay one of the lowest in the world. Maybe you think I am bullshitting, but you gotta see what the others pay first. If you ask me, I just wished the govt raised the income tax rebate for active NSmen from $3000 to something alot higher, then it'll make a difference.</p>

              <p>I do agree with TS about 12 months duration. If you want to have motivational and enthusiastic people in the army, there has to be more welfare, financially as priority. Currently, what is the pay? $400+? Lol, how to be happy?</p>
              <p>You pay peanuts, you get monkeys. Increase the overall salary for those who wish to stay on after 12 months.</p>

              <p>You know.</p>
              <p>That we have people here who have the luxury to talk about NS being useless, and women needing to do NS is testimony to the sacrifice of others who allow this to happen.</p>
              <p>As stated above, some clearly have little inkling of how vital NS is.</p>
              <p>As for women doing NS, no. We don't need more waiting at rifle ranges. Males only, and you already have waiting to wait. What's the point of making females do NS? Are you forgetting that NS first and foremost is about defense and not about conscripting everyone? Even admin side, we have plenty of support from the guys already with some civilian clerks. And even with all of them, I had plenty of nonsense dealing with the admin, hence the famous "efficiency".</p>
              <p>You did saikang. I'm sorry you were under some retards.</p>
              <p>But that didn't mean the rest of us did the same thing.</p>
              <p>How are you going to tell this to the parents of those who gave their lives in the course of duty?</p>
              <p>How about the poor NSF who was only weeks short of ORD when he kena kiap by ship machinery out at sea when you people argue here?</p>
              <p>Do you know what many of us NSFs do?</p>
              <p>How can you just suka-suka call for 1 year when a lot of us took the same amount to receive only <em>basic</em> training? The <em>real </em>training begins with unit.</p>
              <p>If you don't, then just do your saikang and stop questioning it.</p>
              <p>I'm more than happy to serve and f*cuk off, but I don't want to f*ck off without doing anything, and just training.</p>

              <p>Still, it is NOT a valid argument. This is the 21st century, where women are allowed to hold a career and wear something besides skirts and aren't expected stay in kitchen to make "their men" sandwitches.</p>
              <p>Male freedom on the other hand is still stuck in the dark ages where we male-people are pressured to act macho and tough all the time for fear of being bullied by other aggressive-beasts. From young we aren't allowed to grow our hair long because that is against the artificial socially-imposed image of what is a male (and especially during NS and after, during reservices -- even though we are not sign-ons); and that rule is harshly imposed in schools. If you are too skinny, people will insult you to psychologically force you to go to a gym when you have no interest in bulking up, etc. If you are born looking too androgenyous, some thick-smelly-hairy-macho-beasts would call you gu-liang in an insulting manner, or even gay especially if you get one of those japanese style hair (then have to cut off during reservice). Guys aren't allowed by machismo society to freely express our emotions, and we are just expected to "toughen-up" w/o seeking support from others, and it goes on.</p>

              <p>That's good.</p>

              <p>What's the big deal about not being able to book out?</p>
              <p>I was from a stay-out unit but my guard duty was at one point nearly 1 in 3-4 days. That's not inclusive of the frequent exercises which will see us stay-in...and my guard-duty is not your normal guard-duty. Its stressful and strenous and we really learn as we do the duties, hence my lack of support for 1 year NS. It took me 1.5 years to be confident enough to not need to ask around for help.</p>
              <p>Its the norm to burn holidays, weekends, etc etc.</p>
              <p>And the some of the down-PES folks, chao-keng or not aside, were slow in following through some of our requests.</p>
              <p>That included my friggin pay-rise when I promoted. I lost 3 months of increment thanks to that. You think having women to help will solve this fundamental issue?</p>
              <p>Its already ONLY 2 years. Just do it.</p>
              <p>Because unlike you, majority of us still have to serve for another 20+ years.</p>
