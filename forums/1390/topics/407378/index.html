              <p>I would like to ask more about the Basic Millitary Freefall Badge.</p>
              <p>Can anyone who have completed and obtain type "A-License Accelerated Freefall" certification don on the Basic Millitary Freefall badge?</p>
              <p>The A-License Accelerated Freefall requires 24 jumps using the ram-type chute where 17 of the jumps are consolidation jump.</p>
              <p>The reason to why i asked this is because SAF has the tae-kwan do badge and i was informed that anyone who has attained the necessary qualification outside SAF can don on this tae-kwan do badge.</p>

              <p>The military course is different then the civilian ones. The military course includes jumping with weapon + personal equipment and the use of oxygen tanks for jumps in high altitude.  The civilian ones does not have the same requirements.</p>
              <p>The unarmed combat badge or tae kwan do badge can be worn if the person went through the unarmed combat instructor course at SPT or earned a black belt in Tae kwan do. I know a few guys who worn the badge who are not unarmed combat instuctors but are black belts in Tae kwan do.</p>

              <p>Basically impossible for you. 1. your pes status. 2. you need to be able to register for BAC (basic airborne course) which is near impossible for NSFs not in the CDO formation. 3. Free fall requires X amount of airborne jumps prior to qualification of the course. Cheers</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, the army is not a hobby club.</p>
              <p>Badges are not for fun, but it means you're operationally-capable of performing a certain skill/task.</p>
              <p>The most basic/beginner badge in the SAF is the basic airborne badge - the starter of every other kind of airborne.</p>
              <p>It requires you to be Pes A/B and fuflil these criterias:</p>
              <p>Either:</p>
              <p>- a commando</p>
              <p>- a regular commissioned officer of either CPT or becoming CPT soon</p>
              <p>- a specialist, SSG and above going for JWOC (Joint Warrant Officer Course) soon</p>
              <p>Above are rank according to priorities to take part in the Basic Airborne course.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It costs the SAF operational time, training time and money to train/fly you.</p>
              <p>Given your status and mere interest, you don't qualify.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And NO, you cannot wear the SAF airborne badge even if you're certified outside. Cause you aren't capable and will never be required to jump into a battlefield day or night with combat gear.</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I'm new to this forum. I'm certified in BAC, however I'm expectional because back in 1995 - 97, SAF Chief-of-Defence Force had an agreement with NCC, allowing NCC cadets to join in SAF courses (BAC, Diver &amp; JCC). Upon competing all SAF selection tests and full-time course (to be conducted by SAF), we'll be awarded the SAF badge (was informed it was approved by MINDEF G4). I'm not sure whether NCC still runs these courses. But still you must pass SAF medical checkup and get at least a PES B onwards, achieved the IPPT standards and the prep-camp training.</p>
              <p>As for Lakiun and Yon-Jyuu questions to parachuting in Army, it is impossible with either your PES status or civilian activities carry outside of SAF.</p>
              <p>In order to put on military badges, it must be "honourable awarded" by the military and carry out a grand ceremony. It cannot be a solo activities carry out by one self.</p>

              <p>Equipment jump is only for regular and that's 5 jumps, not for NCC. By the way, to do the jumps, minimum must be 16 years old and take a 4 days 3 night prep camp training, followed by 3 weeks at Hendon Camp.</p>
              <p>We had a graduation ceremony after we completed the first jump. then followed by 1 day jump, and 1 night jump. I also completed the NDU - Diver course (non-professional) and awarded the "bottle-cap" badge.</p>

              <p>Uhh, sport, you're gonna wanna check your facts there.  Every single Commando, regular or NS man, must be qualified to jump with equipment.</p>
              <p>EDIT: OK, I've looked it up - instead of a separate NCC Airborne badge as in the old days, now it's just the SAF Airborne wing without the red backing. </p>
              <p>Frankly, if you're not geared up for a fight when you jump, it may as well be a civilian jump.</p>

              <p>Gedanken, I'm very sure abt all those jumps and the badges, even the types of parachute used. For your knowledge, BAC wing are Airborne wing. With red padding, is known as "Combat Equipment Jump Wing". The no.4 version difference is the "Singapura" wording in red.</p>
              <p>By the way, Gedanken does NCC still carry on these courses? The reason why NCC started the SAF courses, was because back in 1997, NCC took over Singapore Youth Festival (usually NPCC) and at that time, Deputy Prime Minister - BG Lee H. L. was the Guest-of-Honour. To impress, NCC want to form an officer continent with only airborne and/or diver badges. After the event, we even performed on the SAF day at SAFTI MI.</p>
              <p>Was told at that time, the Chief-of-Defence Force was also formerly from NCC, he approved on these courses and even jumped together with us at the BAC together with NCC cadets, Gukas, Riggers and 3 sticks of Commandos.</p>
              <p>Anyway, airborne course is easy compared to other courses I had in NS later, it was a decades ago.</p>

              <p>Most of you guys would be too young to remember Uncle Winston, our original CDF.  He had a backing for his wing and it wasn't just red - it was yellow and we used to see him regularly down at PTW.</p>
              <p>A wing without a backing simply means that you can fall out of a plane without getting killed.  Hardly worth mention.</p>
