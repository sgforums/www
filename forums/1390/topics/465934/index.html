How do I apply for an extension of my disruption period?</strong><br><br>You can send your request through mail or fax to Human Resource Services Centre (HRSC), stating the reason for your request eg; repeat of studies etc and the required end date, together with the relevant supporting documents. Alternatively, you may also apply for extension of disruption online via <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ns.sg/nsPortal/index.jsp">www.ns.sg</a> and send the supporting document to us by mail, fax or email at <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:hrsccns@starnet.gov.sg">hrsccns@starnet.gov.sg</a>. Supporting document sent via email must be saved in word document or PDF format. Application for extension of disruption is to reach HRSC at least 3 weeks before the expiry of your disruption period.<br><br><strong style="font: inherit;">Q2a. Can I apply for an extension to pursue my Honours/Masters degree after I have completed my Basic degree?</strong><br><br><strong style="font: inherit;">Q2b. My disruption period as well as my exit permit is expiring soon but I intend to do my Honours/Masters. However, the outcome of my application for my Honours/Masters course will only be announced at a later date. What should I do?</strong><br><br>Extension of disruption for Honours/Masters degree may be allowed only if it can be obtained within 5 years (inclusive of the disruption period granted for the Basic degree). No extension for Honours/Masters degree will be granted if the original disruption period exceeds 5 years.<br><br>You may apply to extend your disruption for up to a maximum period of 3 months while waiting for confirmation of acceptance by the University. Your exit permit will also be extended upon extension of your disruption. No re-disruption for Honours/Masters will be allowed after resumption of service.<br><br><strong style="font: inherit;">Q3. How do I know if my online application for an extension has been successful?</strong><br><br>You can choose how you wish to be notified (ie email or postal service) of the outcome of your application under Preferred Means of correspondence.<br><strong style="font: inherit;"><br>Q4. What will happen if I fail to resume service after my disruption period has expired?</strong><br><br>NSFs on disruption must return immediately to serve out the balance of their Full-time NS as recalled, or upon discontinuation/completion of their studies. Disciplinary action will be taken against those who fail to do so. NSFs disrupted for overseas studies will have their exit permit withdrawn by the Central Manpower Base (CMPB) and be classified as exit permit defaulters.<br><br><strong style="font: inherit;">Q5. Can I switch to a different course of study?</strong><br><br>You are not allowed to switch courses or institution without the prior approval of the Human Resource Services Centre (HRSC). You are required to inform Human Resource Services Centre (HRSC) on the switch of study with documentary proof of the details of the new course. Approval may be granted if the switch does not lead to an extension of the maximum 5 years duration or the original disruption period. The switch must also be to a course that is at least equivalent to that of the original course.</p>

              <p><strong style="font: inherit;">Q1. What should I do if I am not available for the medical check-up that has been scheduled for me?</strong><br><br>Human Resource Services Centre (HRSC) will contact you regarding your medical check-up at the Medical Classification Centre (MCC) located at the Central Manpower Base (CMPB). If you are not available for the medical check-up that has been scheduled for you, you are to inform HRSC so that another appointment can be arranged for you.<br><br><strong style="font: inherit;">Q2. Can I go for my medical check-up before I complete my studies?</strong><br><br>You may go for your check-up at MCC/CMPB before you complete your studies. However, as the PES status accorded by MCC is only valid for a year, we advised that you contact HRSC to arrange for a medical appointment during your final year of study. This arrangement will facilitate your resumption of service immediately upon the completion of your studies.<br><br><strong style="font: inherit;">Q3. Can I request for a medical review before I resume my Full-time NS?</strong><br><br>Yes. HRSC will arrange for you to have a medical check-up at MCC/CMPB to ascertain your medical fitness once your application to resume full-time NS is received. Alternatively, you may also request for a medical review through your unit's manpower officer after you have resumed service.<br><br><strong style="font: inherit;">Q4. Can I choose to see my own Specialist or family doctor instead of going to the medical check-up at MCC/CMPB?</strong><br><br>No. The medical check-up at the MCC/CMPB is required to facilitate Medical Officers to review your medical conditions and to assign a medical PES status to you based on the current criteria outlined in the Medical Classification System. It is thus not possible for you to see your own Specialist or family doctor for this purpose. Nonetheless, you may ask your Specialist or family doctor for a medical report on your condition and to forward it to the Medical Officers who will then consider it in the assessment of your medical PES status.<br><br><strong style="font: inherit;">Q5. What are the documents that I have to bring along for the medical check-up at MCC/CMPB?</strong><br><br>You need to bring along your NRIC with any medical reports or supporting documents that will assist the Medical Officers in reviewing your medical condition and medical PES status.<br><br><strong style="font: inherit;">Q6. When will I complete my full-time NS if I apply to resume my service now?</strong><br><br>It depends on the balance of your full-time NS and your annual leave. You may contact Human Resource Services Centre (HRSC) to find out the balance of your full-time NS.<br><br><strong style="font: inherit;">Q7. Where would I be posted to upon my resumption of service?</strong><br><br>Usually for servicemen who have been trained in a specific vocation and who have only a short balance of full-time NS remaining, they would most likely be posted to their former units. However, there may be occasions where servicemen are re-deployed to other units due to organisational requirements.<br><br><strong style="font: inherit;">Q8. Will my tertiary qualifications or individual preferences be taken into consideration for deployment?</strong><br><br>The SAF's primary role is to build a fighting force that can defend Singapore and secure our peace. Therefore, this is the main consideration in deploying national servicemen to various vocations. Where necessary, we do take into consideration the national serviceman's education qualifications. But, the SAF will train every national serviceman to be effective in their respective vocations. Every vocation has a critical role to play in Singapore's security and defence.<br><br><strong style="font: inherit;">Q9. Can I request for a change in posting unit?</strong><br><br>You can forward your request to HRSC. However, please note that while MINDEF would like to take your posting preferences into account, any request will have to be considered vis-vis the organisational requirements.<br><br><strong style="font: inherit;">Q10. My uniform cannot fit me. Can I report for service in civilian attire?</strong><br><br>You can report in civilian attire if your uniform no longer fits you. However, please check with your unit's Chief Administrative Supervisor on the day of your reporting to arrange for a new set of uniform. Those reporting for Medical Officer Cadet course (MOCC) are required to put on white shirt and black pants.<br><br><strong style="font: inherit;">Q11. Can I serve out my balance of full-time NS over more than one vacation period?</strong><br><br>No. It is the policy of MINDEF that servicemen who wish to serve out the balance of their full-time NS during their school vacation must do so in one continuous period. Therefore, your vacation must be long enough for you to serve the balance of your full-time NS. No re-disruption will be allowed.<br><br><strong style="font: inherit;">Q12. Do I have to inform Human Resource Services Centre (HRSC) of my intention to pursue my Honours or Masters course upon completion of my basic degree?</strong><br><br>Yes. You will have to keep HRSC informed of your intention. Otherwise, you will be recalled to serve out the balance of your full-time NS when your current disruption period expires.<br><br><strong style="font: inherit;">Q13. When will I know the outcome of my application to resume service?</strong><br><br>Under normal processing, you will received a Notice to Render Full-time National Service (NOR) sent to your local mailing address within 6 weeks from the date of your application to resume service. If you do not receive a reply after 6 weeks, your application may have been forwarded to a higher authority and would therefore require a longer processing time.<br><br><strong style="font: inherit;">Q14. If I have not completed my combat course prior to disruption, will I be sent for the same course on re-enlistment?</strong><br><br>If you are medically fit for combat vocations, you may be sent for the same combat course upon your resumption.<br><br><strong style="font: inherit;">Q15. I wish to resume my service during my vacation break. Is this possible?</strong><br><br>Yes. You should apply for the resumption of service at least 6 weeks in advance if you wish to serve the balance of service during your vacation break. However upon resumption, you must serve the balance of your full-time NS in one continuous period. You are not allowed to serve your balance of full-time NS over 2 (or more) vacation periods. Once service is resumed, you will not be granted re-disruption. It is important therefore, that you ensure your vacation period can accommodate your balance of full-time NS.<br><br><strong style="font: inherit;">Q16. What should I do if I want to serve out the balance of my full-time NS before my disruption expires?</strong><br><br>You will need to notify Human Resource Services Centre (HRSC) of your intention to resume service at least 6 weeks in advance.<br><br><strong style="font: inherit;">Q17. I was given a few days of medical leave by a private clinic before the effective date for me to report to unit to serve out the balance of my full-time NS. Will the few days of medical leave be counted towards the balance of my full-time NS?</strong><br><br>No. If you are not able to report to your unit because of a medical leave not granted by an SAF doctor, the date of your resumption will be postponed until you are medically fit to report to your unit for service.<br><strong style="font: inherit;"><br>Q18. How can I check my leave balance?</strong><br><br>Your previous unit maintains your leave records. You can check your leave balance with them before your disruption from full-time NS.<br><br><strong style="font: inherit;">Q19. Can I use my annual leave to request for an early ORD to enable me to start work earlier/return and complete my study?</strong><br><br>No, you are not allowed to use your annual leave or Off to request for an early ORD.</p>
