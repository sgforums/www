              <p>the only thing that held me back then was my education - that 4 o levels can't even make it to sispec. the cmpb screening thing was funny - i actually fell asleep and spammed the 'ok' key or smth and i finished the test when i woke up. but ended up in armour - the other intakes at that time was commandos, NDU, guards, armour.. january 05 batch.</p>

              <p>There are other careers in the army besides officers and if they allow everyone to sign on as officers, there would be noone who will be willing to sign on as a WOSPEC and that will lead to a large imbalence in the structure of the company.</p>

              <p>I think the issue is not that they don't allow, rather it is that they judge the person unsuitable based on the records during ns.</p>
              <p> I think it's a way for them to shortlist, otherwise they would have to test rigorously all those who sign up and want to be officers. Which I suspect would be most of the sign ups.</p>

              <p>you have got to be kidding if you ask this in earnesty. if everyone in SAF is an officer, where is SAF supposed to get specialists and NCOs and men from?</p>
              <p>And fyi, nowhere in the ads do I see an indication that they were made for officers only. The ads are based on concepts of leadership, military life and adventure..nowhere do you see only officers cavorting about in the officers' mess for officers only.</p>

              <p>SPF and SCDF don't follow such a ruling though with regards to
                                  signing on for "officer" positions.</p>

              <p>Yup, you're right, SPF and SCDF do not follow this rule. Do note that it's common knowledge since SAF and SPF were conceived in the late 1960s that SPF is the dumping ground of SAF. Back in those days until now, people who fail to make it as an officer in the SAF sign on to SPF as an officer. As you rightly say, SPF does not follow this rule, so obviously it's logical and plausible that the lack of this rule has caused this dumping to occur since time immemorial.</p>
              <p>SCDF is even worse than SPF.</p>
              <p>in general, a number of components in NS life do translate to identical terms and circumstances of career uniformed personnel. For NSFs, certain people are deemed unfit for various reasons to be in SAF even as men, in certain formations, appointments and certain vocations are completely prohibited to them, we all know they are channelled to SPF and SCDF for NS, an indication of the kind of work and business and budget and arms and influence and importance of the three forces. This is already a clear and obvious indication to anyone with half a brain that for regulars, SPF and even worse, SCDF are dumping ground of SAF, unfortunately. Its been ongoing since your father's time in the 70s and common knowledge till this day save for some very blur people still in the mist, ask any of the older folks or go to oldmen forums like sammyboy and they will tell you.</p>
              <p>Someone once said that SCDF is for people deemed to be so inapt that they can't be trusted with a rifle, and can only be trusted with a hose. Harsh but true. The person went on to say that by order of goodness the uniformed groups in SG are Boy Scouts, Girl Guides, SAF, SPF and SCDF.</p>

              <p>i think MDES can... i saw somewhere about the different MDES rank represent the army ranks..</p>
              <p>however, when i was talking to someone on the recruitment line (not the officer) he said engineering have exception. you might want to try again since 2007 and 2009 might have some changes.</p>

              <p>Should be same as officer or warrent officer one, for the scheme, maybe no change, except the rank looks more like SPF one.</p>
              <p>this is my opinion,</p>
              <p>if anyone wants to sign-on, their mindset should be, go-in as 3rd sgt and come-out as second-warrent, or at least staff sgt.</p>
              <p>Don't sign for 5-6 years and regret this, regert that. theat this as a career. if that's the case, then don't sign.</p>
