              <p>Hi all!</p>
              <p>I'm a Singaporean who has deferred my NS and have spent 8 years of my life overseas, completing my medical degree and getting full medical registration in Australia, and getting married as well (to a malaysian). I will be returning to Singapore soon to start my NS, and am fairly clueless as to what will happen (even the Mindef websites don't give a lot of info). Basically these are my questions:</p>
              <p>1. How do I know when I actually start my formal NS training? I have friends who had to report back for a medical in January, but were told they can only start in July (early enrolments were all full). Is there anything I can do to increase my chances of getting an earlier enrolment, to avoid wasting time?</p>
              <p>2. What will my training program be like? Will I do the full 3 months BMT and then the 4 months MOCC?I'll be 25 when i start - what will this affect?</p>
              <p>3. My wife will be coming back with me to SG (i understand she can get a PR as a spouse). How will being married change my NS period (if at all)?</p>
              <p><br>I would appreciate any accurate information - thanks heaps!</p>
              <p>Cheers</p>
              <p>Sing</p>

              <p>Thanks again for those links - I have already had a quick look through them, and have found minimal detail on the NS structure for doctors, other than a 4 month MOCC course.</p>

              <p>If I were you, I would rather stay in Australia than return to Singapore. Why would want to come back to Singapore just to complete your NS when you have a wonderful career life ahead of you?</p>
              <p>Anyways to answer your question, i think that you only can take this kind of overseas leave only if you do not have training on the days that you are taking leave and annual leave last only 14days...</p>

              <p>Add to that the fact that 6 years of medical school and working full time (plus overtime) as a doctor doesn't really leave me in good physical shape :P</p>

              <p>To loki: well coming back to singapore for that 2 years isn't just about NS i think...it's also a time to spend with family and friends. My parents aren't that young, so I know that they aren't going to be around much longer - and I'm sure they miss me ;)</p>
              <p>besides, I'm blessed in the sense that having a medical degree opens up lots of career opportunities...even if there is a few years of disruption, there's enough demand that I can slip back into the medical workforce easily.</p>
              <p>in addition (and maybe most importantly) - my wife is also misses singapore (she grew up in sg, although she's malaysian)!</p>
              <p>besides, how many other doctors (in australia i mean) can put "served 2 years as a medical doctor in the army (obtaining rank of Captain)" in their resume? Sounds very big to the overseas people :P:P</p>

              <p>to kengkia: I wouldn't disagree that there are alot of elements about singaporean governance that are less than idea....but you and I grew up in singapore and turned out alright didn't we ;)</p>
              <p>In any case, it's interesting to note that in the last few years, the SG govt has been pouring alot of money into overseas consultancy work .... to reshape issues of education, healthcare, etc. I think they are starting to realise that some things are amiss, and the people are starting to stir ;)</p>

              <p>Other then the fact you need to inform CMPB when you decide to go on overseas leave, NS pretty much won't do anything to your passport.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if you need a different set of opinions about NS, you can go to this forum:</p>

              <p>Now the new passports only valid for 5 years only,</p>
              <p>Anyway the MOCC course is quite tough but after that all MOs enjoy good life in the Medical Centre. But still depends on what unit, some units MO need to go into field once a while but most if the time the MO stay in medical centre.</p>

              <p>Sir, full respect for you willing to come back and do your 2yrs</p>
              <p>regarding BMT, you would have to do your full BMT, then MOCC, those period will be fully stay in, but most OCs are usually impress to have a Doctor as a recruit anyway, and would treat you pretty decently i guess, you can teach a thing or two to your cover medic during BMT, they would appriciate that, i know i will</p>
              <p>Good luck more when you come out from MOCC, thats when they shit part begin. when you are actually having pretty much one of the worst medical support crew around in the form of mostly unwilling medics which forgot about their skills the min they leave SMTI.</p>

              <p>I'm noticing some differing information already - so is the MOCC a stay in or a 8-5 course? And is life as an MO after MOCC "easy" or "shit" (as 2 people have mentioned :P).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to dracula: I didn't even do A levels in singapore...left before I was 16 to do high school in australia (hence could defer NS). So no, I didn't try to apply for a local university. In any case, at 16 when I'm itching to get away from home, and my parents offer me the chance to pursue studies at what seems to be an awesome place, why not just take it? At least that's how I felt :)</p>
              <p>Criteria for acceptance differs on which uni you're at...best to look at the course guides available online. Fees also differ based on whether you are overseas student, local full fee, or local HECS (govt subsidised)...</p>
