              <p>TS.</p>
              <p>     Upon completing my GCSE O levels in Singapore, I elected to begin further education in the United States.</p>
              <p>    I understand that you will be granted a stay of service if you are admitted to a Degree-awarding university and pursing at least the qualification of a BA/BSc . For the stay to be effected, you have to begin your course prior to turning 17 1/2.</p>
              <p>   As for the 75K issue, that sum does not buy you freedom - its a deposit / insurance to secure your return from overseas education. The sum varies depending on your family's wealth, but if I recall correctly, it STARTS at 75K. Financial assets including property, bank bonds or the like may be utilized in place of hard cold cash.</p>
              <p> Utilizing this option had served me well in NS... at least I was more educated than many of my peers, more outspoken and could "work within" the system better than my O-A-ITE peers who really suffered.</p>

              <p>hi all, here to add new questions on this thread</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My post secondary school studies route is like this:</p>
              <p>Express(due to bad O'Levels results)-&gt;ITE year 1(dropped out before the 2nd started and entered Poly)-&gt;Poly year 1 and 2.</p>
              <p>But like many other individuals, I feel that this current diploma/course I'm taking is what I dislike/not interested etc. and feel like going to a private institution to do another type of course.</p>
              <p>Because its been 2-3 years since I've entered both institutions I kinda forgot whether I did or did not get defered.</p>
              <p>So here's my qn: letssay I did for each entry to both, am I still allowed to defer again to pursue this new course? If I only defered once(for poly), am I also still allowed to defer again to pursue this new course.?</p>
              <p>am currently 19, will be 20 in less than 2 months time</p>

              <p>Haaa, thanks. Yea, I got my letter a few weeks back, but it told me that I have to wait for next month before applying for deferment.<br><br>Regarding the change in IC and all, well it's not really that big a deal. $120 for a name change, $60 to change your photo + name + sex in your IC. Could get it all done in a couple of hours. <img title="Wink" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink"></p>

              <p>you're gonna be 20. can't defer liao.</p>
              <p>anyway, everybody also feel the same way as you. i dun like my poly course too, but no choice. paper qualification is impt. chasing plainly on dreams these days are out of the qn. if you still do not know what you really want, you wld haf to spend more time exploring and finding out wad interests you. and that wld be a serious waste of time. since you are already in yr 2, juz bite your teeth and complete the diploma course. any diploma is still a diploma. from a diploma den u can go to private unis. and there are perks for dip holders going to private unis. unless you are very sure abt wad u wanna do den u just pursue it lor.</p>
              <p>but bottomline is...i dun think you can't defer anymore. but still you can call up CMPB to check. all the best man.</p>
