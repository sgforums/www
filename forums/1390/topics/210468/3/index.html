In summary or rather, correction, i should say the commanders/management level there are more "open". I have to stick with this as if you ever compare a combat unit with a school, SMM (i prefer to call the prev name) you'll realise what im saying.<br><br>Anyway, please accept the fact that anyone who go through before the medic course will afterall find it slack. who doesnt?<br><br>1st, the specs there are usually people who're highly educated therefore whos willing to hear things out first before any punishment is executed. And, the specs go through our CMC before. They understand more than we do.<br><br>2nd, people from different places are comming to attend the course for 2 1/2 month and will leave shortly after that. It's a school, my dear. So in anyway, it will still be slack to a certain extend. I stated on my previous post that, medics need to mug for exams in our course didnt i? well, if mugging is a slacking and relax process to you, im glad for you.<br><br>Well, as in for my course, only that 1-2 made our instructors life difficult but it's not due to the slacking of the course k?<br><br>Oh ya... recently i was asked by a ORD friend who was a medic and was shock that im a medic as well. Questions like "SMM shuang hor?" always burpt out. I think alot people will agree with me unless im really differ alot from that.<br><br>Okay, lastly... LASTLY! Medic's learning dont end after the course in SMM, in fact! SMM only teaches us the basics. I frankly learn the whole lots of other medic knowledge after i pass out from school. <strong>Medics learning doesnt stop in after passing out from school but throughout the 2 years of your medic life, you'll be learning. . .</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Seek, Save, Serve!
