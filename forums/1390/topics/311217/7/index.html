              <p>And look what our Honourable SAF is resorting to, threatening? Oppression? Typical actions of the typical bully. When it all boils down, they are but a bunch of bullies with license.</p>

              <p>When you die, its not so bad, people around you might be devastated but you cease to feel, cease to be aware, cease to need, cease to want, cease to know. But when you get stuck with a permanent handicap, no matter how resilient or jovial you may be. Every corner you turn, you'll be reminded of it, subconciously it slowly gnaws at your very soul and you'll never feel complete again till the day you lay six feet under. </p>

              <p><br> What do you mean by take care of yourself? If your superior say you
              are ok, means you are ok. What? bypass CoC to ask for help at the
              threat of being send to DB?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>If obviously your working environment is a health hazard and if you've already tried going by the CoC, then you just skip it and find higher authority. There's life beyond the 2 years of NS. Why should we sacrifice our body to such extend that might affect our future. There's no medal to any bones we break and certainly there's no empathy for the injuries we sustained.</p>
              <p>If your superior obviously put you in danger, they are in the wrong. Its their responsiblitiy to ensure safety of their men. And if your superior do not ensure, it's us to ensure it.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>That is exactly the attitude that is the problem-- people who
                                      'play the system', who think that it is their right to do what they
                                      want and not take responsibility for the consequences.</p>
              <p>Yes, you may not have a choice of whether to serve or not, but
                                      since you have to serve, why not make the best of things? Do you
                                      think that always trying to find the easy way out will let you live
                                      the good life?</p>
              <p>Again, I've said many times-- The SAF may have fucked up people,
                                      but where in life are you going to find a
                                      place/company/organisation without similar other fucked up people?
                                      Learning to deal with fucktards is part and parcel of life.</p>
              <p>Sometimes I really sympathise with the MOs. Do you people
                                      realise that many of them are just serving their bond like you
                                      before they can go into private practice? The fact that many of
                                      them actually take pride in their work is a miracle in itself.</p>
              <p>Lastly, and most importantly, the military is, and always will
                                      be, a DANGEROUS place. It is the nature of the job. The military is
                                      trying to train the average X-box/PS/Nintendo playing guy into a
                                      soldier who has the strength of the weightlifter, the stamina of
                                      the marathon runner, the accuracy of the competition shooter and
                                      the will to fight of the champion boxer. Regardless of all the
                                      safety procedures, accidents will happen and people will die or get
                                      injured. For example, in the past 2 months 6 US Navy SEALs have
                                      died in TRAINING accidents. They were not even in Iraq of
                                      Afghanistan!</p>
              <p>So, in summary, be a man and stop whining! If you are normally a
                                      garang soldier, and suffered an injury which prevents you from
                                      performing your duties, your PC/PS will definately take the
                                      appropriate action. But if you have a reputation as a chao-keng,
                                      Attend-B King, just remember all the fraudulent medical leave that
                                      you took if you ever suffer an injury and get refused
                                      treatment!</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Even private companies have chao keng. There's people who went to see their company doctor to get MC for nothing. There're even people who buy cough syrup from their company doc even though they do not have cough.  But why didn't the doctor brand them as chao keng? Cause he's paid at a good rate.</p>
              <p>But the MO are just like us who are NSF are paid peanuts and bound by law into serving the nation. But MO should maintain their professionalism because they are only fellow in the whole unit that help soldiers medically. So whether chao keng or not, they shouldn't be reject medical treatment.</p>

              OF GOING DB? Did you know that calling the SAF hotline is
              technically considered bypassing CoC? Once you are in DB, your
              entire life is screwed, going DB is considered a criminal offence
              right-which means you cant enter uni? (somebody care to correct me
              on this point?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And you might get it worst from your superiors after he finds
              out that you disagree with his opinions.</p>

              <p>You can try going by the CoC 1st. But if nothing is done or if it takes too long and your condition is deteoriating at every second, you should look for help. If your case is geniune, maybe they'll just reprimand you for skipping CoC cause they know they are putting your life in danger. Just cover backside and do what's necessary and at least this is what i did for myself.</p>

              <p>I think everybody here should take one step back and look at the issue objectively.</p>
              <p>If the bloggers case is true, there is NO WAY that the SAF could pressure him to close down his blog. At the very least, the incident itself (him losing his sight) would result in a Board of Inquiry, and you can be very sure that it would be discussed in Parliment.  If the SAF, or some part of the SAF, is found to be actively supressing the blog, you can be very sure that many heads will roll.</p>
              <p><br>So then, why did the blogger take down his blog? I think that he posted that story because he was pissed off with someone in the SAF, probably his superiors. Maybe he thought that it would be funny to play a little prank. Once he realised that people were taking his story for real and publicising it, he got worried, and tried to get out of the situation as easily as possible, because he could be criminally liable for making false accusations against the SAF.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, the fact that so many people chime in with their own stories, some of which may be true, is in fact disturbing, but shows once again, that the SAF, like every other organisation, is made of imperfect people. But I think that there are certain misconceptions-- Calling the SAF Hotline will not get you thrown into DB. Yes, people can argue that it is circumventing the chain of command, but the point is that it is supposed to be used when the chain of command has failed. That being said, if you use the SAF Hotline fraudulently (i.e. you made a false or unjustified complaint), you can expect that there would be repercussions within the chain of command, possibly affecting you. Of course, since we are all garang and honorable soldiers, that would never happen, right? :D</p>

              <p>I contend that, in this case, the MO is professional and the company doctor is negligent and should be fired! Doctors are supposed to heal, not to harm, and prescribing medicine when the patient is not sick can lead to harm in the patient! Professionalism on the part of the MO also emcompasses making sure that the unit is fit to fight. That is part of his unspoken duty. He is in fact obliged, in spirit if not in law, to make sure that chao keng soldiers are sent where they belong--with their sections, training, just as he is obliged to make sure that real cases are allowed to rest. So, in the case that you mentioned, Kudos to the MO!</p>

              <p>Frankly...IMHO this guy was denied medical treatment etc. due to this fucked up policy and mentality that is very very rampant in SG. Unlike other countries, which is usually innocent until proven guilty, our system here is that of guilty until proven innocent. Which is in some cases, such as this, too little too late. Also, frankly there are many kengsters in the SAF, who spoil the market and thus genuine cases often get swept aside as well. MO side, we have to empathise that they are suppose to help identify the cases so that they are treated accordingly</p>
              <p>A little suggestion is that perhaps the MOs should reverse the policy, and treat all cases brought to their attention as genuine. When those kengsters are caught, punish them harshly. That will be a fair system to weed out the genuine from the keng-ing ones. Just my 2 cents, the harsh punishment will serve as a deterrent to those whom wanna keng.</p>

              <p>You sympathise with that?! i did a double take when i read this. You are actually speaking up for and sympathizing with the attitude of "just serving bond and passing time before one goes into private practice"?!</p>
              <p>Is that the attitude that taxpayers are paying for? Did those sign-on MOs not get their local medical education sponsored? BY TAXPAYER'S MONEY?!?!? Hello there is no such thing as a free lunch in this world ok? A person who has actually qualified and gone through OCS should rightfully behave and think like an officer who genuinely wants to lead people and better the organisation/country.</p>
              <p>A person who has qualified for and passed the medicine course interview should rightfully be someone who has a compassion for people, who wants to save lives and minimise pain, and who has the greater good of the world as one of his objectives. And not "JUST WAITING to go to PRIVATE PRACTICE!"</p>
              <p>So what if the Local Medicine Award is one of the least respected and crappier awards given out and kena bastardized by the local medicine fraternity (basically military doctors are seen as ppl who wasted the most important years of their careers treating keng cases)? Did these people not project a certain impression to the SAF when they applied and PRETENDED they genuinely want to serve?!?! Did they not get a free medicine education PAID FOR BY THE GOVERNMENT?!?! How would you like it or react if the real elite scholars like SAFOS and president's scholars ever say such things? "Just hanging around and waiting to go private practice?!" WTF!!</p>

              <p><br> Hi edwin, please don't mind I ask. Have you done NS before? I hope
              I don't sound blunt to you, but you sound like someone who has
              not done NS or not treaded painful paths before.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>... Yes I have done NS before. I have also got my fair share of extras, punishments and so on. I still think that the emotional, knee-jerk reaction that most people have to this unverified story is, at best, misguided, when it is clear that given that it is a conscript force, the SAF cannot cover up any such incidents or it will lose the public trust.</p>
              <p>I say again: This story has been publicised and STOMPed, and immediately after that the blogger removes his blog? Why would he do that unless his story was untrue? If his story is true, you can be sure some MP will raise the issue in Parliment and then you will see some heads roll.</p>

              <p>You sympathise with that?! i did a double take when i read this.
              You are actually speaking up for and sympathizing with the attitude
              of "just serving bond and passing time before one goes into private
              practice"?!</p>
              <p>Is that the attitude that taxpayers are paying for? Did those
              sign-on MOs not get their local medical education sponsored? BY
              TAXPAYER'S MONEY?!?!? Hello there is no such thing as a free lunch
              in this world ok? A person who has actually qualified and gone
              through OCS should rightfully behave and think like an officer who
              genuinely wants to lead people and better the
              organisation/country.</p>
              <p>A person who has qualified for and passed the medicine course
              interview should rightfully be someone who has a compassion for
              people, who wants to save lives and minimise pain, and who has the
              greater good of the world as one of his objectives. And not "JUST
              WAITING to go to PRIVATE PRACTICE!"</p>
              <p>So what if the Local Medicine Award is one of the least
              respected and crappier awards given out and kena bastardized by the
              local medicine fraternity (basically military doctors are seen as
              ppl who wasted the most important years of their careers treating
              keng cases)? Did these people not project a certain impression to
              the SAF when they applied and PRETENDED they genuinely want to
              serve?!?! Did they not get a free medicine education PAID FOR BY
              THE GOVERNMENT?!?! How would you like it or react if the real elite
              scholars like SAFOS and president's scholars ever say such things?

              <p>You misunderstand--- I did not at anytime support the "just serving bond and passing time before one goes into private
              practice" attitude. If you read what I typed, I said that, despite the fact that some of these doctors(some of whom are my friends) want to go into private practice and so on, they STILL act professionally and differentiate the chao keng kia from the really sick, when the easier path to take was to just issue out Attend B to any Tom, Dick or Harry who whined. I give kudos to their professionalism, and to their moral courage.</p>
              <p>Also, not all MOs are bonded to the military, in fact a very small number of them are. Most of them, even those who are MOs for our Battalions, are guys who are smart enough and have the passion for medicine to decide to study medicine and then do their NS duty before they go out to work. Please, before you start jumping down my throat, get your facts right.</p>
