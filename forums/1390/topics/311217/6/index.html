              <p>Hey, I got to take down my blog for awhile...</p>
              <p>Received a call from you-know-who, regarding you-know-what.</p>
              <p>Anyway,
              I know you guys meant well, but screaming Hatred for you-know-what will
              get me into more trouble. I'm not running an anti-you-know-what
              campaign here, and this is causing me a great deal of stress. As much
              as I severely dislike you-know-what, there are some things that we
              can't control. Please spare a thought for me, how would you feel if you
              are in my shoes? (size 9) I am getting blamed for things other people
              suggested, and it's not fair for me. Life hasn't been fair to me much,
              but I believe it will get better. This is tremendous stress isn't good
              for my health too. I am touched that so many people care, and that
              itself made life more worthy of living.</p>
              <p>I have nothing to hide,
              all I said was true. But this might jeopardize my compensation and
              scholarship and that's not good for my future. You-know-what has
              already advised me, and there are some valid points. You-know-what
              hates to be pressurized and the publicity isn't good for these 2
              important things for me. I hope you guys understand it.</p>
              <p>Winced in
              pain everytime I hear from my friends ( you might be in trouble). It's
              my experience in these 2 years and I'm glad it inspired some people to
              live their life stronger.</p>

Nobody believed me, my PC thought I was trying to get attention, my Medic thought I was just another Chow Keng recruit and my MO thought that all I needed was a bloody small bottle of eye droplets! OMG... Many thanks to the "You can do it if you try harder attitude". Many thanks to the guys who pushed me on, my 3SGs my PC my PSG. You were not only responsible for making my shoulder joing so loose that it'll pop out whenever I do a standard overgraph pullup, you even chose to ignore it. Many thanks to all. My shoulder is now screwed and I'll have to pay more than $2k just to get it "videotaped" as evidence so I can downgrade to a meagre clerk doing 9-5. Difference is, why the hell must I go through all the shit just to downgrade to a worse vocation doing 9-5 looking at stupid paperwork?! SAF I thank thee, you screwed up my body big time.</p></div>

              <p>don't mistake me. i'm not anti-SAF. i look forward to BMT and i aspire to become an airforce officer. i have officer friends both airforce and army, they take pride in what they do, but they also know how to carry themselves well to reflect well upon fellow officers and the SAF. if you don't carry yourself well, will the men have confidence in you? or wld u be one of those "ociffers" (officer clowns).</p>

              <p><br>Do not blame it on the keng'sters if the professionals do not have the professionalism to look into the matter and just render them as keng'sters!</p>
              <p>They should be trained enough to see whether it was real or kenging... cos of these untrained professionals, I nearly die of lung infections during bmt! Lucky me clever enough to exercise my rights and seek medical treatment outside of camp!</p>

              <p>btw.. talking about training and professionalism.. soldiers are trained to be professionals at what they do too.. so what happened to the keng kings?  are they let off the hook?</p>
              <p>the failings of the SAF doctors do not exonerate everyone else of their failings...</p>
              <p>you were responsible enough to look for treatment... that is not luck.. that is your choice.. that is your right..</p>
              <p>what about those who can't even be responsible enough to exercise their own right to seek a 2nd opinion?  especially when they know there is something seriously wrong with them?</p>

              <p>well, you can't really expect everyone to comply when they are actually forced to serve.</p>
              <p>Having MO in the camp is to facilitate the safe environment within the camp itself. If MO find excuses to avoid practicing professionalism in their field... what more would they find excuse in real practical medical world that they would go out to?</p>

              <p>Some unit actually do not allow you to report sick outside. So if you can't see a doctor outside, it's quite difficult to seek 2nd opinion by yourself. The MO should practice their medical knowledge to help whether it's a kengster or not.</p>

              <p>That is exactly the attitude that is the problem-- people who 'play the system', who think that it is their right to do what they want and not take responsibility for the consequences.</p>
              <p>Yes, you may not have a choice of whether to serve or not, but since you have to serve, why not make the best of things? Do you think that always trying to find the easy way out will let you live the good life?</p>
              <p>Again, I've said many times-- The SAF may have fucked up people, but where in life are you going to find a place/company/organisation without similar other fucked up people? Learning to deal with fucktards is part and parcel of life.</p>
              <p>Sometimes I really sympathise with the MOs. Do you people realise that many of them are just serving their bond like you before they can go into private practice? The fact that many of them actually take pride in their work is a miracle in itself.</p>
              <p>Lastly, and most importantly, the military is, and always will be, a DANGEROUS place. It is the nature of the job. The military is trying to train the average X-box/PS/Nintendo playing guy into a soldier who has the strength of the weightlifter, the stamina of the marathon runner, the accuracy of the competition shooter and the will to fight of the champion boxer. Regardless of all the safety procedures, accidents will happen and people will die or get injured. For example, in the past 2 months 6 US Navy SEALs have died in TRAINING accidents. They were not even in Iraq of Afghanistan!</p>
              <p>So, in summary, be a man and stop whining! If you are normally a garang soldier, and suffered an injury which prevents you from performing your duties, your PC/PS will definately take the appropriate action. But if you have a reputation as a chao-keng, Attend-B King, just remember all the fraudulent medical leave that you took if you ever suffer an injury and get refused treatment!</p>

              <p><br>Yes. I agree that the military is a dangerous place and regardless of whatever safety measures put in place, there's bound to be accidents.</p>
              <p>But I don't think that's the main issue here.</p>
              <p>You argued that the blogger has a responsibility to take care of his own body. Maybe. But did he not seek outside help or a second doctor's opinion? He even went to the National Eye Centre...but still, was that of any use? His superiors still forced him to work didn't they?</p>
              <p>The problem now is that those responsible are unwilling and scared to own up to their mistakes and make appropriate compensation. Even the counsellor, for goodness sake, quitted the very day the blogger became blind and never contacted him again despite promising him he would.</p>
              <p>By threatening and preventing the blogger from telling others the truth, they are hiding facts and cowering away in the corner trying to escape from the problem, while ignoring the guy who will become blind due to their mistakes. From all the 360 degree angle I looked at it, this is a sad incident that could be avoided.</p>

              <p><br>Please... not every one a fit soldier! Like the blogger, he had already sounded out about his medical problem but was ignored. MO also do not give a fark... go seek medical attention outside, they call him chao keng and wanna charge him... You think this is the treatment that you would accept if you were in his shoes?</p>
              <p>Not all men are equal in physical, mental and medical... So, you think of those who are less than you a wayang and keng'sters?</p>
              <p>He did his part, try to asked for an transfer. We all know that storeman do not do much work but since his environment is endangering his health, would you not help him in transfering or place him to another position in the camp that do not endanger his health condition?</p>
              <p>As such, I hope all the commanders above that person get into trouble! This is a incident that can be avoid if they just listen to that guy!</p>
