              <p>Seriously that is a sad case. lucky for me mine is not as bad. and did not have to suffer permanent disability... yet. Due to lugging heavy equipment around during active times had deformed my spine. had i not gotten a MRI done at my own expense, i would not have known how bad it was. so now when i go back to reservist i do not give a damn about anything, i just go there for relaxing holiday.</p>
              <p>So to all those who are being enlisted, do not be afraid to speak out, go see a medical specialist if u have to. you do not wanna regret it when things happens. u definately do not want to be handicapped before u are 20.</p>

              (Why didnt he get a down PES at CMPB during the initial check up?)
              
              toking abt tis...lets nt forget tat some medical officers r on SAF side...they r there to reject downgrading of PES status so tat SAF will have more combat fit soldiers...remember tat loyalty to country is no.1 while care for soldiers is no.7...i somehow feel tat no.7 was included jus to make up the numbers...just to show to parents n recruits tat theres care for soldiers...but after u have gone thru army will u realise tat tis "care" tat they r referring to is nth more than juz ensuring ur safety while serving army...
              
              one more thing: y r officers n sgts so concerned abt ur safety??? is it cos they realli care for u or is it cos they have to protect their own interests??? rem tat they r accountable for u n if anything bad happens to u, they have to answer to higher authorities...so by ensuring ur safety, r they nt doing it wif an ulterior motive??? if tats the case, tats nt truly caring for soldiers...if they didnt have to answer for us, would they stil care???

              <p>i dont think the MOs scrimp on MCs, and esp for PES C ppl. during my bmt (pes c2l2), had more than half the platoon with medical status at one point of time. in fact, to get an ex status was so easy that pp were abusing it- just see a specialist outside, get him to write a letter and show that letter to the MO. one guy was even given oot for flat foot (which he claim was very severe).</p>
              <p>given the fact, the guy could have done much more to make sure that his rights are governed, and esp since he has ord-ed alr, even more reason to do so now.</p>

Being able to cross train definitely appeal to the mass recruits as it will serve as a leverage for the recruit at the end of the contract. But merely 3 years later the ‘terms and conditions are subjected to change’ took place and somehow the scheme was scrapped. The premium plan replaced the JPSDS and of course it didn’t appeal to me. Those who wanted to continue may convert to the Premium Plan and stay for 10 years but those who do not want will continue as a pure combatant and leave on the 6<sup>th</sup> year. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">While working in the SAF, I encountered many other more nonsense. But a BG who took the efforts &amp; stood up for his men. Because of his timely intervention, I was spared with further nonsense from the SAF so called ‘code of conduct’. Got converted to become a technician and this 3 years plus of exposure in this industry helped to form the foundation of the breadwinning career I have today in a German MNC. Up till today, I still keep in contact with the BG who left the SAF also around my time.</span></span></p>
