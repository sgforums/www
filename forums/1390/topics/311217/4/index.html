              <p>There is definately nothing wrong with the SAF policy. It is the way the policy is executed that makes the politics there dirty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Have you ever been through situations whereby words are twisted around as many times just to get work done regardless how shameful it is? In the SAF it has become a culture whereby pple unconsciously do. And in my career with the SAF, I've gone through many times, seen people gone through it, see how some of my colleagues play around with filthy underhanded means to get work done. Even at the cost of another person. The beauty of it is that even at the end of it, there is always a way to justify it. This sounds familiar?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even in the private sector, such culture is also common in especially the large Singaporean MNC. The policy is naturally set to protect the company's interests. But many times the method of execution is dirty. Seen and been through some of most dirty polictics with the old timers of large Singaporean MNC.</p>
              <p>But at least in the EU MNC I am working for now, such practices even though exists, the method of carrying out the policies are not as low handed as you can expect from a Singaporean MNC / SAF.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I urge you to observe the way things are being done in the SAF and a large reputable EU MNC.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From there we can easily see who gets to retain talents more easily.</p>

              <p>Rarely heard about accidents doesn't mean there's no accident. When you go in, you'll start witnessing/heard about so many accidents that you start to wonder why none of them appeared on the news (except for the fatal accidents of course).</p>

              <p>I wouldn't believe everything I saw on the internet. If this is a true story, fine, it has been STOMPed, so let the news media go and verify the story. The fact that the blog has been made private after this story went public makes me very suspicious about the story.</p>
              <p>Again, to all those who complain about politics and/or regulations that protect the SAF, I challenge you to find a private company that doesn't have the same politics/regulations.</p>
