              <p>Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen revealed in Parliament today 
              that there were breaches of training safety regulations in the deaths of
               two full-time National Servicemen in separate training incidents this 
              year, and detailed the actions taken following the findings reported by 
              the Committees of Inquiry (COI). <br><br> A Commanding Officer has 
              been replaced and other commanders have been redeployed, for the 
              regulations breached under their watch. Investigations are ongoing to 
              see if they should be prosecuted in the military or civil courts.<br><br> <br> <strong>The following is Dr Ng's statement in full: </strong><br> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to report to this House the findings
               from the Committees of Inquiry (COI) that were convened after the 
              deaths of two full-time National Servicemen in separate training 
              incidents in April and May this year. Before I begin, I want to offer my
               deepest condolences to the families of PTE Lee Rui Feng Dominique 
              Sarron and 3SG Tan Mou Sheng. The SAF and MINDEF are deeply sorry for 
              the untimely and tragic loss of PTE Lee and 3SG Tan and the anguish and 
              distress it has brought to their families.<br><br> The COIs were 
              convened by the Armed Forces Council to investigate the circumstances 
              surrounding the deaths of PTE Lee and 3SG Tan. COIs are chaired by 
              senior civil servants outside MINDEF. Members include one or two medical
               specialists, who would be able to provide professional expertise. The 
              COI has full powers and access to information and personnel to 
              independently investigate fully the circumstances leading to death, to 
              determine the contributory events or persons and make recommendations to
               rectify lapses, if any. MINDEF and the SAF treat COI reports with 
              utmost seriousness so that we can avoid similar occurrences.<br><br> In the cases of PTE Lee and 3SG Tan, their respective COIs have 
              uncovered clear breaches of training safety regulations in the events 
              that led to their deaths. I will now brief the Members of the House on 
              their key findings, and the follow up measures the SAF will take in 
              response.<br><br><br> <strong>PTE Lee Rui Feng Dominique Sarron</strong><br> First, the main findings from the COI report on PTE Lee. On 17 Apr
               2012, PTE Lee participated in an exercise at the Murai Urban Training 
              Facility at Lim Chu Kang. Smoke grenades were thrown outside a building.
               PTE Lee entered one of the rooms of that building, and experienced 
              breathing difficulties after exposure to the smoke. He was immediately 
              accompanied away from the smoke but lost consciousness outside the 
              building. He received Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation on the spot and was
               evacuated in a safety vehicle to the Sungei Gedong Medical Centre, 
              before being sent to the National University Hospital (NUH) in an SAF 
              ambulance. Resuscitative efforts by an SAF medical officer continued 
              throughout the journey and at NUH. The COI found that "the medical aid 
              rendered was timely, adequate and proper". Regrettably however, PTE Lee 
              was pronounced dead after these attempts failed.<br><br><br> <strong>Cause of Death</strong><br> The cause of death was certified by the forensic pathologist of 
              the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) to be due to an "acute allergic 
              reaction to zinc chloride due to inhalation of zinc chloride fumes". 
              Zinc chloride is a primary component of smoke grenades currently used in
               the SAF.<br><br><br> <strong>Safety Breach</strong><br> The COI found that the number of smoke grenades used in the 
              exercise exceeded the limit specified in training safety regulations. 
              The Training Safety Regulations (TSR) stipulate that the minimum 
              distance between each thrown smoke grenade should be not less than 20m 
              and that the minimum distance between troops and the thrown smoke 
              grenade should not be less than 10m. Based on the exercise layout, not 
              more than two smoke grenades should have been used, but the Platoon 
              Commander had thrown six grenades instead. The COI opined that "if the 
              TSR had been complied with, PTE Lee and his platoon mates would not have
               been subjected to smoke that was as dense as that during the incident, 
              and ... for as long as they were during the incident" and that "reduced 
              exposure to smoke would have reduced the risks of any adverse reactions 
              to the smoke." The COI concluded that "the cause of death of PTE Lee 
              resulted from inhalation of the fumes from the smoke grenades used in 
              the incident".<br><br> <br><br> <strong>Platoon Commander "Negligent"</strong><br> The COI is of the opinion that the actions of the Platoon 
              Commander, a Regular Captain, were negligent as he was aware of the 
              specific TSR but did not comply with it.<br><br><br> <strong>Other considerations - Asthma</strong><br> PTE Lee's pre-enlistment medical screening records revealed that 
              he had a history of asthma. The COI found that PTE Lee's medical 
              classification and vocational assignment were appropriate, based on the 
              severity and control of his asthma condition. The COI was unable to 
              establish with certainty if PTE Lee's history of asthma was a 
              contributory factor to his death. First, the COI noted that the specific
               effects of zinc chloride fumes on asthmatics had not been reported in 
              medical literature. Second, adverse reactions to zinc chloride can occur
               even in individuals without asthma. Third, the other platoon mates with
               asthma had developed only mild symptoms after the exposure to the zinc 
              chloride fumes in the exercise.<br><br> <br><br> <strong>Recommendations of COI</strong><br> To prevent a recurrence, the COI recommended measures to ensure 
              compliance with TSRs through strengthening the role of the Safety 
              Officer and educating commanders and troops on the TSR.<br><br> Sir, I have concluded the findings and recommendations from the COI and 
              would like to now brief members on SAF's and MINDEF's measures in acting
               on the report.<br><br> First, on the use of smoke grenades in 
              training. Sir, smoke grenades which produce zinc chloride fumes have 
              been in use by the SAF since 1970s. They are also used by other 
              militaries and agencies such as the United States and the Republic of 
              Korea militaries because in acceptable concentrations of exposure, these
               smoke grenades are safe. Lung injury following exposure to zinc 
              chloride fumes, and even deaths, have been reported in international 
              literature but the numbers are few and mainly occur after exposure to 
              high concentrations of zinc chloride fumes. In fact, PTE Lee's death 
              directly attributable to zinc chloride inhalation is the first on SAF's 
              records.<br><br> To update our TSR for smoke grenades, MINDEF had 
              in 1998 commissioned the Department of Community, Occupational and 
              Family Medicine of the National University of Singapore to conduct a 
              detailed technical evaluation of smoke grenades. Specifically, 
              concentrations of zinc chloride fumes were measured at different 
              distances from the thrown smoke grenades to determine the corresponding 
              safety parameters. The findings of that study form the current TSR for 
              smoke grenades that I have previously detailed.<br><br> Smoke 
              grenades, which have zinc chloride fumes, are still safe to use if TSR 
              are observed. However, despite these assurances, I can understand the 
              anxiety of our soldiers and their families, arising from this isolated 
              incident of a death due to inhalation of zinc chloride fumes. So that 
              our soldiers can train with confidence, MINDEF would like to address 
              these concerns directly.<br><br> Following PTE Lee's death, the SAF
               has suspended for training exercises the use of the smoke grenades, 
              which produce zinc chloride fumes. The suspension will continue as the 
              SAF is studying using smoke grenades which do not produce zinc chloride 
              for training exercises. For missions, we will continue to use zinc 
              chloride smoke grenades as they are judged still to be the most 
              operationally effective.<br><br> The second public concern is due 
              to asthma as a significant proportion of National Servicemen - one in 
              five - have asthma, albeit often in a mild form. The SAF convened a 
              Respiratory Medicine Specialist Advisory Board of five senior 
              respiratory medicine specialists to study this issue, taking into 
              account the COI report. The Advisory Board concluded that the SAF 
              medical classification guidelines on asthma are relevant, up to date and
               in line with national and international standards. It is still safe for
               servicemen with a history of asthma to undergo training with smoke 
              grenades if the TSR are followed. I thank the COI and Board for their 
              valuable work.<br><br> MINDEF has relieved the exercise Chief 
              Safety Officer, Captain Chia Thye Siong and the Platoon Commander who 
              threw the smoke grenades, Captain Najib Hanuk Bin Muhamad Jalal, of 
              their duties. They have been re-deployed to assignments which do not 
              oversee soldiers in training or operations. Following procedures and due
               process, the Chief Military Prosecutor will determine if these 
              personnel should be subject to a General Court Martial (GCM), to 
              establish their degree of culpability and if it finds them guilty to 
              mete out the appropriate punishment. Police investigations are also 
              on-going to determine whether to prosecute the personnel involved in 
              Civil Court.<br><br> <br><br> <strong>3SG Tan Mou Sheng</strong><br> Let me now present the COI findings on the death of 3SG Tan. 3SG 
              Tan was an instructor of a Reconnaissance Commanders' Course held at the
               Marsiling training area on 11 May 2012. He was travelling with other 
              instructors in a scout jeep and seated at the rear of the jeep. When the
               jeep overturned, 3SG Tan was thrown out and pinned under the jeep. 3SG 
              Tan was extricated, attended to by a medic and evacuated in the safety 
              vehicle to the Nee Soon Camp Medical Centre. The duty Medical Officer 
              immediately accompanied 3SG Tan to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital via SAF 
              ambulance. 3SG Tan underwent emergency surgery but despite this 
              succumbed to his injuries. According to the HSA, the cause of death as 
              certified by the forensic pathologist was "haemorrhage from severe 
              pelvic crush injuries".<br><br> The COI was of the opinion that 
              specific instances of individual negligence and breaches of safety had 
              contributed to 3SG Tan's death. First, the jeep driver was not licensed 
              to drive. The Conducting Officer had assigned the jeep driver to drive 
              without checking if he had a license. Neither did the assigned jeep 
              driver highlight to his superior that he was not licenced to drive a 
              jeep. Second, the two rear passengers, one of whom was 3SG Tan, were not
               wearing helmets or lap belts. The Vehicle Commander did not ensure that
               the jeep passengers wore their helmets or lap belts.<br><br> The 
              COI found that Combat Intelligence School (CIS), the school conducting 
              this training package, had a weak safety culture. In the course of its 
              investigations, the COI uncovered other previous instances of unlicensed
               driving. The vehicle management system was also not satisfactory, with 
              lax access to vehicles by servicemen in the field during training.<br><br> Shortly after the incident, MINDEF removed the Commanding Officer 
              (CO) of the CIS, Lieutenant-Colonel Vincent Lam Fei Liong, from his 
              command and appointed a new CO. Several personnel in the CIS have also 
              been relieved of their duties:<br><br> a) The Head of the Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target<br><br> Acquisition Wing, Major Poon Chen Song;<br><br> b) The School Sergeant Major, 1st Warrant Officer Lim Ser Wei;<br><br> c) The exercise Supervising Officer, Lieutenant Marcus Koh Men;<br><br> and<br><br> d) The exercise Conducting Officer, Master Sergeant Lee Kong Kean.<br><br> All these personnel have been re-deployed to assignments where 
              they willnot be supervising soldiers for training or operations.<br><br> As in the previous case, the Chief Military Prosecutor will 
              determine if these personnel should be subject to a General Court 
              Martial (GCM).<br><br> Police investigations are also on-going to 
              determine whether to prosecute the personnel involved in Civil Court. 
              This includes the unlicensed driver of the jeep, 3SG Cavin Tan.<br><br> The vehicular management system in the CIS has been tightened. The 
              SAF has also reviewed other units to ensure that unauthorised driving 
              does not occur during field training. It is now mandatory for drivers to
               display their driving license visibly on the vehicle dashboard. All SAF
               units have now tightened control over the use and movement of vehicles 
              so that keys are not inadvertently handed to unlicensed drivers.<br><br> <br><br> <strong>Strengthening Safety Across the SAF</strong><br> While the SAF has a robust training safety system in place, these 
              two incidents show that more needs to be done. The SAF is determined to 
              put things right and correct any inadequacies uncovered. More 
              importantly, we want to ensure that these lax attitudes toward training 
              safety remain isolated instances and do not take root in our system.<br><br> Specifically, after these two incidents, we have already tightened
               the control and management of SAF vehicles in units and during field 
              training. We will explore safer alternatives to the existing type of 
              smoke grenade for use in training. We will also reinforce measures to 
              ensure safe management of servicemen with a history of asthma. We will 
              also ensure that the TSR are adhered to on the ground.<br><br> But 
              beyond the specific measures, the SAF will also make three key systemic 
              changes to strengthen training safety across the whole SAF.<br><br> First, we will deploy more safety officers on the ground. They will be 
              designated as full-time Unit Safety Officers whose primary role will be 
              to ensure that units and servicemen comply with safety measures.<br><br> Second, an Army Safety Review Board (ASRB) chaired by a senior 
              civil servant outside MINDEF has been set up to review the Army's 
              overall safety structure, processes and culture.<br><br> Third, the
               SAF will set up an SAF Inspectorate, reporting directly to the Chief of
               Defence Force. The SAF Inspectorate will set the safety culture across 
              the entire SAF and oversee the individual inspectorates of the three 
              services. It will promulgate best practices and ensure that safety 
              related policies are up to date and sound throughout the SAF.<br><br> <br><br> <strong>Conclusion</strong><br> Every Singaporean son is precious and any injury or death in the 
              SAF is one too many. But to prevent injuries and death, our commanders 
              and soldiers must observe training safety regulations. Any commander who
               ignores safety regulations, whether wilfully or negligently, puts his 
              soldiers at risk and is not fit for command. Our soldiers can train 
              realistically and safely - there need not be a compromise. Indeed, the 
              more we ensure that conditions are safe, the greater confidence our 
              soldiers will have in training. These two deaths could have been avoided
               if safety instructions had been followed. The SAF will learn from the 
              incidents, correct any inadequacies and punish those who disregarded 
              safety regulations.</p>

              <p>as an army reservist.. or NSF.. is important the soldier knows the TSR and the common sense to apply it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Once out field training, very heavy thunderstorm, our excercise we climbing up and dowm, and OC not around. We decided to cut the excercise ourselves...</p>
              <p>Due to later in the day, some VIP will be visiting us.. TA Major run to us and ask why we stop.. we explained.. He then proceed to order us to continue.. we refuse and he start to pull rank.. the conversation goes somethg like this..</p>
              <p>Maj: Get back to your vehicle and contine with the dry run</p>
              <p>Me: Sir, heavy rain and now is Cat 1..</p>
              <p>Maj: shouted at us.. continue with excercise</p>
              <p>Me : (he got me very pissed) Sir, I do not acknowledge your authority over us. Please convey your orders to OC and in turn OC will give us the order.</p>
              <p>OC : came running, what happen?</p>
              <p>(we explain etc etc)</p>
              <p>OC: instruct us go shelter to take cover from rain</p>
              <p>Maj: (super pissed) shouted at our OC and radio CO to come over</p>
              <p>CO : told our OC to continue</p>
              <p>OC : told CO is loud voice. Sir I hereby wish to informed you that TSR states, Cat 2 CO have discrettion to continue, Cat 1 even CO no authority to override TSR.....If order is to continue, please give me MINDEF orders to continue, otherwise... my men will take cover...........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This happen in reservist... so ultimately we will discharge.. so can you imagine NSF with regular officers? doubt will end up continuing training</p>
