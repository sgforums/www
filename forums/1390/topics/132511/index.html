            <div class='col-md body'>well i think your just suay, my unit's INT and OPs Specs were pretty gd, doing their job and know their role during excercise. The regular specs were much better, ensuring the Tact HQ and their played their roles well. However i gamely recalled this OPs spec who was a regular in my unit who was overweight and failed IPPT. My S3 personally gave him RT and combat runs in vest slacks and SBO to train him up. when i ORD. he managed to pass IPPT, but have not cleared SOC yet.<br><br>Most of the regular specs were doing their sect comds and PS tours with the rifle companies.Most of them were motivated, often talking to their section, revising their SOPs. We tend to conduct 1 once a wk mini patrol missions in camp, allowing the sect comds to command the their men. From which we could access the strong areas the comds had. One gd point i watched from these training was the level of proficency that was drilled in to them by their trainers in SISPEC, and some of them did say some of the OCs were pretty garang ppl expecting gd standards from them as trainees.<br><br>Most of the specs were rather adequate in their drills and SOPs, some needed more motivation.One of my specs, a NSF was a real slacker, and had to be given the hard end of the stick , after being warned by PS, PC, CSM. well to which there is no point in going into details.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If any of you watched Band of Brothers, you will definitely know what a big role the specialists played (they're known as NCOs or Non-Commissioned Officers). Especially when they had to deal with inept officers like Lt Dike.<br><br>For an example of a fine NCO, just observe Sgt Lipton (who was later commissioned to be an officer). He looks after his men. Makes sure the morale is kept up even during the harshest times.<br><br>A specialist must of course be very proficient in his field. That's why he's called a specialist.<br><br>He has to lead by example too. In conduct and behaviour. If he tends to chao keng alot, how do you think his men will respond?<br><br>Very importantly, he is the glue that holds the coy together. He is the link between the officers and the men. He has to be close to his men, and yet be respected as their sect comd.<br><br></div>
