              <p>Get your facts right.... that fella who received the money was given SOL and not DB....</p>
              <p>Also, simi innocent party? The Att C belongs to him, and he should have known better than to give it to someone else.</p>
              <p>And the very fact that he happily received money for it.... that makes it all the more worse for him.</p>

              <p>therefore usually the officer will usually close 3 eyes and just let him stay a few days DB and that it. Anyway it is only 3 days only. what is the deal? They only get him to shave botak again. Before he know it, he is out. </p>

              <p>Actually unless on exercise, i'm not sure whether SAF vehicles are allowed on the road after 1700 without proper reason.</p>
              <p>If they are allowed on road then the log book will update till whatever time they return to camp. Been ages since i left service so unable to go and check when they really close the logbook.</p>

              <p>In the army, just avoid anythng that can get you in trouble. Regardless whether they outdated or updated, they will still just punish u when u do anything that feels wrong to them.</p>

              <p>The timing i gave belong to before 2007 since thats the year i left the army. If this change was only 2 years ago, i do not know whether Tpt has change their rules. Unless u belong to a transport coy, its best not to post it as absolute.</p>
              <p>Anyway the timing is more to prevent army vehicles from clogging up the road during peak hour and not related to buses in anyway i believe.</p>
              <p>Anyway this is way OT, if u wanna discuss about Tpt batt matters etc, feel free to start another topic to discuss about it.</p>
