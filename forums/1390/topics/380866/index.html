              <p>3 days DB for the offender and SOL for his accomplice for this kind of offence is a reasonable sentence. The medic on duty can be charged too for knowingly abetting the offence.</p>

              <p>Concur.  First offence, falsely reporting sick - if the bugger was "genuinely ill", that "something urgent" could not be taken care of, so it's clearly a lie.</p>

              <p>Concur.  First offence, falsely reporting sick - if the
              bugger was "genuinely ill", that "something urgent" could not be
              taken care of, so it's clearly a lie.</p>
              <p>Buying other people's sick leave to get out of barracks, and
              obviously the PC/OC was onto him.  AWOL.</p>
              <p>Bwteeen the two, I'd expect that the bugger should be getting
              between 1 and 2 weeks' DB.  Three days is a bargain.</p>
              <p>By the way, the guy who sold his attend C also needs to be
              charged.</p>

              <p>Well, the TS said that the guy who sold his ATT C got SOL.</p>
              <p>All in all, 3 days' DB for the main perp and SOL for his accomplice is not harsh at all, and is actually quite lenient. I would have thought that seven days in the brig would be more like it.</p>
              <p>I just wonder about the duty medic.... if he really had known about this whole scheme (as the TS said) and tried to cover it up, then he counts as an accomplice too (albeit to an arguably lesser extent than the fella who sold his ATT C).</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>MC is not transferable, you think this is some guard duty? Any problem outside he should speak to the superior not do something like this. Seriously, the PC does not have the power to tell the MO what to do, if the MO think he really deserved the Att C he'll give. Obviously TS, your friend is not that sick. This is SAF, not some kinda of school. Imagine everyone pull such act in SAF....then there'll be a big mess in camp.</p></div>
