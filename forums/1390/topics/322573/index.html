              <h1 class="clr">675 officers and warrant officers promoted as part of SAF Day celebrations</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: A total of 675 officers and warrant officers have been
              promoted as part of the Singapore Armed Forces Day celebrations.</p>
              <p>The promotions of 453 officers and 222 warrant officers will take effect on July 1.</p>
              <p>The
              highest ranked officer to be promoted this year is 40—year—old Rear
              Admiral Chew Men Leong, who joined the SAF in 1985 and has been with
              the Republic of Singapore Navy for the past 18 years.</p>
              <p>During his
              tours of duty, he oversaw the development of the navy’s
              formidable—class stealth frigates, which form the vanguard of the
              navy’s capabilities.</p>
              <p>Rear—Adm Chew, Chief of Republic of
              Singapore Navy, said: "In the navy, you can be a strategist, you can be
              a tactician, you need to be a good leader, you need to be a team
              builder, you need to know how to nurture people, you can be a coach and
              at the same time you need to be a diplomat. And all these kinds of
              challenges will spur our people on."</p>
              <p>Another serviceman who has been promoted is 36—year—old Ting Kheng Siong, a reporter with MediaCorp’s Chinese News.</p>
              <p>Mr Ting tries to juggle his time to fulfil his duties as a journalist, an officer in his reservist unit and a family man.</p>
              <p>"We
              all got 24 hours, but (it’s) how we distribute them so that every party
              is happy — family got their valued time, I have enough time invested in
              my job so that it can be done properly and we don’t neglect the NS
              people. So the main thing on... (managing) time is commitment."</p>
              <p>SAF has recognised his efforts by promoting him from the rank of major to lieutenant—colonel. — CNA/ac</p>
