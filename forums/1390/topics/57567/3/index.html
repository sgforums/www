I'm old!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>andywalker, MyNickisZ and all others posted to SMM ... don't despair ... a CMO posting initially seems really uncool but trust me on this ... it'll grow on you and you'll be glad for it.  Unlike most vocations, you will also pick up a skill set that you can use in the real world.<br><br>I can understand that Medics in the SAF have an image problem ... who's to blame people for having such negative perceptions? Most first impressions are of Â“lazy fat-bastardÂ”  medics during BMT.  That a lot of Platoon Medics are unfit and unmotivated leads to stereotyping like MunnaBhai_MBBS's.  12qwaszx's medic ... now that's what I call a medic.<br><br>Your mission if you choose to accept it is to reverse these impressions and glorify the name of CMOs in the SAF.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Some pointers and pitfalls to avoid:<ul><br>[*]Initially everyone's gonna have a dim view of the platoon medic Â– unneccesary, superflous, useless even.   Don't argue with them or try to convince them with words.  Let your actions speak for you.<br>[*]Be fit.  Be very fit.  Be very f**king fit.  If you can't keep up with your men, you can't do squat.  Do the maths, you have one of the heaviest sustained combat load in the SAF.  The first inkling your men will have that their medic is different will be when you outrun and outlast them.<br>[*]Have pride in your vocation, your duties and yourself.  Take a look around, a Platoon commander can be replaced by his PS, A MG gunner has a #2 gunner but you are irreplaceable.  Interesting trivia, in reservist call ups, each vocation has a maximum income ceiling.  Earn more than that and they don't call you back for ICT Â– cheaper to replace you.  The cut-off point for a medic is higher than that of a Platoon Commander Â– go figure.<br>[*]Don't ever slack off and think that your job is cushy and Â“cho boÂ”.  Even if the shit doesn't hit the fan, you can still  find plenty to do in the form of preventive health care Â– take it seriously cos it's making sure that the shit doesn't have a chance to hit the fan.  The men will not cooperate at first, but if you keep at it, they'll eventually get used to it and play along.  If you don't do that, then you really truly have nothing to do and are as useless as tits on a boar.  Like what antoh said - Get used to the fact that you'll be amongst the first ones up and last one to close shop.<br>[*]If the shit does hit the fan, make sure you know what to do.  I always do Â“what-ifÂ” scenarios wherever I go.  What are the likely accidents to occur?  How to treat? How and Where to evacuate? Make sure you know all this, if you don't know Â– ask!  It's your job.  The ossifers may think you a pain at first but if you take notes and don't ask the same stupid question twice, they'll recognise that you're being professional and respect you for it.<br>[*]Take an interest in things around you.  Who says a medic never gets to play with the toys? In my active unit, I've thrown 4 more grenades and fired more rounds through the SAW and M203 then I did in BMT.  How?  As cover medic that's how.  If you have good rapport with the officers and NCOs, you get invited to join in when they expend all unused ammo.<br>I also surprised the shit out of the ATEC controller when I recovered the GPMG from a disabled MG team, brought it up and provided support fire for my platoon (PC and PS didn't realise MG was wiped out).  It pays to help the MG team clean the MG if your weapon is clean.  6 months into my unit, I could operate all the individual and crew served weapons in my coy.  I just didn't manage to live fire a LAW or 84 ... damn.<br>[*]Don't ever forget that there is a C in CMO.  Above all things you are a COMBAT medic. Always take some when blanks are issued, always have your weapon readied when prudent to do so (but remember your safety catch) and do not be Â“ngiaoÂ” about firing if you have to.  If you have to clean your weapon, you clean your weapon lah, you lazy bastard.  You will have few occasions to fire your weapon but just note, most of the time that you are called upon to do so, it'll make a difference.  I've saved my platoon hq's bacon on more than a few occasion.</ul><br>The best compliment I ever got was from a rifleman in my platoon.  He signed on to be a CMO.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel there is a need to raise the profile of medics both in and out of SAF. Let me reaccount a sad thing that happen to me...<br><br>As everyone knows (I hope everyone knows) one of the "trademaks" of a medic is the "railway stations" on their arms. These are the large marks of the 16G infustion needles everytime medic infuse on one another. Every medics will have at least 5 on every arm and yes, reservist must also do IV in every Medic Vocation Training.<br><br>What happen is that I was donating blood one time and the nurse saw those marks (they are really prominient). She made a very disturbing remark."Excuse me, are you a DRUG ADDICT?" Can you imagine the insult?<br><br>I can say that medics are the ONLY vocation that need to give blood and sweat for SAF.</div>

Period.<br><br>Nevertheless, I'm still rather proud to be a medic in the SAF, for I know, I've saved lives in my life before. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So people out there, if you're posted to be a Combat Medic, don't be disappointed! Remember, you're the ONLY one who is equipped with all the life-saving skills in the whole company/platoon (in unit). Just take it, and move on with Life!</div></blockquote>i fully agree that the medics, and life-saving skills, are one of the most understated within the combat community.<br><br>the very fact that during atec, the casualties are revived between missions tells us things.<br><br>our troops do not really practice buddy-aid although they are expected to do so.<br><br>and our medics do not really perform their tasks within the context of combat exercises. they end up carrying weights or becoming part of the fighting troops.<br><br>i hope the people up there know how important medics are in war, and have plans that are workable.</div>

You think you are underappreciated?? you will see a resus maybe 4-5 times in your entire NSF. What about the paramedics out there who do the same job as you, and on a bad day, will see 4-5 resus in one single shift. They are just as underappreciated. Lets not even talk about nurses and doctors.<br><br>This my friend, is not unique to medics. Its called LIFE. people only remember when you screw up.
