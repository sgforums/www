The objective was to provide resuscitative surgery to casualties so that they could last the journey to the civilian hospitals. As the SAF Medical Services was relatively young in 1960, Singapore Volunteer Medical Officers of the Singapore Medical Association were recruited into the SAF to assist SAF Medical Services in the formation of the First Field Hospital.<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/army/medical_images/medical_picture_2.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><strong>Army Medical Services Motto<br>- Life First</strong></span><br>The motto emblazoned on the scroll proclaims "LIFE FIRST". This is the essence of the arduous duty and challenge that has confronted medical forces labouring on the battlefields of war &amp; peace throughout history. Remaining steadfast to this mission will mean the alleviation of pain and suffering, and the safeguarding of the Army's vital fighting strength.<br><br><strong>Army Medical Services Insignia</strong><br><br>The Snake<br>The Army Medical Services logo is made up of a snake entwined around a sword, the latter resting upon a motto-bearing scroll.<br><br>The snake, or serpent, has traditionally been associated with the art and science of medicine. Its origin can be traced to Ancient Greece where temples devoted to worshipping the god of medicine, Aesealapins, abounded. These temples served also as hospitals and in each was to be found a circular pit containing a snake. Retrieved by coiling the serpent from around a wooden rod, it was believed that applying the snake's forked tongue to the diseased body brought about healing.<br><br>The Insignia<br>The sword that is central to the logo replaces the rod and is the recognised symbol of the Army. It is raised in righteousness and strength, unsheathed in readiness to do battle. The entwining of the snake evokes the intimate bond between the Army's Medical Services and its fighting forces.<br><br>The Colours<br>The colours used remain true to those of the SAF's earliest Medical Services logo, namely maroon and gold. The color of the scroll hearkens to the flag of our predecessors, the British Royal Army Medical Corps, whereupon the colours of dull cherry, blue and old gold are to be found<br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/army/medical_images/ams_logo.jpg"></div>
