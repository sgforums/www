            <div class='col-md body'>haha... to think that i ask the same question in this forum before i was enlisted into the army a year ago. i was a zero fighter 3 months before my enlistment. But i got it up to 8 before i enlisted. I bought a pull up bar and just do pull up at home everyday. Once you reach 4 pull ups. Try to do sets of repetitions. Ideally it will be at least 3 sets of 3/4 of your max pull up. Say if you can do 12 pull up, you have to do 3 sets of 9 pull ups. It is an efficient way to train ur pull ups real fast.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah assisted pull ups are good.. the best is go for a run then do pull ups.. it will train ur overall fitness and endurance.. cos i couldnt do pull ups for many years but this yr i try to build up to avoid ptp and in the end i went from a fail to a gold in 3 months.. so just try to be consistent in ur training and the results will pay off.. try assisted pull ups to start off and even when u can't do anymore just try to hang on the bar for as long as you can to train your lat muscles</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.... try to reduce your weight, it helps a lot. Doing 2 sets of 20 push up everyday then followed by increasing it by 10 if you feel no sweat.. What I did last time was to train once I wake up and before I go to sleep and I could pass my pulll-up..<br><br>No pain, no gain. I got a few classmates very funny de... one very skinny one cannot do more than 1 or 2, another very big size one cannot do even 1 or more... another average one said everyday train push-up still cannot do even a single one. What's wrong with that?<br><br>I guess the skinny one didn't train his muscle so he is quite weak, the big size one too heavy, too much fats. The average one don't know train correctly or not, can run so fast yet cannot do...<br><br>I guess they didn't push themselve hard enough... maybe that always train one always stick with same number of push-up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pull Ups<br>What it measures: This is a test of strength and muscular endurance in<br>your upper body.<br>How it's done: Hang by your hands from an overhead bar. As visions of<br>medieval torture crowd your mind, decide on either an overhand or<br>underhand grip! Pull yourself upwards till your chin reaches the bar.<br>Some have been known to include a chin-thrust and neck stretch at<br>this point. It isn't necessary to perform body curls, frog like leg kicks,<br>or tarzan swings. You will not be awarded bonus points for<br>them...really. You'll need to complete at least 5 more! Also... your feet<br>have to be clear of the ground throughout the test.<br>Note: The NAPFA only accepts an overhand grasp......sorry.<br>Body parts you need to shape up: Our primate cousins boast the<br>consummate physique for this very specialised movement. We humans<br>have been seriously disadvantaged by evolution. But our indomitable<br>human spirit prevails... we shall train and overcome! Your upper arms,<br>shoulders, and back will be doing most of the work, with some help<br>from your abdominals. Also, the strength of your grip os all that will<br>keep you from dropping off that bar. Our quest begins...<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pull ups<br>How to train: Try to gain access to a gym because it would greatly help<br>your training. Why? Try : because there will be trainers around to give<br>you advice, bacuse there will be weight-training machines which you<br>will need, and to keep your motivation burning, there<br>will be leotard-clad others around!...... yummy.<br><br>1. Inclined Pull Ups : Find a bar, about waist-high (No, not<br>the kind with bar-stools), and hang from it. Keep your body<br>really stiff and straight, with only your heels resting on the<br>ground. Pull yourself towards the bar till your chest touches it (Yes, huge<br>pectorals might help).<br><br>2. Assisted Pull Ups : Get into that familiar position hanging from<br>an overhead bar. Bend backwards at the knees (You may bend<br>yours forward if they work that way), and rest your feet on some<br>supprt. As you pull up, press your feet downwards to help lift your<br>body weight. As you get stronger (because you are<br>going to train SO HARD), reply less on that support.<br><br>3. Lat Pull Down : Sitting in gyms all over Singapore are<br>machines known as lat pull-down machines. They work<br>these muscles called the latissimus in you upper back. Grip<br>the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width, and sit or<br>kneel. You don't want any damage done to your lower<br>back, so keep it flat. Pull the bar down to the base of your neck (front or<br>back), and return the bar to its original position.<br><br>4. Close Grip Pull Down : You are still with the lat machine. This time, grip the<br>bar at shoulder-width or narrower. As you pull downwards, your elbows<br>should travel in front of your body (as opposed to side).<br><br>5. Monkey Bars : Ah...the stuff of childhood memories! Swing from one end to<br>the other and have fun while you work on your grip and arm strength.<br><br>6. Grip Strength : Yup, those ten digits have to keep you hanging from that<br>bar. Hang from the bar for as long as you can. 30 seconds' great!<br><br>7. Abdominals : ......the muscles which hold your gut in place (Well, they try<br>their best!). The abdominals play a supportive role in the pull-up. Do sit-ups,<br>crunches, and lying leg lifts. If you put in that effort, they'll work...... the<br>exercises, not the lying.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Extracted From : Secrets of Passing Your IPPT and NAPFA booklet<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Credits<br>Original Booklet<br>Written and illustrated by<br>Ms Ruth Koh Siang Cheng<br>Ruth Koh held the appointment of then Staff Officer<br>(Fitness) at Soldier Performance Centre when she completed this<br>Booklet in 1997.<br>Printed: First Edition 1999<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Copyright 1998.

            <div class='col-md body'>I was a zero fighter too before November last year. My dad installed a doorway bar and every time I did lots and lots of assisted pull-ups. A week later, I could pull one and could reach 4 by the end of the year. By the way, doing push-ups will not help much as they train the chest muscles and the triceps whereas pull-ups requires your upper back muscles and biceps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>um actually doing pushups WILL help, to a certain extent.<br><br>the pects (chest) and triceps are antagonistic to the biceps.<br><br>Take another example (rare but happens):<br>Someone does leg presses the whole day, as a result his quads (the front of thighs) are HUGE, but his hamstrings (back of thighs) are minute by comparison.  Whereas size is not a -very- good judge of strength, here it means that his hams are limiting the improvements in his quads, because they are antagonistic to each other.<br><br>So basically doing pushups, depending on which variation you do, adds flexibility to your biceps and lats. (So don't slack and go down lower! :p)<br><br>If you are a zero fighter right now, don't fret.  there are 'easy ways'.  Just get a indoor pullup bar.  everytime you pass by it, do a few.  if you can't do any, its okay, just pull to the maximum you can, and HOLD IT THERE as long as you can.<br><br>Another method is assisted pullups, but those are dangerous (if you are exhausted and the other person isn't paying attention.... gd luck to both of you.)<br><br>So i suggest what some bodybuilders do.  "negative training"  This involves getting to full pull, aka chin over bar first.  (via any method, assist, jump etc) THEN, you SLOWLY let go, taking as long as you can to reach the full stretch.  be especially slow during the first and last parts: those are the hardest, and therefore you train the most.<br><br>(btw for those who are looking for one, most larger sports stores have one - you can screw them onto the doorframe, just be careful: i fell off mine before.)<br><br>another tip.<br>for those of you who see your school canoeists that do pullups in a 'wave' like motion, DO NOT LEARN FROM THEM.  that method does a few things:<br>1) utilises momentum to literally bounce you up again after reaching the bottom - if its easier, you train less, its that simple.<br>2) you don't ever get to full stretch using that, so your forearms (not the finger muscles) don't get that much training.  so you lose flexibility and arm strength - ever notice how HARD It is to get from full stretch to chin-over-bar?<br>3) wreaks HAVOC on your joints.  everytime they bounce, the joints take the strain.  you do not want your shoulder burned out.<br>4) increases risk of tearing just about any muscle.  one person i knew half-sprained  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> his back<br><br>so just do the full motion during training.  if you want to do any 'techniques', save them for the actual test, if at all.<br>after all, what's the point of doing '20' and then when you get to the IPPT, the niao instructor makes half of them 'no count' and you end up with 10?<br><br>and finally - consistency, for &lt;5 pullupers - just keep doing, especially if you haven't enlisted, since you still have time.  just TRY once or twice a day and you will see improvements - and it takes &lt;2 minutes total... why not?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Buy yourself those hand grip resistors. Those that looks like horseshoes. They can be be bought from sports shop. get yourself those with plastic handles, avoid cushioned handles.<br><br>grip sets of 60 (or until you can't squeeze the handles anymore). It trains up the muscle group in your lower forearms. it helps because when you are hanging on the bar, you relieves the biceps and triceps from the grip of the bar, saving those muscles for the sole purpose of the pull sequence.</div>
