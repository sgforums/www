              <p>Well, judging from past experiences, u will be sent to redo ur driving course once ur temp excuse driving expires. During this period if you decide to get a perm excuse driving, depending on your location current (tpt hub or node?) and the reason you were posted as a driver (posted from tekong bmt, posted from mono intake bmt, ooc from bmt, etc), you will be revocated according to your PES status.</p>
              <p>Since u are PES A, you could end up anywhere! I've seen some being posted to RP, some as rifleman, and back to their unit (for mono intake). It really depends on why u were vocated as a driver in the first place since u are pes A! It's highly unlikely u will be revocated to storeman or clerk, as ur S1 will have to answer to why a pes A soldier is placed in a pes C vocation.</p>
              <p>Last but not least, do think about what causes u to be anxious. If u are afraid to drive big trucks (3,5ton), see if u can come to an agreement with ur FM/FSM/etc to place u on details requiring only either land rover or ouv, but u would still have to be trained for the vehicles. Or if the driving instructors are just too unfriendly, pray hard to see a better one the next time. Not all of them are harsh on trainees.</p>

              <p>I used to be a driver during my ns days.. ok for ur case, i think if u ask ur specialist to write excuse driving permenantly, i think most likely u will be revocated..</p>
              <p>And since u are  PES A , there is quite a high chance they might post u to combat unit ,..</p>
              <p>I have a  2 friends in my unit, both also PES B, both OOC from driving course due to fail too many times, one got posted to 2 SIR be rifleman, the other got posted to be a RP.. and depends on ur luck, u may or may not be posted back to the same camp as u are now, after ur RP course..</p>
              <p>what i suggest is, if u really dont want to get posted to combat unit, maybe u can try to appeal to go through driving course again.. May i know what causes u to have anxiety? is it due to the instructors? or the fear of driving big vehicles?</p>

              <p>Honestly, if you remain Pes A and get revocate, you can land yourself anywhere. Furthermore, if they did not have time to send you to some course then very likely chance you'll be a rifleman. As for storeman and clerk, I doubt so unless you get downgraded.</p>

              mean? I just don't want to go back to the course and feel stressed
              again and end up wasting time or slot. I also want to know if I can
              let them know I got this problem, and they won't be harsh, because
              honestly it will be easier for me to concentrate and learn.<br> <br> Why I have anxiety? I think maybe because that's how I am, not only
              for driving but for other things as well, but I don't usually
              'complain' and instead just go through with it. I think for
              driving, it may be because of safety and also the pressure from
              instructors. </p>
              <p>I wonder if I can inform them about my problem, so that they
              don't pressure me? I honestly don't mind learning, I just want to
              be safe and confident.<br> <br> If I'm malingering how can the MMI specialist be helping me? How
              can MO even want to refer me to MMI? Plus I know that I am pes A
              and that drivers who OOC can get a new vocation based on their PES
              status. How is RP and Storeman more relaxing than driver? Drivers
              are more relaxed and can get driving license. I don't want to drive
              because I have an issue, not malingering. don't assume.<br> <br> @Bus Stopping What if the people at my node needs storeman and
              clerk? Is there anyway I can get to stay?</p>

              <p>During my days, which is two years back, there's 2 reasons why ppl get posted to driver from tekong bmt, either out of course from bmt, or if u are a PR and did not pass your ippt, u will have a chance to get posted to driver. Not sure if they still pratice that.</p>
              <p>I feel the most important thing that makes u feel confident of driving a 20+ years old army truck/tonner is to know it better. So one way of doing that is to go for MSET course, basically some basic maintaience course that teaches u more about the vehicle. I hope that could help u. U might need to ask ur clerk to see if ur hq needs ppl to go.</p>
              <p>As for telling the driving instructors, im not too sure whens the best time u can do that. The only problem as i understand is that their salary is partly determined by how many times his 4 student takes to pass the course. So its good to relax, and communicate with him. Don't be like some drivers who tried taking a wheel choke and scaring the instructor or attempting to drive a L plate up the expressway, that wont end well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>And its really unlikely that u will get to stay in ur node as storeman and/or clerk, like many mentioned, ur current pes status dont allow u to do that. </p>

              <p>I've read all your posts, thank you so much. I'm still unsure what exactly to say on my next appointment, hopefully I figure it out and I can move on. Thanks guys. :] <br>Any of you know what's it like to be rifleman, whether is it stressful or is it more or less the same as BMT? </p>
              <p>ANd actually I passed Ippt, local not PR, got diploma. I was hoping to go command school. I'm not the only one, a lot of my platoon mates and friends from other coy who POP on the same day as I did also got driver or storeman, I think it's something to do with our race. ... Which is kinda fucked up. Lol whatever, can't wait to ORD.<br><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;"><br></span></span></p>
