              <p>medical board takes time....so many people need to be boarded. one thing is that when u went OOC and sign some forms to be medically boarded your were in Tekong, now are you still there as a clerk in Tekong? If not, I would advice you to check with your medical centre in current camp on your medical status becos you see when there's a transfer of camp the medical board is usually informed. </p>

              <p>friend, may i ask what is the factor that deters you from going for BMT in the first place?</p>
              <p>we are here to help you but without knowing the real reasons behind your reluctance to go for BMT, we can only speculate the reasons and no offence, people will make a mockery out of it.</p>
              <p>we have men here who went through BMT without a stratch (i mean mental stratch) and some even survived DB so i would like to ask what is it that is holding you back. fear of darkness? fear of the jungle or something else. please help us, help you.</p>

              <p>As mentioned already, medical board is rarely able to clear all the applicants at 1 go so it might take a few months.</p>
              <p>Jan is only an FFI and not the reBMT. You should receive ur downgrade status before you are required to go for BMT but do note that if u only get a PES C, u are still required to go through a PES C reBMT</p>

              <p>hi guys..</p>
              <p>i enlisted in july 09 pes B, and stayed in tekong for bmt for
              2weeks before i fainted during a run with SBO, then went out of
              course, and i was posted to become a clerk as my vocation. But now
              i recently got an email saying i need to attend an FFI for jan 2010
              bmt recourse.</p>
              <p>About a month ago, I went to see mo for a medical review, and he
              said he would settle my pes stuff, and downgrade me, etc, and
              afterwards i was made to sign some form abotu the medical board.
              But until now still no pes status update for me.</p>
              <p>I have lots of medical problems including psygological
              ones(including sucidal thoughts), and now i'm really worried that I
              would have to go back for pes b bmt again next yr.</p>
              <p>my friend told me that since i fainted before, they wont let me
              go back to pes b bmt, but i don't believe that, is that true,</p>
              <p>anyone can help me out? like tell me what to do..i'm so stressed
              out i'm going insane !!!!!!!!!</p>
              </div>

              <p>Hi Symphoni,</p>
              <p>Don't overstress yourself. As for your query, if you get down-Pes from Pes B, you will certainly not go back for Pes B BMT recourse. For the time being, there is nothing much which you can do, so don't worry too much, and just do your part as a clerk.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>I beleive that your PES status is still be pending on the medical board. Depending on the amount of people listing, it will take probably 1- 4 monthes for you to get your PES result. I beleived that you can defered your PES B BMT recourse upon request from your MO. See your Mo, and highlight to him that you have a recourse going on, and that you are still waiting for the medical board to award your new status. He will write in a letter for you and u can pass to your PC or OC or whoeva incharge, S1 etc, to have your recourse deferred.</p>
              <p>hope this help.</p>

              <p>and to TS, since you never clear bmt, you will definitely go back recourse.</p>
              <p>its either pes b recourse or pes c.</p>
              <p>so just be mentally prepared to say hi to tekong again.</p>
