              <p>What does his road rage got to do with National Service? CNA highlighted - He is <strong>NS-man</strong>, does CNA suggest that his anger/revengeful nature was linked to his NS trainings?</p>
              <p>A 22—year—old National Serviceman has pleaded guilty to an act of road rage by voluntarily causing hurt to a taxi driver at around 8pm on 22 May 2009.</p>
              <p>Citran Rathakrishnan punched 49—year—old taxi driver Quek Hiak Soon three times on along Woodlands Avenue 2.</p>
              <p>The cabby had swerved into his lane while they were driving along Woodlands Avenue 7 that day.</p>
              <p>The court heard Citran’s wife who was seven months’ pregnant at that time was sitting beside him in the car and he had to step on the brakes to avoid an accident.</p>
              <p>Deputy Public Prosecutor Prem Raj also told Senior District Judge See Kee Oon that Citran had to step on the brakes two more times after this to avoid a collision with Mr Quek’s taxi.</p>
              <p>DPP Raj told the court that Citran’s car and the taxi stopped along Woodlands Avenue 2.</p>
              <p>Citran got out of his car, opened the driver’s door of Mr Queks taxi and punched the cabby.</p>
              <p>Citran will be sentenced on August 2.</p>
              <p>For his offence, he could be jailed up to two years, fined a maximum of S$5,000 or both.</p>

              <p>Uh.... all it means is that he happens to be a National Serviceman?</p>
              <p>To use an analogy, we can also have headlines that say 'Lawyer pleads guilty to road rage' or 'Student pleads guilty to shoplifting', right?</p>
              <p>What in the article implies that his National Service training has anything to do with his road rage? All it says is that he is doing his National Service.</p>
