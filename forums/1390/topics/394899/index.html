              <p>Hellow everyone,</p>
              <p>I was wondering. If lets say I applied for pilot, when would I sign on the dotted line? Because I'm wondering if RSAF will ask you to sign before you commence your pilot training or only after you have successfully completed your training.</p>
              <p>If the first scenario is true, and say I failed my pilot training then will I still be liable to serve my contract? Since I signed on to be a pilot but instead is unable to pass the tests.</p>

              <p>many were called as pilots but few were chosen.they either had gangster attitudes or made their own standard practice or didnt read them from start.soÂ Â far i only knew 2 that didnt make it as pilots.just remeber to land the plane gently like a pro from computer games etc.</p>

              <p>Those loser things you mentioned above given to the foreigners in the number of thousands every year with no standard whatsoever when awarded, to study in any local shit institution are not considered "scholarships".</p>
              <p>They are more like bursaries and financial aid for poor losers.</p>
              <p>And you seem to dream that in other armies, all the pilots become generals. You've obviously not worked in any place with more than 3 employees before. Someone like you would probably not even get those loser bursaries if you were a foreigner.</p>
