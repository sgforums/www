              <p>Hellow everyone,</p>
              <p>I was wondering. If lets say I applied for pilot, when would I sign on the dotted line? Because I'm wondering if RSAF will ask you to sign before you commence your pilot training or only after you have successfully completed your training.</p>
              <p>If the first scenario is true, and say I failed my pilot training then will I still be liable to serve my contract? Since I signed on to be a pilot but instead is unable to pass the tests.</p>

              <p>many were called as pilots but few were chosen.they either had gangster attitudes or made their own standard practice or didnt read them from start.so  far i only knew 2 that didnt make it as pilots.just remeber to land the plane gently like a pro from computer games etc.</p>

              <p>And you seem to dream that in other armies, all the pilots become generals. You've obviously not worked in any place with more than 3 employees before. Someone like you would probably not even get those loser bursaries if you were a foreigner.</p>

              <p>obviously yer army only had very few military people who even deserved that kinda al general rank as they were not talented nor deserving in the first place.</p>
              <p>so far i have never seen any real general in spore.those who were admirals,generals got to be the worse kinda officers as seen from george yeo,lhl etc.</p>
              <p>why would i want loser bursaries paid by losers like u????i dont need some scholarship??whatever for???.........i will demand from gov whatever  i need in the future thats deemed beneficial............</p>

              <p>only a super retard doesn't know the difference between shit rubbish crumbs and scraps for foreigners and bursaries and what are scholars. which is why its the same group of people (super retards) who suffer inferiority complex against foreigners most of whom are losers. lol<br></p>
