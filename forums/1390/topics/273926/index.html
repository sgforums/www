            <div class='col-md body'>My time no L-code yet. Either that or I was never told. I myself was supposed to be Pes C1 but, other than being posted to an overweight platoon during BMT, my medical status was not "recognized" anytime during my NS. (Note "overweight" was different from "obese", the latter heading to Nee Soon SBMT &amp; future rear-echelon vocations instead). I ended up carrying a PRC-77 set &amp; followed infantry, which meant I had experience attaching out to every SIR, GDS &amp; even CDO unit as an Arty element. Even went jungle-training in Brunei before.<br><br>Frankly, PES status wasn't a big deal in my time. As far as I know, C1 had a different definition from the current version too. No modified BMT, more like Enhanced, with the same training timetable but extra PT sessions when the rest of the camp recruits are doing area-cleaning. No excusing certain IPPT stations either.</div>
