Last time, the whole area was already ulu but at least still have remnants of the old riverline settlement (&amp; the mismatched HDB flats at Neo Tiew, of course). Many a M113 used to convertly "nudge" the fruit trees in the abandoned orchards there! Dunno if it's still done now, but my unit used to rumble into the LCK &amp; CCK cemeteries to stay for the night too. Talk about waking up the dead!

Everyone in the formation wear black berets, for a start. You'll be conscious about the DIV structure only upon entering reservist, or was posted to HQ Formation or something.<br><br><blockquote>Is it true that people have to use shovels to remove the crews' remains if the APC's armour is penetrated?</blockquote>Humour aside, I've seen first-hand how surprisingly flimsy the M113 armor was  during the mid-80s -- dunno if they've upgraded it since. One of my BTY detachments was wiped out (1 dead, 4 casualties, only the driver unhurt) due to a M203 round which the dead guy supposedly found &amp; concealed after a live-firing EX. The damage to the vehicle -- it'd accidentally detonated from inside -- was quite devastating.</div>

As someone already posted, a M113 chassis remains aluminum armor. (Even for the new SSPH1 Primus, as far as I know.) I'm not saying a M203 round has tank-piercing capability but, all the same, it was enlightening to discover its TNT can penetrate a M113's "skin." Who needs a LAW gunner anymore as long as there's a open hatch you can shoot a grenade into? ~lol~<br><br>Let's face it, our main armoured vehicles, inc. the AMX-13s, are always an ageing fleet. However refurnished, their designs are almost 50 years old (pre-Vietnam War, even) &amp;, more often than not, recycled a few time among different armed forces. (Who cares about flotation secrets too?) The SAF lived with the limitations cuz of the terrain &amp; type of warfare we could find ourselves in although, who knows, the latest investment in MBTs (Leopard 2A4) may signal a change of mind. After all, last year saw Malaysia buying the Polish PT-91s &amp; Indonesia the Russian T-90s, &amp; all three types use more-modern reactive armor.<br></div>
