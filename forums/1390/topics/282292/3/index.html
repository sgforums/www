The conventional sense of APC is basically a battle taxi, to transport troops. However, our M113s have been upgraded in a manner that would be more appropriately terms an AFV - Armoured Fighting Vehicle (or IFV).<br><br>This means that the vehicle actually plays a crucial role in combat, as compared to just a transport vehicle.<br><br>Erm, its not that hot. You will get used to it.<br><br>No it will not topple easily, if you are just using uneven ground as a factor. The risk is high when on steep slopes at high speed. Other than that, vehicle overturns are far and beyond.<br><br>It is definitely not one of the lousiest vehicles. It is highly efficient and performs certain roles that the Bionix cannot cover.<br><br>Maintenance wise, it really depends on the vehicle. Some ultras are really troublesome but overall maintenance is not more compared to other armoured  vehicles. I believe that the SM1-AMX13 is actually more trouble prone.<br><br></div>

Both were brief mentions of the formal BOI hearings (conducted much, much later) published inside the ST editions. Never ever saw the official report, actually. Won't mind reading it too.<br><br>Looking back, I identify the accident to have happened in the second half of 1986, perhaps during the last quarter of that year. The explosion took place past midnight as the M113s was preparing to convoy back to camp. According to the sworn accounts, the fatality absorbed a chunk of the blast &amp; in that sense indirectly "saved" his buddies. Nonetheless, the layer had some fingers blown off (the only one downgraded); another mortarman took sharpnel in his back; the detachment 2IC in his face (one heck of a swollen jawline) &amp; the detachment commander in his buttocks(!) cuz he was "up there" in his seat. Only the driver, seated in front, was unhurt -- though he would ironically also downgrade later for a different reason &amp; joined my IHL unit for reservist.<br><br>What also emerged from the chaotic eyewitness accounts was a hero (my BC, a scholar CPT who went into the M113 to carry out the injured) &amp; a "villain" (my BTY medic, a gabra NSF who was paralyzed with shock). The dead soldier's name was Low Soon Yeow -- or isst Loh Soon Yow? Geez, it was 20+ years old, leh -- &amp; I have good memories of him cuz he was one of the more affable Hokkien peng who took time out to befriend Air Levels like me who were just posted in mid-year.<br><br>The military funeral was a big affair -- we got to wear the No.1's &amp; all the bigshots also came down to Mt. Vernon -- but, guiltily, only my BTY Hokkien peng remembered to mark his death anniversary a year on. Guiltily, cuz my BTY officers &amp; English-educated troops only realized the occasion when we saw the simple, improvised ceremony at the back of the building (inverted bayoneted-M16, helmet &amp; boots Hollywood-style, with joss sticks &amp; incense-paper burning inside a metal bucket for an Asian touch).<br><br>What's bittersweet is that, like a lot of unforgetable NS experiences, they're largely forgotten after ORD by all except those were there. I'd queried a fellow NUS hostelite who'd joined the next 21 SA batch, as well as SOAY trainers later on during ICTs, but *sigh* they all said they'd heard only vague stories about what happened.<br><br>My old 21 SA BN, which I didn't follow after NS, ended up winning best Arty unit during reservist (265 SA) ~lol~ Quite a turnaround from what was quite a jinxed stint during active time (many other misadventures).</div>
