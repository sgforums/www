Since SAF is a predominantly citizens' force, this length of service is reasonable. Perhaps it should also be made compulsory for girls to do NS for 2 years as well. Girls should also be PES classified and vocationalised suitably, just like the guys.</p></div>

              <p><span>National Servicemen can expect new measures to better
              motivate, support, and recognise them, as well to help them balance
              their NS commitments with their family and career
              commitments.</span></p>
              <p>These aims were revealed by the Committee to Strengthen National
              Service on Wednesday, after it held its first meeting at the Basic
              Military Training Centre on Pulau Tekong. Over the next six months,
              the committee will gather ideas from servicemen and the public
              through focus group discussions and town hall sessions.</p>
              <p>The public may also air their views on a new website <a title="www.strengthenNS.sg" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.strengthenNS.sg">www.strengthenNS.sg</a> or through
              e-mail at <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:strengthenNS@starnet.gov.sg">strengthenNS@starnet.gov.sg</a>.</p>
              <p>The 20-member committee is chaired by Defence Minister Ng Eng
              Hen, and includes Members of Parliament, senior military personnel,
              employers, and NSmen. It was set up during this year's Committee of
              Supply Debate in March, which saw robust debate over how to better
              recognise National Servicemen in light of continued immigration and
              the need to preserve a Singapore core. In recent months, members of
              the public have responded to the news by calling for greater
              monetary incentives, including subsidies for transport, education
              and health, and time-off to rest after reservist in-camp
              training.</p>
              <p>Over the next six months, Singaporeans will be asked for
              feedback on how to beef up National Service.</p>
              <p>The Committee to Strengthen National Service, announced in
              March, will lead focus group discussions and town hall sessions
              while also conducting online consultation sessions via a new
              website, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/strengthenNS/index.html"> www.strengthenNS.sg</a></p>
              <p>The Committee meeting for the first time today, expects its work
              to be done within a year.</p>
              <p>Made up of 20 members, including Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen,
              Members of Parliament,military top brass and private sector
              employers, the committee will use the feedback gathered to
              recommend measures to enhance National Service as a critical
              institution for Singapore's continued survival and success.</p>
              <p>The measures are meant to motivate servicemen to give their best
              in serving, help them balance their duties with family and work
              commitments, enhance support from families, companies, new citizens
              and the broader community, and promote recognition of servicemen's
              efforts.</p>

              Service (Phase 2)<br></strong></p>
              <p>In the last few months, we held a first phase of Focus Group
              Discussions (FGDs) where different people came together to share
              their experiences with NS, the strengths of NS and areas to be
              strengthened, as well as their aspirations for NS. We thank our
              participants for taking the time to share their ideas and
              experiences.</p>
              <p>For Phase 2 of the FGDs, we will go into more specific
              discussions on these following topics.</p>

              for our National Servicemen from the community. What else can we do
              for our NSFs and NSmen? In this topic, let’s come together to
              discuss what are the ways different segments of the broader
              community, such as our family members, employers, the government,
              and members of the public can better recognise and show their
              appreciation for the contributions of our NSmen.</p>

              Training and IPPT can be challenging. Some have also shared their
              worries about falling behind in terms of education and when they
              eventually enter the workforce. In this topic, share with us what
              you think are the ways in which we can help address these

              <p>Every National Serviceman has an important role to play in
              Singapore’s defence and wants to have a meaningful NS experience.
              Some servicemen want to do more and increase their contributions to
              NS. How can we better meet our servicemen’s personal aspirations
              through their deployment, while ensuring operational needs are
              met?  In this topic, we will come together to discuss ways we

              group discussions before everyone gathers for a large group
              sharing. The estimated duration of each session is between 2.5 to
              3.5 hours.</p>
