Signing on does not assure you be an officer as well since there are also regulars specs but if you can sign on directly to airforce as pilot that might be different but it will depend whether they are taking in any pilots currently i think.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok. u may be right.<br><br>i haven't encountered too many fighter guys with glasses as yet.<br>but since the number of myopic ppl in sg has gone up, i guess u got to let ppl get better eyesight else u have a shortage of pilots to train.<br><br>understand that in fighters u dun really have time for all this kinda glasses adjusting or squinting of yr eyes to try and make out what u're looking at cos things just happen fast. too fast.. maybe in a dual cockpit u can ask ppl to take control while u adjust....<br>but in a single cockpit. if ur hands are off the stick, who's flying the jet?<br><br>get my drift?<br><br>but well if u say its not a controlled group then i guess its been approved. lucky for the myopic guys then.<br></div>
