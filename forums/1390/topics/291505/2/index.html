Usually guys of that age group have got some pretty colourful ideas about being a fighter-pilot, with the A-level cohort particularly bent on being an officer for some strange reasons. Anyhow, let's take a closer look at these choices.<br><br>First let's talk about being an officer. I do not know what you guys of the current generation are thinking of, but back then, you will hear guys on the basketball court bouncing their balls (basketball) while talking about wanting to shave their heads in preparation for enlistment..........<br><br>Please, don't do that. That act says a lot about the fragile nature of their minds. Go ahead, dye your hair if you want to. When its time to shave it off, it will happen, no need to slowly wean yourself off all that crowning glory.<br><br>The next topic will be OCS. They somehow think that having straight A's in A-levels is not good enough, they must headbutt their way into OCS by hook or by crook, or else their egos will take a beating. DO you know what being an officer means? It's not a permanent branding under your foot or something like that. It's just a role you need to play should you be selected for that period of time as an NSF, a small number of them do sign on and become captains eventually, but to carry on until that age of 45, that is really rare, and anything beyond that age, your chances of even having a contract offered to you is as good as being selected after several rounds of parading yourself on TV for star search. And this occurs in the Navy, Army and airforce. Talk about career decisions, unless you are born with blood on your palm like Genghis khan, I'd say its a high stakes gamble. After you finish your term as an officer during NSF.....what then? DOes it help in your career in the civilian world? Yes it does, to a certain extent depending on the nature of your choice of work, but don't look at it as a must. And if you do get your contract, by which time it means you may be ejected out at the age of 45, with no other work experience, balding, kids to feed, wife to please.......you wanna know what is happening to my friend who is a captain?<br><br>Airforce fighterpilots......you know, the job's not all about flying, its about projects, projects, and more projects, lots of office politicking, none of that TOP GUN "oh I'm so tom cruise I'm going to pull a few G's and date my instructor" kind of stuff. Not even close. And if you do get close, be sure you clean up after being air-sick. See the exodus of flighter pilots to the airlines for a good measure of how much these guys actually love the job.<br><br>I can go on and o, but my fingers are tired, and I need to catch a show. What you really need to do is speak to the people who are actually doing what you are doing, go for the older guys, and ask them what its really all about. If you need, I can intorduce a couple of them to you. WHo knows, you may actually have what it takes, and we all know what good connections mean.<br><br>Happy enlistment. I enjoyed my NS, I hope you will too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My humble advice is to just pop down CMPB and ask.<br><br>The selection tests and interviews are so stringent. What's more, acceptance into the course does not guarantee one will be a pilot eventually. Chop rate is so high....somtimes as high as 60-70% per phase.<br><br>Getting down to this business before one talks about what planes he should fly....that would be more sensible.</div>

Commando does combat jump, normal peeps dun thus Commandos have the red backing. they are NOT on par. and the only reason why u see so many pilot has airborne badge is because that is the easiest confidence badge to attain and they need at least one confidence badge to promote. (all regular needs that one confidence badge to promote actually)<br><br>and to TS just try. wun die. plus u get to enjoy ur NS life. that is hopefully u pass thru all the test and grading.[/b]</div>
