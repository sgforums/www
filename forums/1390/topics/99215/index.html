            <div class='col-md body'>I'm like entering BMT soon..after my A Levels that is...kinda interested in a career with the SAF..but got a couple of questions so hope the officers in the SAF out there can help me...<br><br>1) For pilots: I've observed several pilots who went for training only after being commissioned. i.e they train as army officers first ..learn the vocation graduate and then train for air force pilot..is this advisable to take this route if i am interested in being a pilot? Obviously it seems weird to have pilot trainees who are officer cadets and commissioned officers training together...<br><br>2) Any SAFOS or SMS Scholars out there?..Care to share your JC profiles so that I can take a gauge as to what kind of pple MSC is actually looking for...what is crucial and stuff..apart from the fact that you have to perform really well in BMTC and OCS...<br><br>3) MTA Scholars...share ur experiences too!...really curious abt this award...sounds exciting...anyone been to US Air Force or Naval Academies?<br><br>4) What is the job vocation of a Guards Officer like?.. Do you have to go through infantry training first before undergoing guards conversion course?<br><br>5) Anyone who has been through Ranger Course care to share what it is like or about?...what is it for and stuff...<br><br>6) Naval Officers!...what kind of jobs do u guys actually do?..care to share ur job scope?...the officer job descriptions they have is really kinda vague..like naval officer..speaks volumes abt the job ehz...=p...<br><br>Thanks guys!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) If you pass all the inital pilot tests, and u sign on with the Air force, u will be sent to OCS..Train with the army wings for 4 weeks before going to the Air Wing to train to be an Air force officer, not an Army officer..<br>In about 10+ weeks, u will leave OCS to go to Air Force School..U may also go Australia for ur air grading..<br>If u commission as an army officer, then u will have to go through the same things..Most prob straight to Air force school..(that's probably if u took air grading already)<br><br>2) I'm not one, but my platoon mates were..<br>SAFOS and SMS scholars ALL got to Delta Wing for the 1st 4 weeks..<br>The SAFOS to bes will stay in Delta even if u intend to go to the Navy or AF..<br>SMS u will be able to go to the MIDs or AIR wing to continue training..<br>In Delta, there will numerous situations to test your leadership ability..Not forgetting the need for a good peer appraisal..<br>For example, the Section Field camp will be 4-5 days for other wings, but it will be 7 days coz of the 2 day Ex. Wildboar at the end to test these scholars..<br>(Of course the other's non-SAF scholars suay suay kanna pulled in too)<br>It will be tiring, and shagged, that's where they see how u cope under stress, and how ur performance is..<br>Good results nonetheless, 4As, S paper distinctions/merits<br>(This year's SAFOS/President Scholar had 2 S distinctions, 1 merit fyi)<br><br>3) No idea..sorry <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>4) You finish your infantry OCC after 52 weeks, then go to Guards to go for Guards Conversion Course to get ur khaki beret..<br>If you are a scholar, u have to go for GCC after coming back from studies with a LTA rank though..<br><br>5) Not many, just a xiong course that's for prestige and stuff..<br><br>6) Well, when u enter BMT, there will be officers coming down to give u some info..If u enter Delta Wing, there will be visits to all 3 formations where Generals, Colonels will come down and sell coyote to u to ask u to take up the SAFOS/SMS scholarships..<br>You can ask ur questions then..you will also get to have rides on the vessels..<br>So most important thing is to do well in your A levels, and do well in BMT, get to OCS, and do even better..<br>Not forgetting u need to pass the PSC interview <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
