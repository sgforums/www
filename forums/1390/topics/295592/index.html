            <div class='col-md body'>1. If you mean during course time or at the unit, see what others do, loh. I dunno how big today's SAF cupboard is, but in my time we only had half a cabinet &amp; only a small compartment (plus a drawer) to keep non-regulation stuff. At least we could fold our Ali Baba bag compactly &amp; store it away, though everyone would eventually keep it at home or make arrangements at the CQ store instead. Do you guys use the black trolley bag that often nowadays? I think I only used the Ali Baba bag only 6 times in 2.5 years: enlistment day, end of BMT, vocational posting day, unit reporting day, &amp; overseas EX (to &amp; back). We'd otherwise booked in &amp; out with the field pack during BMT, &amp; a civilian bag during course &amp; active time.<br><br>2. Must still wear during course time. I remember cuz I left my jockey cap in a taxi during vocational posting day, then got scolded left right center by various Enciks at Khatib Camp (still botak, what) until the weekend arrived to buy a new one at Beach Road. No Emart, then. At the unit, can book out in either civilian or, depending on the SOP there, normal No.4 without any headgear.<br><br>3. Most of us wore the same pair throughout active time, partly cuz everyone must conform to same standard during stand-by-beds (one pair of boots, one pair of shoes, one pair of slippers under the bed). We must kiwi them regularly anyway, whether got parade or not. No need to be NPCC-style shiny too; they just need to be cleaned, maintained &amp; darkened without any traces of mud or soil.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Mono intake means almost 100% probability that you are staying in the same unit.</blockquote>Wah, now so streamlined, meh? The intake size had varied during my time. For example, for the Arty batch I taught in '88, only 60-plus percent were retained after BMT. The old birds immediatey knew not everyone would stay on when, for some reason, the unit had mustered a extra (4th) battery of recruits. About 70 to 80 men were posted out afterwards, I estimate, to become storemen or whatever.<br><br>But I agree with the gist. Unlike those in Tekong, mono-intakers are imbued to identify with the Formation from Day 1.</div>
