As such, you've got to distinct yourself when you are in green and when you are not in green. I know there seems to be a conflict of interest, but primarily your first duty as a citizen soldier is to protect the country. In this sense if some general holds a coup ( which is terribly unlikely), a soldier activated by the government to defend Key installations should still uphold the defence of the nation, no matter how sucky the situation.<br><br>Having said that, the SAF Creed/Pledge was written by the govt, so if you noticed alot has to do with strict compliance/obeying the government and protecting thre government in times of need.<br><br>We must be clear about government and how that is separate from the ruling party.</div>
