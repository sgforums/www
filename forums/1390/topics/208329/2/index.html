"good life" in itself is like an oxymoron there, lack of pride is one thing, something like that is another, if we take the lack of pride to be an excuse, then hey, it's like saying that littering is fine, cos we have no pride in clean neighbourhood streets ? ...<br><br>remember that there's this clip of some smoker recruits being made to sing songs before being allowed cigerattes ? ... or some (it looked like scouts) prancing around like a fool after firing off a machine gun ? ... of course, some are pretty harmless, like the bunch of chaps trying to open a "see hum" (that reminded me of past exercises in tekong" ... but where do you draw the line ? ... such things are subjective of course ... one particular brass may think nothing of it, another may look at it as a security breach of some sort ... who's right ? ... back to my point again, the SAF is only as effective as what others (potential adversaries) would think of it ... call it wayang if you like, but if you're not good at this wayang, military options would seem so much more attractive to which ever chap's to our north or south eh ? ... of course, we may well fight and win decisively in a real war, but then agian, chaps would be dead, homes destroyed, and parents would be crying eh ...<br><br>the best thing to do, it to limit such clips, after all, the explicit standing orders were that private video camera (phones) were NOT allowed in camps and military reserves, were they not ? ... I don't think mindef is going to DB someone over a clip of trying to open an oyster of course, (or even more serious clips) but they may just throw you in the can for bringing an explicitly forbidden item into camp, and using it ... the consequences are clearly spelt out, knowingly breaking them is just asking for it, no ? ...</div>
