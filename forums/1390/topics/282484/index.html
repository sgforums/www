Only SMU, NTU, NUS and Poly students need not go for RT if they fail IPPT.<br><br>And I should know because I am currently studying full-time at MDIS and I also had to go for RT-IPPT last year.

But your employer or educational institution is obliged to release you early to attend RT under the law, so no lobang on that front. You're supposed to make your own arrangments with them.<br><br>Yet I've seen people come as late as 6:30 to Khatib before in the '90s, from my vantage point at the canteen during my ICTs. The variation of the reporting times were inevitable for a number of reasons: eg. access via the back gate from nearby Khatib MRT may/may not be banned (depending on routine orders); access via the main gate is 1/2-hour longer if commuting from from Yishun MRT (171 bus) or from Thomson direction (evening hour-traffic along the long Sembawang Road); the FCC in-processing is quite impersonal (compared to last time when must fall in together); at least half a hour at the start is set aside for warming-up anyway, etc.<br><br>From what I hear, they don't always exercise the full 4 hours anymore -- esp. on weekends. (The schedules are available at their website.) Anyway, the training is supposed to be quite progressive &amp; unhurried, unless it's IPPT day. Really, Khatib was more like a fitness park every evening too, with other people playing football or jogging inside the stadium &amp; the RT people wearing anything they wanted.<br><br>IMO Only really siong if you live far away &amp; don't drive, or if you work shift hours. Or if your body always "nua" (weak) after exercising.</div>

You can still go and "book in" but usually they will give u a green tag, which means u are late. Usually, that would mean that when people are collecting their tags and ready to go home, the PTI would ask u go run around the parade square 2-3 times, after which u can return the tag and go home too.<br><br>on weekdays, the training will usually be over by 8.15pm or even earlier by 8, and on weekends, 10+am/6+pm(depending which schedule u choose for the sunday one).  They usually do the same thing, warm up, go run 3km, then take a break, then go do circuit/gym/pull up, rest a while, then cool down aka go home liao. But since u are in Phrase 1 currently, that would mean the PTI IC or the 2IC would spend sometime talking to u after the exercise, telling u what u can do to pass IPPT. If u kenna the PTI IC talk, less than 5 mins settle, if u kenna the 2IC, its 10minutes and above of talk.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>on weekdays, the training will usually be over by 8.15pm or even earlier by 8, and on weekends, 10+am/6+pm(depending which schedule u choose for the sunday one). They usually do the same thing, warm up, go run 3km, then take a break, then go do circuit/gym/pull up, rest a while, then cool down aka go home liao. But since u are in Phrase 1 currently, that would mean the PTI IC or the 2IC would spend sometime talking to u after the exercise, telling u what u can do to pass IPPT. If u kenna the PTI IC talk, less than 5 mins settle, if u kenna the 2IC, its 10minutes and above of talk.</blockquote>Wah, bloody senang, leh.<br><br>In my time, they must all stay back at Khatib until 9:30 plus, even though the training itself not siong at all. Really pitied those waiting long-long for Bus 171 along the dark &amp; quiet Sembawang Road during those nights. And, of course, exercising in an empty camp on weekends is really, really low morale.</div>

I heard usually khatib and bedok RT personnel will stay back until late late because there will be long lectures about fitness, is it true?<br><br>Anyway, RT-IPPT was more senang previously. Last time if we fail 1 station liao, that would mean we fail the whole IPPT, since for RT-IPPT, there's no such thing as partial failure. Then a lot of us will usually fall out from taking the 2.4km, since we find it useless to run since already fail. The PTI will then tell us to walk/run 3 rounds around the small field then fall out liao.<br><br>But middle of this year, there was this "smart" NSman who went back for his ICT. His OC ask him what's his 2.4KM timing. That "smart" NSMan told his sir that he has no timing, because "Maju Camp very slack, let us walk around the field and fall out after that." Seems that his sir immediately informed the higher-ups(aka regular officers) and requested that no such nonsense be continued. And from then on, we all have to clock a timing, irregardless of how well/badly we do for our 4 static stations.<br></div>
