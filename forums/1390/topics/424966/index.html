              <p>sorry for asking stupid questions here.. I am a female wanting to join the SAF as a combat soldier very keenly.. I have been given pes-e for my asthma and past depression because i have been to imh for it. No medications were given in imh for my depression because i have recovered after talking to counsellors.. I have been sentenced to 1 day in prison and got a hefty fine for my depression problems (i called the counsellor to talk and she sabotage me by calling police to arrest me).. Now it's almost a year and i have been to army half marathon and completed.. I want to know how to upgrade my pes-status to A or B and also am i still able to ask for appeal from chief of army to hire me?? I don't bother about salary or anything but i want to join as a combat soldier because this was my childhood dream.. Males dislike NS but i (female) want to join SAF and they don't want me.. how ironic..</p>
              <p>Please advise me accordingly and please don't ask me to forget about saf because i want to join and learn something.. I mean.. my 1 day in prison is due to me wanting to kill myself and i didn't commit any crime which involved hurting others.. Any idea how to appeal for similar cases to mine..???</p>

              <p>almost all psychiatric cases (or p-case in short) will be given within PES C to E only, depending on light to mild to moderate ones. the severe ones even get PES F, which is medically discharge from any NS duty, meaning no need to serve...</p>
              <p>you can only join for non-combat vocations without any use of rifle and weapons.</p>
              <p>they will NOT even give you a rifle and 5 live bullet rounds for guard duty to prowl the camp area, they will give you a stick baton and a rattan shield for self-defense, so it's much less than having to risk a risk of giving you some 30 live bullet rounds for live rifle range since you have had attempted to commit suicide. because later they all scare the slight possibility of you may relapse at any time to point, aim and shoot people at the live range.</p>

              <p>Problems you need to overcome</p>
              <p>1) How SAF view ur prison sentence. With the problems in the past few years, soldier misbehaving, with the recent "soldier steal car for joy ride", I am not quite optimistic of ur chances.</p>
              <p>2) How SAF grade ur medical assessment. Depends on ur asthma problem, if ur asthma will act up periodically even without medication, chances are still low. Remember, u are aiming for combat vocations, so u dun expect ur platoon to stop just because ur asthma acts up, the army cannot function this way.</p>
              <p>3) How SAF will consider ur mental health. SAF have its own psychiatric department,  you will still need to get thru them as well, these are medical officers (doctors) who ususally also work in IMH, so dun get surprised if u see a IMH doctor u know, now wears a uniform and u have to salute him.</p>
              <p>Lastly, if u decide to hide all this information from them, just be prepared to get back fired and you end up in Detention Barracks (SAF's prison, yes, SAF have its own prison) for lying and withholding information. BTW, if u commit an offence as a soldier u will need to face two court (Civilian and Military), so if u cannot adequately control what you do during ur depression, I strongly suggest against joining SAF, u will suffer even more.</p>

              <p>BRAVO to a gal who aspire to be a combat soldier as compared to many guys who want to escape from their responsibility....my admiration for your rare courage and thoughts..</p>
              <p>but the system is a queer place and they can be hesitant to accept people with certain past history....but dun let that hinder you.....u can try but will you accept offer in certain units that are administrative in saf than holding arms? </p>

              <p>actually the cicumstance behind the 1 day under lock up wont cause problems in being considered for employment since that thing itself might not have any black record at any time, even more minor than minor offences that will leave a few years' record. [getting confirmed agreement for a job is another matter]</p>
              <p>but health wise may hinder u alot, unless it isnt purely combat based. TS very sure physical no kick? health does not equate to physical fitness btw.</p>

              <p>Asthma and past depression! I would recommend that you go for staff appointment like DXO, DXO-EA or do consider the Airforce. Those appointment that required less combat fitness as you are unwell. Well, it is still consider as giving support the SAF organisation isnt it so.</p>
              <p>If we talk in term of salary, the pay of a specialist is not so attractive as you may think. Joining the officer ranking would required you to pass through OCS, midship or Airforce school. Further, you still have to pass/clear your IPPT every year.</p>
              <p>Get your mindset off from treating SAF as mainly combative and afterall you are a sick girl.</p>

It's no wonder, becuase girls seems to be exempted from military discipline such as DB and extra guard duties, it seems. That's why they wanna sign on; good pay &amp; hasssle free.
