            <div class='col-md body'>No exemptions. Heck, I kena Recall IC itself when I was in NUS. Of all people, my commander was my 2IC too! Between us, we were in charge of one quarter of the island, but neither of us were actually based in that sector since we were staying at the campus hostel on the other side of the island!<br><br>For a while, the SAF would've assigned me a "chaffeured" Land Rover, before I was told to take taxis &amp; claim the money instead. Luckily, my detachment ICs were all contactable, so I never needed to go down to their houses (or do their jobs for them).<br><br>I can remember being activated twice during those 4 years, with the first one a problem cuz it was open mob &amp;, other than using a transistor radio or someone calling my beeper, I couldn't do manning at all. (No TV or private phone in my room, &amp; cheap handphones were way into the future. In those days, we were supposed to call back every 2 hours on weekends for updates.)

Forewarning: Even if you study Engineering &amp; is supposed to do industral attachment during the long vacations, your company must still release you for ICT if your unit calls you up.<br><br>As for the mob briefing, I note you didn't mention if it involves your whole unit or only certain personnel. (Try calling your mates up to check informally.) In any case, things are apparently a lot easier &amp; automated now -- so much so they can repeatedly bombard you with non-stop phone calls until you answer, or so I've heard. It's been a while since my unit stood down, so no idea if the SAF still use ICs as the (accountable) backup system for silent mob.<br><br>I dunno how coincidental this was, but my IHL outfit used to "arrow" its undergrad reservists to "bao" all the recall-IC jobs for the first few years too! At least these appointees get rotated later on since, after all, our unit strength was only has a couple of hundreds strong, no one wanted to do these duties forever &amp; yet they must farmed out.<br><br><blockquote>is Ops Manning and Mob briefing the same thing?  </blockquote>You mean Mob Manning?<br><br>The briefing precedes the manning, which is the real exercise (inc. any activation). Mob briefings are conducted prior to the end of ICTs too. These sessions serve to remind the codewords, the timings &amp; the SOPs, etc.<br></div>
