              <p>Well don't take it too hard, not every interview will be sucessful &amp; there is bound to failure. Try harder for BMT &amp; if you are really good, chances are going to the OCS is high too but there is another interview with your officer during BMT. You can ask him to recommend  into OCS too.</p>
              <p>Chances are if you can't be a pilot, maybe you can take up other vocations in the RSAF. If you intend to sign on with RSAF.</p>

              <p>I guess the main reason you have failed your interview is that the board, at the moment, still isn't sure about your leadership qualities. That is through what you've mentioned, morever the officer hinted something like "get into OCS and we will talk again".</p>
              <p>Leadership here is a very very important issue, because it is said that even though one might not have the fullest potential to become an officer during BMT, but has passed the pilot interview, somehow he will get into OCS, for sure, unless hes really a prick during BMT.</p>
              <p>As said, you have a second chance to become a combat pilot, fight for it dude, and goodluck.</p>
              <p><br>Also, remember that honesty plays an important role.</p>

              <p>Simple to put it, during your bmt phase if you perform well in aspect of training or physical. Your BMT sgt or pc might recommend you into OCS if you have the leadership quality. Example from recurit to cadet and you graduate to become a officer.</p>
              <p>For the reapplying stuff, if I not wrong you still can apply 2nd time if you shown outstanding merit during your OCS days &amp; they might take a look at your profile or portfilio  &amp; give you a 2nd chance.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>thanks vincent! anyway are you a pilot with air force? i seriously tink its coz of my leadership and yfc flying records la. they reali tot i'm trying to lie abt my experience in yfc. I reali screwed this gd opportunity up man! if passed, i wud've went for the medical and leave for airgrading after bmt. now got to try aiming for OCS in bmt when i wud have an easier route if i had passed today's interview. but chances of mi getting into OCS is slim coz if i'll likely be posted to commandos and OCS intake for poly students are much lesser than jc intake...so i guess i juz hav to pray hard!    </p></div>

              <p>nope im not. I'm just like you guys.</p>
              <p>I've just received news today that ive passed my compass. I do have seniors and a friend that have successfully been signed as pilots.</p>
              <p>Another point here is that, if you get through OCS first, your pay during airgrading is less miserable. - citation needed lol.</p>
              <p>But anyway, when I discussed this with my commando cousin, he told me if I'm set on becoming a pilot, I should never ever go for the commando VA. Because chances of me getting into commando should I attend the VA is like 80%.</p>
              <p>To the ratio of the OCS intake, again, don't worry about it. If you have a cut for it, you will get it.</p>
              <p><br>Just pray that you do not get enlisted into commandos, because once you get through their bmt, its a very-hard-to-say-scenario already.</p>

              <p>heya. i went for the same session as you man, but only happened to see this thread today.. Personally I think you should have said something like... 'oh maybe my flying skill wasn't good enough' or appear super humble? Cause it's very easy to appear insincere and dishonest once you're nervous and under high stress.</p>

              <p>Leadership records are taken into the side considerations, what I've meant about leadership here is that have you been able to display and show that you do have leadership qualities. Thats the main point.</p>
              <p><br>Anyway, how were your interview?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And to Del_Co, actually it depends. I didnt want to go, and I didnt turn up. All I did was to ring up the camp and told them tons of reasons. if charged, I know it can be serious, but till now i haven't heard of anyone being charge for failure to turn up for commando VA. My commando cousin told me they cant be bothered with those who did not turn up too.</p>
              <p>I were determined in doing so because from what I were told, if one applies for pilot, sat and passed his compass, but went through commando bmt, the chances of being released is very very slim.</p>
              <p>But if one attends the interview and passed aero-medical, meaning that he has been signed on, its a whole new story.</p>
              <p>Maybe any commandos here can verify the above.</p>

              <p>and to TS, quite a handful fail the interview...when I went for it, half the people who were there failed. But since you were given a 2nd chance, I'd say do your best during BMT and go for it again. If it's what you really want, putting in extra effort during BMT wouldn't be too much right?

              <p>you shouldn't use strong winds because they think that it's an excuse to cover up yourself you should say something like if you work harder you could have went PPL and admitted that you were at fault .</p>
              <p>Cheer up anyway u've got another shot anyway . This will be experiance to improve ur second interview . after u get to OCS ok ?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>i think that when he said "are you sure" is because he feels that you are trying to tell him that if there were not strong winds and you were not nervous you could have went to first solo instead of admiting that if you worked harder on improving ur skills on strong winds and coping with nervousness you could have made it to PPL and improve ur SYFC flight records . or maybe it's the fact that they are not interested in the strong winds and nervousness factors but why you did't went first SOLO</p></div>

              <p>it's called a stress interview it's a interview whereby a single interviewer(the colonel) who will behaves in an uninterested or hostile style and ask questions in a demeaning or challenging style this is to access how the interviewee handles pressure or to purposely evoke emotional responses. that's why there was the presence of a psychologist in other words he delibrately trying to provoke you .</p>
              <p>was the fighter pilot quite supportive of you ? maybe you can tell us more about the questions they asked and how you replied !</p>

              <p>i think i know how u feel.. been in your shoes before.</p>
              <p>Applied for pilot, went for med/compass test all before.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Same with you, i've been in the syfc before. got my wings though..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Went for the interview after almost a year of waiting, several delays and an appeal.</p>
              <p>but during the interview, instead of questioning me on aircrafts and whatnot, they ask me why i nv go OCS, can a spec be a pilot (i was halfway in spec training), what leadership qualities i have, how i screwed up in my yfc days.. etc. I was like wtf, why all these questions which aren't related? They asked others the difference between an F16C and D, how easy was that?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, at that time i did not see why all that mattered. To me a pilot was someone with talent, but sadly that was not what they were looking for. "Leadership" is the key, flying is secondary and 'can be trained'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have alot to say about how RSAF or the SAF does things, but i'm gonna keep it short. Was damn depressed n disappointed in the system when i got rejected, as that was the only job i was interested in doing at that time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now after almost 2yrs of NS, i'm hell glad i was rejected.</p>
              <p>not to be sourgrapes though. i do enjoy flying, but i guess not with an organisation like that.</p>
