              <p>i think i know how u feel.. been in your shoes before.</p>
              <p>Applied for pilot, went for med/compass test all before.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Same with you, i've been in the syfc before. got my wings though..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Went for the interview after almost a year of waiting, several delays and an appeal.</p>
              <p>but during the interview, instead of questioning me on aircrafts and whatnot, they ask me why i nv go OCS, can a spec be a pilot (i was halfway in spec training), what leadership qualities i have, how i screwed up in my yfc days.. etc. I was like wtf, why all these questions which aren't related? They asked others the difference between an F16C and D, how easy was that?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, at that time i did not see why all that mattered. To me a pilot was someone with talent, but sadly that was not what they were looking for. "Leadership" is the key, flying is secondary and 'can be trained'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have alot to say about how RSAF or the SAF does things, but i'm gonna keep it short. Was damn depressed n disappointed in the system when i got rejected, as that was the only job i was interested in doing at that time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now after almost 2yrs of NS, i'm hell glad i was rejected.</p>
              <p>not to be sourgrapes though. i do enjoy flying, but i guess not with an organisation like that.</p>

              <p>Well said.</p>
              <p>The thing is Sometimes when you want something, you become nervous and screwed up. While others who are indifferent to the job can actually perform better in the interview.</p>
              <p>Another case is with gfs. Some gals may be your dream gf. But their bf dont seem to care much about the girl.</p>

              <p>haha..yeah quite true! i was damn nervous before the interview but settled down when i start to speak. hey weet, i tink the qns tt were shot at me today sounds so similar to urs. i was also expecting some qns on aircraft n stuff coz i prepare alot for tt too. wat u say abt leadership is first, flying is secondary and can be trained is so damn right after i went for today's interview! i tink i self-snook by myself today. i shud hav just said that my flying is not up to the standard and needs some more training but instead i argue wif them abt not flying much wif my primary instructor and stuff. Now i noe why they tink i'm lying abt my yfc days. i put myself in such a difficult path now instead of the much easier 1 if i had passed today. WHAT A COSTLY MISTAKE I HAD MADE!<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/sad.png" alt="sad.png"> </p>
