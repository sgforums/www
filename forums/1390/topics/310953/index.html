              <p>read up about our RSAF capabilities and inventories what we have etc etc deterance - . - i think read about 3G SAF sit humbly don't put your legs over the other leg . display confidence and calmness in answering ur questions but don't be too over confident or too flamboyant in ur answers or appear over confident but you must be honest cause there will be a psychologist during the interview to see weather you got tell lies anot and rating ur psychological attributes like coping with stress ,confidence etc .also heard my cousin mention something like since you already pass COMPASS u already got "potential to undertake military pilot training" but this interview is more for assesing for people with leadership qualities and people with the right attitude . just be humble confident and display calmness most important be honest! medical can take 1-2 months or maybe enlist still no results yet so you have to spam them with phonecalls everyweek to press them - . - alot of people will already get axed off during medical le .</p>
              <p>TIPS:Before you go to the interview pray hard to ur ancestors and kowtow to em</p>
              <p>Appearance plays a important part in how serious u are about this interview too</p>

              <p>well i dunno the shirt and pants part.</p>
              <p>cause i got called for interview during my BMT.<br>wear smart4 go in face a panel of 5 majors and colonels.</p>
              <p>basically like any other interview,<br>they will asks u why are u interested in being a pilot?<br>then u in YFC, most probably will asks u some stuffs u learn in YFC or some experience that you want to share with them.</p>
              <p>Next, they will look at your transcripts, see how well u did in school.<br>This one i think they took into consideration also. <br>Basically my poly results not bad, but O level flunked until jialat jialat.<br>They focus on my O level results and shoot me. But i told them about my problem then in sec school and how i managed to overcome the problem and studied well to get better results in poly. Think i scored here :P</p>
              <p>After they finished interviewing everyone, they will gather everyone in the room and read out the names that are offered a 'probation' contract.</p>
              <p>You will sign then return them on the actual day. The contract will be effective the day that you received results that you passed the medical check up AND i get selected to OCS after BMT. If either failed, then the contract fail :)<br><br>Well, i was offered the contract but my medical failed. They never mentioned which test i failed. It's considered as 'classified' information to them -_-</p>
