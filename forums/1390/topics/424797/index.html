              <p>Hi! I'm new here. Reading your post is depressing because I have just been given PES status of E9L9 because of some heart problem found during the NS medical check-up and follow-ups with cardiologists. Not too happy but health is more important. I have been reading these forums and did not find much info on what vocations/units PES E9L9 can be posted to. Appreciate some info on this please. Thanks!</p>

              <p>In SAF, dun expect normal treatment, just because you have a real medical condition, dun expect others to empathize with you, trust me, they won't. In fact, most ppl u will come across inside will perceive u as chow keng one. This is life, in working world also the same one.</p>
              <p>And dude, drop the "how come they got this/that and I dun have" mentality.  Once u enter SAF, u have to accept one simple fact "The world is unfair", and SAF is one such place that blatantly shows this unfairness in-your-face, so if u keep thinking like this for the rest of ur NS, u will just suffer.</p>
              <p>Plus, u are a soldier now, although u are not expect to get trained 
              physically as one, u will get "trained" mentally as one. u will come 
              across situations where u will find urself in unfair situation and u 
              will need to learn to accept it, adapt to it and make the best out of 
              it. In fact, most ppl here can't really tell u what to do, u have to 
              figure it out by urself.</p>

              <p>@ Geeeeeeee. call SAF hotline only. confirm plus chop it works. cause the head of e unit have to do a unit investigation. then if the problem you face is true. if regular will get warning. if nsf then sure sign xtra.</p>
              <p>@ stardust. superiors can dont allow MA cause it's a privilege. but you can also highlight the problem. stating that, if i dont go are you gonna b responsible if anything wrong? if they say yes then stay.</p>
              <p>as for camp mates you guys mentioning, that kind of problem cannot b help ah. it's outcast liao. can might as well go MO keng one depression due to peer also can. aiya clerks alr nth much to do. go read the GOM then see how can it make ur life better la. thats what i do.</p>

              <p>@Razors. above is only a small part of my story and is already depressing. i think i can go and die already.</p>
              <p>@likeyou and -StarDust- :  how often is your duty? mine is 1 weekday per week, 1 weekend per month. cool right? everyday verbally insulted with all sorts of vulgarities to my person. why A level must be really smart meh, think i can learn and do everything by myself, and when i did something wrong, they will say i act blur...  somemore the bunk is from other units one and he ask others from our unit's bunks to join me in the room, while the reason for the other clerk for not staying in is that he cannot find a bunk for him, when there are many beds vacant due to those who shifted plus those who ORDed.</p>
              <p>somemore those pes Cs are leading such a carefree life, everyday sleep in the restroom until they got something to do, like go top-up fuel. </p>
              <p>@voltrons :   if saf hotline can work and i can post out then will be good. if it fails and my remaining life in the army will definitely be very sad. maybe no nightsoff for the whole week</p>

              <p><br>Some of the servicmen like to bully others for sake of showing off their power. They think that people weakl, can b take advantage of. Last time, there is a report about a serviceman being bullied by some of his colleauges n it is reported in pionner magazine. The victim decided to complain to SAF MP n the matter was investigated. Some of the perpetrators were brought to Mowbray camp for questioning.</p>

              <p>My advice to you,</p>
              <p>1) If u have giant metal balls, Go straight to your CO and tell him your problem.</p>
              <p>2) If u dont dare talk to your CO, Go to MO and tell him your problem</p>
              <p>3) If both CO and MO dont work. Call SAF hotline and request a post out as even when problem is solved they will still give u a pek chek look.</p>
              <p>As for the part of duty, it looks normal to me. I dont know your unit structure, but it should be divided evenly to all clerks. Having 1 day a week + 1 weekend per month is normal. Just imagine if there was 6 clerks left to share the duty for the month, thats like how many weekdays a week and at least 2 weekends.</p>

              <p><br>SAF hotline cannot post out one.</p>
              <p>Only Army MO or army psychiatrist can recommend a post out.</p>

              <p>Take my advice and complain on the hotline. It worked for me. The incident was when I was unfairly punished with 2 extra and I have more duties than other men. It was a trivial issue and somebody else's fault but they punish both of us. I was a target because I was in the same situation as you: A levels and medical excuse.</p>
              <p>At first I was scared of posting out, because I was living very near my unit. I stay out. But my OC talked to me and the regulars privately. The regular treated me very nicely for a few months until he was posted out to another unit.</p>
              <p>That time, I had more than one year left and was afraid they would make life difficult for me, anyhow punish or charge, award extra, burn off etc or even purposely post me to a far unit. But it didn't happen and I enjoyed my time there. My OC sympathized with me because he was also bullied in his time for being well educated and even as OC regulars disrespect him too.</p>
              <p>You don't have to "win" any investigation or get the regular punished. Army culture involves a lot of twisted logic. The guy said "I use foul language but I don't mean it, I am from a humble background not like you." My OC found it hard to punish them, but told them to treat me more decently to avoid trouble.</p>
              <p>Also you should try and have more friends. When you are alone, they will treat you nice or bad as and when they feel like it. When you make more friends, even if they are fake friends, they treat you more like a human being.</p>

              <p><br> Some of the servicmen like to bully others for sake of showing off
              their power. They think that people weakl, can b take advantage of.
              Last time, there is a report about a serviceman being bullied by
              some of his colleauges n it is reported in pionner magazine. The
              victim decided to complain to SAF MP n the matter was investigated.
              Some of the perpetrators were brought to Mowbray camp for
              questioning.</p>

              <p>Really reported in Pioneer magazine? Not to doubt you, but it sounds ridiculous that SAF airs its dirty linen in public. Did you mean Pointer, for circulation to officers only?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>My unit also sort of like this. Some regulars like to aim those diploma and a levels NSFs, since most of those diploma and a levels NSFs are officers, they cannot touch them mah so left people like me who have no rank then kena aim lor but it isn't too bad lah, just during some defence lessons they like to use me as punchbag and stuffs but luckily i have a MWO commander who will definitely help me if I complain but I don't see the need yet lah</p></div>

              <p><br>I was in the BMT n my OC, a LTA Guards officer is not a kind person. As our BMT is a modified version, one of the platoon mates suffered from anxiety disoder suddenly became breathless n one of the sergeant decided to let the guy rest in the company room. The OC already quite tulan when he seen the recruit becoming breathless sittig on the chair, decided to wake him up by kicking his leg. The recruit after being kicked woke up n the storeman nearby, told the recruit that the OC kicked him on the leg. The recruit is devastated decided to complain to OO, the OO after hearing the recruit complain went to sclod the OC for being insensitive.</p>
