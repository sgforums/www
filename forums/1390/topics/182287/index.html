            <div class='col-md body'>Let me give you some tips:<br><br>1st and foremost (haha - you will get the joke if you are from 1 SIR), find out who the DO and the BOS and other appt holder is. If the DO is one of those daaamn switch off one, then can relax relax. Else, then do what some of the posters above say lor...learn all the drills, etc.<br><br>2nd most important thing. One which you must never forget is to bring TV to guard room. Otherwise very sian one and as you know, idle soldiers like to get into trouble.<br><br>Then, and this is also very important...get someone who is going on a night's off to Ta Pao food back. Your guards eat SFI food will be very low morale. And low morale is no good because low morale soldiers like to try alot nonsense.<br><br>Lastly, <strong>remember that Cpls can do Guard com </strong>also. So if you have CPLs in your guard contingent, there is no reason why they should be able to rest for hours just because they have gone for a walk round the camp! Make him share the desk duty with you and the Guard 2IC and 3IC, etc! These CPLs are the 'high flyers' among the men - so you, as an NCO, ought to encourage their personal development. Making them do Guard Com duty will help them develop their leadership and man-management skills!<br><br><span class="small">note my signature. If you get into trouble, its not my fault!</span></div>

So if you have CPLs in your guard contingent, there is no reason why they should be able to rest for hours just because they have gone for a walk round the camp! Make him share the desk duty with you and the Guard 2IC and 3IC, etc! These CPLs are the 'high flyers' among the men - so you, as an NCO, ought to encourage their personal development. Making them do Guard Com duty will help them develop their leadership and man-management skills!</div></blockquote>don't anyhow teach the new birds lah. they are not allowed to change appointment during duty. as in guards can change timetable with other guards can. guardcom can change timing with his 2IC can. never guards change with guardcom or 2IC. don't get the poor CPL in trouble.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

You are a guard comd leh. Got so many guards under you... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Why cannot make them do guard comd? ...say sleeping time is from 8pm - 8am. If you have 3 persons (GC. G2IC, Poor CPL) to share desk duty that means each one only has to do 4 hrs of duty! (except for the cpl who has to go prowling a couple of times - But Rank comes with responsiblity <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> priviledge!) 8 - 12, 12 - 4, 4 - 8!. Now just imagine the situation if all your guards are CPLs!! WAhahahaha!<br><br>I know not very orthodox, but that is why i suggested an excuse that he could use...and the disclamer.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>
