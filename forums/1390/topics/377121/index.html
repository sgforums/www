              <p>Would fellow singaporeans please help out. Any advise is great.</p>
              <p>I
              am a singapore who ran to USA to study. Now that I have graduated I am
              thinking of returning home. I call CMPB and talked to a Major. He asked
              me to return home and all i will get is a fine probably  no jail.
              Anyone with experiences ?</p>
              <p>Thanks bros</p>

              <p>dont think so.</p>
              <p>the letter they sent to you states:</p>
              <p>either 3 years jail or $10000 fine or <strong>BOTH</strong></p>
              <p>im a defaulter btw. so yes. dont return unless you want to take that risk.</p>
              <p>talk to the major cannot confirm, you must consult mindef and the sg law to be 100% certain.</p>
              <p>and imo.. i think you might still need to serve NS if u return. (not sure abt this)</p>

              <p>Those who are liable to serve national service but refuse are
              charged under the Enlistment Act. If convicted, they face three
              years' imprisonment and a fine of S$10,000.</p>
              <p>Controversy arose when the penalties were increased in January
              2006 after <a title="Melvyn Tan" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvyn_Tan">Melvyn
              Tan</a>, who was born in Singapore, received a fine for defaulting
              on his National Service obligations. Tan left for <a title="London" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London">London</a> to study music during his enlistment age and
              later acquired British nationality. In <a title="Parliament of Singapore" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore">parliament</a>, Defence Minister <a title="Teo Chee Hean" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teo_Chee_Hean">Teo Chee Hean</a> provided some illustration of the
              punishments defaulters would face:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the default period exceeds two years but the defaulter is
              young enough to serve his full-time and operationally ready NS
              duties in full, MINDEF will press for a short jail sentence.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot serve his
              full-time NS in a combat vocation or fulfil his operationally ready
              NS obligations in full, a longer jail sentence to reflect the
              period of NS he has evaded may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot be called
              up for NS at all, a jail sentence up to the maximum of three years
              may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Each year, a small number of people are convicted for their
              failure to enlist or refusal to be conscripted. Most of them were
              <a title="Jehovah's Witnesses" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, who are usually
              court-martialled and sentenced to three years' imprisonment, but
              they are usually held in a low-security detention facility and
              separated from other conscription offenders. The government does
              not consider <a title="Conscientious objector" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector">conscientious objection</a> to be a legal
              reason for refusal to serve NS.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>cause mindef sent me a letter demanding that i return by a
              certain June, but i cannot return cos of exams. Then it states that
              if i dont return, ill be liable for jail/fine/both.</p>
              <p>Then past the date already, they still ask to pay for the bond
              and they now say, that i have until october. Now wtf??</p>
              <p>dodgy right?</p>

              <p>why would they ask u to pay for the bond when u are already abroad for so long? the deposit should be put down before u leave.</p>
              <p>u should have contacted them when they first told u to return in June, to say u have exams. The idea is to keep them in the loop. Cos guys who MEAN to default, they do not respond, yeah thats what they do.</p>

              <p>please do not generalise. the above statement is not only far from true for some in the SAF, (that includes both officers and specialists), the ambitious/dedicated ones work much longer hours than anyone in the private sector.</p>
              <p>there are tons of slackers, losers and slobs in the private sector as well. afterall so many of those farmer local grads end up there haha. if you dunno that, its clear you haven't started work for a day.</p>
