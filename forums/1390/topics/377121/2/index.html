              <p>if i'm not wrong, LHK, LSS and Peter Ho were moved from the SAF to the civil service way before 45. This occurrence is common. There are dozens more but its not meaningful to cite since you won't know who they are. Whether the scholar goes earlier or goes at 45 depends on his preference and time and space.</p>
              <p>But maybe I shouldn't go further, as topics on SAFOS <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never fail</span> to invite swarms of jealous sour grapes in SGforums, not referring to you.</p>

              <p>I am a singapore who ran to USA to study. Now that I have
                                  graduated I am thinking of returning home. I call CMPB and talked
                                  to a Major. He asked me to return home and all i will get is a fine
                                  probablyÂ  no jail. Anyone with experiences ?</p>
              <p>Thanks bros</p>

              <p>I went to the US as well and opted to do my NS after my return.<br><br>I guess you/your parents did not declare to Mindef when you left for the US because you're saying that you may be fined. You should not even be worried about a fine if you had done your due diligence.<br><br>I'd suggest you think about whether you want to return to make SG your home at all. If you don't, and are willing to give up your citizenship, you shouldn't come back.<br><br>But if you want to make Singapore your home, then please contact Mindef to explain your case, tell them it was your parents' fault and of course you were a minor and can't be responsible. Draft-dodgers may be charged, but no parent has been charged before, unless my memory serves me wrong. But SAF wouldn't charge anyone who professes the intention to serve when they say they want to come back. Unless the person is an old shit in his 50s or 60s.<br><br>You should also be aware that if you opt for the first option, you may not return even to visit. This stems from the theory that from birth, a Singaporean already enjoys privileges not accorded to non Singaporeans, born in hospital here, went to kindergarten/pri/sec/JC, so even if he gives up his citizenship after he's due to serve, he is liable for conviction for draft-dodging. One way is to give up your citizenship before you are due to serve eg at 7 years old.</p>

              <p>Yep, thats the question.. Ive been in contact with mindef for about a year +, and ive informed them on my every single move. every single move. Ive informed them on my intentions, the progress, and even about my exam timetable, school schedule, and school holidays.</p>
              <p>The problem is that they've been very inconsistent in their replies. Replies as in emails and those snail mails from the letter box. I do question them on the contradictions, but they do not answer my question directly. Instead, still leaving me in the blur.</p>

              <p>first of all.....are you asÂ strong as an athlete??are you able to run around the oval stadium of 2.4km in 12minutes or less.that is more important in deciding your permanent stay in spore.why?cuz they willÂ  demand that kind of timing from you from today till age 40!its not listed but thats a fact when u go back to spore.</p>
              <p>most people find it impossible especially when they arent born athletes or have jobs that uses intelligence instead of brawn.up to now i still cant pass my running although im as slim as tom cruise.</p>

              <p>oh sheet,</p>
              <p>sounds like bad news to me if they havent really given you a
              real answer fer whole year.</p>
              <p>first of all.....are you asÂ strong as an athlete??are you
              able to run around the oval stadium of 2.4km in 12minutes or
              less.that is more important in deciding your permanent stay in
              spore.why?cuz they willÂ  demand that kind of timing from you
              from today till age 40!its not listed but thats a fact when u go
              back to spore.</p>
              <p>most people find it impossible especially when they arent born
              athletes or have jobs that uses intelligence instead of brawn.up to
              now i still cant pass my running although im as slim as tom
              cruise.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Are you saying that intelligent people cannot be fit, and fit people are not intelligent? Ergo intelligence and fitness are mutually exclusive, ergo a person is either fit and stupid or unfit and intelligent? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><br><br>No offence...I'm super sure, judging from logical odds and from how you write and have presented in this post, that the fit guys I know are smarter and more analytical than you when they were 7 years old compared to your adult life. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>hiya hitman.</p>
              <p>thanks. im not really atheletic but id say soso.. I got silver for my sec 4 nafpha test, and ive got l1r5= 7 for my Olevels.</p>
              <p>Thats been about a year ago since ive sat my olevels in 08, and im taking my A levels equivilant exams this yr 09. (and for a whole freaking year i havent been exercising- sigh)..</p>
              <p>but im not overweight. infact, im 1.7m, and 52kg. so weight issues arent a worry.</p>
              <p>yep. the prob is that mindef wont allow me to pursue my degree even though i get in. and if i were to get into the degree course of my preference, i will only be able to defer it by 1 year.</p>
              <p>so by going NS, = 2years. Ill have to compete with a new batch of students for the same course. (which most prolly will be a slimmer chance of getting , since the board of studies in aus considers my prev application, and by seeing that i went pass the deferrence period, well.. you know. long story...)</p>
              <p>yep. im currently in aus. and my entire family is with me. and ill be turning 18 next year, in september.</p>

              <p>I heard from one of my reservist's friend, his cousin, called Mindef up saying abt his parents overlooked his enlistment issue and he's coming back to serve his NS. So upon arrival in Changi Airport, he was handcuffed and bring to Police Station or SAFPU took down his statement and release after that. But he still have to serve his NS.</p>

              <p>hey tarutaru,</p>
              <p>that explains why once i saw a guy like 39 year old man who looks like a civilian with hair coverings his ears like any sporean civilian.initially i thought he was a army dude but on closer look his haircut was like any sporean street guy n he was much older.he was at the back of a military lockup van n was looking down on van floor.as i was taking a bus i was tryin to figure out what he did to end up in those jailbird vehicle.</p>
              <p>i guess that could be the reason.</p>

              <p>I think you need to shut the fuck up cos you're obviously a moron born with below average intelligence, and hence became a social misfit because the low IQ causes you to react poorly with other humans.</p>
              <p>And you also need to wake up lah and stop being deluded. There are lots of smart guys who are 10 times fitter than you. You're a fat slob who's also intellectually wanting, so you need to console yourself that your poor fitness means you're also 'smart'. Which is of cos a joke. I can count at least 5 of my friends who are marathoners, long distance runners, triathletes, who attended top colleges like MIT, Imperial,Â  and came back with double degrees, post grad degrees and aced everything in their lives. There's even an asshole i know, though he's an asshole, he's a smart asshole, who did his first degree at MIT and did a PhD at MIT concurrently and finished both in four years. He's now back in SAF and is a marathoner whose speed timing at the Stanchart marathon puts many marathoners to shame.</p>
              <p>You need to wake the fuck up and cease embarrassing yourself for another minute of your wretched life.</p>
