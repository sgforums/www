              <p>Hey all,<br><br>I'm considering signing on to the Navy purely out of interest and passion for being out at sea. Thing is, I'm going to pursue my degree first.

              <p>Follow your passion but consider if it's the height of your ambition. It's not a demanding career, you'll lead a life of relaxation and enjoy job stability. That helps you achieve financial goals. Trouble is you might not want to stick it in forever and won't be job mobile later. I'm dishing this out because you have better things to do, not that it isn't a fun career.</p>
              <p>Get the contract terms here http://www.mindef.gov.sg/navy/careers/careers.html</p>
              <p>Women can take on any shipboard role. Some ships have women COs.</p>
              <p>As to what happens if you fail IPPT or BMT, some say you get to re-course it, some say you're let out, some say you're stuck in as a specialist. Best you ask a recruiter <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AND</span></em> scrutinize your contract.</p>

              <p>1) actually, if you are set to sign on, you don't have to sign on after uni. you can sign on and serve for 1 yr, and disrupt to do your degree, under training award. Tuition fee will be covered, and depending on scheme, you may cont' to receive a monthly salary throughout your course of study.</p>
              <p>2) as for whether it is worth it. It depends largely on individual. I suppose you did so out of interest for seafaring. If that's is your interest, well, signing on with the navy is definitely worth it.</p>
              <p>3) It depends on what scheme you sign up under. most usually requires a bond of 5 yrs.</p>
              <p>4) you have to pass your ippt if you want to sign on, ocs or not. for women, if they can't make the cut in bmt, their service will be terminated.</p>
              <p>5) not a woman, so no comments.</p>
              <p>6) Unless you want to take up technical position, e.g. engineer. you do not have to take any relevant degree.</p>
              <p>7) you can apply to sign on at any point of time in your life. perhaps near the end of your course.</p>
              <p>8) there are female sailors. and yes, they can be officers. But they are the rare few. since most eventually will request for transfer to shore-based positions after having children. Women do get to see action. they will usually be doing support roles, e.g. navigation, communications etc.</p>

              <p>Job mobility: you might enter the civilian workforce 4 years later (at minimum) and that might not be helpful.</p>
              <p>Civilian vs navy cruising: trust me, Navy cruising is easier. The mental burden is 10X less. You won't be concerned with your image all the time etc, the sucking up is of a different kind. ie YOU CAN BE YOURSELF. What other job lets you switch off your brain so much. On top of this, there is a heck of a lot of free time.</p>
              <p>Use this time to be yourself, slack off do whatever you want. Even though there is some physical effort, it isn't much. Fitness is a concern, but they make time for it, personal benefit too.</p>

              <p>Hey all,<br> <br> I'm considering signing on to the Navy purely out of interest and
              passion for being out at sea. Thing is, I'm going to pursue my
              degree first. I just graduated from JC last year, and this year
              I'll be pursuing a Communication Studies degree at NTU.<br> <br> So that means if I go ahead, I'll be signing on to be a Naval
              Officer when I'm 23 or so.</p>
              <p>My questions are:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Is it worth it?</li>
              <li>How long will I have to serve if I get into the Navy?</li>
              <li>What happens if I fail IPPT in BMT and can't get into OCS?</li>
              <li>Any women can share their experience as a Naval Officer?</li>
              <li>Is it okay that my degree has hardly anything to do with the
              Navy?</li>
              <li>When should I contact SAF if I don't want to waste time, and
              want to get in immediately after I finish my studies?</li>
              </ul>
              <p><br> Also, I've heard that women aren't allowed on the ships during
              missions. As in, they can only do paperwork and what not, even as
              an Officer. Is this true?</p>
              <p>Thank you in advance!</p>

              <p>Your post is very strange. You are going to pursue a degree soon. After four years of studying, your thinking will change and be more mature.So you should start to consider after four years later.</p>
              <p>If u are trying to sign on a SAF scholarship, this will be a different case then. It would be wise for you to look at my first paragraph and consider more.Â </p>
              <p>Signing on Navy is a fufilling career. Regardless of gender, you will get to be on the ship, and get to sail all over the world. Many places are not accessable to normal people, you will have a chance to visit.</p>
              <p>There are many women who serve the Navy. You will face the problem of dealing with your supervisor. This is the usual office politics.</p>
              <p>I suggest you consider your career after four years.</p>

              <p>Different people have different idea of they want. If you like the sun, sand and sea, Navy is for you. They will train you on IPPT, and teach you to be an officer.Â </p>
              <p>If you like to put on make up and dress pretty everyday then Navy is not for you. Sailors dont get to bathe often on the ship due to limited water supply. They are on watch of the ship everyday. Duty can be on very odd hours throughout the night, then you sleep in the day. You have heavy responsibility, a wrong decision results in death. For instances, the Courageous incident happened eariler.Â </p>
              <p>Most of the female regulars that I know have already stopped serving. "It is a good experience!" - this is what they always says.</p>

              <p>Is not can be....its ALWAYS the case.</p>
              <p>After all, its 24 hrs manning, and the watches can be pretty long.</p>
              <p>At one segment of my tour with RSN, I never got to see the sun for 5 days straight because I took the 6pm to 6am watch.</p>
              <p>And it gets worse when you can't even get the full 12 hr break you desire after a whole night's watch and you scramble around with drills and such.</p>
              <p>Forget the movies...the reality is that RSN lacks people so be prepared to go without rest and even proper sitting down and eat types of meals (ie stand and eat while on watch)...even officers are not spared.</p>

              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>I was a NSF naval officer but I've met quite a few female officers.</p>
              <p>Is it worth it?<br>- If you like the sea, yes it is. Just bear in mind that you will have to keep watch and do duty; the latter means sometimes you miss your public holidays and weekends. Sailing also sometimes happens on weekends.</p>
              <p>How long will I have to serve if I get into the Navy?<br>- Probably about 4 years, ask a recruiter for specific details.<br><br>What happens if I fail IPPT in BMT and can't get into OCS?<br>- You're out. If you want an SAF career you should at least make sure you are reasonably fit.</p>
              <p>Any women can share their experience as a Naval Officer?<br>- Some love it, some decided it was just not for them and OOC-ed from OCS or applied for early release. Your mileage may vary.</p>
              <p>Is it okay that my degree has hardly anything to do with the
                                      Navy?<br>- It's okay.</p>
              <p>When should I contact SAF if I don't want to waste time, and
                                      want to get in immediately after I finish my studies?<br>- You can do BMT and OCS before you commence university, and SAF will sponsor your degree. However, signing on after studies gives you more time to think about it and keeps your options open (you'll also be better paid as a recruit or midshipman since you hold a degree).</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Women can serve any shipboard role including Commanding Officer and do get to see action, including on overseas missions and deployments. The work does get grimy and sweaty sometimes, especially when on deck officer duty. Conning the ship is something you'll have to do a lot of and it is quite a unique (if sometimes stressful) experience because the responsibility for the safety of the ship lies with you. Smaller ships may have water rationing and do often eat their meals packed while standing up or keeping watch.</p>
              <p>Lack of rest/sleep deprivation is something you will get a massive amount of in OCS and it does sometimes happen on ship, usually when sailing or when you are on duty. Of course, there will be lull periods where you can slack, such as when the ship is in yard, but don't expect a career that is always easy.</p>
              <p>It's hard to find the camaraderie you see on a navy ship elsewhere. That doesn't mean there aren't office politics - they still do exist, like anywhere else.</p>
              <p>After some time on a ship (usually after your XO tour) you'll be posted to shore as a staff officer. You might want to stay there or request to post there earlier if you intend to settle down and start a family.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I was a NSF naval officer but I've met quite a few female officers.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Is it worth it?<br>- If you like the sea, yes it is. Just bear in mind that you will have to keep watch and do duty; the latter means sometimes you miss your public holidays and weekends. Sailing also sometimes happens on weekends.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">How long will I have to serve if I get into the Navy?<br>- Probably about 4 years, ask a recruiter for specific details.<br><br>What happens if I fail IPPT in BMT and can't get into OCS?<br>- You're out. If you want an SAF career you should at least make sure you are reasonably fit.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Any women can share their experience as a Naval Officer?<br>- Some love it, some decided it was just not for them and OOC-ed from OCS or applied for early release. Your mileage may vary.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Is it okay that my degree has hardly anything to do with the Navy?<br>- It's okay.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">When should I contact SAF if I don't want to waste time, and want to get in immediately after I finish my studies?<br>- You can do BMT and OCS before you commence university, and SAF will sponsor your degree. However, signing on after studies gives you more time to think about it and keeps your options open (you'll also be better paid as a recruit or midshipman since you hold a degree).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Â </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Women can serve any shipboard role including Commanding Officer and do get to see action, including on overseas missions and deployments. The work does get grimy and sweaty sometimes, especially when on deck officer duty. Conning the ship is something you'll have to do a lot of and it is quite a unique (if sometimes stressful) experience because the responsibility for the safety of the ship lies with you. Smaller ships may have water rationing and do often eat their meals packed while standing up or keeping watch.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Lack of rest/sleep deprivation is something you will get a massive amount of in OCS and it does sometimes happen on ship, usually when sailing or when you are on duty. Of course, there will be lull periods where you can slack, such as when the ship is in yard, but don't expect a career that is always easy.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">It's hard to find the camaraderie you see on a navy ship elsewhere. That doesn't mean there aren't office politics - they still do exist, like anywhere else.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">After some time on a ship (usually after your XO tour) you'll be posted to shore as a staff officer. You might want to stay there or request to post there earlier if you intend to settle down and start a family.</p>

              <p>Grimy is what generally happens when you sweat a lot (due to direct sunlight, humid and stuffy ship compartments, physical exertion, DCBA suits or any combination of the above), get wet in salt water (happens in bad sea states), or get your hands greasy from seaman work. It's uncomfortable but at the end of the day you usually get to shower and change into clean clothes (unlike army on outfield exercises) so it's not that bad.</p>
              <p>Sleep deprivation occurs during OCS training more than in normal ship life, but on exercises or sailing you will still have to be up a lot. Most officers manage it so while it can be tiring it doesn't require superhuman energy levels.</p>
              <p>NOH is good to peek into what the Navy does but, as always, it only shows the good side. Someday you could be on the other side, going to Changi Naval Base at 7am on a Sunday morning to give endless tours of your ship to civilians. The LSTs and frigates are the glamorous ships always seen by the public, but be sure not to miss out the PVs and MCMVs next time you go to Navy Open House because you're likely to spend at least part of your career there.</p>
              <p>As a shipboard officer it will take you about 6 years after being commissioned as an officer before you end your tour as XO (the XO is second in command to the CO). You'll go from an officer under training (understudy senior officers, sharpen your navigation and duty skills, buy coffee for senior officers) through a variety of shipboard officer appointments before becoming the XO. You'll then be posted to shore for several years before you can be assessed for potential to take command of a ship.</p>

              <p>Surprised that the shift is 12 rather than 8 hours. Always thought there were 3 shifts. No wonder we manage to keep the frigate crew at 68, when standard complement is 168.</p>
              <p>I went to NOH, one of the MCMV's (RSS Katong) CO was a woman.</p>
