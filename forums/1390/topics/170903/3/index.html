Some things to ponder:<br><br>1. If only the main force is worthy of respect .. then to hell with commandos and guards 'cos obviously they're not the main force.<br><br>2. My unit last time dun clear the shit after armour. In fact we reach there and most probably die there first before you even see us. If you're lucky .. you see our corpses. If unlucky that can only mean we holland liao.<br><br>3. Clean weapon and maintain vehicles big fark? Combat engineers and artillery also clean their vehicles (CE "MBT", Primus, Pegasus etc.)<br><br>4. The POI thing we were the first guys to do it. KNN .. that time cannot book out 'cos 40SAR need to do standby and can you believe it? SAF couldn't spare any of the 13 combat units liao! Some SIRs ORD and Some SIRs I think not turn ops yet. Probably the same situation in the SAR battalions.<br><br>5. Now infantry status elevated a bit 'cos of the 9DIV/INF business and one of its units become officially "MOUNT certified".</div>
