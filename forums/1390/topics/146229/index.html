            <div class='col-md body'>Think they should promote according to appointment.<br><br>Sect 2i/c, runners, signallers, medics should be CPL.<br><br>Saw gunner 1, GPMG gunner, etc - LCP.<br><br>Everyone else.. PTE or PFC with the option of LCP if they are good soldiers.<br><br>Just because a guy holds A levels doesn't mean the guy is smarter, more capable or a better leader than an O level holder.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually for men rank is really dependent on educational level.<br><br>simply becoz in the old system:<br>CPL and above --&gt; 2.5 years<br>LCP and below --&gt; 2 years<br><br>so A levels and diploma = guarantee 2.5 years = guarantee CPL coz BY ENLISTMENT ACT you are required to serve 2.5 yrs.<br><br>O level and below = 2yrs = LCP or PTE most O level holders decline the offer to be promoted to CPL as that means 6 more months of NSF<br><br>same case as my platoon last time all the o levels LCP declined the offer to be promoted to CPL. this is of course considering the old 2.5/2 years NSF system.<br><br>so i think appointment has little effect on promotion</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Really?  My unit never offered the O level LCPs a opportunity to get promoted to CPL.<br><br>But then it still doesn't answer the question of who takes over in the event that the section commander gets killed.  The LCP section 2i/c or the CPL saw gunner?</div>
