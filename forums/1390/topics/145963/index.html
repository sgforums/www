            <div class='col-md body'>Hi i have a question to ask,<br><br>Let say one day ur unit got one officer car kena vandalise, den ur unit OC want those ppl who did it to admit. Of coz, common sense tell u tat no one will will admit.<br><br>After a few days without anybody wanna own up, the OC start to accuse n put words into u n ur men mouth n force u all to admit, reason is becoz u r the potential prime suspects due to some reasons. As an innocent party, anger n hatred definitely will arise despite we defend ourselve tat we are not at the crime scene during that particular period, in stead more stupid assumptions n accusations from the OC and force us to admit. How can an officer of such high rank say such things to the low ranking, easily bullied nsf without solid evidences, only base on pure assumptions, as if want me n my men to become a scapegoat. I was shock by the way he handle this case, it really disappointed me n my men totally. The way he handle this problem is like an immature, childish kid.<br><br>Anyway wat will u do if this type of thing happen to u?</div>
