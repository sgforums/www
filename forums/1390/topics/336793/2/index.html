              <p><span style="color: #000000;">My boyfriend is in NS now.. and I honestly think he is starting to sink into depression. And no, this is not one of those chao keng cases.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I've never seen him like this before and it's really freaking me out. The thing is he's talked to the people in charge in the camp, I'm not very sure of the ranks =S but they all don't want to seem to grant him 8-5. They don't even seem to be sympathetic at all.<br></span></p>
              <p>I guess the reason why he's like this is because he's been wanting stay out so that he can study. If he doesn't, he would have to spend extra tens of thousands of $$ just to continue his studies when he goes overseas.</p>
              <p>It's really driving him up the wall and I can't even talk to him properly anymore.His loss of moods for anything.. constant guilt..</p>
              <p>I would want him to go seek help and maybe from there he can get 8-5, but will it work? And would it be in the record for his future?</p>
              <p>Oh, and he also has a knee problem. Seen specialist, letter given to MO, etc. Everything was still rejected.</p>
              <p>I know some of you may say he should suck it up because most guys have to go through the same thing, but some people just can't. Its affected his whole mind and well being and I'm really concerned.</p>
              <p>Pls reply! Opinions and comments and help much appreciated.Thanks! :)</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I guess many people have already said your bf should wake up and not take 8-5 as an entitlement etc so I won't go on further on these issues.</p>
              <p>Actually, I want to ask about his knee problem? Is it a crucuate ligament tear? That is a confirm downgrade to c2l2 at least, coz thats my pes status. If it is really a serious knee problem, he'll have to go on medical board to get downgraded. He'll have to "pester" his camp MO with all the necessary documentation from specialist etc, explicitly stating a recommendation to downgrade. The camp MO, after all, in the medical field, is just a GP. Rejecting the specialist recommendation without a medical board is like him questioning the abilities of  the specialist and the MO is nowhere near qualified to do so. Another scenario could be those imbeciles at the medical centre misplaced my request for medical board review, causing nothing to happen. Happened to me last time, so had to submit again.</p>
              <p>Another issue I want to bring up is the mentality of the unit, especially his closest friends. I have a friend in Hendon last time, pes c1, medic at medical centre only, but his fellow medics are siao one, lunchtime also go practice IPPT, do chin ups, 2.4 etc. In my unit, we sleep after eating lunch until its 1pm. So if his unit people think he is chao keng, they may invariably start to criticise him and this might be causing his depression. However, if your bf is really not chao keng-ing, then he should continue to try to get downgraded , it will ultimately be for his own good. But if he's chao keng-ing, then maybe he should think twice of whether he should grit it out or still try to chao keng further.</p>

              I feel in NS there is bound to be a group of people that will be subject to extreme stress. For me my NS life is quite disgraceful. I went to bmt when i was around 100 kg due to easy life in poly. I remember my first week i was already the most remember name in the whole company. I could not do this and that but i really blame only myself for putting on 30 kg in my last poly semester. 
              
              Anyway i flunk my ippt everything, i was made to stay back every sat and book in early on sunday.Even after my normal training in weekdays, i will alway be in the chin up bar,i never had the lurxy of using my phone to call my parents at night as my other platoon mates will boycott me saying go and practise marching and do more chinup on the machine. My worst experience happen when i contract an boil on my knee due to infection, there were tons of accusations that i put germs on my knee thats really terrible. I went ot the hospital and had it remove and i was given mc of 1 month but i only use 3 days as i wanted to complete bmt which was a mere impossible. I went back and on my first day, as i was in bed 1, i have to go down 4 storeys to get bed sheet for my bunk and i was given an exemption of not stretching too much for a  week for the fear the wound will break.My bunk mates are aruging that who should go down in place of me. In the end i decide to go down anyway as i knew they expect me to go. When i come up and distribute all the bedsheet my wound had spilt and i can only use cotton and duct tape to stablize it, my buddy was beside me and he just stare at the blood and said why was i so weak.
              
              Anyway to cut things short, i never complete that bmt, i was assign to storeman for 3 months but those 3 months i really train hard and after that i was assign to be a guardsmen medic. I just think your bf may be too stress but either way he must know he have to complete the whole thing but hopefully he will not be tempt to feign madness

              <p>I appreciate some of your answers, because some of you are really giving me advice.</p>
              <p>Like I said, I didn't post here to pick a fight, but some of you are really harsh in your words.</p>
              <p>As some of you have said, some people may really be subject to extreme stress. And for the record, my boyfriend is not trying to fake his way out, ''chao keng'', nor does he think the army is his dad's, grandfather's, along those lines.. etc.</p>
              <p>I'm just saying that because the army is taking and delaying a chunk of his life, (eg: study (forking out another 50k is really a huge sum), and by getting 8-5, at least after he finishes his class, he gets to go home and do his work, research etc, whereas if he goes back to camp, no internet etc, he can't do any of it. Therefore, his grades will suffer). Once he does his course here, he can go overseas and fully complete it. Without this course, he has to go overseas and do a bridging, which costs about 50k, and on top of that, extra fees to finish degree.</p>
              <p>As for his knee injury, I think its pretty serious because it has to do with the cartilage. Basically, most of the cartilage in the knee has eroded and torn.</p>
              <p>We already had plans to go overseas once he ORDs, if 8-5 doesn't happen, all our plans will just be wasted.</p>
              <p>I guess as much as I say this, most of you will still think.. he's acting childish, only want to "chao keng" etc. I know loads of guys have gone through this, survived etc and well done! I'm not saying he's special and deserves special entitlements.</p>
              <p>But I can honestly say I've never seen him like this. I did my homework, and how he's acting and behaving, are really signs of depression.</p>
              <p>And hey, everyone has their own limits, strengths and weaknesses right? If someone's state of mind suffers because he takes it differently from the majority, do we really have to insult, say hurtful stuff?</p>
              <p>All I was asking for was advice. Good advice. Not: "Leave him, he's a girl. Gu niang. Get another bf." I just wanted to know if he really gets into full depression, will the army think he's lying because so far they've been anything but sympathetic. There's nothing I can do except be there for him and support him. All I'm asking for is advice that maybe helpful.</p>
              <p>Other than that.. thanks to those who have been nice and understanding so far.</p>

              <p>How exactly do you get material in camp to study without the internet, or get work done without a proper computer and time to even visit the library (if there are relevant materials there) when the course is more of self study, researching and projects?</p>
              <p>Also, does the army provide you with extra free time if you're doing a part time course? What if he has constant duties to do? How will work ever get done?</p>

              </p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">i'm curious to know why your boyfriend took up the part-time degree during NS in the first place? Plus, it's worse if you told me that he signed up for the course before NS, cos to me it is a pure lack of foresight on his side. To me, the slightest clue that NS is a primarily stay-in kind of job would instantly put me off taking up the degree and committing myself to the study. You get what i mean? Why shoot yourself in the leg man?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">what i would do instead is buy reference books related to the course of study and study in camp. once i ord'ed, then get the degree. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">some things you can't change, remember. Especially government-controlled issues. of course he has the right to say that NS is hindering his progress in life, but to force the government to sing to his tune is impossible...</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">i think the root problem is why he signed up for the course knowing that time would be a constraint....but he sure has guts trying to think that he can coerce the Force to compromise with him....the world doesn't revolve around him.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">above are my comments, and kudos for being a caring girlfriend :)</p>

              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">i'm curious to know why your boyfriend took up the part-time degree
              during NS in the first place? Plus, it's worse if you told me that
              he signed up for the course before NS, cos to me it is a pure lack
              of foresight on his side. To me, the slightest clue that NS is a
              primarily stay-in kind of job would instantly put me off taking up
              the degree and committing myself to the study. You get what i mean?
              Why shoot yourself in the leg man?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">what i would do instead is buy reference books related to the
              course of study and study in camp. once i ord'ed, then get the
              degree. </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">some things you can't change, remember. Especially
              government-controlled issues. of course he has the right to say
              that NS is hindering his progress in life, but to force the
              government to sing to his tune is impossible...</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">i think the root problem is why he signed up for the course knowing
              that time would be a constraint....but he sure has guts trying to
              think that he can coerce the Force to compromise with him....the
              world doesn't revolve around him.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">above are my comments, and kudos for being a caring girlfriend
              :)</p>
              </div>

              <p>Thanks for your comments. Well, he has not signed up for the part time course yet because he wasn't sure of whether he had to stay in or out. But he has been hoping that he can get 8-5 so that he can quickly sign up, finishing this course, then ORD and go overseas and complete it.</p>

              I'm saying that because he can't study, its causing him to feel like

              individual.</p>
              <p>But if this is going to cause him to really get

              <p>Because theres only 1 course here that's relevant to what he wants to study. No point in getting another course thats not what's he planning to do in the future right? I'm not sure about army duties, which is why I'm asking, if he does has duties etc while staying in, how will he study? If he's 8-5, at least the duties are done during that 8-5 time, and once he's home, he can study.</p>
              <p>I know that last time, the army was much worse and it's relaxed now. But it doesn't mean people still dont have their own problems. Like how our parents always say, the last time they had it so much worse, now all kids are spoilt. But we all know that, last time although it was different, they had their OWN problems back then, and even now with so much technology, etc, we STILL have problems. Same thing.</p>
              <p>It doesn't mean that when things get better, problems or feelings disappear and everything is instantly solved.</p>

              <p>8-5 does not mean strictly 8-5.</p>
              <p>I had the privilege of office hours, however, most days we did overtime. It's a usual occurance.That is no even inclusive of the duty officer/clerk roles that will also take up rest of the time.</p>
              <p>Yes, we know that everyone has problems, but sometimes, it's impossible to solve them 100% in an organisation that prides the collective over the individual. I'll be blunt here, but your bf's problems are not exactly those that are life-threatening or as bad as what I've seen in service.</p>
