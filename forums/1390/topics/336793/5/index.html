              <p>she already came out front and said it ... her boyfriend's sort
              of depression, could be magically and instantly cured, with an 8-5
              ! .... what does it tell you, really ?: .... i do not think people
              like that deserves sympathy ....</p>
              <p>i have seen some real maladjustment cases ... chaps who'd start
              crying when screamed at by the officers and CSMs ... chaps who's
              start bawling and wailing when under stress .... those people, in
              my books ... are people who really cannot handle army life ....
              they need to be committed at IMH of course ... and sadly, I really
              dunno what kind of a future people like that will have ... if they
              cannot handle little things like that .... how are they going to
              handle what life throws at them ? ....</p>
              <p>and this chap wasn't the only one i've seen who tried to keng
              his way out so that he can "study" ... i've seen plenty of A level
              kids who tried that too ... thing is, why should you be given
              special treatments and excemptions, and have others take up your
              slack for you, because you farked up your own studies, and had to
              retake ? ... does it make sense ? ... it may be harsh to say so,
              but whose fault is it, really ? ... why should others have to cover
              for you and take up more duties and shit so you can do your own
              selfish thing outside, when it's you who farked up your own
              studies, your own life ? ... </p>
              <p>and sure ...we all wished we could have tuanged and did less and
              had a cushier life during NS, who doesn't ? ... but why do we
              really hate the pricks who actually went ahead and keng'ed ? ... is
              be because they did something we "dared not" .... or is it because
              they did something we would not ? ... it's not even really about
              responsibility here ... it's about integrity ! ....</p>
              <p>how would you conduct yourself in an environment where everyone
              had to do their equal share ? ... would you, for example, start a
              business with someone whom you know would grab a bigger slice of
              the pie if he can get away with it ... would "jiak" you if he could
              ? .... would you trust someone like that ? take him as a partner ?
              .... would you employ a person whom you know would see things only
              in terms of his own career path and personal gain ? ... would you
              hire him, knowing that he would slack when the boss is not looking
              ? ..... would you, for ladies, want to spend your life with someone
              like that ? ....</p>
              <p>NS is a time, when a man's inner character's revealed ......
              it's not about being garang and siao on and ranks and vocations
              .... but something more fundamental .... how you behaved during NS,
              is really a preview of your life ... it says a lot of the kind of
              man that you are ......</p>

              <p>Well made points. I just disagree that army life would be the be-all and end-all of everything a man should stand for. I have met people in other fields who have excelled and contributed a lot to society but would likely fail horribly in the green machine. </p>
              <p>I think failure in the army COULD, but doesn't ALWAYS mean mental weakness. Living/working together with a lot of other people in a highly regimented life is something not everyone can do. And just because people fail to adapt in this specific environment, I can't agree that they should be in IMH. </p>

              <p>likely ? .... did they or didn't they ? ... have they served NS or not ? ... but that's beside the point of course, I think you have miss-understood the gist of what i was trying to say .....</p>
              <p>of course, not everyone can stand the rigors of regimentation ... i didn't like it all that much myself ... I'm sure most of us didn't ...</p>
              <p>The real issue here, is not even really about mental weaknesses, or failure to adapt to the army. Like I said in a preceeding post, I agree that not everyone can stand what almost everyone else withstood ... fine ... not a problem ... people are made differently .... I even gave examples ... perhaps the IMH part was a bit harsh, I stand corrected.</p>
              <p>It is about INTEGRITY.</p>
              <p>Back to my example, and I quote myself again; how would you conduct yourself in an environment where everyone
                                      had to do their equal share ? ... would you, for example, start a
                                      business with someone whom you know would grab a bigger slice of
                                      the pie if he can get away with it ... would "jiak" you if he could
                                      ? .... would you trust someone like that ? take him as a partner ?
                                      .... would you employ a person whom you know would see things only
                                      in terms of his own career path and personal gain ? ... would you
                                      hire him, knowing that he would slack when the boss is not looking
                                      ? ..... would you trust such a man as a friend, or for the ladies, want such a man as a life partner ? ....</p>
              <p>Sure, the army is not the be all and end all of life ... not all of us ended up with ranks and garang vocations, I do not see success and failure in the army in those terms at all  ... but I stand by what I said ... it is NOT what you are in the army .. it is what you do, how you behave, that would tell on you and your character ...</p>
              <p>If this "boyfriend" of the TS has problems adapting to the green machine, hated the regimentation, hated having to follow the rigid rules, etc, and got into a "depression", he'd have my full sympathies ... cos it'd likely to be a true case of maladjustment ... fine ....</p>
              <p>but his real issue here ... is that he tried repeatedly to seek special treatment for himself, and got into a "depression" because he can't get the 8-5 he wanted for his own selfish reasons, and then now the TS (him ? ) is trying to find ways to exploit the system to get what he wants ? ... again, for the third time, what does it tell you if his case of "depression" can be cured magically when he gets what he wanted, really ? ... you think it's a genuine case of maladjustment ? ... of failure to adapt to army life ? ...</p>
              <p>If the TS is really concerned about the depression .. then why come and ask, how can he get an 8-5, how can he get what he wanted, (read: where are the loopholes and where to exploit them ? ) instead of focusing on how he can seek treatment for his "depression" ? ... doesn't that say a lot about their thought process, doesn't it say a lot about what the real issue is ?</p>
              <p>I cannot respect a man like that ....</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">My boyfriend is in NS now.. and I honestly think he is starting to sink into depression. And no, this is not one of those chao keng cases.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I've never seen him like this before and it's really freaking me out. The thing is he's talked to the people in charge in the camp, I'm not very sure of the ranks =S but they all don't want to seem to grant him 8-5. They don't even seem to be sympathetic at all.<br></span></p>
              <p>I guess the reason why he's like this is because he's been wanting stay out so that he can study. If he doesn't, he would have to spend extra tens of thousands of $$ just to continue his studies when he goes overseas.</p>
              <p>It's really driving him up the wall and I can't even talk to him properly anymore.His loss of moods for anything.. constant guilt..</p>
              <p>I would want him to go seek help and maybe from there he can get 8-5, but will it work? And would it be in the record for his future?</p>
              <p>Oh, and he also has a knee problem. Seen specialist, letter given to MO, etc. Everything was still rejected.</p>
              <p>I know some of you may say he should suck it up because most guys have to go through the same thing, but some people just can't. Its affected his whole mind and well being and I'm really concerned.</p>
              <p>Pls reply! Opinions and comments and help much appreciated.Thanks! :)</p>
