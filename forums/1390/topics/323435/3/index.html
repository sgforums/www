              <p>he intended to have a shoot out to murder his ex gf, and he could have done it, if he wasn't caught in time.</p>
              <p>he could have injured many others.</p>
              <p>it's hardly harsh at all.</p>

              <p>even if he did it out of fun, like he was being funny, thought it'd be funny to smuggle out a rifle, it stilll wouldn't have been harsh. he would have deserved it as well. because he'd be a dick, and this would teach him that not everything's fun and games.</p>

              <p>you think that' i should pity him for making totally stupid decisions just because he went through what thousands of other guys who have gone through in NS? what makes him so special that I have to give him special consideration?</p>
              <p>i also went through breakup in NS wat, not just me, but so many others as well, you don't see me bringing out a gun, plotting to murder her,</p>
              <p>he's simply weak-minded, and self centered. he threw away his own future, and he didn't even care. ppl like him, don't want to be saved, they walk that path of self destruction, knowng the consequences, yet still thinking that they're so cool.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if he succeeded in killing the ex gf and family, are you going to walk up to dave and pat him on the back and say "it's ok, i understand how you feel, i understand what's going through your mind"?</p>
              <p>if he succeeded in killing them, are you going to tell the relatives to leave dave alone?</p>
