              <p>its just that you seem to be suggesting that it is so easy for a someone suffering from depression to start talking to people about their problems. if depression can be overcome so easily, people won't have to ponder over decision to visit psychiatrists, least go to them for treatment.</p>

              <p>i believe someone once told me, you call a dog, "a dog"?</p>
              <p>this is what i see, his girlfriend broke up with him, boohoo, yeah, life sucks, get on with it.</p>
              <p>but did he get on with it? no. that smart alec decided to break his grandmother's heart (probably the only person who really loves him) and do the most stupid thing possible, AWOL and try to murder an entire family (totally lacking in foresight, showing his maturity level - level 0).</p>
              <p>for that, i cannot forgive him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and as for you, ya, i don't care if you're loyal to him or what.. he screwed up royally, that's what i see. and he totally deserves it. and if you can say this:</p>

              <p>yup she is a lesbian. apparently she's 19 this year and her
                                                                  lesbian gf is 2 years younger than her, which makes her 17. shortly
                                                                  after Dave and her broke up, Crystal got with Kervon. her blog url

              </blockquote>
              <p>you're as big an idiot as he is. everyone has the right to choose who they want to be with. and as sad as the situation is for dave, the girl did the right thing. who wants to be with a weak-minded person? abit of thing only, want to kill others, want revenge, filled with dark emotions. you think this is manga ah? he's sasuke?</p>
              <p>if he's a real man, he'd pick himself up from the break up, learn from it, and be a better person from this experience. and you, as a friend, shouldn't encourage his actions and say stuff like "ya, if i were him, i'll also shoot them", if your friend is brainless, you should think for him and help him see the bigger picture.</p>
              <p>but he didn't do that, did he? so now he have to bear responsibility for his actions, simple as that. don't give me that bullcrap how he didn't deserve this la, etc. he did something wrong, he pays for it.</p>
              <p>so no need for you to come in here and try to rally sympathy and get others to say "poor kid, break up ah? come i give you a hug?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the only support he needs is anger management, and to think about his future la.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but just to keep the record straight:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>He had a breakup (aw... pat on the back).</li>
              <li>He smuggled a rifle out with <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the intention to murder</span> </strong>his ex gf and family (among other plans).</li>
              </ol>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Compare the issue he's facing and the actions he took to deal with it. How can anyone think that the sentence was too harsh? It's not as if he was forced into a corner and had to defend himself from attacks from other people.</p>
              <p>i've definitely heard enough of the "my friend provoke a fight, but he got beaten up instead, so i must avenge him, it doesn't matter whether he is right or wrong, but as a friend, i must avenge him" speech.        totally illogical to me.</p>
