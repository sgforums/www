              <p>This reminds me of a joke.</p>
              <p>President bush walked around an elementry school. The teacher is giving students words to make sentences with. The word is tragedy. The teacher asked president bush if he would like to take the class for the word.</p>
              <p>A student raised his hand. If my best friend got ran over by a car, that would be a tragedy.</p>
              <p>President said "NO that would be an ACCIDENT"</p>
              <p>Another student replied "if a bus carrying a busload of students drives over a cliff, that is a tragedy."</p>
              <p>He said "NO that would be a GREAT LOSS"</p>
              <p>Then nobody said a word, after some time, a voice piped up. "If a terrorist bombed a plane carrying Mr and Mrs Bush, that would be a tragedy. "</p>
              <p>President said "Wonderful, and how did you get there"?</p>
              <p>The child said "well, in that way, it would not be an accident and it certainly would not be a great loss."</p>

              <p>poor dave, he doesnt deserve this. maybe many tend to see that he deserves what he's getting. matter of fact, his ex gf Crystal Liew is one big time slut. why would i say this? i personally know the two of them. Crystal is one big stuck up self-centred materialistic girl. she treats herself like one "princess" and demands this and that from people around her. not to mention, she also goes around bitching and laughing at people like she's got some darn hot face. Dave, on the other hand, growing from such bad influencing family, must have had insecurities and held on to his long-term gf. and to suffer the big blow to his ego after his gf took off with another butch is downright humiliating. but of course im not trying to justify that his doing is right. he is just too possessive for fear of losing another of his loved one. now kenna 9 yrs for taking a rifle but never shoot. wasted. here's her blogs fyi. xemptyspaces.livejournal.com--- Crystal's.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>yup she is a lesbian. apparently she's 19 this year and her lesbian gf is 2 years younger than her, which makes her 17. shortly after Dave and her broke up, Crystal got with Kervon. her blog url can be found on technorati, kervonlim.livejournal.com. go have a look. i also feel Dave should've just shot them.</p></div>

              <p>rubbish, as if he's the only one with lousy gfs, he's the only one who ever broken  up issit.</p>
              <p>if we follow the rule of thumb to shoot every bad gf in sg, almost 2/3 of the female population would hv died.</p>
              <p>sure, life isn't a bed of roses, bad things happen to good people, life isn't fair. but the choice to do the right thing, or the wrong thing, is all on us.</p>

              <p>anyway, i think won't serve full sentence wan la. with good conduct etc... might be shorter</p>

              <p>I find that the punishments for both Dave and his friend are harsh.</p>
              <p>I am just curious why didn't the news talk about the 'lesbian' issue now. I think it was reported initially when this incident broke out right?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I guess if Dave's ex-gf is really such a lousy gf, she would be able to say that someone literally love her to such crazy extend to get himself landed in jail.</p>
              <p>Emotional matters are very dangerous as it literally drives all rationality away.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>The jail term is enough and the caning is way too harsh. Someone has to be mentally unstable to do something like this. Many people think such thoughts at times of anger and stress but to actually do it probably means he just broke mentally, IMO. Very sad that such a young life is destroyed this way.</p></div>
