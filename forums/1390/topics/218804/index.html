            <div class='col-md body'>Dear all mates, i got a difficult problem now.<br><br>i am pursuing my Injury report which happened during my bmt 2 years ago. yes it happened a long time. As i just got my mri scan result from hospital, i found myself in a highly % chance of going for a operation now yet i am ording soon in like 1.5 mths. Few weeks ago i heard that personnel can do a injury report and I also heard that with an injury report, my costs etc will be cover by govt after i ord.<br><br>Hence with this news, i backtracked my injury report. The problem is..the time frame and another is whether are all enlistees being briefing by their PC/specs that we can do a Injury report if we injury during the service work?<br><br>For myself, i remember i was never being briefed by anyone at all. i asked my frens, they say never too.<br><br>Is there any directives that the PC/specs know that they should brief or whatsoever?<br><br>pls advice..hai, thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Before you enlist, at CMPB, they will give you a booklet.. detailing all the policies of SAF.<br><br>They will cover you for injuries obtained while in Service and in cases of permanent injury, they will cover you after.<br><br>For your case, you can't just write out an injury that happened 2 years ago and only want to claim against it now.<br><br>They will ask many questions... like why you never bring it up 2 years ago, and even if you did not bring it up, why didn't you bring it up in the subsequent units you went.<br><br>And of course they will ask why you can sustain such an injury for 2 years and only want to bring it up now.<br><br>i dun really know what your situation is... but  it will help if you elaborate what injuries has occurssed etc.</div>
