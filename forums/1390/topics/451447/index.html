              <p>Hi guys... </p>
              <p>I've been having anxiety issues since about 2 years ago.... During my BMT, it got really bad and I was suicidal and had involved myself in self-harm. My parents caught me and I broke the whole story to them. They were shocked as I did really crazy things( at least to me) which i thought i will never do. I was then admitted to IMH for some days. Went back to camp after that, and the MO told me to get a memo stating the diagnosis and give it to him for him to do anth, I was told not to do any training but just follow my platoon. I went back and got the diagnosis, and the psych also stated for me to be transfered for light duties(clerk storeman, etc). The MO took it and said i will be medical boarded. Till then, I was not involved in any training. I missed the medical board date because the medic screwed up some stuff and the med board date has been postponed till i dont know when. Now, I have to go back to training.</p>
              <p>I was quite surprised that I was not taken out immediately and I am sinking deeper and getting more delusional... I don't know what to do. My PC can't do much, my OC doesn't want to get involved. I'm really lost... I get really anxious and my anxiety is getting worst. </p>
              <p>Any advice on what can I do?</p>

              <p>So are you still in BMT?</p>
              <p>I suggest that when you report back for training, tell your PC and PS
               about your situation and try to get an appointment with the MO. With 
              previous historical records from IMH, many of the commanders won't 
              really want to have to handle your case, thus the possible cold shoulder
               from your OC. Try to explain your situation to your PC and get an MO 
              appointment as soon as possible.</p>
              <p><br> Although I do have to warn you that many MOs don't really take anxiety 
              as a very serious excuse. Simply because BMT is a high stress 
              environment and most of the people who go in tend to ease into the 
              system when they are immersed in it for longer periods of time. Also, 
              Tekong MOs tend to be quite anal in an attempt to filter out the 
              "kengsters" but make sure that you bring a copy of your IMH medical 
              reports and present them to your PS, PC, your OC if possible and the MO 
              that you are reporting to.</p>
              <p>As for the medical board, you can report back to the medical center to check on when it has been postponed to. Just know that once a date has been set, it is very difficult to change that date as the board has many cases to look at as well.</p>
              <p>As for your training, I guess once your PC is well aware of your situation, backed by the medical reports, he would pull you out of training till your medical board is complete. Prior to that, just be ready to do nothing all the way till it is cleared.</p>
              <p><br> If luck is on your side, the board may just be nice enough to grant you a down pes.</p>
              <p>May I know however, what is your current PES status?</p>

              <p>Thanks alot. Im currently B1L1 and currently in BMT. My diagnosis is more than anxiety disorder... something about mood. IMH won't reveal it fully to me ironically... The medical report would be done in about a week so when i get it, i'll pass it to the MO. Since it's supposed to be direct to my MO, im not allowed to open the report, but I guess i could get a copy of it and pass it to my superiors. I currently only have that memo as IMH dont really give their patients the full report. What do I do when I go see the MO?</p>
              <p>I'm not suicidal anymore, thank goddddd... </p>
