              <p>you don't look for your mp. ask your parents to(make sure ur parents mention they approach the mp on their own accord, like that u can puay your way out) . if you look for MP yourself ur co sure ask u go his office lim kopi.</p>
              <p>just quoting a case that happened during my time. this guy chao keng and my oc spotted him. OC refuse to let him go for M.A and confine him in camp. that siao eh called his mother and his mother went n kpkp to the MP (bedok), mp escalated problem thru letter and email to mindef. next day i see a few office attired ppl came dwn n taking down all of our statements with regards to our welfare given by our OC.</p>
              <p>subsequently afew other dudes in my coy saw the opportunity, they also asked their parents to complained to mindef. and if your ah teo and receiving several complains to the same officer over a span of a few days, surely gt problem tio bo? i remember always seeing my brigade SM and brigade commander at our smoking corner lepak during the "mindef period"</p>
              <p>And that dude subsequently was let off and since tat incident my OC nvr anyone liao.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SAF hotline also can lah but take some time . anyway just for your reference only. dont necessary work all the time.</p>
