              <p>TS created an account just to complain about this???</p>
              <p>It should be well known MINDEF takes time to do everything. You want to do anything you do it months before and not when just a few weeks is left. Waiting till the last few weeks to start sending emails won't hasten things much anyway.</p>
              <p>When i applied for my disruption, i sent in my application almost 10 months before my disruption date AFTER i checked and was assured that i was eligible for disruption. Due to some negligence of my unit clerk, i had to submit 3 applications in total before he got everything right and it was only about 3-4 months before disruption that i've got the official approval for it.</p>
              <p>Directives for disruption of NS is not something new and the guy should have checked his eligibility before he even applying for uni while he is still serving. If disruption was so easily granted, many NSFs will never complete their 2 yrs of service before they disrupt and lead to major manpower issues.</p>

              <p>The blogs are by a lady.</p>
              <p>Why do you fellows think it's the NSF concerned? Secondly, there are valid issues of command ineptitude or plain time-wasting outlined.</p>
              <p>However, I must say that the NSF should have read through the disruption guidelines before doing anything. Cambridge does accept delayed entrance for undergraduates if you have been accepted. This is up to 1 year at most.</p>
              <p>Understand the situation before taking steps, because some things are policy, and policies do not get changed willy-nilly for an individual.</p>

              <p>Not really. This guy wants to defer because he has a place in Cambridge to study economics. No mean feat, but he cocked it up by applying early. He wants to apply for deferment but his unit clerks and admin staff, being lazy incompetent bums, tried to fob him off. That means more delays and all the time the clock is ticking.</p>
              <p>Ultimately he failed in his application. In the course of his application, he asked people for help, and help was given. The PMO and others responded rather more quickly to some than others and the TS is unhappy. So she wrote a blog, naming names, publishing letters and potentially creating a very embarassing situation for those who tried to help.</p>
              <p>The woman bit the hand that fed her. You know what they say about women "snakes with tits" spring to mind. The words "dumb", "doorknob", "as" and "a" also springs to mind.</p>
