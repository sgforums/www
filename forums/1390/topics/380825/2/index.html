              <p>dude, please don't think you can be a doctor if you want. why
              not let me ask you, are you sure you can make it for the
              requirements? for NUS: As for A-Levels + (2 interviews+essay). Its
              so ridiculous when people think being a doctor is that easy, be it
              attaining the degree or after acquiring it. I must say its a joke
              if you think that you can be a doctor if you want.</p>
              <p>like what most people replied say, you should start working hard
              for that place.</p>

              <p>it is easy, many of my classmates are doctors. Even the sign on Major MO, result is not even half as good as me is a full-pledge doctor now. The fact the working life of MO is too tiring for such a lazy people like me so I will pass.</p>
              <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">To be a MO, the results of the so many As is not important. My friend went in with A,B,B,C gp: A1, HC:A2, but he is a school swimmer. not sure if his parents are doctors. The interviewers are looking for the qualities for beng a doctor, that is to be "selfless and willing to give your life to serve others"  Imagine you are a trainee doctor taking only 1.8k salary, and have to stay back overnight almost everyday 24 hours seven days in the hospitals. Practically you live in the hospitals and with patients.</span></p>
              <p> <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">My friend (a MO) is shocked when I complain my graduate starting pay is low. I rebuke and say that you want to be a MO is to serve the people not for the pay. </span></p>

              thats totally irrelevant. your point was that the saf mo's don't look if the patients have had drug allergies. being a medic, i have seen medics get fucked bad for leaving the drug allergy column blank. you probably just saw one black sheep out of the thousands of MOs.
