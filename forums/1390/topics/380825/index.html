              <p>Their course in OCS is the MO cadet course. Not the same as the other cadets. Anyway if not because SAF needs NSF doctors, less than 1 in 10 of them would have made it to OCS the normal way. This can be seen by how many of the overseas medical students didn't get into OCS during their NSF years. (Guys doing medicine overseas in UK and Aussie do their NS first, if not put security deposit).</p>

              <p>yes many of my friends went Australia to get the medical degree, it is shorter and the doctors are more skill in surgery than the local MO. </p>
              <p>MOCC is slack if you are a NSF. If you are a ORD personnel during a MOCC conversion course even more slack. Anyway all the courses in the medical school is really very slack. I thought my BMT at leopard is already quite slack, there, even more slack.  </p>
              <p>serve 2 years, then get med degree and stay overseas and never come back if I am as smart as you. </p>
              <p>actually being army doc is not that bad... my friend sign on as a SAF MO and is now a major going to 2 crab next year</p>

              <p>MO life is quite good lah. Especially if you are a MO in some
              bases, no need to go exercise just stay in Medical Centre see sick
              parade. MOCC can be quite siong but sure pass lah.</p>

              <p>Where got slack? being a MO is stressful. Depending on your posting. if you are unlucky you go to tekong, you will work like mad, imagine you have take care a few hundred patients a day, like less than 1 min per patient. World record holder. </p>
              <p>On left side, the bloody officer say dont give his men MC (they chao keng one), on right side, the recruit look really unwell and need some rest. If you dont give MC the recruit might faint or worse die, if you give the officer not happy. The MO sometimes dont even have time to go toilet and have lunch. Every time, they sign and chop their stamp they out put their medical license at risk. </p>
              <p>In Tekong, the MO have been giving me Ponstan for backache and Panadol for fever. But they dont know I am allergy to these drugs. Lucky I am a disobedient patient and never follow instructions and never take the drugs, else I would have die from drug allergy. So do you think issuing medications is a joke now. I charge the MO for giving me drugs that I am allergy and get their license remove...   </p>

              <p>dude, please don't think you can be a doctor if you want. why not let me ask you, are you sure you can make it for the requirements? for NUS: As for A-Levels + (2 interviews+essay). Its so ridiculous when people think being a doctor is that easy, be it attaining the degree or after acquiring it. I must say its a joke if you think that you can be a doctor if you want.</p>
              <p>like what most people replied say, you should start working hard for that place.</p>
