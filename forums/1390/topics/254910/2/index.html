            <div class='col-md body'>took this article from New Zealand army web site.<br><br>looks like if there is a cold spell the 5 man will freeze their butt out....<br><br>The following is an overview of Bamyan Province, the area in which the New Zealand Provincial Reconstruction Team (NZ PRT) is deployed to. It covers ground, environment, and other information on the area.<br>Orientation<br>Afghanistan is located North West of India and is bordered by Pakistan , Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and China.  Kabul is the capital of Afghanistan, a city of approximately three million people, by far the largest city in Afghanistan. There is a large American airfield and coalition base at Bagram, located approximately 50 minutes driving time north of Kabul.<br>The NZ PRT Area of Operations (AO) is Bamyan province, approximately one hour flying time or eight hours road drive west of Bagram Â– and that is on a good day. This drive has been known to take up to 33 hours in inclement weather!<br>Bamyan is one of the central provinces of Afghanistan, and is located in what is known as the Central Highlands Region. It is bordered by the provinces of Sar-e-pol and Samagan to the north, Baghlan, Parwan and Wardak to the east, Ghazni, Oruzgan and Dai Kundi to the south, and Ghowr to the west.<br>Bamyan province is approximately 200km East to West, roughly 2-3 days driving, and around 250km North to South, approximately 2-5 days driving Â– driving time is weather and season dependent. The roads are unsealed and rocky and drivers can safely average speeds of 25-40 km/hr.<br>Bamyan City is located in a river valley and the ground is dominated by a cliff feature on the northern side of town. It is in this cliff that three ancient giant statues of Buddha were carved into the rock, and had stood for centuries. But on 26 Feb 2001 the (then) Taliban leader Mullah Omar, ordered their destruction. The Bamyan BuddhaÂ’s had been completely destroyed by 10 March 2001. The empty holes in the rock now serve as a constant reminder to the locals of the Taliban Regime.<br>Bamyan town is home to the regions provincial government and headquarters for most of the international organisations and non government organisations in the province. Many of these in turn report to a higher national level headquarters in Kabul and have branches or outposts in some of the minor towns within the province.<br>Key towns in the province are Kahmard, Ru Ye Sand, Do Abe and Sayghan to the north of Bamyan in the Kahmard district. NZ PRT patrols regularly liaise in this area and there is a Forward Operating Base (FOB) in this district. To the west is the Yakawalang District, and another FOB in this area. In the south of the province, perhaps the most exposed and rugged of the patrolled areas is the Panjaw Waras region, and another FOB. This area is difficult to access, especially in winter when several meters of snow closes the passes.<br>Afghanistan has an estimated population of 23 Million, with an additional three million refugees in Iran and Pakistan. Exact population figures are difficult to determine.<br>It is difficult to determine the population of Bamyan province, however estimates suggest there are up to 500 000 people and perhaps over 100 000 of these in Bamyan City and the surrounding area.<br>The central highlands terrain is challenging at best. The NZ PRT, better known as Kiwi Base, sits at an altitude of approx 2600m, while some of the roads traverse mountain passes of up to 4000m. Many of these passes close with winter snow, cutting off larger areas of the province until spring snowmelt or the hiring of workers to clear the snow. There are no sealed roads within the province and many river crossings are still awaiting bridges.<br>Mines are still a hazard in the province although most areas are now marked and mapped. There have been no incidences of NZ PRT vehicles encountering a roadside mine, however with spring snowmelt there is a risk that mines can move with the snowmelt onto the roads.<br>The Bamyan Climate is one of extremes. Temperatures easily reach into 40Â°C in summer and winter temperatures have been recorded as low as -30Â°C with wind chill factors lowering this by an additional -20Â°C. The climate is much drier than NZ, with dry snow in winter and dust storms in summer. The extreme temperatures do affect both locals and NZ PRT personnel.<br>River levels can also rise with spring thaw, bringing the added risk of movement of mines onto roads and fords.<br>The central highlands region is also known as the Hazajarat, and is the traditional homeland of the Hazara people, and the primary ethnic group in the NZ PRT AO. Most Hazarans are ShiÂ’a Muslims, and many have families, descendents or ethnic ties outside of Afghanistan. By virtue of their minority religion, physical isolation, and distinctive religion, Hazarans have often felt discriminated against by members of other ethnic groups, and are perhaps one of Afghanistan's most independent populations<br></div>
