            <div class='col-md body'>it's a tradition for the military, both local and esp foreign, to have some alcohol to celebrate occasions. I suppose it was from way back, when people feast and drink merrily when a victory is declared. The wine flowed like the river in those times.<br><br>So I guess this habit of drinking and drinking to socialise is very common.<br><br>In fact for navies, when a ship docks at a new port of call, the commander would hold a 'diplomatic' reception and drinks will be served, along with good food. This is to promote good will amongst countries. And I suppose they believe a few rounds of alcohol is perfectly safe.<br><br>CHEERS!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's a tradition that dates back to days of old when sea trips took weeks.Water could not be kept for that long without going bad so wine was used.They either used wine concentrates just wine.Later when other forms were discovered like brandy then brandy was also used.<br><br>Anyway the armies drank it for the same reason.<br>In the old days there wasnt piped water or even clean water where ever you went.So soldiers would drink wine.Also wine and on a whole alcoholic drinks help wash wounds better.</div>

I served onboard a ship that is catered for NSmen training and often when we sail overseas, the NSMen will drink, although never in open view of my SQN officers.<br><br>When our ship reaches other countries, and we will stay there for 3 days, often the NSMen will drink to their hearts' contents. But in the end, they know their limits. I sure think that Navy don't encourage drinking, but its a well-known fact that Navy personnel sure can drink. I am an exception, because I don't like drinking, as I hate the feeling of throwing out and having a bad hangover. My officers will encourage me 2 join them at times, but they do not FORCE me to go drink with them. And even if I do join them, I only drink 1 bottle or glass of Carlsberg or Tiger Beer because I know I can't. Seriously, its up to the individual to decide if he wants 2 drink or not. If you don't want, no one can force u.<br><br>Its unfair to say that the Navy supports and encourage alcholism. Some officers do that because they see it as a way to bond with their men, and know them better. Often out at sea, everyone is busy with their positions, and seldom do the whole crew get a chance 2 get together. Drinking is one of the way to bond, but whether is it the right way to bond depends on how you see it.<br><br>I am sorry that you had this bad experience, but to say the Navy encourage a drinking culture is just wrong. Like I said, its all about self-control, and if u are the strong or weak-willed type.  No one can force u to do things u don't like.</div>
