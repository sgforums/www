And as was mentioned, it does come engraved with your name, your class and your rank. Here's a pix. Anyone recognise the gent handing out the sword?

They plan to give it as a milestone for the first &amp; subsequent graduate batch of SISPEC in SWI.<br><br>But they got issues to settle.<br><br>1) Swords to officer is a long and international tradition. I have known no armies giving any symbols of rank to NCOs other than RSMs.<br><br>2) Swords are "fake" as in other than symbol, they don't have much practical use . Unless you sharpen it yourself.<br><br>3) Bayonets are the real stuff. a new bayonet from ALB is actually sharp and a weapon.<br><br>4) there are approximately 2600-2800 3SGs being appointed annually. I think it will be a cost issue.<br><br>5) 3SGs get promoted by vocaton and there is no ceremony for all Army Specs. organising one will be diffucult since their Speciality course varies in duration. WO claimed this will not put any meaning to the bayonets if ceremonies are small scale.<br><br>So in conclusion. SISPEC and SAFWOS did not conclude anything.<br><br>Anyway, all this info i got is from a SISPEC conference back then.</div></blockquote><span class="small"><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>How about issuing bayonets to the 2SGs (Combat) and above. Those that finish the platoon sergeant course? (how about those UNSHARPENed bayonets?)<br>or issuing baton to the CSMs when they finish the CSM course?<br><br>You can consolidate all the CSMs in the whole WORKYEAR who had attended the CSM course, ask them to go back to PLC camp or SAFWOS to have a big ceremony. (low cost, good morale booster, and the baton is not sharp).</strong></span></span></div>
