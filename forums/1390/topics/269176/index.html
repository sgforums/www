With RSMs, we're talking about WOs who've been in the service for already 9 years or so, making about $3k to $5.5k (according to MINDEF website). At that stage, they're very much "lifers", to borrow a more-accurate American reference.<br><br>Unlike younger senior-NCOs, these old-timers would've had a settled personal life one way or another. They'll also know that they won't get the same remuneration &amp; enpowerment outside in civilian life.<br><br>Plus, after years of saluting 19-year-old 2LTs, they can also see that their next promotion (eg. to 1WO, or to MWO) would get them into a staff-job posting or a OIC equivalent, &amp; out of the frontline-unit life for good! ~lol~<br><br></div>
