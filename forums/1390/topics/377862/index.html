              <p>1. If you fail IPPT beyond the 3 months in Tekong, you will have to go for re-BMT just before you ORD. As for the rest of the time outside of Tekong, you won't need to stay back on weekends, but your chances for promotion are close to zero if you are combat fit. But then again, it also depends on your unit's policy for IPPT failures.</p>
              <p>2. You will have to go for re-BMT, which will usually be near the end of your NS. I heard of people who managed not to go for re-BMT though, but don't get your hopes up too high.</p>
              <p>3. Yes, biscuits are allowed, unless you are from an obese batch.  </p>

              <p>1. I dont need to take IIPT so i'm not that sure.</p>
              <p>But i believe there are people who fail IPPT.</p>
              <p>No matter what, i believe it should not fall outside the 3mths.</p>
              <p>Most units are crappy...anyway IPPT doesnt affect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. If you OOT or down/up PES, then you will need to do a BMT re-course.</p>

              <p>They will post u to a UNIT. And maybe there , if its a combat unit, u have to pass yr IPPT from the start, Difference is that others who passed  during BMT will only have to take it one year later.</p>

              <p>1. if the NSF has to go for RE-BMT at the end of NS life , only if he is physically fit and he has OOC @ the start of BMT. Mindef will have note that these people have not completed BMT and send them again 2-3 months before ORD</p>

              <p>Not specified mar, generally biscuits are not allowed, but then it also depends on the CSM and OC. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>That is why last time my BMT all my PC and PS said the same thing, don't feed the ah pui next door. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>
              <p>And don't so bad la, people think that they cannot pass IPPT you straight away think that they are going to enter the obese batch... I failed my IPPT all the way till my last IPPT in BMT.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> So TS, don't need to worry der, just work hard. </p>

              <p>The intake this week is PES A/B direct BMT and not obese intake.</p>
              <p>This means that TS PASSED his IPPT within the past year and hes just worried what will happen should he fail since its common that alot of ppl slack and stop training after they pass their IPPT.</p>
