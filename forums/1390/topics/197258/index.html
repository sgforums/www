            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Guys,wondering if I should work towards specialising in a Defense Studies Degree which covers Military History, Modern Warfare, Tactics etc. as I'm interested in signing on as an officer with the SAF.<br><br>However,I have certain fears that if I can't perform well and  I might be booted out of the SAF or early retirement for officer being 45 and still got like 10yrs to go before getting any money from CPF. So am thinking that maybe I should take a business degree,such as Marketing or something as I'm currently a Business student in poly. Because to me, though being passionate and highly interested in all things military, the very real problem of whether I'm being able to put food on the table also counts. Thus, I need some advice on whether it is wise to get a Defense Degree, as there's no use for it in the coporate world...unless they want me to come out with tactics by Clausewitz,Napoleon or Sun Tzu or should I come study in a Business degree?</div>
