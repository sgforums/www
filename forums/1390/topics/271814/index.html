I dunno if they still have it there since the floating platform is used;<br>AND THE FOOD IS GREAT</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Didn't know there's so many 21SA alumni here ~lol~<br><br>Khatib Camp quite schizo. The SOA/HQ SA side forever regimented, especially during course time (marching point to point) &amp;, most exceptionally, when OCS cadets are around (super-seow on). But the ARTC side completely laid-back, &amp; quite ulu when no reservist ICT. KTSC, a big logistics unit, is also there &amp; their storemen, not surprisingly, kept a low profile.<br><br>Every day, after 4pm, the Stadium takes on a fitness-park look with footballers &amp; runners turning up &amp;, of course, the FCC opens shop for the reservists doing RT. Throughout the day, helicopters fly all over the shop too cuz Sembawang Air Base is nearby.<br><br>23SA used to occupy the ARTC building (opposite the SOA one), so the old-timers used to have it worse with the regimentation. Most just siamed the front side (except when sending arms on the ground floor), but the back side is built on a slope so a 5-storey building becomes a 7-storey one just to get to the garage!<br><br>I can't remember if the unit has since shifted to the ex-SADA building or the old SAF Boys School one. The latter place can be quite secluded: has its own road from the front gate, hence little contact with the rest of the camp. The ex-SADA one, on the other hand, is behind SOA &amp; used to complain all the time that reservists anyhow parked their cars in their territory!<br><br>The "Honour &amp; Passion" TV clips at Youtube has some Khatib Camp scenes, no sure how much you can orientate yourself. Oh yeah, doing night guard-duty there was terrible; plenty of turnouts &amp; BOS spot checks. The front of the camp gate is an accident magnet too, so be careful whenever you're driving in or riding in.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Actually, life as a signaler in an arty unit is quite eng one... mostly just need to setup the signal sets that's all. </blockquote>Changed so much, meh? 23SA still FH2000, right? I've trained with both the 120mm SP mortar (active) &amp; the 155mm howitzer (reservist) -- &amp; can say that signallers served similar functions in both units.<br><br>To TS: If you're new to Arty, basically your unit appointment is already decided upon posting there (based on your course results, which actually made sense in my own experience). But you may be able to get your BC to change yours during the first, "acclimatization" interview, so take heed of the following.<br><br>In my time, 20-plus of the signallers would learn the Arty stuff more or less, &amp; always on the fly. The remaining 6-8 were the "eng" ones as mentioned, basically glorified runners for their commanders but who, however, could be redeployed again to essential comms jobs during reservist.<br><br>Of the first group, about 16 were operational appointments, spread across 4 batteries (3 line units &amp; one BN level). Used to really pity them, cuz their vocation pay was only half as the Arty-trained (under the old system) &amp; yet must do the same stuff. As for the degree of the Arty cross-training involved, I'll break them down in this decreasing order:<br><br>- the R&amp;S signallers would've learn the most, as part of a small vanguard party that must always prepare the ground before the main body arrived. (But I know the SAF has bought some new surveying equipment, so the physical exertions might not be as siong as before, let alone in Lee Hsien Loong's time.)<br><br>- next were the FSO signallers, cuz they're supposed to accompany the FSOs on INF exercises or wargame center. For "internal" exercises, they might help out the recce teams or do OP instead. Take note, Pes Bs: FSO teams can be attached out to join Brunei jungle-taining! But reservist Arty units have no FSOs or FOs; these would be part of SIR units instead.<br><br>- followed by the BC signallers, which actually had an ops role but not frequently tested, &amp; thus their whole group (inc. the officer) tended to gabra a lot. FYI The BTY 2ICs are operationally the "BC"; they're NSFs &amp; will command the BTYs during reservist. The active-time BTY BCs are operationally the "FSO", usually army regulars or scholars.<br><br>- the last were the FDC/CP signallers, who won't be calling fire missions but a grueling life if they completely bo-chap &amp; just man the signal set. That said, those in 155mm unit quite switch-off (a lot bring along novels into the field) compared to 120mm one (18 mortars instead of 12 guns; triple the deployments cuz 2km from frontline instead of 20km back; &amp; arguably ten times the vehicular maintainence).<br><br>Each battery line would also get about 2 linemen from the excess signallers, while the BN level also had an official Line Party. These guys were often on their own in the field, checking or reeling back the comms wire, so it was in their interest to know how an Arty deployment worked.</div>
