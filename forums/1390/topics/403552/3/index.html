              <p>Apparantly, someone from plat 4 brought in pork. That evening, the whole plat 4 came down to bath... Someone was sitting on the wall in their toilet. The same description as everyone. long hair, white dress. And the sun had bearly setted yet and the sky is still bright blue...</p>
              <p>Did not go up to witness since I still got weeks there so no point scaring myself and unable to sleep.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- I kept finding long strains of hair on my bed... like 15 cm and longer... who had long hair in tekong huh? You do the maths and you will know.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- On the second night of my BMT, my bunk mate saw someone in full battle order inside the bunk just standing in front of the opposite bed and looking at him...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- My friend actually saw the famous jacob ladder lady when he was doing guard duty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Another friend saw a very beautiful litted stone house on the opposite hill in the middle of the night when training over there... When they pass by the place again in the morning, it was no longer there...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Another friend left his patrol buddy behind when they were resting. One guy took a nap, the other two saw white figure moving towards them... Tried waking the other person but did not manage so they left him behind...</p>
