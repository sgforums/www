              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>My 1st post here. I would like to know the procedures to disrupt my NS for studying medicine overseas. I'm going to ord next year May. I've call the hotline and the lady says i need to serve a minimum of 24 months but my service period is only 22 months.</p>
              <p>My medicine term start feb next year. What's my likelihood of having a disruption?</p>
              <p><br>Thanks!<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/bigsmile.png" alt="bigsmile.png"></p>

              <p>ask your Chief Clerk, if they are unsure of, they can email to the relevant person in charge to find out one what.</p>
              <p>just try asking this coming Monday.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Because disruption also need to be approved one. Not like tml you fly liao today you go disrupt.</p>

              <p>According to the last directive i read when i applied for disruption, you are only allowed to disrupt after a minimum of 22 months of service and ONLY if you are going to enter university with the same batch of enlistees. This in a way simply means that only people who ORD in the 2nd intake Apr/Oct can disrupt after 22 months to enter uni together with the people who ORD in Jan/June but people in the earlier batch is not allowed to disrupt has that will allow them to enter uni as it would be unfair to the rest from the 2nd batch.</p>
              <p>Since you ORD in May, you will belong to the Jul enlist batch which is unlikely to be allowed for exemption according to that directive. Exemption might be granted if you are from JC and happened to miss the Jan/Apr intake for some reason but no if you are a poly student.</p>
              <p>Allowing you to join a course starting in Feb will be an unfair advantage over others who enlist in Sept. Disruption is only allowed mainly for people who happened to get enlisted in the 2nd batch not have to wait another year to enter uni just because they were enlisted later.</p>

              <p>Â </p>
              <p>correct. there is now this "staggered disruption timeframe" system with the ns period reduced to 22 or 24 mths compared to the last time 30months ns.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>in effect is the maximumÂ use of onlyÂ 5 official days of ur annual leave to block out the last week of ur ord weekÂ and take ic early.</p>

              <p><br>always always take and read the latest GOM/directives... at the beginning of the directives it will state that,Â e.g. "this directive updates directive no.Â 88/2007Â and <strong>supercedes its relevant instructions.</strong>"</p>
