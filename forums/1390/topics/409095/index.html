              <p><strong>Those who require exit permit of 2 years or longer will
              be required to furnish a bond. This bonding requirement is similar
              to the current arrangement where security in the form of Banker's
              Guarantee must be furnished. The amount of the security bond is
              S$75,000 or 50% of the combined gross annual income of both parents
              for the preceding year, whichever is higher. The monetary bond
              requirement for male citizens who accompany their parents on
              overseas employment may be waived and they be bonded by deed with
              two sureties.</strong></p>

              <p><span><strong>Why must MINDEF impose exit controls on NS-liable
              males?</strong><br> <br> Exit controls are necessary to ensure that NS-liable males who have
              gone overseas to study or reside at a young age return to fulfil
              their NS responsibilities.<br> <br> <strong>Will young males aged 13 to 16.5 who fail to apply for an
              exit permit be sentenced to imprisonment?</strong><br> <br> The penalty for exit permit offences of young males aged 13 to 16.5
              will be a fine of up to $2,000, with no custodial sentences. They
              will however be subjected to harsher penalties should they continue
              to breach of the Enlistment Act after age 16.5.<br> <br> Males above 16.5 years who travel and remain overseas without
              applying for an exit permit would have committed an offence under
              the Enlistment Act. They will be liable upon conviction to a fine
              of up to $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years

              <p>Those who are liable to serve national service but refuse are
              charged under the Enlistment Act. If convicted, they face three
              years' imprisonment and a fine of S$10,000.</p>
              <p>Controversy arose when the penalties were increased in January
              2006 after <a title="Melvyn Tan" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvyn_Tan">Melvyn
              Tan</a>, who was born in Singapore, received a fine for defaulting

              later acquired British nationality. In <a title="Parliament of Singapore" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore">parliament</a>, Defence Minister <a title="Teo Chee Hean" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teo_Chee_Hean">Teo Chee Hean</a> provided some illustration of the

              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the default period exceeds two years but the defaulter is
              young enough to serve his full-time and operationally ready NS
              duties in full, MINDEF will press for a short jail sentence.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot serve his
              full-time NS in a combat vocation or fulfil his operationally ready
              NS obligations in full, a longer jail sentence to reflect the
              period of NS he has evaded may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot be called
              up for NS at all, a jail sentence up to the maximum of three years
              may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Each year, a small number of people are convicted for their

              they are usually held in a low-security detention facility and
              separated from other conscription offenders. The government does

              <p>Aiyah, the problem is, my son is <em>smart.</em> The reason why I bring him to America in first place.</p>
              <p>You hear of vandwelling or not? If you have, then nearly impossible to find him already lor. He also apply for US citizenship. Headache. Also, I suspect he got illegal documentation. Did I also tell you that this was a long time plan-ahead? He had been planning to run away the moment he turn 18 since three years ago. Kena saved I think 10k and ran off.</p>
              <p>I want to sue him, but how to sue if I don't know where he is, especially when he got no address.</p>
              <p>Because he is smart, he not doing drugs or alcohol. I suspect he will survive for long time. Sigh...</p>
              <p>How can I pay for my son's bullshit. Is not based on my son not on me?</p>

              <p>That's y i ask TS the question in my previous post, he seems not clear on what he WILL DO when he gets hold of his son.</p>
              <p>Ask him come back to SG serve his NS?</p>
              <p>Ask him for 75k in lieu of coming back SG to serve NS?</p>
              <p>Latter seems to be more probable though. Since his son's running away, indicates that he do not wanna serve NS.</p>

              <p>I want my son to learn discipline, and to become a man. I want him to learn to respect authority, since young has always hit head against wall.</p>
              <p>I don't want just 75k back, although now it is priority. I want him to serve and respect his country.</p>
              <p>Before you criticize me, ask yourself. If your son run away with 75,000 dollars, how you feel? Of course you want to get your money back lah!</p>
              <p>Now, some thing I need to address.</p>
              <p>Do I get bond back when son come or after son does NS? If I get it when son come back, maybe even sneaking him off Singapore could be possible.</p>

              <p>looks like you didn't teach your son values...</p>
              <p>never mistake intelligence for wisdom...</p>
              <p>actually, if my son ran off like that, the $75k would be the last thing on my mind.. it would be the shame of having a worthless, self-centred, asswipe of a son.. and how something this terrible happened...</p>
              <p>if you have other children, you better start doing some soul searching to figure out what went wrong and not repeat this again...</p>
              <p>cut your son loose.. take the $75k as a hard lesson learnt...</p>
              <p>or maybe your thinking only about the $75k is the reason why he ran?</p>

              <p>Do you even have children? Or, is your son just naturally obedient?</p>
              <p>If teaching values was so easy, would have done long ago liao. You think so easy ah? Just cane cane cane and the children will grow up good?</p>
              <p>What is on your mind is not what is on my mind. Idk if my son is a selfish worthless asswipe. What Ik about is that it does not involve me. Because I have already tried my best. No point in doing anymore.</p>
              <p>You ask what went wrong? Why ask me? Ask my son you sotong. Maybe you will say differently when YOUR son run off.</p>
              <p>Cut my son off is not easy when you lose enough money to go college. Thing is, I need my 75k. You think wat? 75k can be earned in one day ah? If can, I millionarre already.</p>
              <p>Now, someone answer my question. Security bond recieved before NS or after NS?</p>

              <p>You do not decide what "should" be or what is not, my dear friend. You are not God. It is not as if 75k is a small amount of money. It is a huge amount of money, and if there is a way to get it back without forcing my son to go to NS, I will take it.</p>
