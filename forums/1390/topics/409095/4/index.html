              <p>Reading through this thread, I can say this much:</p>
              <p>Cranere, I know it really sucks big time to have a son who ran off without handling his responsibilities as both a son and a citizen of Singapore. And I can understand that it sucks that you had to bear the consequences of your son's actions, which in this case is a very hefty $75,000 down the drain.</p>
              <p>However, the fact is that since you had agreed to sign the bond, the responsibility is entirely yours to make sure your son actually comes back to perform his duty. Don't bother trying to blame the system or anything if he doesn't - the onus is entirely on you to make sure that he comes back so as to not screw you of your $75k. If you had known your son a little better and known that he was a flight risk, you should not have put that bond up. So maybe you should be asking yourself instead - <em>Did I really know my son all that well?</em></p>
              <p>And as mancha has pointed out, these points you made are quite suspicious:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1) Who is responsible for the policies regarding NS?</span></em></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2) Is the NS necessary in this era? Do we really stand a chance against other countries even with such NS policies?</span></em></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3) Has the NS really have been protecting us, not our geographical, economical, and democratical position?</span></em></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Same as mancha, I smell Speaker's Corner nonsense in these points. At the very least, these points are wholly incompatible with what you said at the beginning about the role of NS in inculcating discipline in your son. Certainly that in itself is a worthy reason for doing National Service.</p>
              <p>That said, everyone, without pointing any fingers at any particular party, <strong>please keep this discussion civil before I start flexing my moderator muscle</strong>.</p>

              <p>Given TS's moaning and griping about the system in here, it's no surprise his son has such a negative attitude towards NS.</p>
              <p>Seriously, it's just 2 years in green, in my time we didn't even have the full service cut yet and I served 2 years, 2 months, some of my friends did more.</p>
              <p>Also it's not a waste of time, it's what you make of it. Seriously it was a time where I got a chance to do plenty of things I never got the chance to do before. I handled firearms, lived in the forest, learnt how to kick butt, made improvised explosive devices, rappelled inverted, roped from helicopters, crossed muddy rivers, got stung half crazy by all kinds of weird insects and even killed a snake once. It's not all a bed of roses but seriously it isn't like its some Soviet gulag or something. You don't get to do all that in boring normal Singapore.</p>
              <p>I am just speculating but it seems that you somehow failed in raising your son to be a man, teaching him value like integrity and honour you seem to have raised him up with a huge sense of entitlement, as if the world owes him a living. Don't even talk about NS, this kind of attitude will haunt him the rest of his life.</p>

              <p>Also to the jokers who think that NS for Singapore is not necessary, they best study a bit of the local geopolitics in the region.</p>
              <p>Do you think Singapore would have gotten a proper deal in the past few decades with stuff such as buying water and what have you not if we didn't have a credible military? Also, while I hope the best for our neighbors be wary of the day an extremist government takes over and suddenly decides that the little red dot ought to be part of the territory as well.</p>
              <p>Seems far fetched? Don't forget not too long ago Indonesia wanted to absorb both us and Malaysia. GG if the British didn't give two hoots back then.  </p>

              <p>You're such a sad fuck loser local university farmer I pity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyone can go to the US with the money but only the top tier intelligent elite can make it into the world's top universities which are located ALL AND ONLY in the US and UK. I think less than 5 people or fewer in farmer university NUS's supposedly best course medicine can get a place in any of the top universities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I bet a sua ku loser frog in the well like you have no idea that only 3 to 5 Singaporeans make it to MIT every year, 1-2 Singaporeans can get a place in Harvard and less than 5 in any of the lower Ivies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only 5 to 7 Singaporeans on average can get a place in Columbia arts school and that's just a <strong>lower</strong> Ivy (the Ivy league has lower and higher classes) and <strong>just</strong> their arts school, not even its most selective departments like law.</p>
              <p>All the local law undergrads I know in the local unis were rejected by Columbia, not law but its arts school. Isn't it such a joke? when Singapore's arts and social science department is actually a dumping ground and nobody in its "best" department can even get a place in an average department of a top university? I bet you didn't know that. Don't think even 3 or 5% of NUS's 250 med students can get a place in Cambridge medicine. There are almost 400 local law students and almost all are rejects of PSC scholarships (many didn't get a single offer, even from the low rung private scholarships like SPH which nobody in the top tier wants) or HYPSM's art schools. All this is actual statistics based on people around me I know who applied to various places and tried for various scholarships after their A levels.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A thick-skinned ignorant farmer like you should either talk to more people outside of your riff-raff ignorant circle or shut up lah. </p>

              (Hint: No.) Besides your feelings, have I clearly been blaming my
              son? (Hint: Yes.) And based on the above three questions, does it
              show that the government has a part in this? (Hint: Yes.)</p>
              <p>Then, keep your mouth shut.</p>
              <p>Now, you have betrayed a huge lack of intelligence by
              accrediting personality to genetics. First, have you heard of
              nurture? Second, have you heard of psychology? Third, have you
              heard of Science? No? I don't blame you. After all, stupidity isn't

              <p>Yeah, blah blah blah, I deserve it. Not my son. Not the
              government. Ha Ha Ha. Alright. Then if you run away, your father
              deserves it. After all, let's blame the father for your
              irresponsible action. After all, it is his fault for bringing you
              up incorrectly. Yeah, everything the child does is the parent's
              fault. Nothing to do with the child, because it is the parent's
              responsibility to bring them up well. Hell, blame the child for
              killing his dad. It's not the child's fault for killing the dad,
              it's the dad for not bringing him up properly. Yeah, well done
              mature and intelligent Singaporeans. You sure are worthy of
              respect.</p>
              <p>Now, have I said anywhere that I will sue the government? Do you

              <p>If you want to just yell and howl - go to chao chu kang cemetry and yell all you want.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Frankly the only way is to find your son and get him back to singapore.</p>
              <p>1) hunt him down in USA.</p>
              <p>2) trick him back to Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only way your son will let down his guard is you pretend to have overcome your anger and accept the fact. He may let you know his whereabout. If he is illegally there make things easiler - once knowing his where about, get legal authorities to arrest him and deport him !!! haha report him as suspect terrorist even if you have to !!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If not then you pretend to die of anger and left him with decent amount of money !!! see if he dumb enough to come back for you to arrest him.</p>

              <p>wait a minute..</p>
              <p>if the TS is not in contact with his son, how could he even know if his son is alive or dead? the US is full or murders activities. what if TS's son is raped in the ass then murdered, or he suicide there or being asian, beaten up by racist there till dead? </p>
              <p>Obviously the TS is only thinking about money. he's not even worried if his son is still alive. If im the father, money is a big problem, but my son's life is even more precious then money. Even if my son's like shit, always cause me trouble, just flashback to the time when u make him.. How fun it was, and that child is considered the memories of u and ur wife having fun making him.</p>
              <p>have u guys ever think of this?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ps: looks like 3 mnths had pass since the last reply was made.. but still, after reading about all this, i have to say something.</p>

              <p>Anyone here sees this the way i do?</p>
              <p>TS is acctually the so called "son"</p>
              <p>Judging by his language, content of his arguement (is there still a need for NS in this modern day?) and probably immaturity. It just dont sound right coming from a grown man who has gone through NS and fathered an 18 yr old son.</p>
              <p>Besides, his main concern was over the money, $75k. Im sure money wouldnt be the top priority on my mind if i were the father right now even if the money meant something to me. Dissappointment and possibly fear for my son's future will definitely top the list. Hence, its probably the so called "son" trying to find a way to skip NS without losing the 75k bond money.</p>
              <p>I may be wrong and baseless but just my 2 cents worth. :)</p>

              <p>You're such a sad fuck loser local university farmer I pity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyone can go to the US with the money but only the top tier
              intelligent elite can make it into the world's top universities
              which are located ALL AND ONLY in the US and UK. I think less than
              5 people or fewer in farmer university NUS's supposedly best course
              medicine can get a place in any of the top universities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I bet a sua ku loser frog in the well like you have no idea that
              only 3 to 5 Singaporeans make it to MIT every year, 1-2
              Singaporeans can get a place in Harvard and less than 5 in any of
              the lower Ivies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only 5 to 7 Singaporeans on average can get a place in Columbia
              arts school and that's just a <strong>lower</strong> Ivy (the Ivy
              league has lower and higher classes) and <strong>just</strong> their arts school, not even its most selective departments like
              law.</p>
              <p>All the local law undergrads I know in the local unis were
              rejected by Columbia, not law but its arts school. Isn't it such a
              joke? when Singapore's arts and social science department is
              actually a dumping ground and nobody in its "best" department can
              even get a place in an average department of a top university? I
              bet you didn't know that. Don't think even 3 or 5% of NUS's 250 med
              students can get a place in Cambridge medicine. There are almost
              400 local law students and almost all are rejects of PSC
              scholarships (many didn't get a single offer, even from the low
              rung private scholarships like SPH which nobody in the top tier
              wants) or HYPSM's art schools. All this is actual statistics based
              on people around me I know who applied to various places and tried
              for various scholarships after their A levels.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A thick-skinned ignorant farmer like you should either talk to
              more people outside of your riff-raff ignorant circle or shut up

              <p>I'm in the University of Pennsylvania, there are about 60 of us Singaporeans (both grad students and undergrad students) here, not including those doing exchange program from sg universities. From what i know, there's way more Singaporeans in the ivy league schools than you have mentioned, a lot of them are in Cornell.</p>

              <p>Singapore's top JCs are, as Quoted by Times during one of their special reports on Asian educations, "Ivy League production factories", compare to any decent american high school, RJC had WAY more Ivy League acceptant. and thats not counting Public Ivys(UC berk, UC LA etc) and Ox-bridge. i am no scholar, i do question our education system, but hell one thing it does produce is people that can study lol.<br><br>What are you doing at Upenn anyway?</p>

              <p>sorry guys, please forget replying this guy. Any body in the right mind will not come to the forum to ask for this advice. He should be calling the related agency to consult his problem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However if its a real case, as one of the forumer mention, I dont think he can survive without legal ways to find a job. Unless he is super good, which I doubt given he is cos might be at most a fresh guaduate given with his age. Why I know this.... cos I am here in the states. Kaoz, its not easy to keep a job for the local, not to say foreigner.</p>
              <p>so if u guys have more time to spend arguing, then by all means reply to his post....</p>
