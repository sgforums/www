              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>I don't know what documents or visa status your son is holding in the states side. Other than married to an American to quickly get a PR status the other alternative is to hold a employment visa H1B1.  Or the final express way is to joint the US Army or Marine to fight in Afghanistan for 12 months to be a citizen soldier.</p>
              <p>Immigration thru employment visa can last for years as it needs to go thru labor certification. At the current rate of unemployment in states side certification is not easy.</p>
              <p>If he is "out of status" over stayed he will need to engage an attorney to get it reinstated more likely he needs to leave the country and returned back to the US. If he is denial entry at the border the only way for him is to return back to Singapore.</p>
              <p>If he buy into a social security and a fake driver license if he is Caught he than is a Federal felony of identity thief that would deny him from any chances of immigrating to the United States.</p>
              <p>So......</p>
              <p>If you can get contact of him please tell him career opportunity for this next decade will be in Asia return back to serve National Service and get into a job get the experiences before going returning back to States side.</p>
              <p>He is still young. He is a smart person to think for himself.  </p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gedanken:</div>
              <div class="quote_body"><blockquote>
              <p>Since you ask, yes, yes, yes and yes. </p>
              <p>For the first two questions, I spent years working in the
              juvenile justice system with kids who had records of crimes such as
              car theft, burglary and assault, and rehabilitating them. 
              Rest assured that your kid's nothing compared to the ones I built a
              professional reputation of dealing with - you ain't seen smart till
              you've seen an 11-year-old get past a car alarm like it was never
              installed. Hate to burst your bubble, but that PSLE score ain't
              nothing special in the real world, booster.</p>
              <p>After that, I quit and went corporate, which leads to the third
              point.  My clients make multi-million dollar decisions based
              upon my analysis and advice - it's not a job for fly-
              by-nighters.</p>
              <p>For the last point, I have never scored anything below 135 on
              test batteries such as the Weschler or Stanford-Binet scales - I'd
              go into standards of deviation above the mean but that might hurt
              your head.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Huh. So professional juvenile guy brags about his high IQ test scores, experience with youthful idiots, and how my kid is nothing compared to the foster guys that you can't adopt. Stop whining. Besides the fact that you don't have a son, or wish you sorely do, you aren't fooling me. First, evidence. Show evidence for your super genuis 11 year-old who got through a fire alarm. Can't? Then I label it bullshit.</p>
              <p>Second, your exxageration for your experience and job doesn't impress me either. Yeah, you're great, and yeah, you're really smart, but unless you provide evidence for you who are (pfft, would someone like <em>you</em> go on a forum?), everything you say is cock.</p>
              <p>Third, IQ scores does not equal intelligence. Yeah, sorry to burst your bubble, but you're not as smart as you think you are. Want proof? Sure.</p>
              <p>http://www.audiblox2000.com/dyslexia_dyslexic/dyslexia014.htm</p>
              <p>Proof that your high income actually betrays low IQ? Sure.</p>
              <p>http://www.halfsigma.com/2006/07/higher_intellig.html</p>
              <p>http://elearningtech.blogspot.com/2007/04/correlation-between-iq-and-net-worth.html</p>
              <p>Your "high" job position does not impress me, neither does your pride in your IQ score. The fact that you have pride in your IQ score just betrays an unstable ego, and an arrogant mind-set.</p>
              <p>And, if you actually think I would fall for your self-praise makes me think of you as stupid. Sure, go ahead and cry to the world how awesome you are.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>And here you are, whining about your 75 grand and threatening to
              sue your son and sic the cops on him.  Hoo.  Rah.</p>
              <p>You can try to justify it any way you want and make all manner
              of excuses.  The current state of play itself reflects how
              desperately you're trying to fool yourself.</p>
              <p>Oh, I see.  So because you claim the other party doesn't
              keep its deals, it's perfectly all right for you to not keep
              yours?</p>
              <p>NOBODY forced you to put up the bond - you chose to do it and
              now you are looking to worm your way out of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> decision.  That's
              irresponsible, plain and simple.</p>
              <p>Still epic fail.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I see you are avoiding my correction of your poor english usage. Instead of making a counter-argument to the definition of a deal, you are whining and reverting the blame to me. Thus, I conclude you are supid.</p>
              <p>First, the "you can justify and make excuses" accusation only shows that you <em>can't </em>say anything against my previous argument because I'm right. Yeah, I'm a fool, but I'm a witty fool. The problem with you is that you're an idiot.</p>
              <p>Second, if the other party doesn't keep it's deals, what is the other party? Plain and simple. A hypocrite. And your definition of "keeping the deal" is irrelevant, because as I have addressed previously, a deal is only a deal on the terms. Not the results, idiot.</p>
              <p>Third, another unoriginal repeat of your second argument. If all you care about is stupid values, then shut up. NOBODY forced me, but you see, I was forced to give the money. If nobody forced me, would I give up the money? Idiot.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>No, I don't judge, I conclude - the facts as you have presented
              them point squarely to your irresponsibility.</p>
              <p>The fact that I can post on the forum simply means that when my
              clients agree to pay three and a half grand a day for my
              professional time and then hold up the process, I can chill instead
              of getting my knickers in a twist slogging like some poor slob.</p>
              <p>Lemme lay it out for you, sunshine.  I've been there and
              done that - if there's a stunt to be pulled I've seen it. 
              I've had my fair share of wins and losses with the scars to go with
              it all, and sport, you've been had in the biggest way possible.</p>
              <p>Now I have to take my hat off to you for coming into a place
              full of strangers and admitting that you've been right buttfucked
              by your boy - that takes a certain kind of gumption.</p>
              <p>Or stupidity.  Take your pick because I really don't
              care.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Hah! Conclude? Bullshit. The facts that you have taken is relative to your own "smart" reception. <em>You </em>have taken the facts wrongly. The fact that you can post on a forum and your "high-tier job" is irrelevant, because most likely your talk is bullshit.</p>
              <p>Let <em>me </em>lay it down for you kid, your stunts mean nothing if you don't do it. If you are so big, then get my kid back. Your eleven-year old genuis has no correlation to you if he's the one that does it. You're not the one that can get through a car alarm so shut it. I don't care about your masochistic bragging if you can't back it up. So stop your cock and do something.</p>
              <p>Now, I have to take my hat off to a profound mix of ignorance and stupidity. Though you haven't admitted anything, I conclude that you are stupid. Screw the facts, you have cited no facts to begin with,</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The fact of the matter is that you're rightfully angry at
              getting screwed proper, but you're just being childish in trying to
              take it out on folks who have sweet fuck-all to do with your
              predicament.  After all, if they had anything to do with it,
              wouldn't you be going after them for your 75 grand?</p>
              <p>So grow up, be a man and deal with the loss of your cash without
              being a drama queen and going after people who had no part in 
              the loss of your wad.</p>
              <p>Sheesh.</p>
              </blockquote></div>
              <p>No, I'm not going after people who don't have part in the loss of my wad, I'm going after people who are stupid, like you. Just as your opinion of me is childish, I think you are childish. Yeah, it's okay to play the victim. After all, stupidity is a condition that in inherited. Not my fault you're stupid.</p>
              <p>Geez, you're a man? I thought you were a pussy. Then again, I learn new things everyday.</p>

              <p>Edit: I just read your last post, and am officially disgusted
                                      with you.</p>
              <p>It's clear that it was your son that is irresponsible and of
                                      poor character, but not only do you doggedly refuse to face up to
                                      that, while desperate to reclaim your lost money which was only
                                      lost because of your son's dishonour and irresponsibility (probably
                                      inherited from you), you now try to blame the government. LoL.</p>
              <p>I was appalled to see you even had the gall to post some stupid
                                      temasekreview link to support your claims that it was the system
                                      that wronged you, and not your ill-bred and immoral son of bad
                                      character.<br> <br> It's super clear where your son got all his irresponsible,
                                      dishonorable and unreliable character traits from! It was from you.
                                      Even if he didn't genetically inherit them from you, he must have
                                      mimicked you over the years back in Singapore.<br> <br> You deserve it 100%. I hope you try to sue the govt (like the fired
                                      SLA nutjob employee bitch who accuses the civil service of
                                      "sloppiness" but is sueing to desperately have a job in the civil
                                      service LOL), join the opposition party lunatics like Uncle Yap and
                                      eventually get admitted into IMH like them.<br> <br> p/s: you may also want to know that while intelligence is highly
                                      prized by society and has rewarded many a great people with high IQ
                                      financially, it's only intelligent people with honour that go the
                                      long haul and eventually reach the apex. Your son with his

                                      look-everywhere-to-blame dad will not last long before he gets

              </blockquote>
              <p>Alright, let me lay the facts clear in front of you, twit.</p>
              <p>1) Who is responsible for the policies regarding NS?</p>
              <p>2) Is the NS necessary in this era? Do we really stand a chance against other countries even with such NS policies?</p>
              <p>3) Has the NS really have been protecting us, not our geographical, economical, and democratical position?</p>
              <p>If you can't answer the above questions, shut it. Like the above, you aren't impressing anybody.</p>
              <p>Now, appealing to your disgust, do I care about your feelings? (Hint: No.) Besides your feelings, have I clearly been blaming my son? (Hint: Yes.) And based on the above three questions, does it show that the government has a part in this? (Hint: Yes.)</p>
              <p>Then, keep your mouth shut.</p>
              <p>Now, you have betrayed a huge lack of intelligence by accrediting personality to genetics. First, have you heard of nurture? Second, have you heard of psychology? Third, have you heard of Science? No? I don't blame you. After all, stupidity isn't bred so it's not your fault, right?</p>
              <p>Yeah, blah blah blah, I deserve it. Not my son. Not the government. Ha Ha Ha. Alright. Then if you run away, your father deserves it. After all, let's blame the father for your irresponsible action. After all, it is his fault for bringing you up incorrectly. Yeah, everything the child does is the parent's fault. Nothing to do with the child, because it is the parent's responsibility to bring them up well. Hell, blame the child for killing his dad. It's not the child's fault for killing the dad, it's the dad for not bringing him up properly. Yeah, well done mature and intelligent Singaporeans. You sure are worthy of respect.</p>
              <p>Now, have I said anywhere that I will sue the government? Do you know English? No? Yeah, you're an idiot. Everything else is irrelevant and bullshit.</p>

                                      irresponsible action. After all, it is his fault for bringing you
                                      up incorrectly. Yeah, everything the child does is the parent's
                                      fault. Nothing to do with the child, because it is the parent's
                                      responsibility to bring them up well. Hell, blame the child for
                                      killing his dad. It's not the child's fault for killing the dad,

              <p>Sure, <em>now </em>you play the victim? Yeah, you can't do anything about it, so shut your mouth and admit your worthlessness and that your "conclusions" are bullshit, pussy.</p>

              <p>It's an agreement. If your son runs away from Singapore and does not come back, the 75k Security bond is gone. Simple as that.  </p>
              <p>You agreed to it, you paid and signed for it stating that you understand the terms and conditions of this bond - your son doesn't come back, you lose your money. You understood prior to this that you will be clearly paying for your son's "shit' if he doesn't come back. If you don't agree to it or have not understood you would not have signed and paid this bond.</p>
              <p>It's hilarious to me now, that all you are trying to do is to blame the system that makes you lose your money, questioning the purpose, the validity of this bond and saying the system is unfair to you. </p>
              <p>It's even more hilarious when you are pushing all the blame to your child, stating that it's all his fault - saying juvenile things like suing him to get your money back.</p>
              <p>You are just sore because you have<strong> lost your money.</strong> Nothing else.</p>
              <p>Just says so much about yourself, and how your child has turned out to be. An utter failure. Why do other parents NOT have problems with their child and why do YOU have such problems. <br><br>People judge you. Yes, and I'm judging you now. When almost everyone in this thread  share the same sentiments and impression about you, clearly, it's true about you. No point denying and rebutting back, trying to say it's not you. </p>

              <p>If you were such a good father, your son would not have severed all ties with you and not keep in contact. There were cases where sons ran away and did not come back. They did i so that they do not have to serve national service.</p>
              <p>What differs from you and them is that they kept in contact with their relatives and loved ones, and happenings back in Singapore.</p>
              <p>In many years on Sgforums and people I know personally, some regretted their actions when they found out that their loved ones have passed on, but they can't take a step back into Singapore to pay their last respects. </p>

George W. Casey Jr. swore 32 recruits into the service Wednesday, and half of them enlisted through a new program for non-citizens with special skills.<br><br>The group included 16 recruits who are part of the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest, or MAVNI program. MAVNI seeks to give individuals from other countries the opportunity to gain citizenship through joining the U.S. Army.<br><br>MAVNI allows non-resident aliens with special skills who are legally in the United States to enlist in the Army. (Resident aliens - persons with green cards - have previously been able to join.) The MAVNI pilot program began Feb. 23 and continues until Dec. 31.<br><br>The pilot program allows men and women with essential language, cultural or technical skills to enlist and possibly gain U.S. citizenship. Although many skill sets are being sought, the majority of recruits under the program thus far possess medical or language skills.<br><br>The New York City Recruiting Battalion is conducting the pilot program for MAVNI and has authority to enlist applicants under the program's strict guidelines. These guidelines include being in legal immigration status, scoring in the upper half of the Army's qualification test and meeting the Army's height and weight standards.<br><br>The MAVNI program has enlisted 52 individuals so far and has more than 2,000 interested applicants.<br><br>"The actions of these men and women epitomize the spirit the President called for in his inaugural address," Gen. Casey said at the Times Square recruiting station.<br><br>President Barack Obama spoke of military members being the "Guardians of our liberty (and those who) embody the spirit of service: a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves." </blockquote></div>

              Is this a blame game? If so, only three options
              
              1) The gahman. for imposing NS.
              
              2) The son. For running away.
              
              3) TS. For AGREEING to impose the bond, with no complains. When shit happens, complains a lot, but never blame himself.

              <p>As far as I know, you're a pussy and an idiot. The fact is, you
                  failed to reply and address any of the points I listed, and thus,
                  your petty insults show nothing but failure for intelligent
                  conversation.</p>
              <p>Here, twit. <em>I</em> lay the facts in front of you.</p>
              <p>Hopefully you are as smart as you think you are, because I'm
                  going to say it very slowly. When I agreed to sign the bond, it was
                  under the condition that I would get it back when my son was
                  enlisted. Now, show that you have an adequete grasp of English.
                  Read: "condition". Get it now? </p>
              <p>Hopefully, if you get it, you will now know that you are
                  mindless idiot droning on the same insult everytime. Who counts?
                  Well, <em>you</em> definitely don't count. I'm sorry, once again,
                  it 's not your fault that you are stupid.</p>
              <p>Sure, <em>now</em> you play the victim? Yeah, you can't do
                  anything about it, so shut your mouth and admit your worthlessness
                  and that your "conclusions" are bullshit, pussy.</p>
              <p>And show me the evidence for your "high IQ" and "high-tier" job.
                  Can't? Then, you have shown yourself to be a real talk cocker.So
                  please, stop your retard thoughts.</p>

              <p>*Yawn*</p>
              <p>There's no reason to address your points because a) they're all bullshit and b) just look how you've been such a crybaby to other people who have addressed your points anyway.  Complete waste of time.</p>
              <p>Which part of "you don't count" do you not understand?  Even if you got on your knees and begged for evidence, I wouldn't waste my time.  Like I said, the people who do count on this forum know the facts and beyond that, whatever losers like you believe doesn't mean a thing to me. </p>
              <p>If you think the vanity-press bullshit you posted is worth wasting my time on, well, boy, you really are a two-bit Mickey Mouse operator.  Never did a degree, did you?  Or are you now going to brag about scraping through third-year undergrad?  Either way, your sadly misguided faith in websites for information broadcasts your ignorance with flashing lights and a siren.  You're well out of your league, booster.</p>
              <p>Speaking of things that you don't understand, which part of "condition" do you not understand?  When you signed, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>you agreed</strong></span> that the money would be the government's til  your brat enlisted.  Your brat didn't enlist and the money is still the government's.  Things are precisely as described in black and white, so where's the problem?</p>
              <p>It's 100% fair so stop being a crybaby.</p>
              <p>By the way, I didn't mean to help with my answers to the questions that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> asked in the first place.  In fact, I'm not here to help at all. </p>
              <p>What I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">am</span> here for is to delight in the hilarity of your public announcement of being arsefucked by your kid, and then your trying to blame NS, the government, your kid and strangers on the Internet for what amounts to nothing other than your own stupidity.  It's always a sidesplitter watching yet another shithead who thinks the responsibilities of fatherhood end once he pulls his dick out of a conveniently available hole, and then scratches his head wondering why his kids don't automatically become Nobel Prize winners for filial piety. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Speaking of convenient holes, what's the missus make of all this?  Or are you no longer talking to her because she doesn't agree that you're 100% blameless? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Anyway, do carry on.  The more you claim that it's everyone else's fault and how you've had to "slog" and nobody knows how smart your kids is and how valiant all of your efforts were and all that other bullshit, the funnier this gets. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>By the way, I've been too busy laughing to mention this, but your kid's now 18, so it's curious why you're bragging about his PSLE results.  Has he done nothing but fuck up for the past six years, or do you not know anything about the brat since your FedEx'd him stateside? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
