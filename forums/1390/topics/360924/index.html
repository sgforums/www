              <p>Hey all. I recently OOC from OCS due to my flat feet problem. Thing is, i received a 3 months excuse RMJ and Lower Limb Activities but no Downpes ( meaning i'd still be PES B). It's been about a month now since i OOC (i OOC'ed on the 4th week in OCS) and till now, there has been no news of my new posting at all but one thing is for sure, i will not be recoursing. I was wondering if anyone here could enlighten me regarding certain questions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Where are the vocations i am likely to end up in considering the fact that i am only a Permanent Resident of Sgpore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Would the fact that i am still under 2 months excuse RMJ/LL mean that i may have to wait 2 batches after mine cause the next batch is coming in real soon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Is there any chance that i may become a storeman which no offence, is not my ideal vocation. (i heard A lvl or equivalent won't become storemen though)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So yeah. Those are the few questions. I really hope those with the knowledge regarding this matter can drop a message or reply cause i'm really in a desperate situation to get out of OCS ASAP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks for reading!</p>

              <p>While you are on status, its unlikely for them to sent you to any combat school for training. If you are revocated anytime before your excuse ends, it might be a logistic side vocation or else you'll be posted to a combat school to do saikang till you can join the training. Logistic side vocations like technician, medic, driver, clerk, storeman are all possible vocations. Vocation and education has little link except people with lower education normally end up in mono combat mono intake but anyone can be a storeman regardless of education.</p>

              <p>As far as I know, you wont be posted to OCS if u specifically state that u do not intend to be a officer during your BMT days. Its obvious you have performed well thats why u can even step into OCS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If u can survive BMT, I dun see why u cant do the same in OCS even though u have flat foot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway now that u OOC, u can only wait for a posting as u already know.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For qns 1) regimental policeman, storeman, armskote, runner and many more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>qns 2) not sure but i guess it doesnt matter, on the day u received your posting, i think your new unit will send someone to fetch u.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ans 3) why u dun want storeman? its quite slack considering u want to OOC.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can tell u, getting OOC from OCS could be one of the bad decision u ever made in your life.</p>

              <p>There are many reasons why OOC (esp from OCS) is a bad decision. Imagine you ooc, got posted to a new unit doing some shit work. Months later, you see your ex-ocs mate posted to the same unit as you and u have to address them as "sir".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those who got ooc had the chance to be a leader but instead let other people lead. How's the feeling going to be?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Outside army, when u ORD, employers tend to hold u in higher regards if u held key appointment in your NS life. Thus increase the chance of u getting hired higher than most.</p>
