Seriously............it's very do-able as long as you've got your groove 'cos the drill requires one to start cold.<br><br>I checked some past timings from a year ago when I sat in a class with this instructor who's full-time job (whether you believe it or not) is to train the FBI's HRT team and he called the following times out (I noted them):<br><br>One shot, down zero, from HIGH ready - 0.90<br>One shot, down zero, from LOW ready - 0.75<br>Splits - anywhere from 0.25 to 0.30 (his splits were 0.15 to 0.20)<br>One shot, drawn from concealment - 1.55<br><br>So, based on these basic numbers, if you take drill # 2 (for example - Double Tap fr Low Ready, 1.35 sec), my goal should be:<br><br>0.75 + 0.30 = 1.05 seconds<br><br>Drill # 3, Rhythm (never heard this term being used); 6 shots at one target:<br><br>0.75 + (0.30 x 5) = 2.25 seconds (which still beats the 3 sec mark)<br><br>The major problem is in Drill # 4; One shot, speed reload, one shot from Low Ready. I never can reload a single stack 45 as fast as I can a double stack mag. If I'm lucky, I'll hit 1.5 seconds.<br><br>All that said, like I've mentioned, if you ain't got your groove for the day, you're screwed. Here's a very good example - in the first video you will see a competitor shoot a stage with 3 targets (2 shots each); the first you have shoot thro' the car (target outside of co-driver side), the 2nd is in front of the car and the 3rd is a swinging target right next to the 1st.<br><br>The reason why I included the 1st vid is becos' you get to see the complete (almost) set-up. The 2nd vid is of myself shooting the stage. Now, before I even shot, I had to mentally calculate how long it was going to take me to shoot this stage. So in my head, I 'see' the following:<br><br>I open truck door, draw and shoot first shot - 2 secs<br>Second shot on 1st target - 0.3 (remember my splits?) secs<br>Transition to 2nd target for first shot - 0.5 secs<br>Second shot on 2nd target - 0.3  secs<br>Transition to 3rd target for first shot - 0.75 secs becos' this is a swinger<br>Second shot on 3rd target - 0.3 secs<br><br>So, in a perfect scenario, I should be able to shoot this stage in a total of 4.15 seconds with 6 shots. Unfortunately, it never is perfect 'cos I shot the last target 3 times to be on the safe side (remember it's a swinger?). And guess what? Total time was 4.14 seconds.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Shotgun:<br>[b]Hmm I guess then everything would turn out to be a very well choreographed dance, (with shooting) ?  </blockquote>Well put. In actual defense, things are different of course but during an offensive situation or in this case, a stage within a match, it is like a choreographing a dance. For most of us, it is a study in the economy of movement. Ever sat thro' a briefing on a raid mission (for example in the SIR, Guards or CDO units)? Speed, surprise, efficient, economy of movement, etc. Same stuff on a larger scale.<br><br><blockquote>[b]Btw, where did u do this shooting at?

Last year it was held in Little Rock, AR. I'm outside of DC (in VA) and being down south, we have a lot of ranges to support the shooting sports. If you are confirmed for the West Coast, let me know and I'll get you some info. There is a former Singaporean on the West Coast who is a well-known gear reviewer. He shoots a lot oand has good contacts too.</div>
