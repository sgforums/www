            <div class='col-md body'>Well,its not the question of right or wrong here.Its more of a question of who walks out of the area alive.And I would say that if during war,I'm engaged by women and children,regardeless of age,I will not hesistate to return fire and kill them.<br>(1)I am a combatant,and they jolly well should have been out of the combat area.<br>(2)They know that in a conflict,any personnel armed and not wearing the same uniform as us is fair game.<br>(3)The moment they pick up arms,they are certain and know what sort of danger they are going to face and will be facing.<br>Its a very simple scenario basically,you don't expect someone not to return fire when fired upon.In fact,in a combat zone,the moment someone levels his weapon at you,I would suggest that you take him/her down immediately rather then let him/her pose a threat to you or your fellow comrades.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Rules of Engagement</strong><br><br>A Hero Should Never Have To Stand Alone<br>What happens if you put two no-sense people together? Get pretty serious right? Put Samuel L Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones in a serious situation and you have a tight thriller. This movie may remind you of Tom Cruise's "A Few Good Men" or even the TV series "JAG". Rest assured, it's a whole new experience.<br><br>Colonel Terry Childers (Samuel L Jackson) headed for the US embassy in Yemen to evacuate the ambassador (Ben Kingsley, in a forgettable role) when the place was under attacked by an angry mob of demonstrators. In the process, Colonel Childers ordered a massacre of the demonstrators whom he claimed they fired shots at the US marines. The conflict was videotaped but the evidence was destroyed by the politicians to prevent another Gulf War. Enters Hays Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones), a second-grade attorney who has never practiced law in court before. Back in the Vietnam, Terry had saved Hays' life and it is time the latter return his favor.<br><br>The director keeps the audience guessing whether Terry had massacred the demonstrators who are actually women and children or had he killed those who happened to arm themselves. A veteran in film-making (The Exorcist, The French Connection), William Friedkin holds the truth up to the very last minute which "What Lies Beneath" should have done. (Blame the trailers!)<br></div>
