              <p>Tut tut.  Are you so weak as to need to run to other people to beg for validation?  It's a hilarious concept that a helpless little shut-in like you would have "friends". <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>You must really have been hurting from that exchange to come back to to this thread after so long.  Then again, you're hopeless at school, you're hopeless in life, so I suppose I have to understand that you have to cling to whatever interactions you have with other people like a drowning - I almost made the mistake of saying "man" - individual.</p>
              <p>I'd suggest that you get a life but it's abundantly obvious that such an endeavour is well beyond your pitiful capabilities.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the clock's ticking.  It's only a matter of time before those lovely blanket parties come your way.  Who knows, someone might find a better use for that mouth of yours after knocking your teeth out.  Enjoy NS.</p>

              <p>Nah I just check my monitored posts every now and then to see if anyone replied to my comments. And oh dear, I'm afraid I have friends and if you assume that everyone you decide to insult with that compact brain of yours is a "loser" then I say good luck to you. No that isn't a lie mr doctuerette.</p>
              <p>I'm not really hurting from the exchange see, but whenever I hear locals complaining about foreigners I think of you, because apparently you claim to have a "doctuerette" and if your typing like as if God left the iron on your neurons too long. Also insulting my school and my life doesn't make you any more "intelligent", because you seem to fail on every other aspect of life. I have interactions alright, and an extra brain..oops I mean head, believing it doesnt really matter to me. And from your words, I can, from the eyes of a 14 year old, infer that you are rather aggresive towards online posts,  perhaps from a past beating or so? Don't tell me.</p>
              <p>And I don't have to worry about the blanket parties, because I'm obviously not as dumb as some people I know to say stuff out loud. Just do me a favor doctuerette, and don't make the same mistakes as your parents. Now piss off before you create extra e-waste.</p>

              <p>Fair nuff, dckx.  In any case, I can't do any worse than he does to himself - he's the one who's got to live with the hell he creates for himself in a few years' time, not to mention the dismal failure he currently tries to pass off as a life. Besides, I've gotten the confession that I want - the dummy's admitted that for all of his big talk, he's a cowering little girl when there's no keyboard separating him from the guy he's talking to. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Coming back to the topic, I had a grand old time in NS.  Okay, so the pay wasn't great, but it was a change of scenery and I got to jump out of planes and blow things up.  Not a whole lot wrong with that. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>On top of everything else, the experience created a lot of friendships - every December my company gets together at Hendon camp for a reunion (we just had our 18th Red Beret presentation anniversary celebrations a few weeks ago).  Not bad for a bunch of guys who under different circumstances would never have associated with each other.</p>
              <p>It's slavery if you don't get anything out of it.  The fact is that it's the individual's choice to get something out of NS, and any slavery is self-imposed.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Actually is it slavery, depends on himself. If you everyday wake up thinking it's another day of slavery then it'll be slavery.  I'm sure lot of people who did the 1st batch of national service back in the 60s will feel that ity's more slavery back then. Why not looked at it when you ORD, maybe 1 year maybe 5 years later or even later, then you judged it. I'm sure most of you when you have a camp mates gathering, you have lots to bitch about and laugh it out.</p></div>

              <p>I can't be bothered to read the entire 7 pages but I believe the discussion now has already deviate from the original topic. But I would still like to add...</p>
              <p>...I hate chao-kengsters more than any other type of people when I was in the army (have already ORDed for two weeks).</p>
              <p>I'm believe in working hard. My initial performance at my unit wasn't too well and thus, I wanted to prove myself to my peers and my commanders. Besides, not bothering to put in any effort into the work will only display a lack of responsibility and maturity.</p>
              <p>But I remembered posting a thread here on sgforum (<a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1390/topics/360538)%20wondering">http://sgforums.com/forums/1390/topics/360538) wondering</a> if this belief of mine will only serve to bring me my demise.</p>
              <p>To summarise: those who actually work the most are the ones who'll get more responsibilities and make more mistake (logic), and thus get blamed more. Those who manage to keng or give a bo-chap attitude, they don't get much work and thus, less blame and punishment.</p>
              <p>I've since learn that one can only learn life lessons through working hard and making mistakes, and those who keng will gain nothing for their life.</p>
              <p>But still, chao-kengsters are the one I'll always hate the most to the very core of my soul, even till now. Hard to forget my experience...it's those who chao-keng who bring misery to me.</p>
