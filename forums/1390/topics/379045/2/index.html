              <p>Yep, I do enjoy tormenting chao kengsters.  And there's alot of people like me in the army, the difference only lies on the amount of torture done on kengsters.  Kengsters are the ones putting my buddies and myself thru difficulty, so I don't see what's wrong with making their lives difficult as well.</p>
              <p>And you going to OCS? You might as well dream of becoming SG's President, hahaha! You think 2LTs are high and mighty? They are just NSFs like myself.  I am not trying to be arrogant, but thru my observation, in my unit, 2LTs and LTAs need us more then we do them.  And I am sure this is similar to many other units as well. We  talk with CPTs on the same level, buddy-buddy.  You want an example? How about an OC sitting down with a  LCP or CPL, talking cock and offering him a smoke?<br><br> You can come in and meet me with your " kit kat bar", but I got two words for you: "ORD LOH!"</p>

              <p>well fudgester, sorry it bothered you this much. To begin with, this was a harmless trend about me asking opinion on a blog i came across with. I was misunderstood and blamed, accursed etc.</p>

              <p>Normally i would recommand u start a new thread since this thread has became more flaming but i'll answer ur questions.</p>
              <p>Many people go into NS knowing nothing. Each year there are few thousands of RECs enlisting yet if you go to all the forums in sg, you might see at most a few hundreds asking questions only. Everything will be taught in NS but it would be pretty rush so people who ask or have NCC experience has a slight edge in the sense they know roughly what to expect.</p>
              <p>In BMT, be ready to be treated like a piece of shit. You will be shouted at for every stupid small thing and not respected by anyone but its a sort of training to get you suited to military life. You are unlikely to feel much 'care' and 'concern' if you expect them to be kind, you won't get much of it but then that depends on ur luck and the type of specs u get.</p>
              <p>First few days tough in the sense of gettnng use to the life and routine of military life. Training etc will be progressive so it gets tougher as you go on but they will pace you accordingly.</p>

              <p>Really, with your defensive attitude, even if you keng in NS, you will still suffer. It's no longer about keng-ing dude, it's about your attitude.</p>
              <p>A little piece of advice for you: be more humble. No one in NS likes a know-it-all, smart-alecky and defensive person, no matter as a superior, colleague or subordinate.</p>
              <p>And don't bother pulling the I-may-accidentally-get-into-OCS shit on me. Even if you manage to get into OCS, you won't survive with your f-ed up attitude. And even if you manage to commission, gd for you, rank-wise, I am still higher than you, so shut up. Don't try to pull future, imaginary ranks on forumers here because you have no idea who you are talking to.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Yes, Let's close this trend. Like what fudgester said this is becoming a nice ol flaming session. Cheez I have always thought those lynching mobs we always see in movies were fake. Now I know it is true, people just love to jump onto a bandwagon and be on the side of everybody else without allowing proper thought. It's always easier to follow the crowd i guess. Start throwing stones and pebbles everyone. Burn the witch because its easier to hang people than making them see things your way through constructive discussions.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Nevertheless, kenging is what everyone does. Don't tell me everyone who flames me here is a 24hr soldier who never question any order given to them. That would be kinda sad and meaningless to have freewill, don't cha think?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I heard somewhere before the well-said phrase, "Military experience is something I will never give up for a million bucks. But I wouldn't wanna do it again for a million buck."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">For all those who have already gone through the service, I seriously doubt you ever want to do it again. Am I not right? SO for people who have NOT been through it, we are entitled to our own thoughts right? Can we not question anything but just listen because YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN THROUGH?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">After reading through all the flames by people who have already been through Army in this post, I can be sure of one thing: <strong>The Army did make you guys more mature but not necessarily smarter</strong>.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">To begin with, I only posted this trend because of this blog at www.heartlandsoldier.wordpress.com. I thought there are some refreshing new insights in the stories he/she posted and suppose we can have good discussion here. So if you guys wanna keep crucifying me just for joy, go ahead.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I was just commenting that I couldn't get any good reads other then this silly blog. Material that tell it like it is. Finally someone who dares to put material out there without censorship.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I had enough of books with the notion:" I love Army because I feel proud doing something for my nation" that kind of politically correct statement and bullshit irks me. Kinda like they are saying this in front of the parliament.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">So I hope the next post will be related to this crappy little blog I found because I have to ask you guys opinions on what he says, facts or fantasies.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">As for moderators who still think i am advertising I have only this to say: I found a good read on the subject this forum is about and only wanted to share. You can A) Conform with the rudimentary, conservative red tape in this country and ban me or B) be a trend setter and allow people to speak their minds on a subject they really have passion about.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Thanks.</p>

              <p>you can question all you want, get your way just because you are correct. it's the exact mindset which will get you into trouble not only in the army but also in society. i believe you are still schooling eh? have you ever probed outside that bubble?</p>

              <p>I was just like you when I just enlist ed into BMT.

              <p>However, despite my efforts, I was awards with a PES BP status, which I could just get a B. But I ate and ate through the 2 monthes window period before my enlistment date, instead of doing meaningful things which could help me when I enlist. First few weeks were tough. And I mean super tough. I am mild obese weighing at 80kg. I could not do more than 20 situps, zero fighter, and worst of all, bobo shooter, + diver. I was always bottom on the list and always kena arrow to do the most shit. All this because of my mindcept of "Kenging". I thought kenging will help me to pass my ns days with a breeze, however, it does the opposite. I was in living hell during my recruit days.</p>
              <p>One fine day, I finally cracked. I was sent to see a phychologist. After the session, my CSM, encik Lim invite me to have a talk in his office.

I push myself 200% and manage to becaome PES B which landed me in OCS from good feedbacks from PC, and PS.</p>
              <p>I become an officer with pride and was posted by to Tekong. It was just like yesterday that I have seen myself change so much after national service. I thank my encik.  </p>
