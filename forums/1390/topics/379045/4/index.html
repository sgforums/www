              <p>No point mentioning all the stuff about how conscription can
                  benefit us and all, because it's still going to be forced upon most
                  of us anyway. Its like saying how amazing pineapples are and all
                  the benefits of it, if a person doesn't like it, he doesn't like
                  it, despite its goodness. Anyway its just my opinion so peace.</p>

              <p>Well Nancy, do you think bitching in any way, shape or form resembles "all the stuff about how conscription can
                                      benefit us and all"?  If not, how could I have repeated what  you said?</p>
              <p>I think the reason for your flopping at school is pretty clear - you just get sloppy in your attempts to protect that little ego of yours.  It's all show and no go.  Whether or not you think it's relevant is irrelevant - your losing attitude to life drives your "what's the point"sentiment in this thread, and given how you were squealing like a stuck pig over feeling like such a loser in the other thread, one would have thought that you might want to take something away from that.  That, however, was upon the assumption that you weren't here for a pity party, which obviously doesn't seem to be the case.</p>
              <p>I'd wish you a nice day, but you and I know I'd be lying.  Nice days are for people who make the best of things, not whiny losers.</p>

              <p>To your first part, no, because as any normal person can see that was a friendly opinion on my part, and if you see it as "bitching" then I cannot say anything I'm afraid.</p>
              <p>Oh wow so this has started. With all due respect good sir/ma'am, it seems to me that you are constantly trying to start up a flame war. A friendly comment is one thing, but you're just too close-minded to see it. I appreciate your tip on my other thread, but linking that thread with this is seriously irrelevant, sorry but I think your the one protecting your ego. And squealing like a loser? Oh Lord bless you, because you need it. That thread was a different thing altogether on an, I don't know, aunt agony section? So if your going to keep bringing that in into this then I can see this will never end.</p>
              <p>Finally good day to you too, and no I can't see the best of things in life and seeing your reply here, I doubt you can too. Yet again it's all an internet thing, and once again, for a working person I expect you to not take it too seriously. :)</p>
