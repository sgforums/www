              <p>Ah, yet another lie.  Do tell, how is "Thank you good sir/ma'am for repeating what I just said" meant to express a request for emphasis?  Or are you hopelessly weak in English as well?  It can only be one or the other.</p>
              <p>That you didn't expect your defeatist sentiment to be challenged simply underlies either your naivete or your stupidity.  Take your pick.</p>
              <p>And you're right, you don't need to know about my so-and-so certificate.  Down the track, it will have absolutely no bearing on your concern about whether I want fries with my meal.  And dammit, make it fast, slacker. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Well, you're the one bleating about this being a flame war when all you're receiving is a couple of simple home truths about yourself, junior.  Again, it's a case of projection, and you'd best be concentrating on your academic struggles instead of getting upset about an internet discussion.  Now study hard - as if it makes a difference.</p>
              </div>

              <p>LOL you actually replied? Look sweetheart, I'll put this in the nicest manner I know: You're a moron. It seems to me that your years in conscription and studies have only given birth to an apparent prick in the world. A civilised discussion is definitely not possible for someone with your intelligence, and giving in will only result in your arrogance growing. To start of this reply, not everyone is as pathetic as you really, I won't bother to lie on an internet, and looking at your comments I sometimes wonder the reliability of your certificates. No I do not want proof, because time is meant for more worthy things.</p>
              <p>Okay so lets take a look at some of your comment...hmm, first an insult. Wow you remind me of our dear Chee Soon Juan, an individual who has nothing but hot air in his/her neurones. Ever heard of typos? Or Internet language? I doubt you did. And sure this is a lie as well.</p>
              <p>Next, I'll take my pick alright. I'm naive, but hey guess what I'm 14, but you sir/ma'am, happen to be, as you claimed, a docturette holder, and wow if having such certs means losing my basic means of civilised talk and becoming some kind of over-temperemental faggot then boy will I avoid the college you went to. No I don't want to know that either.</p>
              <p>Of course I don't want to know about your certificate, because judging by your words you seem to be overly worried about winning an internet debate rather than focusing on your life. Name me some of the kids you actually "taught", because it's really interesting to know what you actually passed on to them.  I think I'd learn more from the trainee teachers at my school than someone like you :)</p>
              <p>And wow junior. If I'm a junior than you seem to be overly immature of your age aye? You have no idea what my results are, and your constantly yet again inferring from a thread on a forum. Me getting worked up? Wow I wonder who started to get all pissing on the internet. People like you amaze me, and have you lost your brain cells, if any that is, on the internet? The examinations are over for now and I have something called a short break. Seriously no offence but your the most pathetic person I've met on the internet, next to some neo-nazi on the internet, doubt you know what that is anyway. No wonder Singaporeans are so often criticised by foreign neighbours, because we have Mr Fail and Mrs Dumb such as yourself, polluting our lands.</p>
              <p>And after typing that out, I wish you a happy november ahead and regards for your life. Because you need it. :D</p>

              <p>Competition?  Wherever did I mention any competition?  Please quote me because it'll be a real eye-opener.</p>
              <p>Allow yourself to be educated.  You've just committed what's known in psychodynamic circles as projection (I'm certain dckx would be familiar with this), wherein you have just falsely accused someone else of doing what you know you yourself are guilty of.  It's you who see this as a competition, and yet, completely without basis, you accuse me of it.  Tut, tut, tut.  Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.</p>
              <p>Rest assured that I do not see this as a competition - it's simply beneath me to do anything with you besides attempt to enlighten you.  I'm not above learning anything from a younger person, but your development is markedly stunted relative to other kids of your age that I've encountered, and thus far you've offered nothing in this thread to facilitate any learning, either by process or content.</p>

              <p>Quote? Aww thats pretty damn easy how about the "sloppy fail fail fail" on an internet forum?  Well thats enough to show that your brain can only comprehend insults rather than actual thought. I still wonder who started this debate, and seriously like I said before. You educate kids? God bless them, really. And beneath you? Wow isn't that Hell already? Because I don't see how your level of intelligence can elevate you to any decent standards. You know when I saw comments made by supposed kids and teenagers, or maybe even paedophiles on other forums, I thought that was childish. Looking at yours, my respect for those other users increase immediately. Actually hey I'm interested in what course you majored in, give me more details because I'm going to cancel it off my list of "courses that don't produce faggots?". Really..sigh</p>
              <p>Yet again just to be polite, despite your shortcomings, I wish you a happy november ahead.</p>

              <p>LOL you actually replied? Look sweetheart, I'll put this in the
              nicest manner I know: You're a moron. It seems to me that your
              years in conscription and studies have only given birth to an
              apparent prick in the world. A civilised discussion is
              definitely not possible for someone with your intelligence, and
              giving in will only result in your arrogance growing. To start of
              this reply, not everyone is as pathetic as you really, I won't
              bother to lie on an internet, and looking at your comments I
              sometimes wonder the reliability of your certificates. No I do not
              want proof, because time is meant for more worthy things.</p>
              <p>Okay so lets take a look at some of your comment...hmm, first an
              insult. Wow you remind me of our dear Chee Soon Juan, an individual
              who has nothing but hot air in his/her neurones. Ever heard of
              typos? Or Internet language? I doubt you did. And sure this is a
              lie as well.</p>
              <p>Next, I'll take my pick alright. I'm naive, but hey guess what
              I'm 14, but you sir/ma'am, happen to be, as you claimed, a
              docturette holder, and wow if having such certs means losing my
              basic means of civilised talk and becoming some kind of
              over-temperemental faggot then boy will I avoid the college you
              went to. No I don't want to know that either.</p>
              <p>Of course I don't want to know about your certificate, because
              judging by your words you seem to be overly worried about winning
              an internet debate rather than focusing on your life. Name me some
              of the kids you actually "taught", because it's really interesting
              to know what you actually passed on to them.  I think I'd
              learn more from the trainee teachers at my school than someone like
              you :)</p>
              <p>And wow junior. If I'm a junior than you seem to be overly
              immature of your age aye? You have no idea what my results are, and
              your constantly yet again inferring from a thread on a forum. Me
              getting worked up? Wow I wonder who started to get all pissing on
              the internet. People like you amaze me, and have you lost your
              brain cells, if any that is, on the internet? The examinations are
              over for now and I have something called a short break. Seriously
              no offence but your the most pathetic person I've met on the
              internet, next to some neo-nazi on the internet, doubt you know
              what that is anyway. No wonder Singaporeans are so often criticised
              by foreign neighbours, because we have Mr Fail and Mrs Dumb such as
              yourself, polluting our lands. And finally, are you scheduled for a
              brain implant? If not then I highly suggest you go for one, or at
              least change the one you already have. I could offer some
              suggestions.</p>
              <p>And after typing that out, I wish you a happy november ahead and
              regards for your life. Because you need it. :D</p>

              <p>Whenever you type out a post, you will notice that there is a grinning face at the top left hand corner. Click on it and you will see different categories of smilies.
