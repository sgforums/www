              <p>To access fact or fiction, u should just ask direct questions to clear your doubts and most of us here can answer or share our experiences etc. Posting blog links is something we generally don't allow.</p>
              <p>The 2 years spent in NS can be a rewarding 2 years or a total waste of time depending on how u treat it. Keng all the way and you are just wasting ur time. Put in some effort and you might gain something worthwhile during the 2 yrs.</p>

              <p>Advertisement or not, I can say this much: WAKE UP YOUR BLOODY IDEAS.</p>
              <p>You have not even enlisted yet, and you are already thinking of how to keng. Here's one useful piece of advice, kid: have an open mind and aim to make your NS a worthwhile experience.</p>
              <p>Whether you keng or not, you are in there for two years. You can choose to skive and keng and try to be a little weasel, or you can try to make the best of things and come out of it a stronger, fitter, and more mature person.</p>
              <p>One thing I can say for sure (and all the old birds here will agree with me on this) is that so long as you have this sort of mentality, you <em>will </em>suffer in your NS. I promise you that.</p>

              <p>Everyone has difference experience about the same thing so what a person writes should be taken at face value and just how the person feels at that moment. You might go through the exact same experiences and come out of it with an entirely different set of experiences.</p>
              <p>If you want to read about anything or others blogs about NS life, you can read. Anything you are unsure about you can ask but this is not the place for discussion about what others write in their blogs but a place to answer questions regarding NS itself.</p>

              <p>Yes, I agree u dun need NS to make you into a mature sensible person. Likewise, there are ppl who are ginnas before NS, ginnas during NS, still ginna after NS, have kids liao still behave like a f**king ginna.</p>
              <p>I can also tell u, u say keng thru NS, unlikely one. Because u automatically become company/unit MARKED man. People think of sai gang, they think of you, people think of extra, they think of you, people think duty, people think of you, any kang tou that involve burning your weekend, they think of you.</p>
              <p>So the more u try to keng, the more sh*t you will be getting. SURE, some units may have loop holes that u can get away with it BUT how sure u can get into these units and KAH officers/enciks get change regularly, how u can ensure that loop hole doesn't close.</p>

              <p>We are not just watching the fire from across the bank. We have been through the fire itself. Whatever you felt as a pre-enlistee, we have felt it before as well. So don't you say that we don't understand how you feel.</p>
              <p>It is your response to your pre-enlistment jitters that is offensive, immature, and befitting of a child's thinking. There is a proper way to deal with it, e.g. by asking your seniors about what BMT is all about, what to expect, etc etc..... now that is how a truly mature person deals with it. You do <em>not</em> deal with it by toying with the idea of kenging. Put it firmly out of your mind.</p>
              <p>Right now every person who sees your first post is thinking 'What lah, haven't enlisted also, this %#%#$# want to keng already?'</p>
              <p>As all the old birds will tell you, the kengster is the most-hated person in the platoon. Why? Because when you keng, other people would have to bear your roles and responsibilities on top of what they already have to do.</p>
              <p>And besides, as I said before, this sort of mentality will lead to two years of suffering for you. And it's not just about the prospect everyone else hating you. Rather, while everyone else goes out with useful experiences, knowledge, and maturity, you get nothing. It's gonna be a long, long two years for you......</p>

              <p>U should take it as positive. NS prepares u for the working world. Which country in the world does that?</p>
              <p>Even kengsters learn a thing or two  about operational effectiveness, management ect.</p>
              <p>In some countries like Australia, they do incorporate workplace training into their tertiary studies to emphasize on being practical, but real operational management is what NS teaches.</p>

Just remember to use your common sense. If you are PES C or E, see what unit you get sent to. If you get sent to a "slack/keng" unit, then I suggest you don't be outstanding and keng together with the rest. Just remember, watch out for your fellow man whether you guys are chionging or kenging together. Just use your brain.

              <p>Very often its urs peers that gives u strength to push on. Esp in combat units, everyone beomes more tightly bonded and depends on each other for support. As long as you do not keng and tries ur best, people around will generaly offer support and help and hopefully you do likewise.</p>
              <p>Rather than only rely on external motivation, alot has to come from within as well. External motivation can do nothing if internal you have already given up the fight.</p>
              <p>Do not expect to be treated well or have any high expectations. Expect the minimal and you will be less disappointed. Most forumers including myself may not have enjoyed or look forward to NS before we go but some of us as we continue on, we find our role in the army and we either enjoy or at least gain experiences from what we do.</p>
              <p>Most regulars here hates kengsters, u will get flame badly for even mentioning about how to keng etc. I don't think any of the regulars here bother to post here just to advice ppl on how to keng and chances are such people will get flame by many others including myself for promoting kenging in NS.</p>

              <p>Dear Kei 1.618</p>
              <p>This is my first and probably last post in this forum. I am the author to that blog you were mentioning and I was attracted to post a reply because my friend inform me that a slightly heated discussion is going on here over what I have written.</p>
              <p>As for my blog it is actually a project I worked with with SAF couple of years ago. Upon submission, they binned it stating that it was way too contravesial, irresponsible and politicaly incorrect. Not to mention leaking of confidential information. So it became a book that was never published.</p>
              <p>I recently decided to blog it because I am now MR and there is nothing much they can do with me now. And I just wanted another place to store the manuscript.</p>
              <p>If you have read some of it i thank you but i hope you stop going around talking about it. That is my experience as a 1st Guards Scout and those experiences are dear to me so don't start anything that may get my blog removed for any reason.</p>
              <p>As for where you got the idea of malingering. It is definately not from my blog. You have to learn that reading chapter 1 of any book doesn't tell you how it is going to end. </p>
              <p>Army experiences is something most male Singapoeans have and like some forumers have already pointed out - yours will be unique to you. My advice, if you ever bother, is this; aim for a good unit if your body and health allows. It may be the best thing you have done in your entire life. Who knows you may just end up pushing papers through a copier till you retire at 60.</p>
              <p>As for moderators of this forum, i respect what you are doing and you guys will probably ban this reply as soon as you see it. So kei 1.618 if you want to carry this discussion further come to my blog hearlandsoldier.wordpress.com and leave a comment. Leave this forum and stop messing around here.</p>

              <p>You will meet people like me, friend.  People who will make kengsters' life VERY difficult. I <strong>hate</strong> chao keng kia with a passion.  The workload in my unit is extremely heavy.  During a peak period, it is common only to return back home for a few hours and booking back in, which will last for 4-6 weeks. There is this chao keng kia in my unit.  Used to like taking MCs on weekend duties.  Fortunately, I have quite a good rapport with my encik, so I managed to convinced him to make the fella sign 10 extra duties, all to be done on weekends.  Sure, he had that saturday free due to the MC, only to return and burn 10 more weekends.  He stopped taking MCs on weekends, but I am just waiting for him to do it again, so I can strike and have the encik charge him DB or at least SOL.<br><br>Not only that, I make sure whenever there are new birds joining in, they will know about this guy's behaviour. I love humiliating him in front of everybody.  And unfortunately for the poor bastard, there's alot of people like me in the unit.  He basically has no friends in there and yes, it's a stay-in unit.  <br><br>I might not meet you in NS, but rest assured, there are people who can't stand kengsters and there are people who hate them.  Enjoy your NS life, people like me will enjoy making you suffer.</p>

              <p>LOL, what is happening? I said i was fiddling with the idea and all I get is a barrage accusing me of a thought.</p>
              <p>Mr Blahhh, I really think the missed out on the crux of this arguement. And speaks volumes about yourself of how you derive enjoyment from getting people into trouble just because they have a differnt opinion from you and also because you know someone of higher ranking. typical blackbird wouldn't that be? I guess deep down inside people dont like you either ya? because i read somewhere that lackeys are rank way up on the detestable list, way ahead of a kengster.</p>
              <p>Anyway, glad we probably won't be meeting. Who knows I may just unfortunately get selected to OCS and end up rank over you? </p>
              <p>And to the author of the blog, way to go for coming into this discussion. Oh my, what have I started here...</p>
