              <p>To your first part, no, because as any normal person can see
              that was a friendly opinion on my part, and if you see it as
              "bitching" then I cannot say anything I'm afraid.</p>
              <p>Oh wow so this has started. With all due respect good sir/ma'am,
              it seems to me that you are constantly trying to start up a flame
              war. A friendly comment is one thing, but you're just too
              close-minded to see it. I appreciate your tip on my other thread,
              but linking that thread with this is seriously irrelevant, sorry
              but I think your the one protecting your ego. And squealing like a
              loser? Oh Lord bless you, because you need it. That thread was a
              different thing altogether on an, I don't know, aunt agony section?
              So if your going to keep bringing that in into this then I can see
              this will never end.</p>
              <p>Finally good day to you too, and no I can't see the best of
              things in life and seeing your reply here, I doubt you can too. Yet
              again it's all an internet thing, and once again, for a working
              person I expect you to not take it too seriously. :)</p>

              <p>Ah,now comes the lie.  "Friendly opinion"?  Pull the other leg, sport - it's got bells on it.  All you did was portray Ninja's input as pointless, and then run off with the coward's caveat "it's just my opinion".</p>
              <p>Listen up, booster - if you're going to put a view forward, grow a pair and stand by it.  No sense saying something and then running off like a gutless little sissy.</p>
              <p>You want to call this a flame war and throw smoke while you slink off, go right ahead - you're not fooling anyone.  All I'm doing is plainly pointing out your shortcomings to you because you're obviously too blinded by your need for angst to see them, and I frankly couldn't give half a damn if you're too weak to acknowledge the truth about yourself.</p>
              <p>As for seeing the best things in life, well, I had a ball in NS after being dragged in kicking and screaming (and I've said as much in past threads here), and what I've learned there has handily seen me through a doctorate and an assuredly well-compensated career, so sorry kid -you're well off the mark on this one.  Just add it to your continued list of "missed it by this much" failures.</p>

              <p>Competition?  Wherever did I mention any competition?  Please quote me because it'll be a real eye-opener.</p>
              <p>Allow yourself to be educated.  You've just committed what's known in psychodynamic circles as projection (I'm certain dckx would be familiar with this), wherein you have just falsely accused someone else of doing what you know you yourself are guilty of.  It's you who see this as a competition, and yet, completely without basis, you accuse me of it.  Tut, tut, tut.  Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.</p>
              <p>Rest assured that I do not see this as a competition - it's simply beneath me to do anything with you besides attempt to enlighten you.  I'm not above learning anything from a younger person, but your development is markedly stunted relative to other kids of your age that I've encountered, and thus far you've offered nothing in this thread to facilitate any learning, either by process or content.</p>

              <p>Ah,now comes the lie.  "Friendly opinion"?  Pull the other leg, sport - it's got bells on it.  All you did was portray Ninja's input as pointless, and then run off with the coward's caveat "it's just my opinion".</p>
              <p>Listen up, booster - if you're going to put a view forward, grow a pair and stand by it.  No sense saying something and then running off like a gutless little sissy.</p>
              <p>You want to call this a flame war and throw smoke while you slink off, go right ahead - you're not fooling anyone.  All I'm doing is plainly pointing out your shortcomings to you because you're obviously too blinded by your need for angst to see them, and I frankly couldn't give half a damn if you're too weak to acknowledge the truth about yourself.</p>
              <p>As for seeing the best things in life, well, I had a ball in NS after being dragged in kicking and screaming (and I've said as much in past threads here), and what I've learned there has handily seen me through a doctorate and an assuredly well-compensated career, so sorry kid -you're well off the mark on this one.  Just add it to your continued list of "missed it by this much" failures.</p>

              <p><br>Look, please listen up as well. I put a view forward just to make an extra comment. Nobody knows me so I have no reason to "lie" or whatever here. And I didn't expect a comment to receive negative feedbacks from 3 people. Your first reply to that was not very clear either, which explains my asking of your to emphasise on that. So there was the "have the nice day", before receiving a second comment which convinces me that you're seeing it as an insult. Flame war? How did I come up with that? Maybe the constant "inference" with my other thread which obviously hasn't got anything to do with my comment. And I'm sorry if my comment offended you, and usually such things wouldn't attract so much attention as it did here.</p>
              <p>And I don't need to know if you have so-and-so certificate, because to be honest, I don't care. And I would be polite if you are as well, instead of constantly trying to "fight" on a front I didn't even know existed. If you want to see it as offensive, then go ahead. I don't even know what we're debating about anyway, so "There's no need to mention all the stuff thats good about conscription as we're forced to do it anyway" is so-called "bitching" in your eyes? And nah I won't add it to my list, perhaps adding a "I didn't get this grade" would be on the list, but certainly not becoming an oversensitive person who gets worked up over an internet comment.

              <p>Ah, yet another lie.  Do tell, how is "Thank you good sir/ma'am for repeating what I just said" meant to express a request for emphasis?  Or are you hopelessly weak in English as well?  It can only be one or the other.</p>

              <p>And you're right, you don't need to know about my so-and-so certificate.  Down the track, it will have absolutely no bearing on your concern about whether I want fries with my meal.  And dammit, make it fast, slacker. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Well, you're the one bleating about this being a flame war when all you're receiving is a couple of simple home truths about yourself, junior.  Again, it's a case of projection, and you'd best be concentrating on your academic struggles instead of getting upset about an internet discussion.  Now study hard - as if it makes a difference.</p>
