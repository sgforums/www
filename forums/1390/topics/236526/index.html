            <div class='col-md body'>No, its not true that you'll be stuck as a specialist for the rest of your contract. But in order to cross over to OCS, you must have performed either exceptionally well or shown great leadership qualities during SISPEC or during your unit tour. But the terms of your contract would be changed and you'll be converted to the SAVER scheme once you commissioned as an officer. I've had specialist friends (JPSDS scheme regulars) who were sent into the Pro term of my OCC and most of them were very good performers. Take heart from that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

First to introduce myself. I'm IDFFollower76 and new to the forum.  Saw your thread and can't help but tell myself that i have to share my two cents worth.<br><br>I was a JPSDS receipent, enlisted in may 1995.  Be RODing in July 2007.<br><br>There has been cases where servicemen/women who performed well under the scheme can cross over to the officer corps but i seriously believe that it will be to your disadvantage.  There are certain factors to take note and please do not take signing your dobby mark on the dotted line with the SAF lightly.  With the current trend of restructuring in the SAF, i strongly advocate spending more time and effort to ask oneself before signing.  It helps if you know friends who are in and can ask them for advice.<br><br>To make it big in the MES formation as a JPSDS technician, you not only need to be technically competent, you must also be a people person(which i'm not).<br>Also to moake yourself visible, you will have to proof your worth by doing tonnes of WITS and volunteer for overseas missions/exercises.<br><br>I was awarded a couple of GOLD Awards for my WITs at the national level and also took part in numerous missions and exercises but due to injury, i guess it's time for me to move on to greener pastures out there. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Nowaadays,  <strong>ALL</strong>governmental organisation actually demeand more from you for the amount of money that they pay you.  So if your motivation is becasue of money then my advice is to stay clear of the SAF. But if yu seriously love the lifestyle of being a soldier and that you love the country, then by all means carry on.<br><br>I seriously hope and pray that my contribution is not too late.<br><br>Whoever you are, please seriously consider and reconsider a career with the SAF.<br><br>My two cents worth.<br><br>Cheers!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thankfully, I have reconsidered and have refrained from signing a contract that will seal my life for the next decade to come, at the very least.<br><br>But some of my friends have fallen into the trap of money the SAF dangles in front of them. Some truly need the scheme, with the cost of education being quite high and with a gross household income of less than 2k. Others just fall into the temptation of receiving a thousand dollars monthly just for studying under the JPSDS - extra pocket money to go pak-tor-ing, shopping etc. And how can we forget those who sign up for it simply because they do not know yet their goal in life and well, hey, at least they are committed to something (the Army).<br><br>There are undoubtedly, people out there who sign on for the scheme purely out of a young man's passion for soldiering, and I salute this people. They are rare, and our Army truly needs their enthusiasm and garangness.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
