            <div class='col-md body'>Private certs are recognised but only to a certain extent.<br>If you have a private cert, SISPEC is probably the highest you can go. OCS will be out of bounds to private cert holders.<br><br>If you are talking about signing on then conditions are much more stringent. Private certs are not recognised at all so if you sign on your next highest qualification will be your secondary school education.<br><br>Frankly, the private cert area is still not that well established. With the recent problems regarding closure of private schools due to financial reasons etc... the government is probably not going to be accepting such certs in the near future. Commercial firms accept on a case by case basis. Usually, it's better to get a private cert as an add-on to your normal ite/poly/uni education and not as a stand alone thing.</div>
