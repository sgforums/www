              China to Singapore with his family when he was six. He was nine years 
              old when he and his family became Singapore citizens.<br><br>Today, the 29-year-old said NS was instrumental in his integration into Singapore.<br><br>"Going
               through army really solidified my thinking. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sacrificing three years of 
              my life was a commitment device for my nationality</strong></span></span>.  That common 
              experience I've shared amongst all my army peers from all walks of life,
               all races, Malays, Indians, Singaporean Chinese. All going through the 
              same regiment together has really made me think I'm truly Singaporean."<br><br>Another foreign-born resident, 18-year-old, Martin Cada will enlist when he graduates from Nanyang Polytechnic.<br><br>The second-generation permanent resident (PR) has been living in Singapore for the past six years.<br><br>But like many other foreigners in Singapore, he too wants to keep his cultural identity.<br><br>"I've
               adapted some Singaporean traits, but you know it's still, I want to be 
              Filipino, I want to be recognised as a Filipino. NS is not going to 
              change that for me," Martin shared.<br><br>Martin used to dread the thought of NS, but recently had a change of heart.<br><br>His elder brother, also a PR, is currently serving NS.<br><br>"I
               was able to enjoy some of the benefits of becoming a Singapore PR. So I
               think it's just fair that I have to serve NS, just to give back to 
              Singapore, who has taken care of me," he said.<br><br>However, both 
              Martin and James said there's no need to make it mandatory for all new 
              citizens, past the enlistment age, to serve NS.<br><br>"It's not 
              realistic. Number one, they've already passed their eligible age to 
              serve. Maybe they're too old to be involved in this experience. And 
              besides, they are working individuals contributing to Singapore society.
               In reality, I think they have other things to do. But if children want 
              to be called Singaporeans, definitely they have to serve," James said.<br><br>In
               line with government efforts to attract foreign talent, first 
              generation PRs who are able to contribute to Singapore economically, are
               exempted from national service. </span></span></p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">This is the trouble with the PAP. Instead
               of considering other viewpoints, they often choose to push them aside 
              and come out to defend the status quo with vigour. This style is what 
              makes them appear so domineering.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Indeed they have not. When Professor Lim 
              Chong Yah recently called for a decent pay to be given to the lowest 
              income workers, a number of PAP ministers came out to refute him. As 
              usual, they painted the picture of economic doom if we give out more 
              money to our lowest wage earners. This is as good as saying: “we must 
              keep the wages low so that the businesses can profit”. Professor Lim is 
              an eminent economist; he should know what he is talking about. Yet his 
              suggestion was pushed aside as if it was made by an engineering graduate
               with no idea what economics is.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">When Singaporeans complained about being 
              crowded out by too many immigrants and foreign workers, they keep on 
              defending the need for foreign workers and immigrants instead of trying 
              to work with Singaporeans to explore possible solutions.</p>
