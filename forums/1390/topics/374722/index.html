              <p>Yea but most farmers usually hit a dead end during their career in the army. They don't get promoted as fast and have to wait a long long time. Their future in the army isnt guarenteed and mostly based on performance. Farmers definately have a harder time.</p>

              <p>U have slapped your own face and stabbed your farmer boots, because its obvious u were a foot soldier, from what you say i doubt u ever met a scholar in saf in real life because your rants and "points" are nothing more than a compilation of run of the mill HEARSAY, the farmer HEARSAY passed down from one generation of farmer to another.</p>
              <p>It's obvious to me, that you are not a commissioned officer and have never worked hand in hand and stood shoulder to shoulder with regular officers commanding on the field. I doubt you are even a spec to have ever heard farmer and scholar officers on the signal set in the field.</p>
              <p>Farmers are nothing but a bunch of bitter sour grapes who are lazy and do nothing but wayang and oh, they never use their puny brains to think before executing commands, only know how to 'follow their CO', if CO (who's also another dumb farmer) never say can move to under the tree, can't let the men move. Thats how stupid they can be. Amazing. Even the men can laugh at them.</p>
              <p>Only farmer regular officers function and operate in this dumb mechanical way due to their lack of inherent intelligence &amp; leadership, lack of cultural exposure to the world (no worldly experience of living and studying overseas), lack of tactical skills on field (related to intelligence), lack of management abilities and mispleased undeserved <em>over</em>-confidence in themselves (the rare few who are actually fit love to 'challenge' their fellow farmers and the men to feel good about themselves, lame losers with no brains and EQ). Most of them have the fitness level of a piece of tofu.</p>
              <p>Oh..another thing. Psychologically, do you know how the
                              farmers started believing that any scholar can possibly 'keng'? Wanna know the root of the farmer hearsay? For farmers (like you and of your ability), you can
                              expect to ord a MAJ. So your aspiration is LTC if ambitious. Scholars come in with the aim to be service
                              chief. Its a different league altogether. In fact not even comparable
                              of leagues, because to compare is a burlesque. Even if they close their eyes with their abilities they
                              will be better than you and get the rank you aim for. But for them
                              that's not what they came for. They are here to be at the top and fight tooth and nail
                              among each other to be there. a scholar once said that if he didn't get
                              a star, he'll probably kill himself.</p>
              <p>MAJ is the best that can be milked from the ability of your ilk, and when you see people of superior abilities sail past that easily, you think it was 'unfairly bestowed' when LTC to them is like getting you getting into OCS. People didn't come here to be LTC. Different league lah. They work awfully hard and some would even backstab another to go ahead. They're here to reach for the skies. So yeah..you're punching above
                              your weight. And you sound awfully dumb while at it.</p>
              <p>Just look at your handle and the things you say and how you say them, to everyone this is the prototype of the SAF farmer officer wannabe. Your existence is proof itself of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">farmer persona</span> and what it stands for.</p>
              <p>It's ok to be incompetent. It's not when it's coupled with shamelessness. you actually think people like you can be compared in their calibre and can waltz into Harvard, MIT and Cambridge or be at the top of pack of your cohort in all rounded achievements, when you can't even get into OCS. No shame.</p>

              <p>And by your posting (which does not seem very clear due to

              <p>Yes you are correct that that is the situation, thank you for being sharp to know what people say.</p>
              <p>I have met and worked with both. Farmer regular officers are good at nothing but wayang, and they do things without using their puny brains. Following orders and staying out of trouble is more important for them. Keep your head low. Toe the line. Saka and wayang. Hope can at least get LTC! Unless you are a commander who worked together and under farmers and real scholars before, I don't think you know what the f is going on in that place called saf. I have worked under a few scholars (they are small in number), from OC to a BG at NDP. And I have seen numerous farmer officers at work, let's just say they live up to their names of wayang and incompetence and poor mental abilities. Only know how to cover backside, can only approve whatever that CO said, if CO never say, cannot move under the shade even when it's the common-sensical thing to do. Common sense is a commodity 90% of them don't possess. Can't even do simple navigation in the jungle, can get lost and start panicking hahaha.</p>

              <p>I meant getting to OCS is much easier than getting into Ivy League. Heheh. I meant ease of entry. Out of every 10 A level and diploma holder, 1 go to OCS. Only 2-3 Singaporeans from one whole A level batch make it into Harvard a year. It's not NUS or University
                                  of Kota Kinabalu or University of Koh Samui. I was asking the farmer toad when he can't even get
                                  to OCS, why is his small cock crapping about the people he's crapping about, obviously every morsel that's come out of his crack so far is the same ol' farmer hearsay all who don the uniform in saf hears and knows as BS.Like the ns men who earn so much they dun get called for reservist and the extra guy in the platoon when the sergeants report strength.</p>
              <p>He's not even a 3SG to hear
                                  and see his dumbo farmer regular officers in "command" "at work" screwing up and making dumb command decisions, that much I'm sure of, because if he were he won't be this ignorant of their <strong>"performance"</strong>, like he said. I think the correct word is "underperformance" Heheh.</p>
