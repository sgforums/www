              <p>Those who are liable to serve national service but refuse are
              charged under the Enlistment Act. If convicted, they face three
              years' imprisonment and a fine of S$10,000.</p>
              <p>Controversy arose when the penalties were increased in January
              2006 after <a title="Melvyn Tan" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvyn_Tan">Melvyn
              Tan</a>, who was born in Singapore, received a fine for defaulting
              on his National Service obligations. Tan left for <a title="London" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London">London</a> to study music during his enlistment age and
              later acquired British nationality. In <a title="Parliament of Singapore" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore">parliament</a>, Defence Minister <a title="Teo Chee Hean" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teo_Chee_Hean">Teo Chee Hean</a> provided some illustration of the
              punishments defaulters would face:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the default period exceeds two years but the defaulter is
              young enough to serve his full-time and operationally ready NS
              duties in full, MINDEF will press for a short jail sentence.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot serve his
              full-time NS in a combat vocation or fulfil his operationally ready
              NS obligations in full, a longer jail sentence to reflect the
              period of NS he has evaded may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot be called
              up for NS at all, a jail sentence up to the maximum of three years
              may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Each year, a small number of people are convicted for their
              failure to enlist or refusal to be conscripted. Most of them were
              <a title="Jehovah's Witnesses" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, who are usually
              court-martialled and sentenced to three years' imprisonment, but
              they are usually held in a low-security detention facility and
              separated from other conscription offenders. The government does
              not consider <a title="Conscientious objector" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector">conscientious objection</a> to be a legal
              reason for refusal to serve NS.</p>

              <p>TS, just bear with it. After you are through with NS, you are free to cancel your PR. If you were to AWOL now, you will never be able to come back to SG again. Oh, btw, you can't run now since you are already serving in the army.</p>

              <p>What do you define as a useful job in NS?Being a commander?You are not the only one who thinks that what they did in NS was useless,plenty others have bemoaned about their vocation.The reason you gave is not a good one.Just be honest that you do not even want to do NS.</p>
              <p>I have heard from my friends about a case of a china PR awoling and moving back to china with his family.On the day they decided to do it,they went to the Chinese embassy and gave a sob story to the officials to plead their case.In the end,the embassy book a flight for them and facilitated their way out SG.Naturally,after that,they should never expect to step back into SG again.</p>
              <p>I cannot verify about what I heard but you can try going to your embassy to plead your case.Who knows they might even be able to bully Mindef into letting you off without a hitch?</p>

              democracy, that's because I have no ties to this nation, and I'm in a
              situation where they'd harass my family. <br> <br> Honestly, it's complete bullshit, and it always will be. I'll finish my
              two years service, but I swear, when I'm done, I'm writing a book

              foreigner, and would spill all the secrets out to the world *rolls
              eyes*.<br> <br> I don't even care that I wouldn't be able to come back to SG, I
              just wish my mum would leave this hellhole, so I could leave and
              not have any qualms at all.<br> <br> I honestly don't care how much they label me here, the only reason
              why I'm serving is to protect my mother, out of fear tactics the
              government uses.</p>
              <p>I'm honestly disappointed in the citizens of SG. No one bothers
              to stand up for their democratic rights, everyone cowers under the
              iron fist of the government. It's a facist country with a false
              sense of democracy to lull it's people into believing they're
              free.<br> <br> And before you go on saying I'm not bothering to stand up for
              democracy, that's because I have no ties to this nation, and I'm in
              a situation where they'd harass my family.<br> <br> Honestly, it's complete bullshit, and it always will be. I'll
              finish my two years service, but I swear, when I'm done, I'm
              writing a book accounting everything I've learned about this
              place.</p>

              <p>Basically I'm a PR serving NS, with a US passport. I've finished
              my BMT, and have been working for a couple of months, but I can't
              take it. It's not that it's hard, it's just I want to move back to
              the US.<br> <br> I'm tired of Singapore [no offense, I lived here 11 years total,
              and don't have any friends outside of camp], and I want to start
              working for real, as well as studying part time.<br> <br> Basically, I want to revoke my PR, but I'm not sure if the
              government will pester me about it, and cause me and my family
              trouble.<br> <br> I'm not even doing a useful job, just the extra-guy; they didn't
              even approve my G50 application, so I feel less and less inclined

              <p>ok mal,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>before u listen to someone close to u telling u to give yerself
              upto police or something.......i guess it wuld be ok cuz u have a
              us passport . buti dont think ya are tough enough
              ta survive the 2nd day even......so.......take out a really
              large piece of paper and think what ya would wanna do....if u have
              awol then its a irreversible kinda law.they wont hunt u down every
              minute like in the movies.they will only be alerted at all
              immigration checkpoints which is the usual practice.</p>
              <p>i hope u changed yer name in the usa before stepping into
              spore...did u??if u did change yer name....theres no chance they
              can track ya.if not perhaps 50% chance.......</p>

              <p>OT: U do know that immigrations these days do not just look at name but ur other details as well. I don't think just changing name alone would make you a different person and thus allowed to enter any country that u were ban from or have commited any offence in.</p>

              <p>Note that the USA <a title="Passport card" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Passport_card"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Passport card</span></span></a> is not a biometric passport. The passport card does not follow the ICAO's Doc 9303, can only be used in a limited number of countries and uses a simple <a class="mw-redirect" title="RFID" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/RFID"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">RFID</span></span></a> chip instead of the contactless smart card technology that is used for biometric passports. Contactless smart card technology includes a microprocessor, data access control, communications security and other functionality as programmed.</p>
