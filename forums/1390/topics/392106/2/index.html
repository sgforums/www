              <p>i dont think they would sentence him more than a few months in DB prison.it is a waste to feed prisoners and a drain to resources in singapore.at most 1 month!</p>
              <p>32 months is too long.........he could go out and serve country usefully by working and solving current issues with the economy.and with children....who is going to feed the children??singapore???the president of the united states??me ???of course the guy who ends up feeding the children!</p>
              <p>time to get any MP to help him out if they put him more than 1 month in military prison.playing playstation games for a month in prison is a waste of time.</p>

              <p>of course, but if this chap is really so hard up that he had to AWOL, then why did he go knock up someone again and produce YET another child while he's on the run ? can't control, too stressed, must fark ? no money to buy condom ?  ... obviously he did not understand the seriousness of his situation at all. I'm so sorry for the two kids, this chap is seriously farked up.</p>
              <p>you come here and whine also no use right ? we're not the SAF, no one here can give him a lighter sentence. And it's "your friend's boyfriend" huh .... okayyyyyyy.</p>

              <p>Normally people of TS's "friend's boyfriend" type, can't migrate because no other country wants them. Such people will never get citizenship from a country better than SG, maybe they can migrate to really crap places like Somalia, but I doubt they'll want that. It is sad because what happens is that gainful SG citizens have to support these people by feeding them in jail and also support the social welfare system like MCYS and NCSS, which are picking up their slack and financially assisting their children when it should have been their responsibility.</p>

              <p>SG born males or Singapore male Permanent residents below the age of 18, who are still in Singapore at the point of enlistment must serve NS and have a NS liability. If they migrate anytime before they serve and after they pass a certain age, can't remember if its 10 or 12, they would be regarded as a deserter and cannot step back on Singapore soil. </p>
              <p>The trick is to leave Singapore before you're 10 or 12 and of cos you must succeed in getting citizenship elsewhere before 16. If not you will have to serve. </p>
              <p>If you are a SG PR below age 18 and have citizenship in a first world country, and wish to remain in SG as a PR only and not take up SG citizenship because you would rather keep your superior citizenship, you must still serve NS. After serving NS, you can continue to remain here as a PR. You need not be forced to take up the SG citizenship. I know a number of my friends like this.</p>
              <p>Best thing if you have SG citizenship or Singapore PR before age 18 and after age 10 or 12 is to just serve it then you are free to make any plans for your future, including migration if you are good enough to get citizenship from a first world country.</p>
