              <p>The <strong>Singapore Infantry Regiment</strong> is the main
                  formation of the <a title="Singapore Army" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Army">Singapore Army</a>. It consists of eight full-time
                  battalions and a number of National Service (NS), or Reservist
                  battalions.</p>
              <p>The 1st Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment (1 SIR) was
                  formed in March 12, 1957 against the backdrop of self-government
                  for <a title="Singapore" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a>. Recruitment began on 4 March 1957
                  with only Singapore citizens and persons born and bred in Singapore
                  were recruited. Out of a total of 1,420 applicants, 237 were
                  initially accepted for training. It was intended that 1 SIR
                  together with another battalion would form part of a regiment
                  within a brigade group in the Singapore Military Forces.</p>
              <p>Self-government for Singapore in 1959 gave 1 SIR the opportunity
                  to mount the Istana Guards in place of the <a title="Gurkha Contingent" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurkha_Contingent">Gurkhas</a>, while the battalion was
                  presented with <a title="Colours, standards and guidons" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colours,_standards_and_guidons">Queen's and
                  Regimental Colours</a> in 1961. The following year, the 2nd
                  Battalion was raised.</p>
              <p>For two years between 1963 and 1965, Singapore was part of
                  <a title="Malaysia" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, and the regiment was renamed the
                  <strong>Malaysian Infantry Regiment</strong>. Both battalions saw
                  service in the <a title="Indonesian Confrontation" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_Confrontation">Confrontation</a>, with
                  1 SIR posted to <a title="Sebatik Island" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebatik_Island">Sebatik Island</a> in <a title="Sabah" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabah">Sabah</a> and 2 SIR to <a title="Labis" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labis">Labis</a>, <a title="Johor" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johor">Johor</a>. On Singapore's independence
                  in 1965, the regiment regained its former name. In 1967 two more
                  battalions, the 3rd and 4th, were raised as part of the move
                  towards <a title="Conscription in Singapore" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Singapore">National Service</a>.
                  1 SIR and 2 SIR were also converted to NS battalions. Four further
                  battalions were raised over the next few years, although 7 SIR and
                  the older 8 SIR were eventually re-roled to become the 3rd and 2nd
                  Battalions, <a title="Singapore Guards" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Guards">Singapore Guards</a>.</p>
              <p>Currently, there are eight active battalions, each of which is
                  assigned to an infantry brigade in one of the army's three <a title="Singapore Army" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Army#Combined-Arms_Divisions">Combined Arms Divisions</a> except 9 &amp; the newer 8 SIR, which is assigned to <a title="Singapore Army" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Army#2_People.27s_Defence_Force">2 People's Defence Force</a>.
                  This is alongside two per brigade of NS battalions. Besides
                  training for their conventional warfare role, different infantry
                  battalions specialised in their unique role. This arrangement which
                  may change according to operating environment also allows MINDEF to
                  try out new tactics and equipment. E,g: 3 SIR specialised in Urban
                  operations. 9 SIR specialised in POI (Protection of Installations)
                  for civilian key installations. 8 SIR specialised in POI for SAF
                  key installations. As of May 2011, 2 SIR has been converted into a
                  motorised infantry battalion in the effort to shift towards a 3rd
                  Generation SAF.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Infantry_Regiment#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The plan is
                  to convert 3 conventional infantry battalions to motorised infantry
                  that is 1 per Combined Arms Divisions.</p>

              <p>The debate on the President's Address moved to the theme of "Safe and
               Secure Singapore" on 29 May and Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen 
              shared on the recommendations put forth by the Committee to Strengthen 
              National Service (CSNS) and the warm reception they have received.</p>
              <p>"Overall, the response has been positive and the Committee is 
              thankful for this. Some have said that we struck the right tone, by 
              capturing the wide range of sentiments and ideas from the focus group 
              participants.</p>
              <p>"Indeed, we reproduced some of their direct feedback in our report 
              because we wanted to capture the essence of what they said and their 
              main points. The Committee was careful not only to recommend actions 
              that were easy to implement," said Dr Ng.</p>
              <p>Some of the Members of Parliament who welcomed the recommendations 
              earlier in the week included MP for Sembawang GRC Ellen Lee, who said: 
              "The proposed changes show more than due consideration towards 
              Singaporeans who defend us and our homes.</p>
              <p>"They are proof that the nation places great priority on furthering 
              options that will increase their well-being as well as their family's 
              well-being which in turn strengthens their sense of belonging to our 
              nation." Ms Lee is a member of the CSNS working group which looks into 
              recognition and benefits for NS. The other working group looks into 
              boosting support for NS.</p>
              <p>MP for Potong Pasir GRC Sitoh Yih Pin, the newly appointed Chairman 
              of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Defence and Foreign 
              Affairs also voiced his support earlier this week: "The CSNS... is 
              making some very far-reaching proposals that will strengthen 
              Singaporeans' support for NS.</p>
              <p>"I am glad that the Government is not content with what it has 
              achieved and continues to strive to make NS even more relevant and to 
              secure more support and buy-in from not just Singaporeans, but... (also)
               employers and companies that hire Singaporeans."</p>
              <p>If accepted by the Government, the CSNS recommendations will bring 
              about substantial recognition to national servicemen, and more 
              importantly, boost Singapore's defence. The recommendations will cost 
              about $4.5 billion over the next decade to implement.</p>
              <p>One of the recommendations called for 90 percent of all future NS 
              cohorts to be enlisted within four months of leaving school. The 
              remaining will be enlisted within six months.</p>
              <p>This is a significant commitment from the Singapore Armed Forces 
              (SAF), said Dr Ng in Parliament on 29 May. "Such recommendations have a 
              huge administrative impact."</p>
              <p>He noted: "If accepted by the Government, this could be implemented 
              as early as the middle of next year." Every year, the SAF typically 
              calls up NS-liable males in June and September. These will be brought 
              forward to May and August, respectively.</p>
              <p>The recommendations also included a call for the SAF to better match 
              the skills of enlistees to their eventual vocations. "For the first 
              time, we will ask NSFs (Full-time National Servicemen) to indicate their
               preferred vocation," said Dr Ng.</p>
              <p>"This is another headache which my commanders are grappling with. 
              Similarly for the SPF (Singapore Police Force) and SCDF (Singapore Civil
               Defence Force)," he said.</p>
              <p>But Dr Ng cautioned: "Any time we give choice to everyone, not all will get their first or even second choice."</p>
              <p>He elaborated: "The Committee deliberated this, said even though 
              some, not all, will get their first and second choice... this should not
               deter us. Because giving choice will better match aptitudes to 
              vocations and allow people who want to contribute in areas that they 
              think they have strength in to do so."</p>
              <p>Speaking for the continued importance of NS in Singapore's fabric, Dr
               Ng said: "Singapore remains one of very few countries able to sustain 
              an NS system... Others have dismantled their NS systems, not because 
              threats disappeared but because public support waned.</p>
              <p>"NS support (in Singapore) has been built on the service of 900,000 
              national servicemen who have discharged their NS duties. Everyone 
              faithfully, dutifully, did his duties."</p>
              <p>Dr Ng also paid tribute to all NSmen. "Here we want to place on 
              record the appreciation of this House for all the national servicemen 
              who have served, and recognition of their contributions."</p>

              called the Manpower Aptitude Assessment System (MAPAS) to assess

              will affect important decisions, which include assignment to a

              vocations that will make good use of your abilities.<br> <br> <strong>What are the tests like</strong><br> <br> We use different sub-tests to measure different types of mental
              ability. Some of the mental abilities that we measure include
              memory, speed of responding, abstract reasoning, following complex
              instructions, solving mathematical problems, mental spatial
              ability, and psycho-motor skills. Please click on the following
              links to try out some of these tests.<br> <br> a) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Word

              reasoning</span><br> <br> All the sub-tests are computer administered. Most of the sub-tests
              will present a problem or question on the screen and you will need
              to respond accordingly. Some sub-tests however, measure speed or
              hand-eye co-ordination and may look like simple computer
              games.<br> <br> <strong>How long is the test at VAC</strong><br> <br> Since we have to be as accurate as possible, we need to measure as
              wide a range of your abilities as is possible. Thus, the testing
              will require about 2 to 2 1/2 hours of your time.<br> <br> <strong>What to do</strong><br> <br></span></p>

              <ul class="reset_margId">
              <li class="reset_margId"> Strengthen the NS training system by employing an additional 1,100 Regulars in
                                      the SAF, and 230 Regulars in the SPF and SCDF, to improve training and inculcate
                                      values more effectively. These Regulars will be well-versed in the latest training
                                      methods and technology. They can also better emphasise and enforce training
                                      safety. As role models, regular trainers will provide our servicemen with a better
                                      appreciation of why they train and what they are defending.</li>

              <ul class="reset_margId">
              <li class="reset_margId"> Increase leadership opportunities for our servicemen by raising the proportion of
                  officers and specialists from 30% to 40%, to meet new operational needs.</li>
              <li class="reset_margId"> Increase deployment flexibility for NSFs by taking into account skills and
                  preferences when deploying servicemen. This would maximise the contributions
                  of NSFs, provide them with a better NS experience and meet our operational
                  requirements.</li>
              <li class="reset_margId">Provide more leadership opportunities and deployment options for servicemen in

              <li class="reset_margId">Enhance the value proposition of NS by accrediting skills that NSFs gain during NS,
                  and enhancing the Certificate of Service to highlight the competencies and skills
                  gained during full-time NS.</li>
              <li class="reset_margId"> Provide opportunities for NSFs to contribute as SAF, SPF and SCDF Regulars on
                  short contracts after they have completed their full-time NS. This will enable NSFs
                  to continue to contribute to the defence and security of Singapore while honing
                  important life skills.</li>

              <li class="reset_margId">Increase recognition for the families of servicemen, such as through an extension of the
              Family Recognition Voucher (FRV) scheme. The number of NSmen who are awarded FRVs
              could be increased from the top 10% to the top 30% of ICT performers. The quantum for
              the top 10% can also be increased.</li>
              <li class="reset_margId">Introduce small gifts to servicemen at significant milestones of their lives, such as marriage
              or the birth of their child. Just as NS has become a part of NSmen’s lives, we care for them
              and celebrate joyous moments in their lives too.</li>

              the “NS Mark” which recognises companies with pro-NS policies and human resource
              practices, and could be a factor for consideration when companies bid for MINDEF/SAF
              and Home Team contracts.</li>

              requirements, such that notification will only need to be given for overseas trips
              of more than 14 days. This will increase convenience for NSmen.</li>
              <li class="reset_margId">Implement Make-up Training for high-key ICTs, which will allow NSmen to keep
              pace with their ORNS training cycle.</li>

              in non-sensitive areas within their camps like accommodation blocks and cookhouses.
              This will help NSmen remain connected to their family and work during ICT.</li>

              <p><strong>Don't be surprised if the voice on the radio sounds like 
              the singing coming from your neighbour's bathroom. It might just be the 
              latest local act to be featured on Power 98FM's new weekend show, <em>PowerSG</em>.<span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p>Singaporean musicians often sing the blues about how challenging it 
              is to find willing and suitable channels to showcase their talents.<span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
              <p>To provide a nurturing platform for local performers, the Singapore 
              Armed Forces (SAF) Music and Drama Company (MDC) and SAFRA Radio have 
              teamed up to produce <em>PowerSG</em>, an hour-long radio show dedicated to showcasing Singaporean musicians and music.<span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
              <p>Starting 8 Jun, listeners will be able to tune in every Sunday from 
              1pm to 2pm for their local music fix. Fans of local music can expect 
              acoustic performances and interviews from a variety of talented 
              up-and-comers, many of whom are from MDC, as well as popular local 
              artistes. They will also get the latest news on upcoming gigs.<span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
              <p>"MDC is a hotbed for Singaporean talent, having produced many 
              well-established performers, and it continues to be a source of young 
              budding talents.<span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
              <p>"(So) it only seemed natural for Power 98FM and MDC to work together 
              to showcase our local talents," said Mr Leong Teng Young (also known as 
              Mister Young), Power 98FM's DJ and Assistant Programme Director, on why 
              the radio station had decided to team up with MDC.<span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
              <p>Mr Loh Aik Khoon, Head MDC, agreed: "Both of us represent the SAF and
               national servicemen. We are about entertaining them, so it's only 
              natural for us to come together to…create a show that they can identify 
              with."<span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
              <p><strong>Hey Miss DJ!</strong></p>
              <p>Helming the show is a brand-new DJ duo who, collectively, look too good to be on radio.<span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
              <p>One half of the duo, Ms Biwa Mastura (pictured above in green), is a 
              recent addition to the MDC family. Trained in theatre, she has chalked 
              up an impressive resume acting in shows such as the<em> Ah Boys to Men</em> movies and various MediaCorp television programmes.<span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
              <p>Her partner in crime is Power 98FM DJ Jacqueline Thibodeaux (pictured
               above in red), or Jacqui, as she is better known. A familiar voice on 
              air over the past seven years, she co-hosts weekday show <em>The Ex-Factor</em> with Mister Young from 4pm to 8pm.<span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
              <p><strong>Hot like sambal</strong></p>
              <p>So how will this new show be heating up our airwaves?<span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
              <p>"It's going to be fun, interesting and spicy! We're gonna add our own
               flavour to it, and the acts we're bringing in are going to be 
              mind-blowing as well!" Jacqui offered with a cheeky smirk.<span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
              <p>She added, more seriously: "Because I know some of the artistes 
              (appearing on the show) personally, it will also be a warm, casual and 
              personal show."<span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
              <p>As this will be the first radio show to showcase MDC performers, Biwa
               is also looking forward to interviewing her colleagues: "We have great 
              talents in MDC that people don’t know of, so this’ll be a good 
              platform."<span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
              <p><strong>They ♥ local talent</strong></p>
              <p>As public personalities who work closely with Singaporean performers,
               both Biwa and Jacqui empathise completely with artistes who face 
              difficulties trying to hone their craft and make a name for themselves.<span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
              <p>Thus, they are thrilled about having this platform for new musicians to showcase their talents.<span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
              <p>Said Jacqui: "What it all boils down to is talent, and we're proud to have them represent Singapore musically."<span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
              <p><strong>Musical memories</strong></p>
              <p>For these two Singaporean girls, what was their first memory of local music?<span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
              <p>"It was probably in my teens, when I heard people singing in school, 
              and I thought, 'oh my gosh, they could have a career!' And I encouraged 
              my friends to 'go, try <em>lah'</em>. As I got older, I realised that these people did try to pursue a career in singing," Jacqui reminisced.<span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
              <p>As for Biwa, it was the first edition of <em>Singapore Idol</em> that 
              left a deep impression. "I remember one girl named Nana (Zakaria), whom 
              the judges called the 'soul diva', but she didn't make it to the Top 12.
               Years later, she had a single out, and when I heard her voice I 
              remembered her and how strong her voice was.<span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
              <p>"That's the kind of feeling I want to give listeners: to rediscover 
              singers that they heard of before but had slipped under the radar."</p>

              <p>Operationally Ready National Servicemen (NSmen) from an NS Guards 
              unit welcomed the slew of recommendations to strengthen National Service
               (NS) put forth by the Committee to Strengthen NS (CSNS).</p>
              <p>This was the feedback that Minister of State for Defence Dr Mohamad 
              Maliki Bin Osman received when he engaged the NSmen in a dialogue 
              session during their In-Camp Training (ICT) on 10 Jun.</p>
              <p>All 30 recommendations were accepted by the Government on 10 Jun. 
              These came after a year-long public consultation on NS, the largest ever
               conducted by the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF).</p>
              <p>"As I engaged the NSmen... what I gathered was that they found the 
              recommendations meaningful," said Dr Maliki, who chaired one of the two 
              CSNS Working Groups.</p>
              <p>"I am very heartened that the Government has accepted the 
              recommendations because it is really a distillation of all the thoughts,
               feedback, and recommendations of more than 40,000 Singaporeans who took
               part in that process."</p>
              <p>One of the recommendations, which called for a more flexible 
              Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) system, was welcomed by 
              Second Sergeant (2SG) (NS) Nachiappan Saravanan who works in retail.</p>
              <p>The 32-year-old, whose working hours are between 11am and 10pm, has 
              found it difficult to complete his IPPT remedial training (RT) in the 
              past.</p>
              <p>"It's difficult to manage 20 sessions of RT in three months. Now, 
              (these sessions are) spread over 12 months, so it will not be so 
              taxing," said the platoon sergeant.</p>
              <p>Another recommendation welcomed by NSmen was the change in the 
              overseas notification reporting requirements. They no longer have to 
              notify MINDEF unless they are out of the country for more than 14 days.</p>
              <p>"It's very impactful for me because my job requires me to travel 
              every now and then. It's actually quite a hassle to (submit) this 
              notification," said Lieutenant (LTA) (NS) Mohamed Azfar Bin Mohamed Taib
               , a marine engineer who travels for work twice a month.</p>
              <p>Staff Sergeant (SSG) (NS) Mohamed Asri Bin Mohamed Azmi, found the NS
               HOME (HOusing, Medical and Education) Award beneficial to him.</p>
              <p>Under the award, an extra $6,000 of Medisave grants will be disbursed
               into each NSman's Central Provident Fund (CPF) Medisave Account over 
              three tranches.</p>
              <p>The financial advisor is concerned about rising costs of housing and premiums of the upcoming Medishield Life.</p>
              <p>"I think the CPF contributions top-up is helpful to (NSmen) over the 
              long term, especially for those who are getting married or buying a 
              house, and for paying the premiums of the Medishield Life," said the 
              32-year-old.</p>
              <p>During the dialogue session, it was evident that the bond among these
               Guardsmen was strong. NS is something special to these Guardsmen, who 
              are now in their fifth year of NS cycle. Hence Platoon Commander LTA 
              (NS) Stephen Chai welcomed the move to conduct make-up for NSmen, who 
              have to defer their high-key ICT.</p>
              <p>This will help to keep the soldiers together, and enhance the fighting capability of the battalion, he said.</p>
              <p>"It's important to keep the unit together... everyone is familiar 
              with each other; there isn't much that needs to be spoken when we have 
              to accomplish a mission because of the camaraderie we have built over 
              the years," he added.</p>

              <p><span>The Vocational Assessment Centre (VAC) conducts a battery
              of tests called the Manpower Aptitude Assessment System (MAPAS) to
              assess your mental abilities. This is so that we can maximize our
              limited manpower by putting people where their abilities can be
              best used.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Your Vocational Assessment scores will affect
              important decisions, which include assignment to a vocation and
              selection to be a commander (Officer,
              Specialist).</span></strong></em></span><br> <br> Therefore, you should put in as much effort as possible to do the
              tests well and accurately, as this will not only help the nation
              maximize it's limited manpower, but also help us place you into
              vocations that will make good use of your abilities.<br> <br> <strong>What are the tests like</strong><br> <br> We use different sub-tests to measure different types of mental
              ability. Some of the mental abilities that we measure include
              memory, speed of responding, abstract reasoning, following complex
              instructions, solving mathematical problems, mental spatial
              ability, and psycho-motor skills. Please click on the following
              links to try out some of these tests.<br> <br> a) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Word

              reasoning</span><br> c) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Picture
              reasoning</span><br> <br> All the sub-tests are computer administered. Most of the sub-tests
              will present a problem or question on the screen and you will need
              to respond accordingly. Some sub-tests however, measure speed or
              hand-eye co-ordination and may look like simple computer
              games.<br> <br> <strong>How long is the test at VAC</strong><br> <br> Since we have to be as accurate as possible, we need to measure as
              wide a range of your abilities as is possible. Thus, the testing
              will require about 2 to 2 1/2 hours of your time.<br> <br> <strong>What to do</strong><br> <br></span></p>

              <p>More than 200 people have applied to join the Singapore Armed Forces 
              Volunteer Corps (SAFVC) a week after recruitment began — a response 
              Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said was encouraging.</p>
              <p>Giving this 
              update in a Facebook post Sunday (Oct 19), Dr Ng said 40 per cent of the
               applicants are permanent residents and 60 per cent are citizens. A 
              quarter of the applicants are women.</p>
              <p>Among the reasons cited for 
              wanting to volunteer were to “give back to Singapore”, “lead by example 
              for my son” and offer their “talent and service”, he said, adding that 
              he was “happy with the encouraging response so far”.</p>
              <p>The SAFVC was
               among the recommendations of the Committee to Strengthen National 
              Service and is aimed at giving more people a chance to contribute to 
              Singapore’s defence. The SAF plans to recruit 100 to 150 such volunteers
               a year over three recruitment drives.</p>
              <p>Applications opened last 
              Monday. Depending on the number of applications received, an applicant 
              may be informed via a letter to schedule an interview in about four 
              weeks.</p>
              <p>After passing the interview and submitting the required 
              documents, an applicant may wait up to four weeks before being called up
               for a medical screening.</p>
              <p>“The SAF will screen applicants 
              carefully to find those with suitable aptitudes and skills to be pioneer
               batches of the SAFVC that can strengthen our national defence,” Dr Ng 
              said.</p>
              <p>Volunteers can choose to serve in wide-ranging fields, from 
              operational deployments to professional roles such as legal specialist 
              staff and doctors — alongside regular soldiers in active units.</p>
              <p>They
               can switch roles during their stint and there is no minimum period of 
              service. They are expected to be called up seven days a year.</p>
              <p>Training
               is expected to begin in March next year and volunteers could be 
              deployed as early as the second half of next year. Applications are 
              still open.</p>
