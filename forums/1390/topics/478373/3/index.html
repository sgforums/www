              <p>The formation was initially formed on 1 January 1975 as the 7th 
              Singapore Infantry Brigade (SIB), with a total personnel strength of 
              four officers and five Other Ranks.<sup id="cite_ref-History_1_1-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Guards#cite_note-History_1-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-History_G_2-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Guards#cite_note-History_G-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The Brigade took command of the Infantry Training Depot (ITD) on 1 January 1976 and the 7th and 8th Battalions of the <a title="Singapore Infantry Regiment" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Infantry_Regiment">Singapore Infantry Regiment</a> (SIR) on 9 February 1976. On 1 July 1976, the 7 SIB was officially declared operational.<sup id="cite_ref-History_1_1-2" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Guards#cite_note-History_1-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> In view of its operational role, the ITD was removed from the Brigade 
              and the Singapore Armed Forces Guards Unit (SAFGU) was added to the 2 
              remaining battalions.<sup id="cite_ref-History_1_1-3" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Guards#cite_note-History_1-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-History_G_2-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Guards#cite_note-History_G-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>On 1 July 1977, the SAFGU was renamed as the 1st Battalion, Singapore
               Guards. A year later on 1 April 1978, the 8 SIR became the 2nd 
              Battalion, Singapore Guards.<sup id="cite_ref-History_2_3-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Guards#cite_note-History_2-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The 7 SIB was officially accorded Elite Status on 1 April 1978. With 
              the award of elite status, the 7 SIR was transferred to the 3rd 
              Singapore Infantry Brigade in 1978, leaving the 7 SIB with the following
               sub-units:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>1st Guards Battalion</li>
              <li>2nd Guards Battalion</li>
              <li><a title="Singapore Armed Forces Commando Formation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces_Commando_Formation">1st Commando Battalion</a></li>
              <li><a title="Singapore Armed Forces Commando Formation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces_Commando_Formation">10th Commando Battalion</a> (Disbanded)</li>
              <li><a class="new" title="School of Commando Training (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=School_of_Commando_Training&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">School of Commando Training</a></li>
              </ul>
              <p>This make-up lasted until 1980, when it was decided to make the 7 SIB into an all guards formation. The <a title="Commando" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando">Commando</a> units were transferred out, and the 7 SIR returned to the 7 SIB. It was renamed as 3rd Battalion, Singapore Guards.<sup id="cite_ref-History_2_3-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Guards#cite_note-History_2-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>On 17 Dec 1991, the 7th Brigade Training School (7 BTS) came under 
              the command of the 7 SIB. However, from Sept 1996, all Basic Military 
              Training (BMT) were taken over by Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC),
               and the 7 BTS was closed down. 11 Oct 1994 marked the formalisation of 
              Guards as the Guards Formation.<sup id="cite_ref-History_G_2-2" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Guards#cite_note-History_G-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>On 6 Apr 1979, a special parade was held to present the beret with a 
              new Cap Badge Backing to the 7 SIB. The then Chief of General Staff 
              (CGS), MG (NS) Winston Choo, explained that the backing was designed for
               the use of the Guardsmen as a symbol of elitism.<sup id="cite_ref-History_G_2-3" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Guards#cite_note-History_G-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The three battalions received their first <a title="Colours, standards and guidons" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colours,_standards_and_guidons">Colours</a> 11 Jun 1983. All Guardsmen wear a "Guards" Tab on their left shoulder 
              sleeve. The "Guards" Tab was presented to the Guardsmen on 23 Jun 1989 
              as a form of recognition of their elite status. On 9 June 1994, the 
              Khaki Beret was presented to the Guards Formation. While the infantry 
              green beret was worn with the Cap Badge Backing previously, all 
              Guardsmen have since donned their distinctive Guards Khaki Beret with a 
              deep sense of pride.<sup id="cite_ref-History_G_2-4" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Guards#cite_note-History_G-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

              <p><span>The Vocational Assessment Centre (VAC) conducts a 
                  battery of tests called the Manpower Aptitude Assessment System (MAPAS) 
                  to assess your mental abilities. This is so that we can maximize our 
                  limited manpower by putting people where their abilities can be best 
                  used.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Your Vocational Assessment scores will

                   you should put in as much effort as possible to do the tests well and 
                  accurately, as this will not only help the nation maximize it's limited 
                  manpower, but also help us place you into vocations that will make good 
                  use of your abilities.<br><br><strong>What are the tests like</strong><br><br>We 
                  use different sub-tests to measure different types of mental ability. 
                  Some of the mental abilities that we measure include memory, speed of 
                  responding, abstract reasoning, following complex instructions, solving 
                  mathematical problems, mental spatial ability, and psycho-motor skills. 
                  Please click on the following links to try out some of these tests.<br><br> a)	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Word analogies</span><br> b)	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Number reasoning</span><br> c)	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Picture reasoning</span><br><br>All
                   the sub-tests are computer administered. Most of the sub-tests will 
                  present a problem or question on the screen and you will need to respond
                   accordingly.  Some sub-tests however, measure speed or hand-eye 
                  co-ordination and may look like simple computer games.<br><br><strong>How long is the test at VAC </strong><br><br>Since
                   we have to be as accurate as possible, we need to measure as wide a 
                  range of your abilities as is possible. Thus, the testing will require 
                  about 2 to 2 1/2 hours of your time.<br><br><strong>What to do</strong><br><br> </span></p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do not worry too much.</span> All we require you to do is to do your best. Each sub-test has instructions to guide you on what to do.</li>

              <p>Comprising six episodes, the series revolves around the lives and 
                  experiences of eight young men enlisted in the army. On location filming
                   is carried out in the Ponggol Prawn Pond, Kranji Dam, Ridout Tea Garden
                   in Queenstown, Brookvale Park in Sunset Way, Shenton Way old market and
                   the army camps.</p>
              <p>“Army Series” was the first true drama series produced by SBC, with a 
              total of six episodes. It was also the first local production depicting 
              the NS life, long before the movies of “Army Daze” (1996) and “Ah Boys 
              to Men” (2012) were screened in Singapore. Its theme song “A Measure of 
              Strength” (ä¸€ä»½åŠ›é‡�), sang by the SAF, was used as one of the National 
              Parade songs in the late eighties.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I'm going for a medical referral after I get my posting after POP. I will probably get to excuse outfield/sun. So here are a few questions:</p>
              <p>1) Firstly, I am a Malysian PR, am I limited to any vocations?</p>
              <p>2) After my excuse what kind of vocations would I get?</p>
              <p>3) In my EI, i expressed interest in becoming medic, storeman, driver, is there increased chance of me going to those vocations? I really want to go to Medic.</p>
              <p>A bit of background, I am in an Enhance Leadereship batch, pass IPPT, fail SOC, indicated NO for command school.</p>

              <p><span><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>The
                   Vocational Assessment Centre (VAC) conducts a battery of tests called 
                  the Manpower Aptitude Assessment System (MAPAS) to assess your mental 
                  abilities. This is so that we can maximize our limited manpower by 
                  putting people where their abilities can be best used.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Your
                   Vocational Assessment scores will affect important decisions, which 
                  include assignment to a vocation and selection to be a commander 
                  (Officer, Specialist).</span><br><br>Therefore, you should put in as 
                  much effort as possible to do the tests well and accurately, as this 
                  will not only help the nation maximize it's limited manpower, but also 
                  help us place you into vocations that will make good use of your 
                  abilities.<br><br><strong>What are the tests like</strong><br><br>We use different
                   sub-tests to measure different types of mental ability. Some of the 
                  mental abilities that we measure include memory, speed of responding, 
                  abstract reasoning, following complex instructions, solving mathematical
                   problems, mental spatial ability, and psycho-motor skills. Please click
                   on the following links to try out some of these tests.<br><br> a)	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Word analogies</span><br> b)	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Number reasoning</span><br> c)	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Picture reasoning</span><br><br>All
                   the sub-tests are computer administered. Most of the sub-tests will 
                  present a problem or question on the screen and you will need to respond
                   accordingly.  Some sub-tests however, measure speed or hand-eye 
                  co-ordination and may look like simple computer games.<br><br><strong>How long is the test at VAC </strong><br><br>Since
                   we have to be as accurate as possible, we need to measure as wide a 
                  range of your abilities as is possible. Thus, the testing will require 
                  about 2 to 2 1/2 hours of your time.<br><br><strong>What to do</strong><br><br> </span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Vocational Assessment</strong><br> <br> Upon completion of your pre-enlistment medical screening, you will
                  be required to go through Vocational Assessment at the Vocational
                  Assessment Centre (VAC). This is done using a battery of tests
                  called the Manpower Aptitude Assessment System (MAPAS) to assess
                  your mental abilities. This is so that we can maximize our limited
                  manpower by putting people where their abilities can be best
                  used.<br> <br> Your Vocational Assessment scores will affect important decisions,
                  which include assignment to a vocation and selection to be a
                  commander (Officer, Specialist).<br> <br> Therefore, you should put in as much effort as possible to do the
                  tests well and accurately, as this will not only help the nation
                  maximize it's limited manpower, but also help us place you into
                  vocations that will make good use of your abilities.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><a href="http://www.ns.sg/cs/content/eServices/mindef/Register%20for%20NS%20%28nsreg%29/General%20Information/vocational_assessment.html">Click  here</a> </strong></em></span>for more information on the MAPAS tests and how to be
