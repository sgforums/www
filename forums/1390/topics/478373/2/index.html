              <p>The Imagery Support Group (ISG) was established in 2000. It 
                  develops and operates the Singapore Armed Forces' (SAF) imagery and 
                  geospatial capabilities. ISG started with a small and diverse community 
                  of mappers and imagery analysts. Today, ISG has grown into a 
                  professional and operationally ready formation.</p>
              <p>One of the key roles played by ISG includes supporting the SAF in the
                   conduct of Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations and 
                  Peace Support Operations (PSO). ISG does this through the provision of 
                  relevant imagery reports and maps, as well as imagery and geospatial 
                  analysis support.</p>
              <p>ISG was presented with regimental colours in 2007 and the formation 
                  headquarters consist of several branches including Plans, Operations, 
                  Logistics, and Administration.</p>

              <p>ISG's motto "Beyond the Obvious" encapsulates ISG's 
                  commitment to establish new frontiers in imaging technology, analysis 
                  and skill sets. It also represents its dedication to forming new 
                  standards and reaching new heights.</p>
              <p><strong>Units under ISG</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span class="redLi">SAF Mapping Unit</span></strong></p>
              <p>The SAF Mapping Unit was established in 1970 to produce topographic 
                  maps for the SAF. Today, it is the only professional mapping 
                  organisation in Singapore, providing MINDEF/SAF and other government 
                  agencies with geospatial products and services in support of their 
                  training, mission planning and execution. It is principally structured 
                  to perform two specific functions, namely professional mapping and 
                  promulgation of Geographic Information System (GIS) data.</p>
              <p>SAF MU is able to develop realistic three-dimensional (3D) virtual 
                  maps with accuracy and efficiency. It produces not just standard maps 
                  but also precise geospatial products that are akin to those provided by 
                  location-based services.</p>
              <p>The data of the 3D maps provides the foundation of precise map 
                  coordinates in various command and control systems, and is mainly used 
                  for planning and analysis, as well as an aid for navigation. In 
                  addition, troops use these maps as part of their battle procedures to 
                  understand the latest terrain conditions, as well as carry out risk 
                  evaluations of the area. Details such as the height of the terrain, 
                  building and vegetation as well as optical devices and weapon types, are
                   all taken into consideration when performing line of sight analysis, 
                  which can help to increase the situational awareness of security forces,
                   enabling them to monitor suspected threats more effectively.</p>
              <p><strong><span class="redLi">Imagery Analysis Centre</span></strong></p>
              <p>The Imagery Analysis Centre (IAC) was formed in 2003 to bring 
                  together the imagery analysis capabilities of the SAF into one place. 
                  IAC analyses commercial satellite imagery in support of training, peace 
                  support operations and humanitarian aid operations.</p>
              <p><strong><span class="redLi">Open Source Centre</span></strong></p>
              <p>The Open Source Centre (OSC) was established to support the SAF by 
                  monitoring news and information relating to global military and security
                   developments and natural disasters occurring in the region. The centre 
                  focuses its research efforts mainly on open source print, television and
                   online news.</p>
              <p><strong>Significant Achievements</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span class="redLi">Operation Flying Eagle (2004)</span></strong> - ISG
                   was activated to provide mapping and imagery support to the SAF after 
                  the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami struck Aceh, Indonesia. The
                   devastation caused by the tsunami altered the physical landscape of 
                  Aceh. It rendered many roads impassable and destroyed much of the 
                  physical infrastructure in the affected areas. The SAF relied on maps 
                  and imagery provided by ISG to enter the disaster zone to deliver 
                  humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.</p>
              <p><strong><span class="redLi">Afghanistan (2010-2013)</span></strong> - The SAF's
                   deployment to Afghanistan to support the International Security 
                  Assistance Force (ISAF) included Imagery Analysis Teams (IAT) from ISG. 
                  The IATs provided imagery interpretation and analysis support for 
                  multi-national troops operating in Oruzgan, Afghanistan. The teams won 
                  praise from international partners for their professionalism and 
                  commitment to carrying out their duties under harsh conditions.</p>
              <p><strong><span class="redLi">Typhoon Haiyan (Nov 2013)</span></strong> - Typhoon
                   Haiyan destroyed roads, bridges and airports making the delivery of aid
                   extremely difficult. The SAF Mapping Unit was activated to find access 
                  areas for aid operations. Their work supported the RSAF's deployment of 
                  C-130 aircraft to the hardest-hit Visayas region to deliver relief 
                  supplies and evacuate survivors.</p>

              <p>Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen visited the Imagery Support
               Group (ISG) this afternoon. During the visit, Dr Ng toured the 
              Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Mapping Unit and was briefed on the mapping
               process and imagery reports. Dr Ng also observed SAF Mapping Unit's 
              capabilities in producing realistic three-dimensional virtual maps.</p>
              <p>The ISG plays a key role in supporting the SAF in Humanitarian Aid 
              and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations and Peace Support Operations 
              (PSO). ISG does this through the provision of relevant imagery reports 
              and maps, as well as imagery and geospatial analysis support. Commander 
              ISG, Colonel Ng Boon Heong said, "The bedrock of ISG's capabilities is 
              premised not only on technologies and innovations but also on competent 
              and committed people. ISG utilises images and open source information in
               a timely and effective manner to support the SAF in mounting HADR 
              operations and PSO. ISG has played an important role in supporting the 
              SAF in HADR operations and PSO thereby enabling Singapore to contribute 
              as a responsible member of the international community."</p>
              <p>The ISG was established in 2000 and operates the SAF's imagery and 
              geospatial capabilities. Today, ISG has grown into a professional and 
              operationally ready formation.</p>

              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>I'm a JC student having NAPFA Gold for the new NAPFA format of the new IPPT.</p>
              <p>To be shortlisted for Vocational Assessment (VA) for CDO, should I voluntary self express interest at CMPB customer service counters on the CMPB medical checkup day itself?</p>
              <p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d9/Commandoposter.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="456"></p>
              <p>But then if not shortlisted, then next is all JC/ Polytechnic graduates now all enlist to Pulau Tekong island for BMT?</p>
              <p>Do CMPB have access to the online 'live' Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system linked up to all hospitals in Singapore? Medical history: Within a decade, I have been hospitalised 3 times: 2 times for high fever whereby one of which caused me to go into a seizure back in 2004 whilst the third hospitalisation was for gastritis.</p>
              <p>So how?</p>

              <p>In the <a title="Singapore Armed Forces" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces">Singapore Armed Forces</a>, the <strong>Guards</strong> are an elite <a title="Infantry" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry">infantry</a> formation specializing in rapid deployment. <strong>Guards</strong> are known as elite heliborne troopers. They are well trained in 
              heliborne operations and specialist combat skills that give them an 
              added combat edge. They are proficient in heli-rappelling, heli-landing,
               and other specialised skills that allow them to carry out heliborne 
              operations in various terrain, day and night. They are specially trained
               thus earning them the respect and status in the Singapore Armed Forces.
               The formation traces its roots back to the 7th Singapore Infantry 
              Brigade and has been actively involved in several National and Army Day 
              events since the establishment of the modern <strong>Guards</strong> unit.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>A Chapter Closes: 3GDS' 15th Mono-Intake 'ORDs'!</strong><br><em>Posted: 26 Sep 2013</em><br><em>Story by Edmund Twohill </em><br><br>The 23rd of August 2013 marked a very special day for the Commanders and Men of 3rd Battalion Singapore Guards 15th Mono In-take (III.XV) – It was III.XV's Family Carnival and NS Milestone Parade.   This was an opportunity for the soldiers of III.XV to celebrate the successful completion of their active NS cycle with their families. The Family Carnival took the form of an NS Journey Exhibit to showcase the experience of the unit over the past two years while the NS Milestone Parade consisted of a traditional "ORD Parade" that also featured the Assumption of Command by the NS Key Appointment Holders, to emphasise the continuity of NS beyond the active cycle.<br><br>The NS Journey Exhibit was a series of photo and video exhibits that depicted the achievements and experiences of the soldiers over the past two years. The servicemen brought their families and friends on their NS journey through a series of static and interactive displays that incorporated two main themes, namely, "Becoming a Guardsmen" and "Becoming Operationally Ready". The first segment of "Becoming a Guardsmen" showcased their journey from BMT through the Guards Advanced Infantry Training (GAIT).  Besides the sights and sounds of the photos and videos, there were combat ration tasting, camouflage-painting stations, as well as weapons/ combat equipment display. These stations gave opportunities to the servicemen to explain and re-live the challenges they first experienced when they entered National Service and the memories they had onto attaining their coveted Guards tab and Khaki beret.<br><br>Across the parade square, the soldiers of III.XV proudly brought their families through their journey of "Becoming Operationally Ready".  This segment depicted the unit's quest of building Professionalism, Perseverance and Purpose - and striving towards their vision of becoming a Mission-Ready unit, with Elite and Committed Warfighters and an Enduring Character.  The photo and video exhibits brought the sights and sounds of their overseas training and ATEC Evaluation. There was an Advanced Combat Man System (ACMS), soldier models for photo opportunities, and a Tactical Engagement System (TES) station. The TES was one of the most popular attractions which saw soldier scoaching their families and friends how to use their weapons effectively.  <br><br>The NS Journey Exhibit also unveiled III.XV's Honour Board and Achievement Board.  Winners of the "Guards Character Award", the unit CO Coin and RSM Coin were honoured with a display of their portraits (in the No.1 uniform).  The Honour Board also featured the awards won by the various Comapnies over the two years in III.XV's Best Coy Competition - ie Best Coy in IPPT, Marksmanship, VOC, and Combat Proficiency.<br><br>Summing things up, CPL Ahmad Jamhuriah, a Guardsman from Charlie Company said, "I think it is good that we have this event so the Guardsmen's family can see what we are doing. Today is a memorable and sad day as I ORD; I will miss everything."<br><br>At dusk, the stage was set for the much anticipated parade to begin.  3WO Suffian, the Parade Sergeant Major formed the Guardsmen up into four contingents in the prestigious No.1 Uniform, and marched proudly onto the parade square. Performing their drills with pride, honour and precision, the commanders and men of III.XV paid tribute to their Commanding Officer, LTC Fredie Tan, with the march-past and advance-in-review order (14-1-2), to mark the successful conclusion of the unit's active NS cycle. The parade also featured the assumption of command by MAJ Tay Kwang Leong, and the assumption of appointment by 2WO Rama Chandran, as the unit's Commanding Officer and Regimental Sergeant Major respectively in ORNS. This symbolically commenced III.XV's ORNS cycle and emphasised the importance of their continuous commitment and operational readiness in NS as 738 Guards.   The parade reached an emotional high point with the song 'Au Lang Syne' in the background, and with both Commanding Officers and the Battalion Command Team insalute, as the commanders and men slow marched off Victory Square, Home of The Elite Guards.</p></div>
