              <p>The
                       specialised skills that Guardsmen possess are vital to the SAF as they 
                      add a new dimension to the modern battlefield. To achieve such high 
                      standards is not without blood, sweat and tears. The men are put through
                       some of the most rigorous training. To be worthy of adorning the muchh 
                      sought-after 'Guards' shoulder tab and the Khaki beret, trainees have to
                       go through the gruelling 'Guards Officers Conversion Course' for 
                      officers and 'Guards Specialist Conversion Course' for specialists.The 
                      men go through the 'Guards Advanced Continuation Training' (GACT) to 
                      earn their mark as Guardsmen. These conversion courses push every 
                      soldier physically and mentally to the limit and only those who qualify 
                      will be given the right to be called a 'Guardsmen'.</p>

              </div>
              <div>In battle, Guardsmen are noted for their rapid deployment of troops. 
                      Their rapid deployment is by helicopter. Thus, an important part of 
                      their training has to do with helicopters. This entails not only rapid 
                      disembarkation techniques but also rappelling, coming down from the 
                      chopper via long ropes. A nice landing area may not always be available,
                       and Guards units may have to rappel straight into battle zones, or onto
                       rooftops. 
                      The Guards have to master many kinds of rappelling from cliffs and 
                      buildings. In one method, they come down a cliff head-downwards. All 
                      this business of jumping off cliffs may sound scary but the Guards are 
                      used to it such that it is second nature to them.</div>

                   Jan 1975 marked the beginning of a new chapter in the SAF - the 
                  emergence of the 7th Singapore Infantry Brigade (7 SIB). Two months 
                  later, it moved from its original location at Headquarters Singapore 3rd
                   Infantry Division (HQ 3 DIV) to Seletar West Camp. At that time, there 
                  were only four officers, five specialists and a few clerks. On 24 Dec 
                  1975, the first Brigade Commander of 7 SIB, COL D R Jambu, PPA, was 
                  appointed.<br><br><strong>1976<br></strong><br>A year after her inception, 7 SIB 
                  took command of the Infantry Training Depot (ITD) on 1 Jan 1976. The 7th
                   and 8th Singapore Infantry Regiments (SIR) came under its command on 9 
                  Feb 1976. On 1Jul 1976, 7 SIB was officially declared operational. In 
                  view of its operational role, ITD was removed and the SAF Guards Unit 
                  (SAFGU) was added to the remaining 2 battalions.<br><br><strong>1977<br></strong><br>On
                   14 Nov 1977, the late President Benjamin Sheares presented the 
                  Inauguration Plaque to the Brigade Commander, then COL Kwan Yue Yeong, 
                  during a ceremony held at SAFGU, Portsdown Camp. This signified the 
                  official opening of 7 SIB.</span></div>

                  SIB was accorded elite status on 1 Apr 1978. The sub-units then included

                  with the new Cap Badge Backing to 7 SIB. CGS explained that the backing 
                  was designed for the use of the Guardsmen as a symbol of elitism.<br><br><strong>1980 - 1983<br></strong><br>On
                   1 Jul 1980, the Commando sub-units were transferred out. 7 SIR was 
                  reverted to 7 SIB and renamed as 3rd Battalion Singapore Guards (3 
                  Guards). On 31 Jul 1980, the men of 7 SIB were presented with Stable 
                  Belts,another symbol that the men deservedly earned for their excellence
                   in training, performance, discipline, conduct and bearing. The then 
                  President Devan Nair presented 1, 2 and 3 Guards Battalion with their

                      more than 100 soldiers find out after embarking on a journey to become 
                      part of this elite group.</strong></p>
              <p>In the still of the night at 1am, they seem like dead men walking. 
                      After three days of rigorous physical training with little rest, 122 
                      soldiers are roused abruptly from their much-needed sleep, packed into 
                      5-tonners and transported to the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Ferry 
                      Terminal.</p>
              <p>As they march from the terminal, some hobble and some limp, their 
                      bone-weary and heavily-blistered bodies barely holding up the weight of 
                      their Full Battle Order (FBO). They are the very picture of extreme 
                      fatigue.</p>
              <p><strong>Guards 101</strong></p>
              <p>Just 22 days ago, 131 Guardsmen-to-be stood fresh-faced on the parade
                       square with only one goal: to graduate from the Guards Conversion 
                      Course (GCC) and don the khaki beret and Guards tab.</p>
              <p>Reputed to be physically gruelling and mentally taxing, the 
                      three-week GCC trains soldiers posted to the Guards formation in 
                      technical skills such as setting up helicopter landing sites and 
                      insertion into hostile territory by heli-rappelling.</p>
              <p>To successfully graduate from the course, trainees are required to 
                      complete a 12km fast march in 108 minutes, a 2km coastal swim and a 
                      rappel from a helicopter.</p>
              <p>To test their physical and mental limits, they also undergo a Rite of
                       Passage (ROP) phase, a series of missions and physical tasks towards 
                      the end of GCC before passing out as Guardsmen.</p>
              <p>Should the course prove too challenging at any time, trainees are 
                      given the option to ring a bell to signal their intention to drop out of
                       the course.</p>
              <p>Course commander 1st Warrant Officer (1WO) Saravanan, who is also the
                       Regimental Sergeant Major of 3rd Guards (3 Gds) Battalion, explained 
                      the purpose of the GCC: "As Guardsmen enter deep inside hostile terrain 
                      in combat, they have to be very strong in their fundamental soldiering 
                      skills and be able to work closely as a team. That's what we aim to 
                      develop in trainees during the GCC."</p>
              <p>1st Sergeant (1SG) Alvin Thomas, a 3 Gds Platoon Sergeant and 
                      Training Cohort Specialist for this GCC, elaborated: "Guardsmen are land
                       warriors of air and sea; we have to be adept on land, and in the air 
                      and sea.</p>
              <p>"The heli live descent and coastal swim build trainees' confidence 
                      and test their competence to operate in the air and sea, while the fast 
                      march trains their speed and endurance on land."</p>
              <p>He continued: "The ROP encourages team dynamics... Trainees are 
                      grouped into new syndicates (teams of 12) just before the ROP, so they 
                      have to immediately adapt to changes and work as a team to complete the 
                      various tasks and missions."</p>
              <p><strong>Always ready </strong></p>
              <p>Staying true to the Guards creed, which ends with the line "Always 
                      ready, ready to strike!", the GCC comprised many twists and turns to 
                      test the readiness of the trainees.</p>
              <p>Turn-outs, where the instructors wake the trainees up for physical training (PT), happened when least expected.</p>
              <p>Trainee 3rd Sergeant (3SG) Syahrulnizam Bin Aziz recalled the 
                      experience of his first turn-out in the early stages of the GCC: "The 
                      instructors turned on the lights in our bunks at 3am and shouted 
                      'Turn-out! Turn-out!'.</p>
              <p>"The banging and shouting woke us up, and we had to change into our FBO and run to East Coast Park (ECP) for beach PT."</p>
              <p>Flashing his usual optimistic smile, he said: "When we ran back from 
                      ECP, our energy level was very high despite our tiredness. We sang and 
                      cheered while running, and that was very memorable, because I felt that 
                      the turn-out actually bonded us closer together."</p>
              <p>Said 1SG Thomas: "Once, during the course, we even got trainees to 
                      report back to camp a few minutes after they had booked out, and we 
                      asked them to check their stores and equipment in camp."</p>
              <p>He explained: "We spring such surprises on them to ensure that they 
                      are always alert and prepared for anything. (So that) when they become 
                      Guardsmen, they will always be ready to be deployed."</p>

              <p><strong>Rising above</strong></p>
              <p>Despite being pushed to their limits, some trainees took pride in overcoming personal challenges during the GCC.</p>
              <p>At the start of the course, 2nd Lieutenant (2LT) Ng Li Bing predicted
                       that the fast march would be a major obstacle: "I'm vertically 
                      challenged; with shorter legs, doing the fast march will naturally be 
                      more difficult."</p>
              <p>Being the only lady in the course, she gave other stronger and taller
                       men a run for their money, as she successfully passed the 12km fast 
                      march within 108 minutes.</p>
              <p>With memories of the march still fresh in her mind, she said: "The 
                      thing that kept me going was the thought that I never want to do this 
                      again, so I had to pass it well, and not have to re-take the test."</p>
              <p>For 3SG Elamaran s/o Ambalagan, the coastal swim was something he did
                       not look forward to, revealing that he was not a good swimmer.</p>
              <p>He gave an account of his experience during the swim that took about 
                      three hours: "We swam against the current most of the time, which made 
                      us drift further away... It felt like we were never going to finish the 
                      swim, but as we sang the Liverpool song <em>You'll never walk alone</em>, it boosted our spirits and kept us swimming."</p>
              <p>Another trainee 3SG Chester Tay added: "My syndicate came up with the
                       strategy to place the weak swimmers, including me, in the centre, and 
                      have the stronger swimmers flank the weaker ones. After completing the 
                      swim as a group, there's this sense of achievement because before this, I
                       couldn't swim for more than 100m at a stretch."</p>
              <p>The heli live descent was another major obstacle for 3SG Tay, who had a fear of heights before the GCC.</p>
              <p>Remembering how his legs shook while standing at the edge of the 
                      tower which he had to rappel from, he found the confidence to rappel 
                      from a helicopter after progressive training.</p>
              <p>"It's a unique feeling to be in a helicopter for the first time! Up 
                      in the helicopter, I kept going through what I learnt about rappelling, 
                      and surprisingly, I wasn't as scared as I thought I'd be," said 3SG Tay 
                      after the heli live descent.</p>

              <p><strong>Breaking point</strong></p>
              <p>While the heli live descent, coastal swim and 12km fast march proved 
                      difficult for some trainees, the three tasks were merely the tip of the 
                      iceberg. Nothing quite prepared them for the ROP.</p>
              <p>Out in the field for three whole days with little opportunity to 
                      rest, the trainees were continuously given tasks to do, such as dragging
                       tyres through the mud, carrying fellow trainees on their backs or 
                      carrying 140kg logs on their shoulders. All the technical skills they 
                      learnt during the GCC were put to the test as they also carried out an 
                      attack mission in a built-up area.</p>
              <p>"I'd expected that our commander's ROP would be tough... I was 
                      mentally prepared, but it took everything out of me physically. It's the
                       toughest experience in my life," said trainee 3SG Harikrishnan 
                      Veerasamy.</p>
              <p>Even trainee 3SG Alvin Lim, who was later awarded the Best in 
                      Physical Training, found the ROP a challenging experience: "I've gone 
                      through BMT (Basic Military Training) and SCS (Specialist Cadet School),
                       but it's only during the GCC that I experienced this kind of extreme 
                      physical exhaustion.</p>
              <p>"The GCC really pushes you to the point where you'll know where your limits are, what your breaking point is."</p>
              <p>1SG Thomas added: "Although the GCC tests the trainees' mental and 
                      physical limits, the instructors always have their safety foremost in 
                      mind, and we also train them to look out for themselves and their 
                      buddies."</p>

              <p><strong>Trained Guardsmen</strong></p>
              <p>There is a saying that the GCC never ends, but it did on the morning 
                      of 6 Aug at Bedok Camp. At the graduation parade, the remaining 122 
                      trainees stood before proud family members, looking the worse for wear 
                      after the three-week ordeal, but maintaining their high spirits 
                      nonetheless.</p>
              <p>Chief Guards Officer Colonel Nelson Yau commended the graduands: "In 
                      the past three weeks, you have undergone the toughest training yet in 
                      your Army experience... You have displayed the confidence, fortitude and
                       determination required of a Guards commander."</p>
              <p>As the khaki berets and Guards tabs were presented to the graduands, 
                      the loudest cheers came not from family members, but from the 
                      instructors. 1WO Saravanan expressed his approval for the graduating 
                      batch: "When they first came in, what we saw were individuals trying to 
                      get this GCC over and done with.</p>
              <p>"Today, you can see that they are a team, always looking out for one another...and we're very proud to see that in them."</p>
              <p>Looking back at the past three weeks, 3SG Syahrulnizam said: "This 
                      course showed me the true character of my friends, that they are willing
                       to help and encourage one another during times of intense stress."</p>
              <p>He also spoke about how the course changed him: "I've grown to be 
                      more like a soldier. I'm now mentally and physically tougher. It has 
                      taught me resilience; to keep pushing on no matter what happens."</p>
              <p>Having demonstrated an indomitable spirit and comradeship during the 
                      trying course, these soldiers marched out of the parade square with the 
                      symbolic Guards tabs on their sleeves and khaki berets on their heads, 
                      having earned themselves the right to be called Guardsmen.</p>

              <p>Hey guys,</p>
              <p>this may be out of topic but my boyfriend just recently enlisted into ns and I'm aware of the fact that when they have their field camp they'll be given letters? I read somewhere that they'll only be allowed one letter per recruit and that worries me because then I wouldn't be able to send my letter because his parents will have their own letter to send, obviously. So my question is are they allowed to receive more than one and if they are, how will I know when and where to send it to? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks! </p>
