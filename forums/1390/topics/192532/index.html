            <div class='col-md body'>DILI : Crack Australian troops landed in East Timor as new fighting between the military and rebel soldiers forced thousands to flee the worst violence since independence four years ago.<br><br>Gun battles in the capital Dili and elsewhere left two people dead as Asia's poorest nation slipped closer to chaos, and Timorese Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri said the troops would help restore order.<br><br>"Their support will ... restore the confidence of the people, enabling the return of the country to its normal life as soon as possible," he said in a statement.<br><br>The violence first erupted last month when 600 of East Timor's 1,400 troops were dismissed after they deserted, complaining of alleged discrimination because they came from the western part of the country.<br><br>The leader of the rebels, Major Alfredo Reinado, was quoted saying he did not want to topple the government but insisted that foreign troops were the only way to prevent civil war.<br><br>"This is the only solution," he told the BBC. "There is no other way, or it will be war forever. The government has taken too long. It is not capable of resolving this."<br><br>Australian Prime Minister John Howard said the first wave of commandos, who arrived in mid-afternoon, would secure Dili's airport and help try to stabilise the tiny nation, with 1,300 troops expected in all.<br><br>"It's our expectation that this will ensure the airport remains open and functioning normally," Howard said.<br><br><strong>Timorese Foreign Minister Jose Ramos-Horta on Wednesday asked Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Portugal to send in forces. </strong><br><br>Portugal, the former colonial power, pledged to send paramilitary police, while Malaysian defence officials said that troops and police would be deployed. There was no immediate decision from New Zealand.<br><br>Alkatiri said a group of 50 anti-riot Malaysian policemen were due in Dili later Thursday, and that advance groups of military and police from New Zealand and Portugal should arrive in the next few days.<br><br>An AFP reporter said fighting subsided in the centre of Dili but was continuing in the suburbs. One gang of youths was seen armed with knives and daggers, and intermittent gunfights could be heard on Dili's outskirts.<br><br>The Australian Associated Press (AAP) news agency said a report on the UN radio communications network had spoken of 20 injured police and "many dead," but the report could not be independently confirmed.<br><br>The report said "a lot of ambulances" were needed.<br><br>AAP said the first contingent of Australian troops fanned out to secure the perimeter of the airport but it was not clear how many had arrived.<br><br>A Timorese statement put the figure at 100, while AAP said it was 50.<br><br>Accompanying the first group was vice chief of the Australian defence force Lieutenant General Ken Gillespie, who was to negotiate the rules of engagement in talks with East Timor government officials.<br><br>An official in the office of President Xanana Gusmao said an army captain had been killed in the town of Liquica, west of Dili. A police officer was killed but it was not immediately known where.<br><br>"His body was riddled with bullets," said a doctor from Valaders state hospital. Two people had been killed earlier in the week.<br><br>A South Korean caught in the crossfire was shot in the neck and was to undergo surgery, Seoul's ambassador here said.<br><br>The United Nations said it had set up a camp for around 1,000 refugees in the capital.<br><br>As the Australian troops headed in, refugees were headed out, telling of running battles in and around Dili, using everything from rifles to slingshots and machetes.<br><br>"They are absolutely petrified, scared and apprehensive in the extreme that there's going to be some sort of civil war," Margaret Gray, who fled the country on Wednesday, told Australian radio.<br><br>Ramos-Horta, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 while helping to lead the movement for independence from Indonesia, said "tens of thousands" of people had taken shelter in and around Dili.<br><br>East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was invaded in 1975 by Indonesia, which held the territory until 1999, when a vote for independence descended into brutal violence by Indonesia troops and pro-Jakarta militias.<br><br>Australia led a UN-backed intervention force to stop the bloodshed, and the territory was run by the United Nations until independence in 2002.<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/210270/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/210270/1/.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dun think SAF will risk our soldier's life and send them there now. Most probably once everything calm down, no more shooting between troops and rebels, SAF will send ADF there. Just imagine if the moment ADF lands in ET, a couple of our young sons kana KIA, wat will be the reactions of the families of the KIA. I notice the Aussie troopers r using M4 assault rifles wif dessert camo color patterns.</div>
