I live in hougang. My first bus to the nearest north south line MRT is 5:45am which is AMK MRT, in which i still have to take to CCK MRT and then take another bus to reach camp.<br><br>Now all those sounds alright if my book in timing is 0800hrs , but no! It is 0700 hrs (6:50am la considering i still need time to walk in). There is no way i can reach camp on time even if i wake up at 4:30am (which i plan to anyway)<br><br>I have highlighted this to my MT officer. He seems quite nice and all but he don't really seem to grapse the problem i face.<br><br>The other 5-6 people who started the first day with me. 2 live in Bukit Batok, 3 live in Choa Chu Kang itself! And one even live one road across (he can afford to wake up at 6:30am even)<br><br>I know this is army life, like it or not. But the point is , i find it impossible to reach camp by 7:00am, not because i dont want to but because it is beyond my ability (ask SBS why)<br><br>What should i do in this case? Can anyone advise.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My old camp was in SG.  I also lived in hougang.  Travelling time is insane even if its 0800 book in timing.  Sometimes good, get privilege to stay out overnight, can go home.  Unless I can lompang my pal's car who lives just down the block, otherwise I rather stay in.  But when stay in, avoid arrows where possible when short in manpower. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

There's no mandatory lights-off time; you can reasonably hoard all the barang to make you feel more at home; things like laundry can be put off to the weekend bookout; &amp; (regular) night-offs provide opportunities for winding down, whether it's to downtown or just hanging out at the neighbourhood coffee-shop.<br><br>I frequently stayed in even when I was a reservist, as opposed to booking out/in at an ungodly hour.</div>

During BMT don't say, SAFINCOS (then) was no bloody joke either (then at Pasir labar, I was on East Coast). After that Tekong Camp III (now SISPEC).<br><br>If follow men, official book in time was 3pm but needed to report by 1pm (because we used LRP before commando jetty was spiffed up). Loading 3 coys at one go meant a climb from the jetty over two other RPL tied alongside, one by one (160 x 3 coys + NCO officers), that takes 1.5 hr plus. No bus direct from East coast (change to no. 2 at Simpang bedok) mean leave house at 11.30am or earlier.<br><br>Book out even worst, earliest is after lunch on Satuday (i.e. 1pm), March out (yes March out from Camp III  to jetty takes abt 1 hour (not like your ten minute walk from MRT) load up etc (another hour plus) add RPL ride to command jetty (45 minutes) means arrive commando jetty earliest 4pm. Arrive home earliest 5pm, just to book in next day (see above). No time for washed No.4s to dry even.<br><br>For us, staying In is not an option, only non ITD units, i.e. Tekong CCO etc allowed to book out. For us (NCO officers) allowed book out once a week, only if no night training or no range next day (very rare).<br><br>Wait till NS then cry, now am at Clementi camp but suffered almost no nights off for 1st few ICT, no time to kiss wife or change baby's dypers etc. Packed programme etc. Just you wait.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Staying in is definitely better, especially if you don't have a car and public transport is not that easily available near camp.<br><br>During my NSF days, I was posted to Keat Hong Camp (old GSB) and I stayed in the south. Booking out means having to endure the agony of seeing busloads of army and air force personnel sardined in the bus and you can't board it.<br><br>My ICTs were spent in Tg Gul Camp. Super ulu place and only one bus servicing the area. Before I got my car, I stayed in even though the Bn can book out.  Go to the mess, get a beer or two, sometimes I get those that are booking in to da bao supper for me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

During BMT don't say, SAFINCOS (then) was no bloody joke either (then at Pasir labar, I was on East Coast). After that Tekong Camp III (now SISPEC).<br><br>If follow men, official book in time was 3pm but needed to report by 1pm (because we used LRP before commando jetty was spiffed up). Loading 3 coys at one go meant a climb from the jetty over two other RPL tied alongside, one by one (160 x 3 coys + NCO officers), that takes 1.5 hr plus. No bus direct from East coast (change to no. 2 at Simpang bedok) mean leave house at 11.30am or earlier.<br><br>Book out even worst, earliest is after lunch on Satuday (i.e. 1pm), March out (yes March out from Camp III  to jetty takes abt 1 hour (not like your ten minute walk from MRT) load up etc (another hour plus) add RPL ride to command jetty (45 minutes) means arrive commando jetty earliest 4pm. Arrive home earliest 5pm, just to book in next day (see above). No time for washed No.4s to dry even.<br><br>For us, staying In is not an option, only non ITD units, i.e. Tekong CCO etc allowed to book out. For us (NCO officers) allowed book out once a week, only if no night training or no range next day (very rare).<br><br>Wait till NS then cry, now am at Clementi camp but suffered almost no nights off for 1st few ICT, no time to kiss wife or change baby's dypers etc. Packed programme etc. Just you wait.<br><br></div></blockquote>Hmm, you too posted to ITD as instructor. I was at A coy (1983-85), camp 1. Posted to Tekong after SAFINCOS. Which coy were you in? Yeap, duty NCO quite suay, got to book in/out with REC. Luckily can take turns. During our time only regular OCs, enciks stay out. NSF (officers, NCOs) all stay in.</div>
