              <p>theres a very simple explanation. The better educated/skilled people are usually the ones chosen to become officers. With these traits, they will logically be more successful later in life. Its education/skill therefore success, not officer therefore success. it just happens that both the army and the corporate world are looking for the same thing, eg. intelligence and leadership</p>
              <p>take this example: if a 'man' in the army has 7 A level distinctions and has secured an overseas scholarship to an elite university to study medicine, do you think he will remain as a 'man' forever?</p>

              <p>there'll always be officers who portray themselves as a higher life form when in fact, they're taking power without responsibility and can't see their own faults.</p>
              <p>it's ok to be a man as long as you play your own part. never feel inferior, and never feel intimidated.</p>

              <p>Not true. Imagine an officer with average grades who could not enter a local uni as compared to a PES C "man" who has straight distinctions and is waiting to enter Yale or Harvard. The most probable route which the two will take is quite obvious from here.</p>
              <p>Besides, if a "man" is to start his own business and become moderately successful with it and is happy with it, he will have been better off than the officer slogging off in a high corporate company and hoping that somehow he will be able to find a less stressful job someday.</p>

              <p>not neccessary all those smart and skilled will be officers... i know people that are asst professors and medical students that are also "man".</p>
              <p>Whereas sometimes, you see in the army camps, those officers are not really smart, and they speak broken english and have fucked up attitude. My ex-OC used to be from ITE.</p>
              <p>Its not neccessary solely depends on education and skills. I believe, they will look at education, but you also need to be damn garang, helpful, and have some initiative and leadership skills during your BMT, field camp and sit-test to have the sergeants and PC to notice you before you get send to the command school. Therefore you must also know how to wayang with them for them to do that.</p>

              <p>After reading the replies, it seems like most people believe that being an officer does not definitely ensure one's success in future. Similarly, being a "man" does not mean that one will always be pushed around like how it was during NS.</p>
              <p>Well, just to share with you guys something which i have experienced personally. Contrary to popular belief that army drivers are lowly educated, bengish and full of tatoos.. I actually met one who was intellectual and educated. We had a meaningful conversation and debated on various issues such as politics in Singapore and regional countries. A MWO then joined in and trumpeted about how he will always vote for a certain party and why that party should wrestle his ward back from Chiam. He also claimed that a casino was important to singapore as it would brought about much wealth and economic opportunities. The driver then questioned the MWO about the potential non-tangible social costs of building a casino and whether economic wealth should be pursued at all costs. The MWO was dumbfounded and tried to 'save face' by asking the driver his qualification and if he was from a debating club. You all should have seen the MWO's expression.Lol.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the driver shared with me some of the dilemmas he faces. About how he had to follow instuctions from his PC when it was apparent that the PC's idea was not going to work etc. Can really sympathise with him..</p>

              <p> Anybody think it's possible for the CO of a reservist
              unit to meet his boss/superior during ICT and the boss/superior
              turns out to be one of his "man" in his unit? Won't it be funny and
              awkward? Lol.</p>

              <p>Such a meeting would be unlikely.  Would MINDEF spend $10K a month calling an exec in to perform reservist corporal duties?</p>
