As it was my first running event I didn’t know what to expect, but everything went pretty smoothly. I was aiming for a timing of 25 minutes, which I would be satisfied with for a first timer. I’m sorry I can’t do a proper race review as I only know much about reviewing races in blogs after the run. But I’ll tell you about my experience at the run. It was a slow start, and as I wasn’t at the front it took about 1 minute to get to the start line, and then I finally had some space to run. I had to dodge and weave through the crowd to find a clear path and some space for myself. There were a few other runners doing that too so I followed them. There were a few people who were walking in a line, making it hard for those who were running, but it was a fun run anyway so spirits were high. There was a distance marker every kilometer and there was 2-3 water points along the route. My personal target for the run was to maintain a constant pace and not to stop running, and I managed to do that.</div>
              <div style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; margin-bottom: 24px; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">I did stop at the water points of course, but it was only for a few seconds. The water points along the race route were managed by different SAF Units and the first Water Point was being managed by the SAF Commandos. It is my ambition to become a Commando one day, so it was a real motivation for me, at the 4km distance marker there was also a water spray thing spraying mist at the runners, really refreshing. The last 1km from the 4km distance marker only seemed like about 300m, but but as we approached the end point after the final left turn the final ttowards the finish line felt really good. My father wanted to snap a picture of me but I didn’t stop as I was too focused on finishing the run, but it was a fun run anyway, haha. After the run I got my first taste of sports nutrition as I drank a grape flavored sports drink which was really strong and got two energy bars for free, and I’m planning to keep it for future runs. It was a very good experience for me and I hope to return to this event next year, after improving on my running. My time was 23 minutes, and I am satisfied, I will work hard and try to improve my timing for future events.</div>
