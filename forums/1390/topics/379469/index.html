              <p>Check with your dentist how long is the recovery period. If its short, you can just do it before NS. Defer is close to impossible and i don't ever hear of a down PES due to mouth problems before.</p>
              <p>If u choose to do it during NS, try to do it after BMT unless u wanna OOC.</p>
              <p>The type of solider u wan to be will affect ur choice. A kengster or 1 who wants to gain as much experience as he can during the 2 yrs in NS.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>sorry to disappoint u, but if you are planning to do it during NS. There might be a risk that SAF will not allow you to do this operation. Unless  you can prove that your operation are somehow related to the well-being of your body. From what I know, having an operation due to cosmetic reasons were often not accepted in NS. I got a mate, he went to have a lasik operation and gotten 1 week MC for that case. However, he was summoned back to the HQ for that he should not have done any cosmetic operation which induces absence from work during his operation phase. But luckily, back than, this rule was not really clear and people didnt know it even existed, my friend plead leniency to my co, and he was not punished. But my co did mention this during a parade, and if anybody caught doing so will be punished. </p></div>

              <p>Hi, thanks for replying. I do not have any intention of doing the surgery during NS or use it as an excuse to absent myself. My current mindset is that since NS is mandatory , may as well use this opportunity to learn as much as possible then at the end of 2 years coming out as a new and better person, so actually i will be quite sad if i wont be able to complete my training course or disrupted half way.</p>
              <p>My main concern now is that 2 months may not be enough for me to be fully recovered but i guess, regarding this, i will talk to my surgeon next week. At least now i know that defering or enlisting at a later date isn't likely to happen . thanks. (:</p>
