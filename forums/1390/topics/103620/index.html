Stealth and accuracy are the essence of the sniper unit, a small and elite group in the School of Infantry Weapons (SIW). PIONEER lifts the veil from this unit and shows you what goes into nailing that crucial hit.</span><br><br>The enemy General is 800m away, safe amongst his troops in the forest and a heavy downpour. Suddenly, he drops to the ground, blood flowing from a wound in the centre of his head. Amidst shouts, all weapons go into position, and hundreds of pairs of eyes scan the area. But no one can spot the attacker, who has hit from afar and remains unseen. A sniper, the SAF's invisible assassin, has struck again.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The role of the sniper is mainly to take out the enemy's key commanders as well as heavy weapon crew</span>, who can cause great damage to the sniper's own battalion of soldiers in an attack.<br><br>Good marksmanship, keen eyesight, high physical and combat fitness, as well as the right attitude and aptitude, are pre-requisites in qualifying for sniper training.<br><br>Once recruited into the sniper unit, trainees have to undergo <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a nine-week intensive training course. Two courses are held every year.</span><br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/cyberpioneer/images/coverstory_nov04_img2.jpg"><br>The most ideal shooting position is the proning position. But depending on the terrain, it is not always possible to do so. The trainees, as seen above, practise 'live' firing in a sitting position using an improvised tripod.<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/cyberpioneer/images/coverstory_nov04_img3.jpg"><br>Sniper trainees doing observation using the M49 and binoculars. In proning position, they are tasked to spot small and obscure objects that have been placed by the instructors in the landscape.<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/cyberpioneer/images/coverstory_nov04_img4.jpg"><br><br><strong>Blending in</strong><br><br>The sniper training course has gone through some changes, the most significant of which are the shortened duration of training and an improved ghillie suit.<br><br>Reduced from 11 to nine weeks, the training course is now more compact without compromising its effectiveness. There is better time usage, including theory lessons conducted at night.<br><br>In addition, SIW has created an improved ghillie suit, which is made of the same material but is sewn onto netting instead of uniforms.<br><br>Its durable, lightweight and portable design allows snipers to extend their operational distance, reduces the risk of heat-related injuries, and allows higher mobility and better handling of weaponry. It has the added advantage of only requiring <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two minutes to change into, compared to 10 minutes for the old suit. </span>The new suit is also more compact and can be easily stored in a full-pack.<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/cyberpioneer/images/coverstory_nov04_img7.jpg"><br>The previous ghillie suit was sewn directly onto the uniforms.<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/cyberpioneer/images/coverstory_nov04_img8.jpg"><br>An improved ghillie suit sewn onto netting was launched in August this year.<br><br>-- <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/cyberpioneer/" rel="nofollow">Cyberpioneer</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Area of Training</strong><br><br>The course involves mastering <span style="text-decoration: underline;">six skill sets </span>and passing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two theory tests.</span> For each skill set, theory classes will be held to explain the intent and basics of that particular skill.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Shooting<br>Trainees go through range and field shooting to hone their accuracy. The shooting range is a controlled environment where an electronic target, which pops up at different speeds and timings, is used. The shooting distance is up to 500m. In the field, wind, light and terrain come into play as trainees experience shooting in realistic conditions. The shooting distance here is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">up to 800m.</span><br><strong>Equipment</strong>: The Steyr Scharfshutzen-Gewehr (SSG) sniping rifle, whose firing range is up to 800m.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Stalking<br>Trainees are taught to move in a concealed and tactical manner, from their final rendezvous point (FRV) to their final firing position. Depending on the environment, trainees may have to do tactical walking or even crawl.<br><strong>Equipment</strong>: An agile body and alert mind.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Concealing<br>This is all about camouflage. Geared in the ghillie suit and camou-paint, the trainee has to get into a hidden firing position. The instructor will try to spot the trainee, who must select a firing position based on the 'screen' (the amount of vegetation around). The shadow and depth of the position affect the visibility of the flare that results when his weapon is fired.<br><strong>Equipment</strong>: The ghillie suit, face camou-paint and lots of creativity.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Observing<br>To conduct surveillance on the enemy's strength, trainees are taught to pick up very accurate and minor details in the field, such as the weapons used by the enemy, the positioning of these weapons and the number of men.<br><strong>Equipment</strong>: A pair of binoculars, which has eight times magnification, and an M49 spotter-scope, which has 20 times magnification.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Judging distance<br>The distance from the firing position to the target must be judged as accurately as possible - calculations have to be made to compensate for the trajectory of the fired round. This judgement is the crucial difference in whether the target is hit on the first or second round.<br><strong>Equipment</strong>: Sharp eyes and good judgement.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Air photo interpretation and map reading<br>Using air photographs, trainees learn how to identify ground features. In map reading, they go through basic directional navigation training before moving on to more advanced open terrain, closed terrain, uncontrolled and island-wide navigation. In uncontrolled navigation, trainees navigate without instructors.<br><strong>Equipment</strong>: Stereoscope, stereo pair and compass. A stereoscope is used to spot features in air photos like slopes, the high points of the land, vehicles and structures. A stereo pair consists of a series of photographs taken to form a larger picture. The 3D images can be seen when using the stereoscope on the stereo pair.<br><br>T <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> heory tests<br>Before they can proceed to live firing, trainees must first pass a training safety regulations test. In the final week of the course, their knowledge on tactics, weapons and fieldcraft will be challenged in a sniper theory test.<br><strong>Equipment</strong>: A good memory.<br><br><strong>Two heads are better than one</strong><br><br>It is a common misconception that snipers work alone - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they actually work in pairs</span>. Trainees are paired up according to their strengths and weaknesses at the end of the course, and will remain as a team for the rest of their National Service.<br><br>One is the assigned shooter while the other observes and identifies the target. With the M49, the observer assesses the wind level, humidity level, altitude and trajectory value. He also tracks the target as the shot is fired. In the event of a miss, he can immediately inform the shooter where the first round landed and where the second round should land.<br><br>"When a sniper pair moves out, their lives depend on each other. It's him and his buddy, nobody else," said LTA Soh Wai Leong (right), a Sniper Platoon Commander who has been an instructor for two years. "They must have an almost telepathic understanding of what the other is thinking and doing. That requires a lot of trust and teamwork."<br><br>"Co-ordination is the most important thing. One observes, one takes aim, so we divide the work equally between us," said CPL Jaikumar Durai, sniper trainee. He is so close to his buddy that he even meets him outside of training.<br><br>"We live in the same room, we go out together, and during nights out we go for dinner. Even during weekends we'll meet up. Because for the rest of our NS, we'll be a team," he said.<br><br>-- <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/cyberpioneer/&lt;br%20/&gt;" rel="nofollow">Cyberpioneer</a><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sniper vs sniper</strong><br><br>What happens when you meet someone out there who knows exactly what you know and can do everything you can? According to LTA Soh, it is a game of waiting that requires great patience and discipline.<br><br>"When it comes to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">counter-sniping</span>, the one who has the better discipline and higher level of patience wins," said LTA Soh. "It's about getting into position and observing. We try to enter the other sniper's mind: if I were him, where would I position myself?"<br><br>"For one whole day, we'll look at all the possible positions and wait for the most minor of tell-tale signs - the boot to stick out, the torchlight to shine or the scope to reflect the sunlight. Then you'll have an idea of where he is and can then set the range," added LTA Soh. "You have to kill him before he kills you."<br><br><strong>Beyond skills and fitness</strong><br><br>Sniping is not just about skills and physical fitness - it is also a matter of mind over body, especially during long periods of waiting. After all, being a good sniper means outwitting and outlasting the enemy.<br><br>"Physical fitness can only bring you this far, the rest is all mental. After a few days of training, fatigue will set in. That's where you push them further, stretch their limits," said LTA Soh. "When you push them, you start to distinguish between the stronger and weaker ones. Their mental toughness makes the difference."<br><br>Just like in school, not everything can be taught and learnt through theory and practical lessons. To 2WO Jeffrey Ang, the Sniper Course Commander, discipline and attitude must be instilled through communication - talking to the trainees and building up rapport with them. Communication is important because learning should be two-way.<br><br>"This is a learning organisation; he has to give me feedback about how to do something. If it's not reasonable, I'll tell him why," said 2WO Ang, who has 15 years of experience with the snipers unit. "This method is much better. You make them think instead of just waiting for instructions, and both of us are learning as well."<br><br><strong>Sniping ahead</strong><br><br>As the SAF transforms into a third-generation (3G) force, the snipers are also implementing changes.<br><br>"As the snipers unit develops, we will take into consideration the ability of the snipers to support <span style="text-decoration: underline;">urban operations</span>, which are possible future operational scenarios," said Commanding Officer, School of Infantry Weapons (SIW), LTC Lim Meng Kiaw (right).<br><br>"There's a distinct difference in the requirements of urban operations. Instead of using only ghillie suits, the snipers are now trained to use materials from their surroundings to make a near perfect position to help them blend with the environment."<br><br>LTC Lim added that the urban landscape would also bring about a "focus on the individual soldier's initiative, skills and fortitude".<br><br>"In the hands of a sniper is the element of surprise. If used correctly, firing from an undetected position not only takes down key targets but also shocks and overwhelms the enemy. The goal is not to kill a hundred but to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bring about severe psychological strain and physical fatigue</span> in the concrete jungle," he said.<br><br>"In line with transformation of the Army, the school is planning to first equip our instructors with the essential knowledge. In the next couple of years, we should be able to trial, and then fully operationalise, the doctrine on how snipers can support urban operations," he said.<br><br>Small in numbers but deadly. Watch out for the snipers - if you can spot them.<br><br>-- <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/cyberpioneer/" rel="nofollow">Cyberpioneer</a></div>
