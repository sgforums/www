Not every country can accept high efficiencies. 1 automation and 1 highly efficient person may mean several people losing their jobs. More jobless people means more political problems.<br><br>Also, our Civil Service people are not courteous. They are not trained to give and accept gifts as a basic courtesy. Some may even look upon these simple friendly gestures as bribes. Do they know that the countries Singapore can export the 'expertise' to practices lots of courtesy ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

From what I have gathered, the SAF is very heartless - there are people who have served for more than a decade and who has unceremoniously had their contracts not continued. Terrible...<br><br>Another thing is the SAF is about fighting but in the SAF there is no real way to measure performance - that I suspect is why there is such enthusiasm for nonsense like ISO; the officer gets to show demonstrable changes and that is something that civilians understand.<br><br>TBH, having had some experience of the process, I think its all BS. Basically, anyone fool can do it and you do not need any sort of management prowess.</div>
