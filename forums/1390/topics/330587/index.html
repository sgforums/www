              <p><br><span>SINGAPORE : The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) provides its soldiers with the best equipment, and trains them well. But Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean said ultimately, it is the readiness and commitment of soldiers - especially those in leadership positions - to do their duty which makes the real difference. <br><br>He was speaking at a commissioning parade for officer cadets on Sunday. <br><br>Mr Teo elaborated: "Make good soldiers out of them. Help them understand the importance of having a strong defence for Singapore, and build their belief in what they are doing. Be their guide, friend and mentor. But do not take their respect and loyalty for granted. You will have to earn it. The best way to lead is by example. <br><br>"Whatever you say to them, the men and women under you will take dressing from what you do. What you expect them to do, you yourself must first be prepared to do. Train them well and push them hard, for this is the best way to give them the confidence that they will accomplish their mission and return home safely. <br><br>"Look after them and always have their safety at heart, so that they will follow you in the face of danger, knowing that you will do your best to lead them back safely again. Your actions, more than your words, will determine whether they will trust and follow you." <br><br>Minister Teo singled out Platoon Commander Second Lieutenant Kok Khew Fai's actions on March 8 this year, as those epitomising what it meant to be an SAF Officer - someone who was well trained and prepared, quick thinking and decisive, brave and selfless. <br><br>Minister Teo presented Second Lieutenant Kok with a special state award - the SAF Medal for Distinguised Act - for shielding a recruit from a hand grenade blast during a Live Throw in Pulau Tekong. <br><br>Second Lieutenant Kok, aged 20, is the first full-time National Serviceman to get the award. <br><br>His recruit's grenade had landed behind them, just outside the ditch in their throwing bay. <br><br>Second Lieutenant Kok immediately used his body to shield his trainee, as they threw themselves down close to the wall. Both escaped unhurt. <br><br>MINDEF said this was due to the bay's design which was revamped in 2004, and the men's familiarity with the safety drills. <br><br>The grenade involved has a damage radius of up to 100 metres in the open. The safety distance, while behind cover, is recommended to be 30 metres. <br><br>The exercise was suspended for half an hour for safety checks, before it resumed. <br><br>The recruit successfully completed his throwing exercise one month later. <br><br>Meanwhile, Second Lieutenant Kok said: "I do not feel that my actions that day was extraordinary. It is part of the drills that we have been trained in. It is our responsibility, it is our role of a commander to take care of the safety of our trainees, so they are our responsibility, we take charge of them." <br><br>This is the SAF's sixth grenade exercise incident in over 40 years. <br><br>Only six others - including a New Zealander - have received the SAF Medal for Distinguished Act. - CNA/ms <br></span></p>

              <p>but anyway...from above...some of U guys were saying that there are no ball-bearings,reduced explosive charge,the 2LT's duty,etc....but at the end of the day...would U do what the 2LT did?</p>
              <p>I think what the 2LT did was brave...the 2LT wouldnt have been faulted if he had followed all the necessary procedures and MINDEF could have just sent a "I regret to inform..." letter.</p>
