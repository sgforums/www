              <p>Accidents do happen. Tekong is well known for "special" events to happen too.</p>
              <p>my bunk mate took someone's firing pin to get that person in trouble. but after that he realised his firing pin was missing yet the person's firing pin was found. he of course turned frantic and panic so we helped him find.</p>
              <p>guess where we found the pin? inside his locked cupboard. he never opened his cupboard during that time and his key was hung by his neck... strange eh? welcome to Tekong.</p>

              <p>Changed already. Now the place where they stand to throw is like a round concrete place with a wall to protect them. The part where they stand and throw is up a ledge above the ground, and beind got another concrete circle that is at ground level with the grass.</p>
              <p>So if the grenade falls onto where they are supposed to stand and throw, they are to move back and get down from the ledge (where they are supposed to stand and throw) and prone down and do the normal protective measure drill. If the grenade land behind the concrete circle, then they remain where they are on the ledge and prone down and do the same.</p>
              <p>So in other words, if the grenade is down, you remain up, if the grenade dropped upstairs, you go down. The command is "pit" and "bay".</p>
