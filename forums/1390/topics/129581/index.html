So i sort of understand how the SAF werks with the regulars it has ...<br><br>Being a spec has equal prospect as a officer in SAF. Its just that the treatment is differrent. Officers will be treated with respect coz of their rank and specs will be fugged and kicked abt becoz of our rank ...<br><br>No hate for officers from me but thats how SAF werks. but pride is pride it will never chaange.<br><br>My explanation as u will see are spec based as i am specs .. officers route of advancements is not known to me.<br><br>Specs get more paid that a officer untill he holds a OC appointment. Till the time he can get to SAS.<br><br>Specs werk til 55 officers till 45.<br>The problem abt signing as a officer is unless u r a high flyer u will never get key appointments as there are too many officers and too little appointments. U may get all kinda shit appointments.<br><br>Being Spec, u can finish your PS tour by 25 latest and then drag the rest of the 5 yrs to do ops/IN spec or do instruction tour whil waiting for CSM.<br><br>You have to improve your education to atleast a diploma to have a gd career as spec as education is taken into view during ranking.<br><br>U also have to spend time doing external projects other than your job in order to get a gd ranking. Now wif so many people signing on, there is tough comepetition for spots.<br><br>My guess is saf is gd if u wanna sign on long term short term i dun think that gd as after the contract u will be lost outside .. unless u have money to start your own business ..<br><br>you have to be gd ... if u are gd and willing to work u can 90% make it ...<br><br>i hope this can help u .. all the best</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jerry82:</div><div class="quote_body">not yet.... thought sign on if got potenial can upgrade to officer?</div></blockquote>Yes u can, provided u get a CO recommendation at least (not too sure if Bde Comd has to recommend)during your tour as a specialist in the Unit. my coy had a specialist who held a A Level Cert who signed on. he was a Silver Bayonet holder. Topped his PS Course, was a very gd sect comd. Command and Control. He was recommended by my OC to to CO to be sent for OCS training.he eventually went to OCS after the men ORD.<br><br>However as a trainee, the possibility of crossing over to OCS for officer training is very rare and infact i haven't heard of regular SISPEC trainees crossing over to OCS back in 2001-2002 when i was a cadet still.<br><br>However my PC back in OCS was a SISPEC regular crossover. but that way back in 1996- 1997. So i do belive such career options may or may not exist since then ..<br><br>I heard most SISPEC regulars get posted to units and from there,if they really shine, they will be sent to OCS for training. However to cross over from unit to OCS, they must have completed PS tour. Not too sure if they need to complete a staff tour ( i doubt it)<br><br></div>
