            <div class='col-md body'>Its still possible for a Regular spec to crossover but during sispec training cannot ... u can do it after training once u become spec .. but u gotta have very gd results and a bayonet ... if go ps coz must impress there also ... so take it that a spec regular no chance to cross over unless u very luckey or very gd ...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by one-niner:</div><div class="quote_body">Yes u can, provided u get a CO recommendation at least (not too sure if Bde Comd has to recommend)during your tour as a specialist in the Unit. my coy had a specialist who held a A Level Cert who signed on. he was a Silver Bayonet holder. Topped his PS Course, was a very gd sect comd. Command and Control. He was recommended by my OC to to CO to be sent for OCS training.he eventually went to OCS after the men ORD.<br><br>However as a trainee, the possibility of crossing over to OCS for officer training is very rare and infact i haven't heard of regular SISPEC trainees crossing over to OCS back in 2001-2002 when i was a cadet still.<br><br>However my PC back in OCS was a SISPEC regular crossover. but that way back in 1996- 1997. So i do belive such career options may or may not exist since then ..<br><br>I heard most SISPEC regulars get posted to units and from there,if they really shine, they will be sent to OCS for training. However to cross over from unit to OCS, they must have completed PS tour. Not too sure if they need to complete a staff tour ( i doubt it)<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
