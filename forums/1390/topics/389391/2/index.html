              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>I have a problem that I would like to bring it up to the SAF
              Hotline, but afraid that this officer from my camp would do things
              to get back at me. I'll briefly just explained what happened.</p>
              <p>Basically, I was on night guard duty in my camp on Tuesday, 26
              Jan 10. I came back together with the rest of the guards in my coy
              back to my unit the next morning. Since it was a Wednesday, the
              rest of the coy had run. My OC is a well known jerk in my coy. I
              walked passed him and we had a little joke that he could not
              take.</p>
              <p>After our little conversation, he asked me to change to my PT
              kit and go for a run. Is this right of him? Does he have this kind
              of authority, even knowing that I did not have 7hours of rest?</p>

              <p>have never even seen chiobu in uniform joke with officers even..........maybe officer only likes gals to joke with him.....maybe he is not a soldiers officer....knows most officers unless they have known u for years would treat u as trusted friend even female officers are nasty to lower ranks if they dunno u.</p>
              <p>its the status thing...they treat lower ranks as recruits unless the lower ranks are somewhere in the special forces category and they start to earn that kinda respect.however special forces types lack a sense of humour and are too serious.</p>

              <p>Eh.It's NS.Just serve,treat the guy with the respect that the <strong>rank</strong> deserves and remain aloof from your commanders.Don't mix or socialise with them during your time in camp and keep an eye of them as well as watch your mouth.</p>
              <p>The minute you get your pink IC you are their equal. Then you can party with them,twist their testicle or do whatever shit outside but until then just stay low and let them do whatevr funny shit they want.

              <p>Well thank you all for your comments, be it good or bad. Guess I emphasised on the wrong point. The important thing wasn't about the 7hours or whatsoever. My question was if he actually had the right to do that; to make a soldier run even after guard duty.</p>
              <p>In any case, I guess not many would stand on my side since almost everyone think that it's my fault that I joked with that bastard. I guess no point bringing up to SAF hotline either.</p>

              <p>Just curious but is it impossible to be friendly with officers?</p>
              <p>I'm seeing comment like best to avoid talking to officers and stuff.</p>
              <p>I personally know mates of mine hanging out with their officer for drinks and stuff.</p>
              <p>Work is work and fun is fun. I guess know when to do what during what moment is the key.</p>
              <p>But i feel that your officer went over board by doing this thou but we shouldn't judge one man action and decide that every officer also like that.</p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>I have a problem that I would like to bring it up to the SAF Hotline, but afraid that this officer from my camp would do things to get back at me. I'll briefly just explained what happened.</p>
              <p>Basically, I was on night guard duty in my camp on Tuesday, 26 Jan 10. I came back together with the rest of the guards in my coy back to my unit the next morning. Since it was a Wednesday, the rest of the coy had run. My OC is a well known jerk in my coy. I walked passed him and we had a little joke that he could not take.</p>
              <p>After our little conversation, he asked me to change to my PT kit and go for a run. Is this right of him? Does he have this kind of authority, even knowing that I did not have 7hours of rest?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Don't take the run as a punishment but also as a joke and then you will feel better and drop it.If you have the sense of humor and the balls to snipe at an officer so early in the morning then be a man to take the riquochet.</p>

              <p>Yeah maybe you guys are right. Maybe I should just ignore that fcuker and just wait for a few months then get out of NS. Absolutely no one in my coy likes him. For the past 1year being in my camp and having him as my OC, I've seen friends having harsh punishments for the slightest mistakes one can ever make. Because of him, I feel I've turn racist against  his race because he's an indian. Every indian out there just reminds me of him (but of course I never harm them physically). Even honda cars(forgot wat type it is but it's the slightly small one) remind me of my dislike towards him.</p>
              <p> And he himself has gotten into quite some trouble before. He once lost a SAF thumbdrive, and caused the computers in camp to catch a virus for 2 times. When he was awarded the extras, he claimed that he can do them on weekdays[CDSO](heard from of my friends). He's been a captain for quite a few years.</p>
              <p>He was also the one who initiated RT for my coy, for those who did not pass IPPT. He made them stay in camp till sat morning. Sounds alright? Thing is, he expects them to come back on CNY Eve.</p>
              <p>Last year before we left for Wallaby for ATEC, there was once where he gathered us and told us to prepare a forecast of when the coy will be clearing their leave for December, so that he can vet through and approve. After we came back, there was</p>
              <p>During running days, he'll always be in smart 4 and wearing the yellow belt that reads "supervising officer". Reason being due to back pain. Yet there were few times when CO conducted ARR training, he could run with them.</p>
              <p>I'm revealing all this to show how 'wonderful' this officer is. To me, I can't think of anything good about him.</p>

              <p>Too bad you have an OC like this guy there are probably many worse officers,Warrant officers,specialists still hiding behind the SAF uniform.My advice to you is ,serve out the remaining days of your NS and keep clear of these scumbags.</p>
