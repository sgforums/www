              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>I have a problem that I would like to bring it up to the SAF Hotline, but afraid that this officer from my camp would do things to get back at me. I'll briefly just explained what happened.</p>
              <p>Basically, I was on night guard duty in my camp on Tuesday, 26 Jan 10. I came back together with the rest of the guards in my coy back to my unit the next morning. Since it was a Wednesday, the rest of the coy had run. My OC is a well known jerk in my coy. I walked passed him and we had a little joke that he could not take.</p>
              <p>After our little conversation, he asked me to change to my PT kit and go for a run. Is this right of him? Does he have this kind of authority, even knowing that I did not have 7hours of rest?</p>

              <p>I was previously an officer in SAF.</p>
              <p>I think if what you said is true, you do have a case if you feel that you are not fit to participate in the activity.</p>
              <p>But know this, 7 hours of rest is not a requirement for you to participate in any activity. It is more of a recommendation. The seriousness of the case would depend on specifically what type of run was this (various activities are classified under various risk classification; high risk, medium risk etc.) and also if whether, the instructors overseeing this activity were briefed on the fact that you did not have the rest period. The rest period is more strictly enforced in BMTC and places where it is known that the participants are in another separate classification of high risk; recruits at BMTC are under the high risk group.</p>
              <p>If you really feel that you have been wronged, go ahead and call the SAF hotline. You're confidentiality is assured. However, since this is a case where only you or a small group is involved, it won't be difficult for the OC to find out where the complain came from. He can confront you, but he cannot really punish you for this. Though he can indirectly make you're life difficult.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, you can request to see the Commanding Officer (Unit CO) regarding this. This request can be made through your PC or to the OC. They HAVE to comply. Especially since the complain is towards the OC. But again, the CO may take the OC's side. </p>
              <p>Either way, there is a chance that you'll end up being screwed over.</p>
              <p>OR you can just let this thing go and try to be more careful with the words that come out of your mouth.</p>

              <p>I was previously an officer in SAF.</p>
              <p>I think if what you said is true, you do have a case if you feel
              that you are not fit to participate in the activity.</p>
              <p>But know this, 7 hours of rest is not a requirement for you to
              participate in any activity. It is more of a recommendation. The
              seriousness of the case would depend on specifically what type of
              run was this (various activities are classified under
              various risk classification; high risk, medium risk etc.) and also
              if whether, the instructors overseeing this activity were briefed
              on the fact that you did not have the rest period. The rest period
              is more strictly enforced in BMTC and places where it is known that
              the participants are in another separate classification of high
              risk; recruits at BMTC are under the high risk group.</p>
              <p>If you really feel that you have been wronged, go ahead and call
              the SAF hotline. You're confidentiality is assured. However, since
              this is a case where only you or a small group is involved, it
              won't be difficult for the OC to find out where the complain came
              from. He can confront you, but he cannot really punish you for
              this. Though he can indirectly make you're life difficult.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, you can request to see the Commanding Officer
              (Unit CO) regarding this. This request can be made through your PC
              or to the OC. They HAVE to comply. Especially since the complain is
              towards the OC. But again, the CO may take the OC's side. </p>
              <p>Either way, there is a chance that you'll end up being screwed
              over.</p>
              <p>OR you can just let this thing go and try to be more careful
              with the words that come out of your mouth.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
              </div>

              <p>I don't mind letting it go. In fact, I'm going to ORD in may. I don't have to bother so much.</p>
              <p>My point is that he made me run without even thinking of the consequences. What if something did happen? It's such an irresponsible act.</p>

              <p>its true that some officers are fucked up.</p>
              <p>but understand that officers are people too. they arent inherently bad. they dont wake up and decide to be mean and cruel just because they think its fun.</p>
              <p>Since he is an OC, maybe in his experience he felt that you needed to be punished. And also know that making you run would unlikely cause you any injuries.</p>
              <p>I know that 7 hours of rest is optimum only because it increases the risk of heat injuries other than making you a little less alert. But if the person is not prone it is not really necesary.</p>
              <p>Like during ops or outfield, 7 hour rest is not even required.</p>
              <p>In fact if during training, it is recommended that personnel under 7 hours of rest only be given extra monitoring during training, which your OC could already be doing for you.</p>
              <p>Guard rest is a privelege. not a right. I have made recruits go for lectures after guard rest. Especially since there was no physical activity that day, only some lectures and urban ops technique lesson. </p>
              <p>My recruits complained to me and i let them see my OC, my OC backed my decision. We explained the reason to them and some accepted it.</p>
              <p>not really an issue</p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>I have a problem that I would like to bring it up to the SAF
                          Hotline, but afraid that this officer from my camp would do things
                          to get back at me. I'll briefly just explained what happened.</p>
              <p>Basically, I was on night guard duty in my camp on Tuesday, 26
                          Jan 10. I came back together with the rest of the guards in my coy
                          back to my unit the next morning. Since it was a Wednesday, the
                          rest of the coy had run. My OC is a well known jerk in my coy. I
                          walked passed him and we had a little joke that he could not
                          take.</p>
              <p>After our little conversation, he asked me to change to my PT
                          kit and go for a run. Is this right of him? Does he have this kind
                          of authority, even knowing that I did not have 7hours of rest?</p>

              <p>Yes, some officers are jerks.</p>
              <p>But no, you should also not joke about your superiors within earshot of them. Even if he had started it, you would do well to not cross the line.</p>
              <p>7 hours of sleep per day is also not an absolute requirement; on 3-day outfield training missions I could accumulate probably eight hours of sleep in those three days, max.</p>
              <p>In the end, yours is just a bad case of self-pwnage and a very good lesson on why you should at least take a good look around before joking about others behind their backs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Also, while joking with superiors, please remember that in the end, they are <em>superiors</em>, and there is a clear line drawn between you and them that should not be crossed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
