              <p>Well, you can always choose to go to command school, earn your rank and be the one leading instead of the one following. You have been given a choice right? Unless you did not meet the academic requirement. And if you dont wish to lead then of course don't expect to have a smooth ride through NS.</p>
              <p>It's the same in the working society, everyone's looking at the piece of paper that spelt "Qualification". A more qualified person will be in charge of you and still, you'll have to suck thumb, finish your job and go home. Instead of dishing out extras and confinements, your boss will throw you tons of unfinished work, hold meetings and still, you'll have to work OT.</p>
              <p>The fact that NS has already been reduced from 2 and a half years to 2 years. I think we should look at NS as a positive learning experience - since die die must serve.</p>

              <p>Office is totally different from NS.</p>
              <p>As what you said, boss throw tons of works and you have to work ot. That is work. Not happy, throw in letter. Not happy, can relax go drink and smoke. And also if daring, can question the boss. Boss will not ask you to sign extra or you cannot go home during weekend.</p>

              <p>But in NS, different. Fckuer officer teken you, you have to do. You cannot talk or argue back, or else your life in ns will be hell. In army, one is being hopeless and fear. Parents cannot do much but can only see from outside and parents heart will be hurt and worry.</p>

              <p>In any case, I really have alot against him. Especially for now just this morning an incident involving him against me occured. I really can't tolerate him anymore. Wheather or not the SAF hotline will work, I'm just going to give it a try.</p>
              <p>Then again, my previous direct superior(S1) was a very welfare guy, very protective. Also an officer, and even got the best S1 award.</p>

              <p>loki chaos,</p>
              <p>i advice u not to do it by complaining to strange channels.stay away from that "officer".if u wanna fight ..........invite him to a LEGAL boxing match.</p>
              <p>and then u will know which one isa better soldier.............i assure you even the CO will praise you if u won him in a boxing or karate match.or just stay away or record every conversation...or stay low n ord in a few months.</p>
              <p>this is the essence of the military.by complaining over the phone.....theother side on the phone will prolly curse u for givin them more paperwerk for chinese new year.:)</p>

              <p>i assure you if SIB or  MP comes in they would look with roasted face sayin,"why u gimme more jobs to do!"</p>
              <p>if u wanna go in....make sure u are backed up by family connections,educated family and your warrior spirit to annihilate your weak officer....the sib or mps arent going to solve yer domestic issues with bad officers. u either need to earn his respect or he earn yer respect.and then the CO will be the referee!!he would make a conclusion of what should happen to you and him once u bring it up to yer mp and everyone is involved.</p>
