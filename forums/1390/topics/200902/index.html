            <div class='col-md body'>Who of you have gone through it?  You guys want to share tips?<br><br>I'll start.  Go for as many points as possible in the day shoot.  Cuz the night shoot is a whole different animal.<br><br>Also if you have the rounds, don't hesitate to "cover" for your friend by shooting his targets too.  Especially when he has IA.  He can cover for you when you have IA.<br><br>For M16 shooters, better idea to use the big rear sight at night,  It's hard to aquire the target at night with the small sight.<br><br>Lastly, if you are a SAW gunner and can pull off the one squeeze one round ability, go for it.  As you effectively double the number of rounds you can shoot.  No one said you can't shoot twice or even three times as long as the target is up.  And if you have "shot down" your target, you can then shoot the target of your buddy.<br><br>As for the SAR shooters, I envy you for the scope but pity you on the mag change.<br><br>My recent shoot, just as I was about to shoot, my target went down, shot by my buddy in the confusion (those of you who have gone thru the shoot will understand), I shifted to his target which was in turn shot by the guy on the other side of him!  Thankfully I just had enough time to take that guy's target out before time expired.<br><br>Man it was a lot of fun.  Cross fire rules have gone out the window!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

But it isn't as easy to get as the previous shoots (thats why SAF can offr $400 instead of the previous $200)<br><br>Also, instead of just one guy getting it, the entire section gets marksman.<br><br>Lastly was your company equipped with just SARs/M16s?

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't know if there is any changes now, but had my section combat shoot last ICT, and almost whole company got marksman too. For the night shoot, we get to use the LED? (the laser thingy), so for me I don't aim at all, but rather look at where the laser beam is and squeeze off, got 19 out of 20 for day and night shoot. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
