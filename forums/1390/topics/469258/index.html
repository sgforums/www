              <p><span>National Servicemen can expect new measures to
              better motivate, support, and recognise them, as well to help them
              balance their NS commitments with their family and career
              commitments.</span></p>
              <p>These aims were revealed by the Committee to Strengthen National
              Service on Wednesday, after it held its first meeting at the Basic
              Military Training Centre on Pulau Tekong. Over the next six months,
              the committee will gather ideas from servicemen and the public
              through focus group discussions and town hall sessions.</p>
              <p>The public may also air their views on a new website <a title="www.strengthenNS.sg" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.strengthenNS.sg">www.strengthenNS.sg</a> or through e-mail at <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:strengthenNS@starnet.gov.sg">strengthenNS@starnet.gov.sg</a>.</p>
              <p>The 20-member committee is chaired by Defence Minister Ng Eng
              Hen, and includes Members of Parliament, senior military personnel,
              employers, and NSmen. It was set up during this year's Committee of
              Supply Debate in March, which saw robust debate over how to better
              recognise National Servicemen in light of continued immigration and
              the need to preserve a Singapore core. In recent months, members of
              the public have responded to the news by calling for greater
              monetary incentives, including subsidies for transport, education
              and health, and time-off to rest after reservist in-camp
              training.</p>
              <p>Over the next six months, Singaporeans will be asked for
              feedback on how to beef up National Service.</p>
              <p>The Committee to Strengthen National Service, announced in
              March, will lead focus group discussions and town hall sessions
              while also conducting online consultation sessions via a new
              website, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/strengthenNS/index.html">www.strengthenNS.sg</a></p>
              <p>The Committee meeting for the first time today, expects its work
              to be done within a year.</p>
              <p>Made up of 20 members, including Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen,
              Members of Parliament,military top brass and private sector
              employers, the committee will use the feedback gathered to
              recommend measures to enhance National Service as a critical
              institution for Singapore's continued survival and success.</p>
              <p>The measures are meant to motivate servicemen to give their best
              in serving, help them balance their duties with family and work
              commitments, enhance support from families, companies, new citizens
              and the broader community, and promote recognition of servicemen's
              efforts.</p>

              <p>i think the recent NS45 safra membership and vouchers are a good start as recognition to our servicemen.</p>

              <p>last time i remember during my NSF days the cooks are like SHIT!</p>
              <p>teh food go sands and taste like SHIT!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>late on as i ORD and serve my ICT through the years things got better.</p>
              <p>i feel if when the time comes a soldier deserve the break or rest time, can be on off day or during meal breaks, there should not be any inhumane hardsh add on trainings like tekan or sabo from officers or specilist. such things happen in the pass during my NSF days at tekong.</p>
              <p>cooks giv lots of rice to skinny people and little rice to fatter people. we must finish our food in the past when the BOSS or DO will stand at the rubbish bin to wait and catch ppl.</p>
              <p>now privatize cook house at least better can ask auntie auncle to give more or less of rice this and that.</p>
              <p>unless its stated in a traingin sechuled on tekan session, a soldier should nt be deprive of the humanity and right to rest or recuperate.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Total defence starts at every individual level.</p>
              <p>We can have the best technology and the strongest soldiers with best trainings.</p>
              <p>but the heart of the soldier is the core of allhe is worth to the nation.</p>
              <p>before we talk about training a soldier to serve a nation, we instill a boy with the right ideas, principle and way of life at a tender age before he joins the army.</p>

              <p>a minister of parliament, like the one quoted in the above article, probably had not in the course of his life been instiled or directed to the right principles and ideals. espcially when he holds  acertain decision powewr and say i our governance. such a bad fruit that is seen to surface and might have a certain degree of rotting in the mind has to be eliminated and eradicated.</p>
              <p>this post is not out of point. but please use this as an example to tell our soldies how wrong it is a person;s mind can be and how dangerous it is to have them in our ranks of soldiers or politician govermance of the country.</p>
              <p>the training of a good true soldier, starts at the heart. </p>

              For ORNS who receive less than $100, but had complete his full NS cycles or transfered to other formation like CDF, but still completed till age 39/40, you are entitle to the full benefit.
              My brother read from a forum (nvr ask where) and he call up. He was in the Army but when he completed his NS cycle, he was posted to Civil Defence till age 39. He received only $80 NS voucher. The CDF made a mistake by only taking the years he was with CDF but nt before when he was in the Army reservist. The Officer he called promised he will be paid for the balance $20 + 1 yrs membership in Hometeam Club. He checked online and indeed his online info was updated with the full amount! The Officer told him that they have updated thousands of ORNS personnel when one ORNS write in to highlight the errors and might have overlooked my brother detail n slip thro the net.
              My brother was even ask to spread the news and if he came across anyone with the same problem, just call him up.
              So anyone having the same issues, pls pm me n will get my bro to passed you the pone nos..

              <p>SINGAPORE – About two-thirds of Singaporeans surveyed said they 
                  are receptive to first-generation Permanent Residents (PRs) contributing
                   to national defence as volunteers.</p>
              <p>This survey of 1,251 citizens, which was commissioned by the 
                  Committee to Strengthen National Service, found that more than 43 per 
                  cent of respondents felt that first-generation PRs should serve two-year
                   full-time National Service (NS); and more than 60 per cent agreed that 
                  PRs could serve in a professional role in the defence of Singapore or as
                   a volunteer at NS events.</p>
              <p>“There is strong endorsement for that. Seventy-seven per cent said 
                  first-gen PR should be allowed to contribute to defence as a volunteer,”
                   said Dr Leong Chan-Hoong, the Institute of Policy Studies researcher 
                  behind this survey on attitudes towards NS.</p>
              <p>The survey, which was conducted between July and September, this 
                  year, also probed attitudes on women in NS. Over 70 per cent of 
                  respondents – both men and women – support having women serve in the 
                  defence force in a professional role and/or having women serve as 
                  volunteers to help out at national events.</p>
              <p>Overall, 35.8 per cent of women said that women should serve NS and 
                  nearly one out of 10 of the women said they will take up a voluntary 
                  two-year NS option themselves.</p>
              <p>“Interestingly, among the women, the endorsement for the four 
                  different options (on how women can contribute to NS, whether in a 
                  two-year full-time capacity or volunteering at ad-hoc events) are quite 
                  similar to the men,” said Dr Leong. “If you look at just women who are 
                  below 30 years of age … its 13.6 per cent who said they would serve a 
                  two-year full-time NS themselves.”</p>
              <p>While most survey findings were positive – showing that Singaporeans 
                  believe NS is necessary for Singapore to develop and prosper, and that 
                  there is strong public support for NS as an institution  – the ability 
                  of NS to improve one’s civilian employment prospects ranked the lowest 
                  out of 10 benefits of the NS. Overall, respondents would like to see 
                  better matching of servicemen’s personal skills and abilities to NS 
                  vocations. This would lessen the perceived opportunity cost of serving 
                  two-year full-time NS, according to the researchers.</p>
              <p>“Issues relating to employment prospects, relating to how your skills
                   are used, whether they can be applied in NS vocations, whether you can 
                  actually learn something from your two years of service – I think those 
                  kind of items tend to score lower compared to the rest of the basket 
                  consistently,” said Dr Leong. “At least from that point of view, that is
                   something that is worth looking into.”</p>
              <p>Over eight in 10 (84%) of those surveyed felt that the current 
                  two-year duration of full-time NS is “just right” in fulfilling its 
                  defence mandate – a sentiment that cuts across socio-economic class. 
                  Only 15 per cent of respondents think that NS is too long.</p>

              <p><strong>The Committee to Strengthen National Service (CSNS) says the 
              Singapore Armed Forces should seriously consider making provisions for 
              first-generation Permanent Residents to contribute as volunteers.</strong></p>
              <div>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The Committee to Strengthen National 
              Service (CSNS) said the Singapore Armed Forces should seriously consider
               making provisions for first-generation Permanent Residents (PRs) to 
              contribute as volunteers.</p>
              <p>It was responding to a survey on National Service conducted by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS).</p>
              <p>In
               the survey, the majority of Singaporeans said they are receptive to 
              first-generation PRs contributing to defence as volunteers.</p>
              <p>The committee which is reviewing the support network around National Service met at the Home Team Academy on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Committee members were briefed by IPS on the findings of the recent survey.</p>
              <p>The
               survey showed two-thirds of Singaporeans are supportive of 
              first-generation PRs to contribute as volunteers in the defence of 
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>However, only less than half say first-generation PRs should serve the two-year full time National Service.</p>
              <p>CSNS'
               steering committee member, Dr Lim Wee Kiak, said: "What you realise 
              from this survey is that majority are not asking them to serve the same 
              two years system. In fact, serving the same two years system is a 
              privilege. I'm glad that many people realise that, and that should be a 
              privilege that belongs to Singaporeans. So far as PRs, they acknowledge 
              that 'Yes, we should give them the opportunity to serve but let them 
              serve in a volunteer basis'."</p>
              <p>The committee also felt there is a disconnection in the perception of how employers are supporting National Service.</p>
              <p>The IPS survey showed that more than four out of five servicemen said employers are supportive of their In-Camp Training.</p>
              <p>However,
               two out of five servicemen pointed out that employers prefer to hire 
              people who do not have National Service commitments.</p>
              <p>Wong Wei 
              Peng, steering committee member in CSNS, said: "For companies, our 
              objective is very clear - maximise profits. Sometimes, depending on 
              individual companies they might choose to have preference over others 
              who pose less of a challenge in terms of work arrangements. I find that 
              not hard to accept.</p>
              <p>"I think the challenge right now moving 
              forward is how to mitigate that kind of challenges in a way that we find
               a right balance."</p>
              <p>Dr Lim said a ground-up approach is needed.</p>
              <p>He
               said: "There are a lot of suggestions that are coming forward. Some of 
              which we consider transactional, in the sense that if you do this, then I
               will give you this. I think what we are trying to do is to avoid that.</p>
              <p>"We
               are hoping for more ground-up initiatives like Burger King offering 
              special deals for NSmen. We hope this will be a ground up approach 
              rather than something which is government driven."</p>
              <p>The 
              committee said more engagement with employers is needed to get a better 
              buy-in from them on National Service. The key thing is to look at what 
              their concerns are and how to encourage more employers to be National 
              Service-friendly.</p>
              <p>In the IPS survey, 98 per cent of respondents regarded National Service as necessary, providing security for the country.</p>
              <p>The committee said the report reaffirmed the belief that National Service is a well-supported institution among the population.</p>

              <p>Every National Serviceman has an important role to play in
              Singapore’s defence and wants to have a meaningful NS experience.
              Some servicemen want to do more and increase their contributions to
              NS. How can we better meet our servicemen’s personal aspirations
              through their deployment, while ensuring operational needs are

              <p>After
               over 40 years, National Service is now woven tightly into the fabric of
               our nation. As we look to the future, to maintain if not strengthen 
              this commitment to NS, we asked Singaporeans for their views and ideas.</p>
              <p>From May to August 2013, over 10,000 participants responded with 
              their feedback and suggestions on NS to the website 
              (www.strengthenNS.sg), through emails or attended focus group 
              discussions. They came from different walks of life and included 
              operationally-ready national servicemen, full-time national servicemen, 
              regular servicemen, parents, women, grassroots volunteers, employers, 
              students and members of the public.</p>
              <p>In this section, we sum up their conversations which affirm that NS 
              is necessary and critical to Singapore’s security and prosperity. We 
              want to thank all participants for the many lively discussions on their 
              NS experience, the practical suggestions on what could be improved, and 
              good ideas on what should be strengthened so that NS remains meaningful 
              for the future generation.</p>
              <p>Four broad themes covering a range of insights and perspectives have emerged:</p>

              <p>“NS is a common language amongst Singaporeans. It fosters 
              national identity and pride. Regardless of background or social group, 
              it brings people together. It is a social glue.”</p>
              <p><br> “NS is one of the key reasons why Singaporeans enjoy peace and 
              prosperity today. Forgetting this is dangerous and could undermine our 
              future.”</p>
              <p><br> NS strengthens national identity and social cohesion. The shared 
              experiences and friendships forged during NS have become an integral 
              part of our personal ties that form communities and unite us as a 
              people. Reinforcing the purpose of NS will inspire national servicemen 
              to give of their best when performing their duties. There were also 
              suggestions to encourage more people in the community, including women 
              and new citizens to play a part in national defence.</p>
              <p><br> “Everyone must see the significance of NS and cultivate a natural inclination to preserve what we have as a nation.”</p>
              <p>“There are women and new citizens who may want to volunteer for 
              national defence. This will enable them to better empathize with our 
              NSmen and develop a stronger sense of national identity.”</p>

              <p>“NS was tough but it has made me more resilient, mature and

              <p><br> NS builds up personal character and resilience. National servicemen 
              value the opportunities for personal growth and the life skills 
              developed during NS. Many would like to take on bigger roles in NS to 
              contribute more to safeguard our defence and security. While NS is a 
              national duty, more can be done to help national servicemen manage their
               other commitments to family, education and work.</p>

              <p><strong>(1) Proposal for a SAF Volunteer Corps
              (SAFVC)</strong></p>
              <p>Participants in the “crowdsourcing ideas” phase of the CSNS
              public consultation suggested that there should be more
              opportunities for the broader community to contribute to National
              Defence. Some suggested that MINDEF should establish a SAFVC for
              women, New Citizens and 1<sup>st</sup> Generation Permanent
              Residents to encourage a deeper understanding and appreciation of
              NS.</p>
              <p>This topic has attracted widespread discussion, and we invite
              the interested members of the public to give further inputs into a
              preliminary proposal for the SAFVC.</p>
              <p>Should we put in place a basic training course? How long should
              the obligation period for a volunteer be? How do we encourage
              individuals to volunteer? Join us as we discuss these policy ideas
              at the Town Hall.</p>

              <p><strong>(2) Expanding Opportunities for National
              Servicemen</strong></p>
              <p>A consistent theme across all the CSNS feedback channels is the
              desire to play a bigger role in NS. Ideas include providing more
              opportunities for leadership, and allowing some preferences for
              vocational deployment.</p>
              <p><br> We would like to invite you to share your views on the preliminary
              proposals on expanding opportunities for our National Servicemen to
              contribute.</p>

              <p>The Defence Ministry is looking into the possibility of establishing a
               Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Volunteer Corps, which allows new 
              citizens, permanent residents (PRs) and women to serve in the military.</p>
              <p>Revealing this in a media interview yesterday, Defence Minister Ng 
              Eng Hen said the idea of a volunteer corps has gained widespread support
               based on public feedback, and is a "serious" issue the Committee to 
              Strengthen National Service (CSNS) will examine.</p>
              <p>While details - such as service duration, training and roles - will 
              have to be worked out, Dr Ng said the volunteers will not be 
              "administrative" but "part of the SAF", and have a military function.</p>
              <p>He added that military volunteers must have a "certain basic level of motivation, physical well-being and security clearance".</p>
              <p>Dr Ng was giving an update on the progress of the CSNS, which has 
              completed public consultation on how to improve NS and better recognise 
              servicemen's contributions.</p>
              <p>Following a trip last week to Finland and Switzerland to study their 
              national conscription systems, he said volunteers in both countries' 
              militaries are subject to discipline, rules and mission requirements - 
              which are a serious undertaking.</p>
              <p>Noting that young new citizens and PRs are liable for NS here, Dr Ng 
              said the volunteer corps will open up opportunities to older new 
              citizens and PRs, like those in their 30s and 40s.</p>
              <p>There is currently a volunteer scheme in the SAF, which allows, for 
              example, experts from different industry sectors to sit on Mindef's 
              boards and committees. Nurses and doctors can also volunteer to serve in
               the SAF's medical corps.</p>
              <p>National servicemen can also volunteer to extend their service after they have completed their NS training cycle.</p>
              <p>Besides a volunteer corps, Dr Ng said the CSNS will study how to make
               training more efficient and effective, and make better use of the time 
              in NS.</p>
              <p>It will look at how to facilitate the transition from school life to 
              full-time service for enlistees, and the transition from active service 
              to institutes of higher learning. This could mean allowing servicemen to
               make better use of the waiting time.</p>
              <p>Dr Ng has tasked a working group led by Second Minister for Defence 
              Chan Chun Sing to look into this, together with the SAF and educational 
              institutions.</p>
              <p>Minister of State for Defence Mohamad Maliki Osman, who was also at 
              the interview, said that in Finland and Switzerland, military officers 
              earn credits which they can use towards their university education.</p>
              <p>Dr Ng said the committee may work with the Workforce Development 
              Agency (WDA) to see how skills picked up during NS can be ported to the 
              workplace.</p>
              <p>But he cautioned that there are limits to this and said expectations must be managed.</p>
              <p>"So if I teach you how to fight as a combat soldier, are there 
              modules that you can, for example, work with WDA on?" Dr Ng said. 
              "Obviously, the answer is probably not."</p>

              Participants will then discuss the proposals in small groups before 
              taking part in the large group sharing, to be led by Minister for Social
               and Family Development and Second Minister for Defence Mr Chan Chun

              <p><strong>(1) Proposal for a SAF Volunteer Corps (SAFVC)</strong></p>
              <p>Participants in the “crowdsourcing ideas” phase of the CSNS public 
              consultation suggested that there should be more opportunities for the 
              broader community to contribute to National Defence. Some suggested that
               MINDEF should establish a SAFVC for women, New Citizens and 1<sup>st</sup> Generation Permanent Residents to encourage a deeper understanding and appreciation of NS.</p>
              <p>This topic has attracted widespread discussion, and we invite the 
              interested members of the public to give further inputs into a 
              preliminary proposal for the SAFVC.</p>
              <p>Should we put in place a basic training course? How long should the 
              obligation period for a volunteer be? How do we encourage individuals to
               volunteer? Join us as we discuss these policy ideas at the Town Hall.</p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>(2) Expanding Opportunities for National Servicemen</strong></p>
              <p>A consistent theme across all the CSNS feedback channels is the 
              desire to play a bigger role in NS. Ideas include providing more 
              opportunities for leadership, and allowing some preferences for 
              vocational deployment.</p>
              <p><br> We would like to invite you to share your views on the preliminary 
              proposals on expanding opportunities for our National Servicemen to 
              contribute.</p>
