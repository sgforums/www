              <p>Is there a course in poly called military police course or police course? So are the people in military police, or police in SPF, did they study in a wizard's school? Or did they study in normal courses in poly and university like everyone else and then go to police academy/OCS and go through on the job training and also professional courses while working? What courses and universities do the SAF scholars attend? Military universities? Or do they study civilian courses like everyone else in Penn and Cambridge?</p>

              <p><br> Hey hi farmer, how's the day been for you hoeing and ploughing in
              the hot sun? Look at you trying hard to convince TS and
              everyone here that you're not a farmer and that you're all that.
              But every letter and word of yours is a dead giveaway, totally
              exposing your farmer face grinning like a retard in
              this universe. Do you not know what a farmer is? Do you not know
              that YOU are a farmer? What right do you have to discourage people
              from pursuing their dreams or denigrate others and refer to them as
              the very thing that you are? When hello, newsflash, YOU ARE AN
              EFFING FARMER. Where did you graduate from? Didn't you end up in a
              local uni dump? Do you not know what an effing farmer is? Look
              into the mirror. http://sgforums.com/forums/1390/topics/382456</p>
              <p>YOU are a farmer. Now now don't forget that. It amuses me
              utterly whenever I bump into a farmer like you back in Singapore. I
              don't really meet such farmers when I was overseas. It is back in
              SG, where there is this large bunch of people, who form the
              proletariat masses, and who think that they are part of the elite
              and have no idea who and how much they are worth.</p>
              <p>There is no crime in being a proleteriat peasant like you.
              Absolutely no crime. Its when now and then, a frog farmer like you
              who fancies yourself a prince comes along and shits all over
              yourself, attention is demanded and people in the know point their
              finger and laugh.</p>
              <p>People like you, are aplenty. From a nondescript background and
              lacking the intelligence to move up the ladder of social mobility.
              You were one of the losers who ended up in a loser local university
              and think you've ascended to be a yuppie earning your measly
              pathetic two to three thousand sg dollars of starting salary,
              working as a farmer, maybe something lowdown like doing Operations
              (back office) in a bank. LOL. Freaking loser who hasn't seen the
              world and can't spell or string a sentence in English properly and
              is a complete utter disgrace to Singapore if ever in
              contact with foreigners. So thank God you're stuck here.</p>
              <p>You're a farmer and its nothing to do with how you could not be
              a commander in your NS days. Lots of people I know who are not
              farmers were downgraded. However your experience in your NS as a
              loser, when combined with your subsequent ORD life, in which you
              mistakenly believe you're better than the farmer that you are, have
              produced a macabre spectre, a satire, a joke for the children with
              a lesson for them to learn. You're the perfect cautionary tale. The
              naked king without clothes. The peasant who doesn't know the size
              of his hoe.</p>
              <p>The only difference between you, a farmer, and the farmers in
              the SAF, is you didn't qualify for command school when in
              NS. And that you a farmer make even less money than
              them, who are also farmers. You are merely a farmer who's
              worth less than those farmers you're talking about.</p>
              <p>Get your mom to buy you a mirror, peasant.</p>
              <p>BTW, in your farmer stupor a few days ago, you asked me
              "why dun i sign on if its so good"? LOL. You know the people who
              are cherry-picked, creamed off and painstakingly groomed in the SAF
              to eventually run the country, they are my sec schoolmates,
              after school football buds, friends in university. I'm not
              presuming I'm so good that I'd have been one of them for
              sure if i tried. But if I tried I'd have somewhat of a shot
              even if I failed.</p>
              <p>As for you, you're so far off from the universe of non farmers,
              you're the posterboy of the delusional farmer ho' with a hoe
              digging with your changkul dreaming (yuppie) dreams. You're a
              farmer earning less than other farmers, yet have the cheek to think
              you're greater than other farmers. Other, being the operative word.
              You're just so sad.</p>
              <p>Enough with the preachy "Oh I post such constructive
              comments". You're making us puke since you've been exposed and
              embarrassed countless times and we know you're a phoney. (refer to
              Navy thread)</p>

              <p>It is amazing that you are an officer. Dont you think that you are demonstrating a poor example as leader here. What type of leader who shows no respect for his men? I think you have forgot that most of your footmen are likely to be LCP or CPL, who did not get into cadet school? Is that what is being thought in cadet school that you are superior than others? And for every post you make you are scolding people,retard, moron.  </p>
              <p>I think your farmers concept comes from "Rich Dad Poor Dad" or similar books? It is not exclusively right but it is not wrong either. </p>
              <p>To me you are very funny, </p>
              <p>On one hand you say signing on is good, yet SAF dont offer you overseas scholarships as they do for me when I am in JC? Why dont you pick up the offer and join SAF for 6 years and later join PAP, then MP?  Do you notice that most of forumers are advising TS to consider the bond carefully, asking them to have a taste of military life before signing on? Their views are neutral, and not putting down on TS to make his decision. And yet you are sweeping every1 down and condemning them as farmer, without knowing these people at all. </p>
              <p>You talk about promotions and yet you dont know the politics and internal affairs? Or you are just a low rank 1 choco bar officer in Army, you dont know much. </p>
              <p>And... there is such a thing called "Freedom". For other jobs, when one dont like the boss or job, one just throw him a resignation letter, one cannot do the same in SAF. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>It really depends on what is motivating you to consider a military 
                  career. Like most of everyone here has advised, I suggest going through 
                  BMT to get a taste of the lifestlye before you decide. I've always 
                  wanted to try for OCS, simply because I wanted to see how far I could go
                   with my time spent in there, but the first few weeks of BMT was hell 
                  for me and I almost gave up.</p>
              <p>I believe promotions in SAF are based
                   on your career estimated potential (CEP). Every regular, depending on a
                   number of criteria - one of which being academic achievements, is given a 
                  CEP rank which denotes the maximum rank he/she can attain. I'm taking a 
                  stab in the dark here but I think diploma holders are Maj/LTC, degree 
                  holders who were offered scholarships like SAS,SMS,SAFOS are COL and 
                  above. Not sure about LSA holders but I would say it's LTC+ and above.<br> <br> So if you sign up at the age of 20 and your CEP is MAJ, you have 25 
                  years to climb up 4 ranks (2LT, LTA, CPT, MAJ). Doubtful you will reach 
                  CPT after 3 years of service and spend the next 2 decades stuck at that 
                  rank. SAF will probably spread it out and use it to encourage you to 
                  stay.</p>
              <p>"Scholars", as so many people would call them, have many 
                  more ranks to burn through in the same number of years so it would make 
                  sense that their promotion would seem quicker. Unfortunately, the nature
                   of our society makes these people extremely valuable as assets and SAF 
                  is anything but dumb. With constant promotion and attractive pay 
                  packages, SAF can keep their leaders from bleeding out into the private 
                  sector.</p>
              <p>So, yes. You will likely see 2LT for a year or so, and 
                  LTA/CPT for a long, long  time. You will likely hate those "scholars" 
                  who only wore their 2LT epaulette during their commissioning parade and 
                  LTA for a year or less, breeze through CPT in a few years and become a 
                  Maj, whilst you are still sporting your LTA. Don't want to rain on your 
                  parade but such is life.. Singapore isn't a very forgiving society when 
                  it comes to education, I'm afraid.</p>
              <p>My reasons for signing 
                  were:</p>
              <p>1) University has always been my goal since I was a kid, but
                   I couldn't afford it without my parents' help. SAF offered to pay for 
                  me. My tuition fees + living expenses are astronomically high and I 
                  would be in debt to some bank for many, many years if I had to pay for 
                  them myself.</p>
              <p>2) The offer given to me ensured that I could immediately, and 
                  totally stop relying on my parents financially. My parents, being hard 
                  working adults from the baby boomer generation deserves to enjoy the 
                  fruit of their labour and I doubt spending the last of their savings on 
                  their leech of a son is what they had in mind.</p>
              <p>3) Guaranteed 
                  employment upon graduation. Job prospects didn't seem promising a couple
                   of years ago and I figure the years in Uni and subsequently serving my 
                  bond would let me ride out the bleak economy comfortably and once I'm 
                  done, I could hit the ground running and have savings to look for a 
                  second career I would really enjoy. <br> I've have friends who have graduated many months ago but are now getting
                   allowance from their parents because they couldn't find a job.</p>
              <p>So
                   those are my reasons. It is mainly to prepare myself for my next step 
                  in life. Whenever I start to regret my decision, I look back to these 
                  and I'll feel better.</p>
              <p>Which is why I suggest you think long and 
                  hard and formulate a list of reasons for signing (or not signing for 
                  that matter) because these will keep you going when your passion, or 
                  whatever floats your boat, starts to burn low.<br> <br>Also, don't believe your own eyes or the words of others who have 
                  not been through that the life of an officer is all fun and games. In 
                  fact, don't even believe the advertisements you see or those recruitment
                   CPTs who will visit tekong a few weeks into BMT, who will have you 
                  believe that being an officer is all about wearing your number 1 and 
                  posing in cool positions. Don't let power be your motivation to join the
                   officer corp because power you are given is something you should learn 
                  to respect and fear.</p>
              <p>Anyways, you will spend aprox &gt;60% of your time planning 
                  missions, &gt;30% presenting 
                  those plans, ~5% executing those plans, and ~5% training for your next 
                  appointment. Powerpoint Rangers is probably one of the names you will 
                  have to get used to. But it can be rewarding and you get to 
                  experience a lot more than anyone else. Although sometimes, it feels 
                  like you to
                   have to experience a lot of nasty things before it gets rewarding. Same
                   could be said for everything in life, I guess.</p>

              years to climb up 4 ranks (2LT, LTA, CPT, MAJ). Doubtful you will
              reach CPT after 3 years of service and spend the next 2 decades
              stuck at that rank. SAF will probably spread it out and use it to
              encourage you to stay.</p>
              <p>"Scholars", as so many people would call them, have many more
              ranks to burn through in the same number of years so it would make
              sense that their promotion would seem quicker. Unfortunately, the
              nature of our society makes these people extremely valuable as
              assets and SAF is anything but dumb. With constant promotion and
              attractive pay packages, SAF can keep their leaders from bleeding
              out into the private sector.</p>
              <p>So, yes. You will likely see 2LT for a year or so, and LTA/CPT
              for a long, long  time. You will likely hate those "scholars"
              who only wore their 2LT epaulette during their commissioning parade
              and LTA for a year or less, breeze through CPT in a few years and
              become a Maj, whilst you are still sporting your LTA. Don't want to
              rain on your parade but such is life.. Singapore isn't a very
              forgiving society when it comes to education, I'm afraid.</p>
              <p>My reasons for signing were:</p>
              <p>1) University has always been my goal since I was a kid, but I
              couldn't afford it without my parents' help. SAF offered to pay for
              me. My tuition fees + living expenses are astronomically high and I
              would be in debt to some bank for many, many years if I had to pay
              for them myself.</p>
              <p>2) The offer given to me ensured that I could immediately, and
              totally stop relying on my parents financially. My parents, being
              hard working adults from the baby boomer generation deserves to
              enjoy the fruit of their labour and I doubt spending the last of
              their savings on their leech of a son is what they had in mind.</p>
              <p>3) Guaranteed employment upon graduation. Job prospects didn't
              seem promising a couple of years ago and I figure the years in Uni
              and subsequently serving my bond would let me ride out the bleak
              economy comfortably and once I'm done, I could hit the ground
              running and have savings to look for a second career I would really
              enjoy.<br> I've have friends who have graduated many months ago but are now
              getting allowance from their parents because they couldn't find a
              job.</p>
              <p>So those are my reasons. It is mainly to prepare myself for my
              next step in life. Whenever I start to regret my decision, I look
              back to these and I'll feel better.</p>
              <p>Which is why I suggest you think long and hard and formulate a
              list of reasons for signing (or not signing for that matter)
              because these will keep you going when your passion, or whatever
              floats your boat, starts to burn low.<br> <br> Also, don't believe your own eyes or the words of others who have
              not been through that the life of an officer is all fun and games.
              In fact, don't even believe the advertisements you see or those
              recruitment CPTs who will visit tekong a few weeks into BMT, who
              will have you believe that being an officer is all about wearing
              your number 1 and posing in cool positions. Don't let power be your
              motivation to join the officer corp because power you are given is
              something you should learn to respect and fear.</p>
              <p>Anyways, you will spend aprox &gt;60% of your time planning
              missions, &gt;30% presenting those plans, ~5% executing those
              plans, and ~5% training for your next appointment. Powerpoint
              Rangers is probably one of the names you will have to get used to.
              But it can be rewarding and you get to experience a lot more than
              anyone else. Although sometimes, it feels like you to have to
              experience a lot of nasty things before it gets rewarding. Same
              could be said for everything in life, I guess.</p>

              <p>thanks for all the advices.</p>
              <p>if it is possible, i will try for commandos/guards/armour becos to me, if i wanna sign on, i might as well sign those with a better pay, at least that could keep me going. Of cos i wouldnt know whether WILL IT really keep me going, but i hope it will. </p>
              <p>just to clarify, will there be any difference if i sign cammando officer and other vocations, cos i heard cdos are specialised vocation, what i was tinking is that i could sign commando officer and the farmer/scholar system would not be treated as too impt.</p>
              <p>and does the pay of MP and commando/guards/armour/ officers' pay have a big difference? i know i have a very big range of what i wan but afterall, i still have to find out more of other different vocations before i decide on my decision.</p>
              <p>and i reallyreally thank you guys for your comments. thanks again</p>

              at minimum wage, and now you come up with another joke about being
              offered a military scholarship overseas when everyone knows you
              said you never made it command school?</p>
              <p>You're the undisputed and biggest clown in the history of this
              forum. What a fucking loser.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>I can only see a joker, bashing me with a long paragraph of words, which I dont even bother to read. Go and do something useful, boy. Maybe pick up some courses or do some push ups will be good for you. If you are really smart, you would not waste time typing nonsense, posting it in public. That is my last piece of advice for you. </p>
              <p>And... I will ignore you from now onwards. </p>
