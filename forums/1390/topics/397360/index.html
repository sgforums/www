              <p>Hi everyone, I had been thinking of signing on for around 1year plus already. Had been thinking of signing on as I am contented with the salary and my diploma cannot bring me anywhere and my gpa cannot get a place in uni.</p>
              <p>I will be graduating next year and I will make my decision after my bmt.</p>
              <p>Was thinking of signing commandos/guards officer but I am the only son, so thinking of armour, infantry officeror maybe the newer IO. Military police is one of the choices too. but I havent had much info of specs, i only gathered officer's info, but as everyone know, you can get 10 advices or hear 10 stories from 10 different ppl, but all these stories and advices can be of 360degree contrast.</p>
              <p>I just hope to get more advices here.</p>
              <p>Whats the salary of MP like?<br>Will I stuck in CAPTAIN for very long if i sign on officer with just diploma?</p>
              <p>I dun intend to further my studies...</p>
              <p>thanks for the help</p>

              <p>Best as you said, make your decision after you go throught your BMT. I
               had many friends officers-wannabes quit thinking about OCS after going 
              through their BMT. All juz wana serve and f*** off liao.</p>
              <p>No such thing as "only son" cannot go for commando course. My

              it is your choice. 
              
              how about scdf, police, navy, prison, cisco?
              
              look beyond 
               
              you max at cpt if you r a diploma. 
              
              do u like military life?
               
              if you are a physical guy, then signing on is not a bad choice, that is the only job that allow you to run at 3pm in the afternoon during office hours, without penalty. Other jobs that are like Outward bound singapore, fitness centre, PE teacher and more.
              
              when you sign on, you will still further your studies, in military school, with proper lectures and exam, but it is on military subjects, instead of maths and sciences.

              <p><br>"Some people have no choice. They are not talented or have no interested in studying, hence going to Uni or further studies is a "no no". They screws up their diploma, finding a job outside is also difficult, the worst is nobody wants them at all, or the best is most 1K plus salary. They are not born with silver spoon and have no money to set up business. They are not motivated, and no interest in working hard . They are not smart/street-smart, and dont have good networking. So... how far can they go? Probably the best outcome is to sign on, and get a stable income and get married, buy house and have children." &lt;-- This is what my sign-on diver friend told me that time, when I first interview him.  He is a "physical" guy, anything that requires physically work he is good at it. </p>

              <p>Threadstarter, don't be disheartened by the comments made by these losers.</p>
              <p>I assume you're new to this forum. Stay a few more days and you will also know like everyone else here that none of these people could be officer or made it to OCS when they were in NS.</p>
              <p>They would always say (in their broken English) that they didn't care, had no motivation or that now all they care about is money (to hint that they are towards the path of making any at all and that they don't care for NS or the military). Which is why as a bunch of reservists who have long ORD they're in this forum day and night still obsessed about NS and the SAF. LOL! Yup I know it's funny.</p>
              <p>To be honest with you, even the most uneducated regular officer (no degree or diploma) I know is earning a good living and just bought a condominium with his wife and he has two kids and he's only turning 31 this year. These people who are talking cock all day long about SAF and NS in this forum (you know how the most 'free' people are normally the ones with the least money and success and the most time on their hands, esp in SG, because even Warren Buffett in the US is very busy despite being the world #2 richest man), I think won't even earn what he is earning when they turn 40. Even though that guy does not have a degree and is in the SAF. To add insult to injury, no SAF regular officer I know from farmer to scholar bothers about online government rants and few know the existence of these losers and this forum.</p>
              <p>As for you, sign on by all means if you have the genuine interest and passion for the military but do so after conclusive and analytical consideration after you have experienced OCS. BMT is a start but BMT does not give one an accurate experience of commanding. Some of the regular officers told me that even OCS doesn't give an accurate reflection of the life of a career officer but it's closer than BMT.</p>

              <p>i was an nsf officer, so heres some advice based on what i've seen from the regulars around me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i dont think reaching captain is an issue, in fact, other than being a logistics officer, i believe you should be able to end your saf career with at least a major 2 or a LTC drawing mayb....8k about there? vocation matters i think. usually armour and commandos and guards advance faster i think. but of course these are the much tougher ones.</p>
              <p>regarding advancement of studies, i doubt that will happen. the army doesnt really send ppl to further their studies, dont think its much use to them either. but at the end of the day, i guess it all depends on whether you dont mind putting on the green uniform everyday serving your country, or lead the life that most of the people here lead, outside with unlimited prospects. the choice is really yours.</p>

              <p>well, since you are a dip holder, u may want to think ahead. People change, mature and grow with time. You may be contented with the initial salary of 2k plus, that actually is quite "a lot" for any one just out of school, fresh into NS whatever. But as you progress down the years, you may find that those fellow officers with degrees are promoted ahead of you...will you feel like you have underachieved? Or are you just content doing your own thing? Will you look at the SAF career 10 years down the road the same positive way that you did 10 years back?</p>
              <p>If you think you will be a happy go lucky chap, then perhaps just sign on as a dip officer. But just don't sweat when you see your peers with degrees given the priority for promotion.</p>

              <p>I assume you're new to this forum. Stay a few more days and you
              will also know like everyone else here that none of these people
              could be officer or made it to OCS when they were in NS.</p>
              <p>They would always say (in their broken English) that they didn't
              care, had no motivation or that now all they care about is money
              (to hint that they are towards the path of making any at all and
              that they don't care for NS or the military). Which is why as a
              bunch of reservists who have long ORD they're in this forum day and
              night still obsessed about NS and the SAF. LOL! Yup I know it's
              funny.</p>
              <p>To be honest with you, even the most uneducated regular officer
              (no degree or diploma) I know is earning a good living and just
              bought a condominium with his wife and he has two kids and he's
              only turning 31 this year. These people who are talking cock all
              day long about SAF and NS in this forum (you know how the most
              'free' people are normally the ones with the least money and
              success and the most time on their hands, esp in SG, because even
              Warren Buffett in the US is very busy despite being the world #2
              richest man), I think won't even earn what he is earning when they
              turn 40. Even though that guy does not have a degree and is in the
              SAF. To add insult to injury, no SAF regular officer I know from
              farmer to scholar bothers about online government rants and few
              know the existence of these losers and this forum.</p>
              <p>As for you, sign on by all means if you have the genuine
              interest and passion for the military but do so after conclusive
              and analytical consideration after you have experienced OCS. BMT is
              a start but BMT does not give one an accurate experience of
              commanding. Some of the regular officers told me that even OCS
              doesn't give an accurate reflection of the life of a career officer
              but it's closer than BMT.</p>

              <p><br>Hey hi farmer, how's the day been for you hoeing and ploughing in the hot sun? Look at you trying hard to convince TS and everyone here that you're not a farmer and that you're all that. But every letter and word of yours is a dead giveaway, totally exposing your farmer face grinning like a retard in this universe. Do you not know what a farmer is? Do you not know that YOU are a farmer? What right do you have to discourage people from pursuing their dreams or denigrate others and refer to them as the very thing that you are? When hello, newsflash, YOU ARE AN EFFING FARMER. Where did you graduate from? Didn't you end up in a local uni dump? Do you not know what an effing farmer is? Look into the mirror. http://sgforums.com/forums/1390/topics/382456</p>
              <p>YOU are a farmer. Now now don't forget that. It amuses me utterly whenever I bump into a farmer like you back in Singapore. I don't really meet such farmers when I was overseas. It is back in SG, where there is this large bunch of people, who form the proletariat masses, and who think that they are part of the elite and have no idea who and how much they are worth.</p>
              <p>There is no crime in being a proleteriat peasant like you. Absolutely no crime. Its when now and then, a frog farmer like you who fancies yourself a prince comes along and shits all over yourself, attention is demanded and people in the know point their finger and laugh.</p>
              <p>People like you, are aplenty. From a nondescript background and lacking the intelligence to move up the ladder of social mobility. You were one of the losers who ended up in a loser local university and think you've ascended to be a yuppie earning your measly pathetic two to three thousand sg dollars of starting salary, working as a farmer, maybe something lowdown like doing Operations (back office) in a bank. LOL. Freaking loser who hasn't seen the world and can't spell or string a sentence in English properly and is a complete utter disgrace to Singapore if ever in contact with foreigners. So thank God you're stuck here.</p>
              <p>You're a farmer and its nothing to do with how you could not be a commander in your NS days. Lots of people I know who are not farmers were downgraded. However your experience in your NS as a loser, when combined with your subsequent ORD life, in which you mistakenly believe you're better than the farmer that you are, have produced a macabre spectre, a satire, a joke for the children with a lesson for them to learn. You're the perfect cautionary tale. The naked king without clothes. The peasant who doesn't know the size of his hoe.</p>
              <p>The only difference between you, a farmer, and the farmers in the SAF, is you didn't qualify for command school when in NS. And that you a farmer make even less money than them, who are also farmers. You are merely a farmer who's worth less than those farmers you're talking about.</p>
              <p>Get your mom to buy you a mirror, peasant.</p>
              <p>BTW, in your farmer stupor a few days ago, you asked me "why dun i sign on if its so good"? LOL. You know the people who are cherry-picked, creamed off and painstakingly groomed in the SAF to eventually run the country, they are my sec schoolmates, after school football buds, friends in university. I'm not presuming I'm so good that I'd have been one of them for sure if i tried. But if I tried I'd have somewhat of a shot even if I failed.</p>
              <p>As for you, you're so far off from the universe of non farmers, you're the posterboy of the delusional farmer ho' with a hoe digging with your changkul dreaming (yuppie) dreams. You're a farmer earning less than other farmers, yet have the cheek to think you're greater than other farmers. Other, being the operative word. You're just so sad.</p>
              <p>Enough with the preachy "Oh I post such constructive comments". You're making us puke since you've been exposed and embarrassed countless times and we know you're a phoney. (refer to Navy thread)</p>

              <p>i was an nsf officer, so heres some advice based on what i've seen from the regulars around me.</p>

              <p>i dont think reaching captain is an issue, in fact, other than being a logistics officer, i believe you should be able to end your saf career with at least a major 2 or a LTC drawing mayb....8k about there? vocation matters i think. usually armour and commandos and guards advance faster i think. but of course these are the much tougher ones.</p>
              <p>regarding advancement of studies, i doubt that will happen. the army doesnt really send ppl to further their studies, dont think its much use to them either. but at the end of the day, i guess it all depends on whether you dont mind putting on the green uniform everyday serving your country, or lead the life that most of the people here lead, outside with unlimited prospects. the choice is really yours.</p>

              <p>Threadstarter, Diploma holders have no problems reaching LTC.</p>
              <p>Vocation matters A LOT, acurara is correct and what he's said is accurate. The better your vocation, the brighter your prospects. The best prospects lie in combat vocations, there are four infantry arms - infantry, guards, commando and armour. out of these, commando would advance the fastest, if all things are equal (comparing a group of men of equal intellect, competency, fitness). commando is the only one that has the slight edge over the other infantry arms. The rest, infantry, guards and armour do not. guards is just infantry by the way. the only people who don't know that, are combat service support people and non commanders.</p>
              <p>Below combat arms, would be combat support arms - artillery, signals and combat engineers. They provide support. And they do not advance in careers as quickly, this is obvious why. Because they're combat support only, not on the frontline. You also rarely find an officer from a combat support background heading a brigade. The only instance signing on in combat support has little effect is when you're a SAFOS.</p>
              <p>Below combat support arms are the ones at the bottom. Combat service support. These people are the engineers (not the same as combat engineers) and the logistics people. Service support is the lowest on the rung. Its the least military in nature. The upside of service support is that the job nature itself is more transferable and close to non military professions, you can very easily find a job in logistics or engineering after your retire. But obviously, for the same reason, its also why support service the least specialised within the SAF. From what and the way you write, I know you have the intelligence to understand this. Unlike some stupid embarrassing fool here. LOL.</p>
              <p>Dip holders like was said earlier, have no problems reaching LTC.The salary of a LTC with diploma is between $8k to $10k. One regular officer I know from poly, is able to buy his own condo at 31. Of course his wife is also working, and they have two kids.</p>
              <p>All these farmers talk in this thread, talking about "the future" and "outside" (hahaha). I doubt any of them can make that amount at the end of their lives in the private sector (hahaha).</p>
