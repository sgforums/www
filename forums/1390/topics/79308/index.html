            <div class='col-md body'>the US are the one that REALLY goes into war... penetrates the enemy line.. that's where choppers are the most useful.<br><br>here only for show... of cos the fighter looks more stylo lah... faster then can eject somemore... chopper pilots goes down with the chopper itself (/touch wood) if anything happens.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well... from my experience.. why they say fighter pilots are more glorified is becoz of the selection process they go through. Fighter pilots are under more stress due to the fact that dey are travelling 900over kph. and 1 slight error or manouver can be fatal. Moreover u oni hav secs to make a decision, therefore fighter pilots are the cream of the crop. choppers are slower.. in the sense that... u have more time to make decisions n u wun go through much gforces. But choppers are also impt too. Choppers are harder to control, they carry more ppl so if the heli is down, dey expect more casualties depending on the number of ppl inside. N like u guys said, the chopper is so called "in" the war. It all comes down to how u see it. All areas of the air force are equally impt, equally glorified. Without chopper pilots. who will transport the soldiers? Without transport pilots, who will transport the supplies?Without fighter pilots who wll defend the skies?<br><br>--sorry for being long winded.. jus my views n my $0.02 worth</div>
