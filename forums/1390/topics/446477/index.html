              <p>Hey all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First of all, let me say this, I wanted to do NS, but only after I complete my university. I recently contacted MINDEF in order to ask what my chances of being able to defer my NS until I completed my 3 years of university. I was told that they were 'virtually zero', even if I had an offer from a University.</p>
              <p><br>Now, I'm not a Singaporean citizen, just a PR and I've never gone to a government school here, just an International school, and we've never had expat status. I've recently recieved the letter telling me to register for my enlistment. I would like to know how I could go about completing my education and then giving up my PR. This has been compounded as I've recieved a conditional offer from my university.</p>
              <p>Is it possible to register and then give it up? I'm worried that if I give it up now, I'll be forced to leave without being able to complete my exams in May (My final IB exams).</p>
              <p>What process should I go through in order to be able to finish my exams in May, and then give up my PR status to go to University straight after?</p>

              <p>I think you better give up your PR.</p>
              <p>Serving NS is by law and not a option you can move unless you are by some special surname.</p>
              <p>The rest of the singaporean have to serve NS before they study.</p>
              <p>What make you so special ?</p>
              <p>So, my advice to you is drop the PR since you will defer reservist later, IPT later, RT later and maybe IPPT later.</p>
              <p>This is the package if you want to be a SG PR.</p>
              <p>If you cannot last, you dun waste your time and the army time.</p>

              <p>We register for university first. Then after we complete the A level or poly, we go to NS for 2 years. The uni will hold the position for us for the time being.</p>
              <p>Being PR or citizen is good, because the uni fee is half of the foreign student.</p>
              <p>I suggest you go and register local uni, and get citizenship after NS, and you can do uni at a cheaper rate.</p>
              <p>Whether you are citizen or PR the goverment settle all this aspect nicely, you just need to follow. </p>

              <p>I guess if we all leave for what are essentially economic reasons my kids can't be blamed. Or will they still be in the shit with the govt if they decide to come back here as adults in the future?</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Here's a question pertaining to this. I am 1st g pr with 2 boys
                  age 13 and 11 liable for ns. Work is not great at the moment so I
                  may be required to relocate to my home country. Since I will no
                  longer be resident in sing I would drop my pr and that of my kids.
                  What are the implications for my kids? I have received the mindef
                  letter for my oldest. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess if we all leave for what are essentially economic
                  reasons my kids can't be blamed. Or will they still be in the shit
                  with the govt if they decide to come back here as adults in the
                  future?</p>
