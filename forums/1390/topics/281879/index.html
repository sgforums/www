            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>If never called back, they're still posted on to MINDEF reserve </blockquote>Oops, that should be "posted on to MINDEF holding list". Only those on the nominal rolls of reservist units would go on Army Operational Reserve together, after finishing their cycle.<br><br>BTW The SAF can sometimes delay the latter too, if an NSF unit hasn't ORDed yet to take over yours in the overall ORBAT. It happened with my unit, after our stand-down parade &amp; long-service awards/certificates of appreciation. We had to spent an extra year on Operational Extended Holding: no ICT, IPPT or mob manning but liable for any real-ops call-up.<br><br>I know we all like to call the conscript part of military service as "NS." But National Service Liability, as promulgated under the Enlistment Act, actually ends only when you turn 40 or 50 (depending on your rank status). Hence at 22 or 32 years respectively, it's actually one of the longest service tenures in the world. What I can confirm it'll actually end on your birthday at those older ages. So, mathematically speaking, it'll be 9 months' more NS liability for those 18-year-olds who'd enlisted in March vs. those in the December batch.<br><br>Hence, whether you do reservist or not, there's a bureaucratic record of your status in the military (until you're formally discharged). If you have a reserve service booklet, your PES status is noted inside too. The medical classification stays with you unless you kena "boarded" (upgrade or downgrade).</div>
