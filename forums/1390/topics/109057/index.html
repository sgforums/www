            <div class='col-md body'>Very true.Sometimes, going through the chain of command is not very practical, if the person you are complaining about and your immediate superior are buddies.If your superior is not impartial enough, and your case is not heard and the situation worsens, what then is the recourse?Realistically, can a mere recruit ever know enough about the system to find himself some help?No.Even lao jiaos like us still have many queries about the SAF.<br><br>Impartialism and professionalism must form the priority of every man, spec and officer in the SAF if everyone is to b guaranteed fair and equal treatment.Treat others as you would like others to treat you.I really feel sorry for those NSFs who are bullied, abused by higher-ups and run into a brick wall when they go through the chain of command.If they take the brave step of writing a letter to their MP, they are co-opted and charged.What the hell is this?This is mere abuse and usage of a very loose definition of insubordination.If the complaints are heard and resolved promptly and fairly, these unfortunate events might have been avoided.<br><br>So, guys, please treat your men well, and keep an eye out for other troopers who are not under you as well.We are all soldiers and we wear the green, be it for 2 years or 20 years.But each is a human being with feelings, a life and emotional capabilities that differ amongst individuals.Surely it is not hard to be a real man and assist the ones in trouble and help the desperate?Let us all serve our time in peace and ensure we leave the army with a sane mind and healthy emotions.</div>

In BMT someone sent mindef a fax pertaining to perceived ill treatment and the results were quick. However, the person who sent the fax did include name so i suspect that they will not entertain anonymous Tipoffs.<br><br>Anyway you must have a valid reason for staying out. Girl friend problems simply dun count imo. And even if you have a valid reason, the most you might hope for is a stay out pass that allows you to stay out say 2 nights a week. IE Tues, Thurs.</div>
