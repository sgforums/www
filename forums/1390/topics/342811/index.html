              <p>Take down their names and complain to the authorities. You cannot be soft on such matter just because they have higher ranks than you. They have no rights to punish you or accuse you of malingering due to your illness.</p>
              <p>Probably nothing will be done the first few time you complain. Complain until something is done. But you still have to go up one by one through the chain of command. Don't get yourself into trouble too.</p>

              <p>You're wrong. We are no longer in our parent's era when we everything also have to lan lan accept. Most, if not all of us are educated people. We have the skills and ability to fight for our own rights and dignity so why not do it?</p>
              <p>Yes, keep cool and analyse the situation. Solve the problem. Not do nothing about it. Not accept it and keep letting this kind of thing happen again and again. I think it's our own life and we should be proactive about it.</p>
              <p>TS did tell those staff sergeants his problem. He did sounded off. Yes there are many people who malinger but there are also many people who don't. And everytime we sound off to our commanders about a problem, they kept brushing it off and just think we are malingering.</p>
              <p>When problems occured who should bear the consequences? The commanders for not taking their men seriously enough, or the man for not being insistent enough?</p>

              in that unit, a small one, for 1 over year more. and if i do tt,
              they are sure gonna tekan me for tt period of time. like wad some
              commanders like to say "you play hotline, we play you". i've
              already figured out tt i have nowhere to vent it out except here
              and my friends. already got it figured out tt to challenge them
              back is not a wise option, unless i am capable of getting OOC and
              out of that formation. its a very small formation, so to get ur
              life messed up isnt hard for those regulars. this is the part where
              i haf to suck thumb. and initially i was so disgusted and depressed
              tt i haf to suffer this kinda unjust treatment like tt...but now, i
              feel tt its better to suck thumb and suffer in silence than to do
              anything abt it. like wad my fren said "we r only gonna be here for
              2 yrs, but the regulars will be here forever". just suffer this 2
              yrs, pray my slping problems go away and i wun get into any trouble
