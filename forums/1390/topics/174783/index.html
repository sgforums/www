            <div class='col-md body'>The committee to recognise the contribution of operationally ready NSmen to total defence, or RECORD 4, has submitted its recommendations to the Government.<br><br>Among others, it asks that a one-time payout be given when they complete their Operationally Ready NS training cycle.<br><br>In its 34-page report, the RECORD 4 Committee also asks that the practice of giving NSmen a higher quantum under the government's asset enhancement schemes be continued.<br><br>In the next Surplus Sharing exercise, to mark the 40th anniversary of National Service next year, those who have completed their (Operationally Ready) NS training cycle should be given a higher quantum then those still serving.<br><br>The additional allocation should also be extended to full-time national servicemen.<br><br>The committee believes in giving recognition to key officers working in the environment of a Third Generation SAF and recommends that their allowances be raised.<br><br>They should also be given an additional tax relief quantum of S$2,000.<br><br>To help those finishing their 2-year NS stint make a smooth transition to working life, the committee suggests that the e-learning scheme be enhanced and career fairs held in facilitate in their job search.<br><br>Special achievements as well as their NS performance should be highlighted in their certificate of service.<br><br>And employers should be apprised of the skills and knowledge they have acquired in the course of their military training.<br><br>To enhance the convenience for NSmen leaving and entering the country, the committee is asking that the existing exit controls be streamlined.<br><br>For example, the need to return exit permits should be dispensed with while those who've already completed their ORNS training cycle should be exempted from having to notify MINDEF of their trips.<br><br>The committee also feels the recreational needs for NSmen and their families should be enhanced.<br><br>A clubhouse should be made available in Jurong for those living in the west, while other existing clubhouses, beginning with the one in Toa Payoh, should be upgraded.<br><br>To engage family members and employers, more funding should be given for social activities and regular dialogue sessions held.<br><br>Topping it all, the committee is calling for a museum to be set up to showcase the history of NS.<br><br>It is as a tribute to Singapore's NSmen and to highlight the crucial role NS continues to play in national service.<br><br>The Chairman of the RECORD 4 Committee, Dr Ng Eng Hen, who's also Manpower and Second Defence Minister, says the team worked four months on this report.<br><br>It asks that measures to recognise and enhance NSmen's contribution to Total Defence be reviewed and improved every five years.<br><br>Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean says the government will study the report and implement as many of the recommendations as possible. - CNA/ch<br><br></div>
