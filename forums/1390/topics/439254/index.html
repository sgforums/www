              <p>1. I'm sure you're aware that Singapore's way is to squeeze the most out of everyone (in this case max number of NSFs while "uphoiding" "military discipline") without giving a hoot about rights. If a transgender individual is an anatomical male of heterosexual orientation, all that remains for them to serve co-equally is for cross-dressing or other effeminate traits to be suppressed by way of "military discipline". Why would a policy distinction be made?</p>
              <p>2. What are the current arrangements and consequences for "302"s? eg exemption. There are rumours that a policy of exemptions is kept quiet to avert mass declarations.</p>
              <p>3. Why does your friend see necessity to declare, report or admit such status?</p>
              <p>What is his objective? eg to serve, to be exempted, to avoid consequences.</p>
              <p>4. We might see a change in policy should manpower shortages or increasing numbers of declarations bring the issue to the fore. Still, expect blatant contradictions in policy and "case by case" arrangements to apply because that's just the way Singapore is.</p>
              <p>5. Referring to the above, http://kementah.blogspot.com/2010/12/with-pride-we-lead-gays-in-singaporean.html</p>
              <p>Yes, some transgender regulars love their jobs (of defending their oppressors) that much.</p>
              <p>6. Yes the mod here does change titles to those he sees as more descriptive.</p>

              <p>Hopefully, someone with personal experience with reporting 302 more recently could advise, especially on the part where they require a parent to be present . . and if that is still the case, if it could be completely exempted if given a valid reason (as stated under the Opening Post).</p>
              <p><strong><br>1. I'm sure you're aware that Singapore's way is to squeeze the
                                  most out of everyone (in this case max number of NSFs while

                                  distinction be made?</strong></p>
              <p>Yes alize :) , but my question was in concern with the case of what if a bisexually orientated transexual girl who's already undergoing self-medicated HRT ( i.e. have already started developing boobs ) . . etc. and would be dangerous for her to be surrounded by guys during shower (for example), etc etc.<br><br>The earlier part about many transgenders being hetrosexual was just to clear up the common misconception that sexual orientation has anything to do with transgenderism. The second part of the <em>opening post </em>was infact the main focus of me starting this thread. ;)</p>
              <p><strong>2. What are the current arrangements and consequences for
                                  "302"s? eg exemption. There are rumours that a policy of exemptions
                                  is kept quiet to avert mass declarations.</strong></p>
              <p>But is the requirement for parental interview ( with the above stated concerns ) still present? Can the person declaring 302 be exempted from that completely?</p>
              <p><strong>3. Why does your friend see necessity to declare, report or
                                  admit such status? What is his objective? eg to serve, to be exempted, to avoid
                                  consequences.</strong></p>
              <p>For example :: Looking sufficiently feminine or androgenous (even with the forced-haircut), having full A-cup boobs = dangerous and risk of being bullied or worse by some of the macho-animals that will most certainly be present inside. Having to take showers with other men, when being physically half-way "there", is already a very good motivation to want to declare.</p>
              <p><strong>4. We might see a change in policy should manpower shortages or
                                  increasing numbers of declarations bring the issue to the fore.

              <p>In practice, soldiers do get ogled at by closet gays every day. Singaporeans have taken a great deal up the ass (sorry) and could be easily made to live knowing this. Neither are different anatomies a practical issue because female soldiers are accommodated in the field.</p>
              <p>It's a political issue. The government's vote bastion is the old and FTs. If the government allowed full GLBT rights within and outside the military, it would not lose out, because the opposition would hardly oppose. However, the government gets leverage by painting the opposition as pro-gay.</p>
              <p>As for the practicalities, the govt takes immense pride in its work and sees no need for change. ie they're too lazy to make it work.</p>
              <p>I have heard vague rumours of GLBTs being totally exempted, and barred from entering local unis, from getting married in Singapore and from buying a HDB flat.</p>
              <p>If true, these are the implicit penalties for avoiding service or combat service. I admit I can't think of a way to uphold GLB rights without doing away with conscription. Few straight guys would go T just to avoid conscription.</p>
              <p>As for your friend, whether and how he serves probably depends on how visibly anatomically different his body is.</p>
              <p>I would say serve closeted if he plans to remain in Singapore and needs the above rights.</p>
