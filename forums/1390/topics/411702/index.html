              <p><br> Dear Bros, I went down to my DIV HQ this very 
              evening to summit documentary proof for my exit permit application. 
              (sailing as a navigational officer around the world).  <br><br>Cutting 
              to the crux, I got into a lively exchange with one of the officer there 
              who told me that any application for future exit permits after my 
              current one might be rejected as I do not have a single ICT with the 
              unit in their record. (FYI - I do not have any upcoming ICT to clear)  
              He wanted me to call them up to schedule an ICT for me after my voyage 
              so that 'they can answer'.  I am also supposed to get my shipping 
              company to set aside time for me to do my ICT.  To say that I was 
              surprised to learn of this new development is probably an 
              understatement.  <br><br>When I called my HQ to seek further 
              clarification, I was told that the absence of ICTs in my record will 
              have no bearing on the success of my exit permit application if I have a
               valid reason. <br><br>Any bros here, seafaring or not, with similar experiences to share?</p>

              <p>actually,u dont really need to see anyone to submit proof.normally people send it online and proof thru emails.the army etc will confirm with employer via employment letter.that is all.</p>
              <p>person who threaten u etc has no juristiction on whether or not even to defer u.i have come across quite a few of these people but just reason to them etc.if they dun reason which i initially encountered from the clerk,chief clerks to the officer..or just use what contributions u gave to yer old unit....once they see what u had contributed for them...they would back off or.....just get a permanent residence somewhere else.</p>
              <p>but for a job on a ship should be alright.its not that u are going to go live on a ship forever.its just a job and u are paying the spore gov in form of taxes.the division isnt the ones giving u a job or salary ...like as if they really cared.</p>

              <p>however your situation is straight forward and easy.its all from the website on overseas jobs and online application .it shouldnt be much of a problem if the people u discussed knew what they were doin as from the general orders and procedures.that is if they knew the procedures.</p>
              <p>if they didntknow it....then it would be an insult if u tried telling them how to do their job.kind of problematic if u deal with idiots who run the show.</p>

              <p>Thx bro for your insight.  I got my exit permit easily via the online portal last night.  As to why I was down at my DIV HQ, was running some errands in the area, thought I might as well drop by and hand over the documents personally as I will be leaving next week.  On hindsight this is a case of 'being smart is good enough, don't be too smart'.  Totally destroy my mood listening to the crap spewing out from that DIV person.</p>
