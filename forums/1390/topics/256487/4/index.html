            <div class='col-md body'>in my opinion, SAF food is not really so bad in terms of taste.<br>ok lah, they are way away from hawker-standard food, but they're way better than what I expect (before my NS, i thought they would feed us wheat rice +  some tiny drumstick + preservered beans crap).<br><br>however, in terms of nutrition/health value, i agree with the original poster.<br>SAF always say that their food is not the best but is high in nutrition value and is adequate every individual soldier, even on the battle field.<br><br>but imagine a small serving of rice + some meat(the meat are usually "patties".......you NS brudders know what I mean) and some veggies.<br>a lot of the time, after you've finished the food, you'll see a pool of yellowish thick oil left on the plate. also, if you eaten already and you ask for another serving, they will be very reluctant to give. some SFI chefs even complain to the QM / 2IC. KNN.<br><br>that's my biggest complaint. low morale everytime i see the serving and type of food......maybe if i kenna captured by enemy, they'll feed me better.<br><br>also, i used to be in charge of food rations last time; the average cost per lunch (or dinner) is around S$4.00 - S$5.00<br>what i don't understand is why they don't instead cater hawker food instead.</div>
