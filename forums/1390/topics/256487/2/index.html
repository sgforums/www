            <div class='col-md body'>Different camps serve different food, different variety, different standards, different nutrition value, different amount of effort put into cooking etc etc... So you cant blame the entire SAF just becos your camp food sucks...<br><br>I had 2 whole years of sucky food before my camp changed the cookhouse vendor... My meals for the last 3-4 months were simply wonderful...<br><br>Actually things have been slowly improving... You're considered lucky that you are in army now and not years ago.. I think you're just a spoilt brat or some non-combat soldier who got nothing to do everyday but sit there and think of things to complain...<br><br>If you get the camp to select soldiers to become cooks in the cookhouse, i can guarantee you that you get more shitty food... Just ask your dad or your uncles... Few years back, out-ration was packed in styrofoam boxes, which they said tht it's toxic (but i took them for 2 years), now they changed it to cardboard boxes liao... Now, the NS allowance has increased by so much! But service time also reduced by so much! Also, only 5 days week! What the freak! You are already enjoying better NS life, so just try to live with it... NS life will get better slowly and slowly... You can complain, but let me tell you that your experience is definitely not the worse... Just ask the pioneers...</div>
