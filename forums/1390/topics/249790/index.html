            <div class='col-md body'>most guys get posted to infantry units after BMT.  so there shouldnt be a worry there.  as fail safe you can always indicate your preference with your PC.  as for RSAF, that is more difficult and rare.  not sure if they still take in NSF technicians now.<br><br>colourblindness does not mean one will not be able to become an officer.  it depends on severity, though how severe before it becomes a problem only the MO knows.  one of my OCS mates was colourblind too.  he got commissioned nevertheless.</div>
