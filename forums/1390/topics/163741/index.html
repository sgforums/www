              <p><strong>Q1. Why must MINDEF impose exit controls on NS-liable males? <br><br></strong>Exit
               controls are necessary to ensure that NS-liable males who have gone 
              overseas to study or reside at a young age return to fulfil their NS 
              responsibilities.</p>

              <p><strong>Q2. Why can't MINDEF exempt young males aged 13 to 16½ from exit controls?<br><br></strong>Exit
               control measures have to be applied at a reasonably younger age so that
               they could be effective to prevent those who leave at a younger age 
              defaulting on their NS responsibilities</p>

              <p><strong>Q3. Why has MINDEF decided to shift the starting age for exit controls from age 11 to 13?<br><br></strong>Currently,
               the starting age of exit controls is pegged at age 11, the age where 
              Singaporeans used to be issued with NRICs.  With Singaporeans now being 
              issued NRICs at age 15, there is no longer a special reason to retain 
              age 11 as the starting age for exit controls.  MINDEF has therefore 
              decided to set it at age 13, which is when students would have just 
              started their secondary school education.</p>

              <p><strong>Q4. Why is MINDEF removing passport controls?<br><br></strong>With
               the introduction of the non-extendable Singapore Biometric passport, a 
              continuation of passport controls for young males would mean that they 
              will have to pay for a new biometric passport upon expiry each time. 
              This will result in greater inconvenience and higher cost for young 
              males and their families. MINDEF has therefore decided to remove 
              passport controls.</p>

              <p><strong>Q5. Will young males holding non-biometric Singapore passport be given full validity?<br><br></strong>Those
               holding non-biometric Singapore Passports will also have their 
              passports extended for the full duration of 5 or 10 years. This is 
              however subject to the remaining lifespan of the passport.</p>

              <div>
              <p><strong>Q6. Why does MINDEF require young males to apply for an exit permit?<br><br></strong>With
               the removal of passport controls, it is necessary for MINDEF to extend 
              exit permit requirements (which currently affect only NS-liable males 
              aged 16½ and above) to males aged 13 and above in order to ensure that 
              young males who go overseas return to serve NS. However, to avoid 
              inconveniencing those who make short overseas trips during vacations, 
              exit permits will only be required for overseas trips of 3 months or 
              more.</p>

              <div>
              <p><strong>Q7. Will young males who require exit permits be required to furnish a bond?<br><br></strong>Young
               males aged 13 to 16½ will only be required to furnish a bond if they 
              require an exit permit of 2 years or more.  This arrangement is similar 
              to the current practice where only young males who require a passport 
              validity of more than 2 years are required to furnish a bond. <br><br>Males
               aged 16½ to enlistment are approaching the age of enlistment. They are 
              therefore subject to more stringent exit controls to deter potential NS 
              defaulters.  The current practice of requiring such males to furnish a 
              bond if they require an exit permit of 3 months or more will continue.</p>

              <p><strong>Q8. Will young males aged 13 to 16½ who fail to apply for an exit permit be sentenced to imprisonment?<br><br></strong>The
               penalty regime for exit permit offences of young males aged 13 to 16½ 
              will be a fine of up to $2,000, with no custodial sentences.  They will 
              however be subject to harsher penalties should they continue to be in 
              breach of the Enlistment Act after that age 16½.<br><br>Males above 16½ 
              years who travel and remain overseas without applying for an exit permit
               will be prosecuted under the Enlistment Act. They will be liable upon 
              conviction to a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not 
              exceeding 3 years or both.</p>

              <div>
              <p><strong>Q9. How will MINDEF deal with young males who do not 
              understand their obligations under the Enlistment Act or those who have 
              parents/guardians who deliberately encourage them to be in breach of the
               Enlistment Act?<br><br></strong>MINDEF recognises that some young males may 
              not be sufficiently mature to understand their obligations under the 
              Enlistment Act.  Their parents or guardians may also have been 
              instrumental in decisions, which are in contravention of the Enlistment 
              Act.  Parents and guardians would therefore also be liable for the exit 
              permit offences of their children or wards of ages 13 to 16½, so that 
              the penalty can be imposed on their parents or guardians when the 
              circumstances warrant it.  The penalty regime for the offence will also 
              be a fine of up to $2,000. MINDEF will consider the circumstances of the
               case carefully before deciding whether to issue warnings, composition 
              fines or to charge the parent or guardian in court.</p>

              <p><strong>Q10. When will the revised exit controls take effect?<br><br></strong>The
               revised exit control measures will be introduced together with the 
              launch of the Singapore Biometric Passport in the later half of the 
              year.</p>

              <p><strong>Q11. With the removal of passport controls, what would be 
              the arrangement for young males who have furnished bonds for extended 
              passport validity under the Immigration Bonding Scheme?<br><br></strong>As 
              males below the age of 13 will no longer come under the ambit of 
              passport or exit control, those who had furnished a bond to the 
              Immigration and Checkpoints Authority under the Immigration Bonding 
              Scheme will have their bonds released.  <br><br>Males aged 13 to 16½ 
              currently bonded in order to be issued with passports of extended 
              validity will be required to apply for an exit permit for overseas trips
               of 3 months or more.  Those who require an exit permit of 2 years or 
              more will continue to be bonded.  Those who require an exit permit of 
              less than 2 years or who do not require an exit permit will have their 
              bonds released.</p>

              <p><strong>Q12. If MINDEF continues with passport controls, how many 
              pre-enlistees would be inconvenienced by having to apply for a new 
              biometric passport every year?<br><br></strong>According to the Immigration 
              and Checkpoints Authority, there are approximately 120,000 
              pre-registrants (males aged 11 to 16½) and 100,000 registrants (males 
              aged 16½ to enlistment) passport holders.  With the passport validity of
               pre-registrants and registrants capped at 2 years and 1 year 
              respectively, we would expect a pre-registrant to have to apply for a 
              new passport once in 2 years and a registrant once a year.  On average, 
              100,000 have their passports extended annually.</p>
