Our Core Values, especially Loyalty to Country and Fighting Spirit are about soldiersÂ’ passion towards their country, friends, and their own life. Passion enables one to excel.<br><br>Army News caught up with LTA Veronica Tan, an Armour tank Officer from the 41st Singapore Armoured Regiment whose passion for her job stands out. LTA Tan was the Best Cadet in her Basic Military Training days, and also achieved the Best Physical Training Award and Sword-of-Merit in the professional term of her Officer Cadet Training.<br><br>Of her achieving of the Best Physical Training Award Â– among all male peers in her cohort Â– LTA Tan was quick to explain that this did not mean she could outdo her male counterparts in equal terms during the Individual Physical Proficiency Test, but rather, the standards were different. She cited, for example, that she did inclined flex-arm hang instead of chin-ups, and she had six instead of thirteen obstacles to clear in the Standard Obstacle Course (SOC). Nonetheless, based on the standards for females, LTA Tan certainly did very well, and could receive the award deservedly with pride. (Just for the curious, her SOC timing (for six obstacles) is 7:27, while her 2.4 kilometre run time is 10:30.)<br><br>Passion, LTA Tan noted, was what helped her excel in her training. Â“Being in the Army is what I really wanted, what I wanted to do. So I didnÂ’t mind the long hours, or the tough work. IÂ’m also quite an optimistic person, and I tell myself, when the going gets tough, the tough get going. ThatÂ’s how I push myself.Â”<br><br>Now in Armour, a Â“childhood aspirationÂ”, LTA Tan certainly seems to have found her calling. Enthusing about her job, she said, Â“I love the tank! You get to experience the synergy between man and machine, to be in control of such a powerful vehicle. Also, IÂ’m not desk-bound and can enjoy the outdoorsÂ… things are more alive. Most of all, whatever you do, youÂ’re impacting lives.Â”<br><br>To impact lives, and instil in them the same passion that she has Â– that is LTA TanÂ’s hope for the future. She explained, Â“I want to be a good tank Platoon Commander, to change the mindset of those who donÂ’t like Army life. I cannot expect everyone to embrace Army life like I do, since I voluntarily signed on, but I want everyone to pass out with a different mentality - that Army life can be fun!Â”<br><br>It certainly is, especially if there is enthusiasm and passion in you and the people around you. That is the key to having a positive Army experience!<br><br></div>
