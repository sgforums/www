              <p>Another asshole talking out of his ass and talking rubbish like "all elephants have mothers" and "the earth is flat cos scientists know this".. when i read the words above from you, all I visualise a cartoon asshole opening and closing like your shit for brains mouth and the hole has shit flowing out of the pink fleshy orifice.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>Obviously we all "must have a sound mind". You from IMH? You don't need a sound mind? What a retarded dipshit, every line spouted is inane and meaningless.</p>
              <p>And you mean all farmers have "skills and realistic mindset",whatever that peasant phrasing means (lol) and scholars all don't have? what a joke. go brush up on your sad English and life would be more constructive than stewing online in bitterness. where do you aliens come from and I wonder where you are educated. And the dipshits are the ones who claim that education isn't a benchmark of their capabilities? (what you need, brains and smarts you cannot have so try to discredit its value)  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"> this is so tragic and ironic it belongs to an episode of The Black Adder.</p>
              <p>Everyone knows what are all the qualities required for top leadership. You don't have to worry your little peasant heads. The establishment is fully aware and is an old hand at this game for over 40 years they have aced the game. All the other dipshit and moronic stuff you mouth off, the other qualities, no one sees that farmers have them more or higher odds of having them than scholars. You mean farmers have high EQ? Blah blah yada yada. EQ, based on the sensitivity to nuances, is a quality more commonly found in a higher level among intellectually intelligent people. Wit and humour, another quality rooted in intellectual dexterity is also found more abundantly among smart people! When you tell stupid people like you jokes of the level of smart people, guess why you can't get the joke? That's why! In fact with the systematic rigorous creaming, scholars are the people whom are finally deemed to have the highest probability of having all the well rounded attributes necessary for success. Its not over. The system is further refined when they are put back into the system and go through the sieving as they climb up the ladder. The end product of those among them who occupy the top spots are time tested and potential realised.</p>
              <p>Thats how the system works. And it's funny that peasant little dipshits like you lame ppl who know zero about it and looking it on from afar talk senseless crap all day in forums about "eq", "skills", and other dipshit stuff you don't possess, on top of not having brains. utterly pathetic.</p>

              <p>what rubbish. no one gives any value to the short term stupid business programmes, which only last for 1 week to 2 weeks. secondly, all the people ever sent to the programmes are people already part of the system, and not farmers. Go check out the various CVs of the service chiefs. the useless programme is part of the route of advancement (ROI) of the high fliers. it's rarely in the CV of farmers, and if they do appear, have no effect.</p>

              <p>Another asshole talking out of his ass and talking rubbish like "all elephants have mothers" and "the earth is flat cos scientists know this".. when i read the words above from you, all I visualise a cartoon asshole opening and closing like your shit for brains mouth and the hole has shit flowing out of the pink fleshy orifice.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>Obviously we all "must have a sound mind". You from IMH? You don't need a sound mind? What a retarded dipshit, every line spouted is inane and meaningless.</p>
              <p>And you mean all farmers have "skills and realistic mindset",whatever that peasant phrasing means (lol) and scholars all don't have? what a joke. go brush up on your sad English and life would be more constructive than stewing online in bitterness. where do you aliens come from and I wonder where you are educated. And the dipshits are the ones who claim that education isn't a benchmark of their capabilities? (what you need, brains and smarts you cannot have so try to discredit its value)  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"> this is so tragic and ironic it belongs to an episode of The Black Adder.</p>
              <p>Everyone knows what are all the qualities required for top leadership. You don't have to worry your little peasant heads. The establishment is fully aware and is an old hand at this game for over 40 years they have aced the game. All the other dipshit and moronic stuff you mouth off, the other qualities, no one sees that farmers have them more or higher odds of having them than scholars. You mean farmers have high EQ? Blah blah yada yada. EQ, based on the sensitivity to nuances, is a quality more commonly found in a higher level among intellectually intelligent people. Wit and humour, another quality rooted in intellectual dexterity is also found more abundantly among smart people! When you tell stupid people like you jokes of the level of smart people, guess why you can't get the joke? That's why! In fact with the systematic rigorous creaming, scholars are the people whom are finally deemed to have the highest probability of having all the well rounded attributes necessary for success. Its not over. The system is further refined when they are put back into the system and go through the sieving as they climb up the ladder. The end product of those among them who occupy the top spots are time tested and potential realised.</p>
              <p>Thats how the system works. And it's funny that peasant little dipshits like you lame ppl who know zero about it and looking it on from afar talk senseless crap all day in forums about "eq", "skills", and other dipshit stuff you don't possess, on top of not having brains. utterly pathetic.</p>

              <p>OK then</p>
              <p>I'm asking you, how come our forefathers w/o education can make a future out for Singapore as a country and society? So that means they've no EQ or IQ or so on? Even so, those who had degree like Dr Goh, I dun think u would find selfless ppl today.</p>
              <p>U come ard make close to personal attack on ppl saying peasants, fantasy, pathetic, aliens, attacking ppl's education. I forgot, if you attack my education, u are also well attacking all e scholar's local education life being equal <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif">. It's as if they didn't go thru O levels, A levels locally.</p>
              <p>touch ur heart and go figure out why there's so many problems recently from e country. You see things like ERP, MRT congestion comments, HDB flat prices, cost of living and yet no one is able to give an real answer to all these or worst dare not to say the truth.</p>
              <p>Not to mention our ex defence minister who helped PSA lost Maersk &amp; Evergreen overnight. "We do not compete with prices". Instead of reducing rates to survive, they'd rather make themselves lose every bit of business away.</p>
              <p>If you want to attack go ahead because you do not know of my personal contacts with officials in some stat board <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">. I do on my own feedback on matters esp w/ regards to public tpt.</p>

              <p><br>Who are the ones behind the wheel? The dipshit uneducated retards of your kind or the people you're jealous of? I know you're referring to the officer killer thread I started. Maybe you'd like to email that Private and ask him whether he had received the proper training and did not follow protocol or if he had done what he was trained to.</p>
              <p>SBS accidents are allegedly "fewer" (more on that later haha) in the interchanges because the buses are driven by people whose livelihood is driving the bus. and retard farmer, don't speak too soon. There are more and more bus accidents on the road, not at the interchange and many bus drivers nowadays drive like they're jerking off to F1. I've seen one zip past a Civic once. I guess you only take the MRT and have no money to drive, and so you don't see them hahaha.</p>
              <p>In any case why don't you count all the motor accidents involving MID vehicles a year and come back to me? Go ask for the figures from Mindef lah. Why so chicken?  I'm very cock sure that the proportion of MID accidents is lower than the proportion of SBS/SMRT bus accidents. I'm very cock sure that if u pull out both figures from Mindef and SBS, you end up with my shoe in your mouth. Do you know how many trips public bus services ply the road? For anyone with common sense and IQ enough for them to do reasonably well in a meritocratic society, something unfortunately u weren't born with, its super obvious.</p>
              <p>U saw that one thread on LTA Nicholas Chan which I started btw, just minutes ago and you come claiming MID accidents are aplenty cos its at the top of your head ahaha. Such a simpleton with the proverbial one track local university brain. You sound even worse than the NUS retards Hahaha.</p>
              <p>Obviously O and A levels are taken locally. What the person is made of decides where each is siphoned to and his ensuing destiny, after he takes the same paper as everyone else you dimwit haha. That is why it's meritocratic and the fact that the entire sample of population takes the same papers in a local place and thereafter the difference in each individual's calibre creates the watershed makes the difference even more marked. You're actually bringing up a point that serves against your argument, not for. Retard. Such a simple thing you also cannot get. Btw the O and A levels are done locally but did you know they are not local exams but from Britain? They're Cambridge papers and are done in hundreds of commonwealth countries worldwide, the same papers everywhere done by millions. You didn;t know? Hahhaha What a fuckwit through and through.</p>
              <p>And hey, make up your mind. So is it meritocratic or not? second last line you said "dun play peasant scholar here, the country is meritocratic (it's farmer vs scholar proper term ..well peasant is my description just for u :) second line even the MRT ads you see is full of elitism..u shoot yourself in the foot and its not even intentional. you're just a natural at it cos it's just your natural state. your natural self.. you just have to be yourself and be..and then it happens and your circuit gets 'shorted'. confused farmer brain unable to process anything that is harder than talking crap and 1 + 1..try anything harder and all the circuits get "short" hahahaha</p>
              <p>The more you talk to me in this exchange, the clearer it is to the audience that there's a reason why farmers are stupid and the system has done a fairly competent job is sieving the wheat.I will vote PAP out the one day it further bows to populist notions.</p>
              <p>For simpletons like you, a piece of advice so you won't make a fool of yourself in real life around important people, is stop before you want to speak every single time and think about it for at least 15 mins before you say that line. Now don't call me an elitist, look at how kind I'm to you.</p>
