              </div>
              <p>A CACHE of secret files stolen from ASIO and police and anti-corruption agencies has been discovered during a drug raid in Melbourne, raising fears of a major breach of national security and crime intelligence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Police are investigating whether the former head of intelligence and phone tapping at Victoria’s Office of Police Integrity stole the documents.</p>
              <p>The files were discovered on September 10 by detectives searching a house in Melbourne’s north as part of a drug investigation.</p>
              <p>They found boxes containing sensitive national security and law enforcement documents, including files from ASIO, the OPI and West Australian police.</p>
              <p>The suspected criminal whose home was raided is believed to be in a relationship with the former OPI official suspected of taking the documents. The former official previously worked for the Victoria Police and the West Australian Anti-Corruption Commission. It is unclear how long the pair have been in a relationship.</p>
              <p>The Age believes many of the documents contain information that may pose a threat to sources used by the agencies. The files also contain specific details on highly sensitive operational matters.</p>
              <p>As Australia’s principal intelligence agency, ASIO gathers information about any threats to national security, including terrorist activity and espionage. ASIO and law enforcement agencies, including the OPI, have strict protocols guarding the storage of such documents.</p>

              <p>THERE'S something in the water according to Elly Steel.</p>
              <p>It may not be a monster shark, but the Rockhampton woman believes it could be just as life-threatening.</p>
              <p>Mrs Steel will only drink spring water and San Pellegrino after discovering a thin yellow-green residue in her tap water filter three days ago.</p>
              <p>She believes it could be yellow sulphur and coal dust from the Fitzroy River.</p>
              <p>Despite the Department of Environment and Resource Management's reassurance no mines are currently discharging into the Fitzroy catchment, Mrs Steel said she believes the Ensham and Mt Morgan mines are behind the horrible smelling residue.</p>
              <p>She said she believes they are still discharging into the water.</p>
              <p>Mrs Steel's husband, Bill, said he couldn't even offer his friend of cup of tea for fear he would poison him.</p>
              <p>"I'm jumping up and down because I've got cancer and thyroid problems and I have to drink it," Mrs Steel said.</p>
              <p>She is worried Rockhampton water could be contributing to her illnesses.</p>
              <p>For more than 20 years the Steels have been drinking tap water from the Fitzroy River, five of those they have spent using their $490 water filter.</p>
              <p>Doug Annetts provides the replacement water filters for the Steels and about 5000 other Central Queenslanders.</p>
              <p>He said the problem could not come from the filter if it was changed every six months, as the Steels say they do.</p>
              <p>Rockhampton Regional Council yesterday said after receiving Mrs Steel's call, Fitzroy River Water logged a job to dispatch a crew to flush the lines in the area.</p>
              <p>Council said they would call Mrs Steel to discuss whether that may have been the issue.</p>

              <p>There is definately something wrong with the rocky water. its tastes aweful. im having to buy bottled water. if only there was a university in town that had smart enough people to actually study and publish the water facts. they could then put it in the local paper and shame the council\government into doing something.</p>

              <p>For the last six months my wife has been generally unwell, with dehydration and gastro. She was chatting with a friend about it and she suggested drinking bottled water. For around a month she has been doing so, and feeling much better, at least about the water. It seems to be a popular subject around town at the moment and we know of quite a few sick people suffering from similar problems. the majority of them have resorted to also buying their water, and we are yet to hear of anybody who isnt feeling better simply by not drinking the town water. Fair enough, we all know the council cant admit there is anything wrong with the waterways, that might make them liable .... Dont they run the water suply around here .....</p>
              <p>I remember a few years ago a project (Australian Army off memory) that made clean drinking water from one of the worlds most polluted sources, might have been in India, but we are not worth the cost .... Thanks council ....</p>
              <p>I see the roundabouts on the south side are getting more love, but we get very little, Theres been a chunk missing from the footpath out front of my house for about 4 months. Wait, I guess I'm lucky to have a footpath AT ALL out front of my house .... Council wont be interested in fixing it until someone falls into it and sues them, then it might get prioritized.</p>

His study allowed him to explore the distribution of water-suspended fluorescent nanoparticles throughout the eggs and adult bodies of a species of fish, known as the see-through medaka (<a title="Oryzias latipes" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Oryzias_latipes"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Oryzias latipes</span></span></a>). See-through medaka were used because of their small size, wide temperature and salinity tolerances, and short generation time. Moreover, small fish like the see-through medaka have been popular test subjects for human diseases and <a title="Organogenesis" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Organogenesis"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">organogenesis</span></span></a> for other reasons as well, including their transparent embryos, rapid embryo development, and the functional equivalence of their organs and tissue material to that of mammals. Because the see-through medaka have transparent bodies, analyzing the deposition of fluorescent nanoparticles throughout the body is quite simple. For his study, Dr. Kashiwada evaluated four aspects of nanoparticle accumulation. These included the overall accumulation and the size-dependent accumulation of nanoparticles by medaka eggs, the effects of salinity on the aggregation of nanoparticles in solution and on their accumulation by medaka eggs, and the distribution of nanoparticles in the blood and organs of adult medaka. It was also noted that nanoparticles were in fact taken up into the bloodstream and deposited throughout the body. In the medaka eggs, there was a high accumulation of nanoparticles in the yolk; most often bioavailibility was dependent on specific sizes of the particles. Adult samples of medaka had accumulated nanoparticles in the gills, intestine, <a title="Brain" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Brain"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">brain</span></span></a>, testis, liver, and bloodstream.

              <h3>Nanoparticles in Sunscreen</h3>
              <p>Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide nanoparticles in sunscreen have come under increasing scrutiny, as should be the case, given that we know so little about the behavior of nano-sized versions of materials like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide that have been used for years in bulk form.</p>
              <p>Because very small particles of metal oxides gave a transparent look to a sunscreen that was difficult to achieve with bulk sizes, many companies quickly grew to embrace the new technology. To this day these companies argue that nanoparticles are safe because there is no evidence that nanoparticles (defined as less than or equal to 100 nm) penetrate past the epidermal barrier. The argument begs its own refutation, as it implies that evidence to the contrary could pose a problem, and now more studies are emerging which indicate that nanoparticles do penetrate past the epidermis.</p>
              <p>A <a title="Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles" href="http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/118/1/140.short"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #dc7103;">test</span></span></a> by Dr. Brian Gulson et al from Macquarie University demonstrated that tracer zinc showed up in blood and urine samples taken from test subjects, indicating that zinc oxide nanoparticles were indeed being absorbed. Another <a title="Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles" href="http://mvorganics.com/news-research/tio2-nanoparticles"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #dc7103;">study</span></span></a> from the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Pharmacology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, found that TiO2 particles penetrated past the epidermis in hairless mice, subsequently reaching different tissues and causing pathologic changes to organs, most notably the skin and the liver.</p>
              <h3>Zinc Oxide vs Titanium Dioxide</h3>
              <p>While size is certainly an important factor to consider in risk assessment studies, the physical properties of the material itself must also be taken into consideration. A nanoparticle and nanostructured surfaces conference cited a<a title="Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles" href="http://spiedigitallibrary.org/proceedings/resource/2/psisdg/4258/1/86_1?isAuthorized=no"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #dc7103;"> study</span></span></a> showing that titanium dioxide particles in sunscreens “catalyzed DNA damage both in vitro and in human cells” when exposed to sunlight. The conference raised the question of “the suitability of photoactive TiO2 as a sunscreen component without further studies.”</p>
              <p>Zinc oxide applications on the other hand, even when absorbed, result in relatively harmless biological pathways and endpoints. To quote Dr. Gulson: “Maybe with young children where you’re applying it seven days a week, it could be an issue but I’m more than happy to continue applying [20% zinc oxide sunscreen] to my grandchildren.”</p>
              <p>Nanoparticles are now found in everything from cosmetics to clothing and even food, and as regulations now stand, consumers cannot depend upon labels to inform them of what they are getting. The rule of thumb used by environmental scientists is that the smaller the particle the riskier it is to use it. More studies need to be done on many of these nanomaterials, particularly when physical properties, such as photoreactivity in the case of TiO2, indicate that there might be problems.</p>
