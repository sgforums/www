              <h1>UN says discrimination embedded in Australia</h1>
              <div class="byline"><a class="toggle"></a></div>
              <p class="first">The United Nations human rights panel has rebuked the Australian government over its treatment of Aboriginals.</p>
              <p>At the release of a report from the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) in Geneva, one of the authors said discrimination has become "embedded" in the Australian way of life.</p>
              <p>Committee member Patrick Thornberry lamented the fact that the Australian constitution lacks any entrenched protection against racial discrimination.</p>
              <p>He said that that had led to a kind of structurally embedded discrimination in the way the Aboriginal intervention was being handled in the Northern Territory.</p>
              <p>"That may be a certain disappointment, if I may say so, that this issue particularly to do with Aboriginal communities - it could have been handled in a more sensitive and culturally sensitive way," he said.</p>
              <p>The committee criticised what it called the "unacceptably high level of disadvantage and social dislocation" for Indigenous people in the Northern Territory.</p>
              <p>It welcomed the Labor government's national apology to Indigenous Australians, but said that concrete steps to increase life expectancy or improve the rate of deaths in custody had not yet been demonstrated.</p>
              <p>The committee's recommendations were issued in a report following a regular review of Australia's compliance with an international treaty of 1969 prohibiting racism.</p>
              <p>The report also raised concerns about the handling of refugees and asylum seekers, as well as anti-terrorism measures; discrimination against newer, mainly Muslim, ethnic communities; and assaults on foreign students.</p>
              <h3>Refugees</h3>
              <p>CERD voiced concerns that the policy of processing refugees outside Australia meant that people seeking shelter in Australia were not being treated properly.</p>
              <p>The treatment of refugees, especially those arriving from Afghanistan and Sri Lanka by boat, was a contentious issue during the federal election campaign.</p>
              <p>On processing refugees, the committee recommended that the government:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Review its mandatory detention regime for asylum seekers so that detention is a measure of last resort; </li>
              <li>End the suspension of processing visa applications from Afghanistan and standardise asylum processes regardless of the country of origin or form of entry; </li>
              <li>Develop proper reception arrangements, especially for children, some of whom are kept in detention-like conditions away from their parents; </li>
              <li>Ensure that asylum seekers are not forced back to their countries of origin when they are being returned.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Companies targeted</h3>
              <p>The panel also said Australia must tighten rules governing the behaviour of its companies, especially mining firms, towards indigenous people at home and abroad.</p>
              <p>"The committee notes with concern the absence of a legal framework regulating the obligation of Australian corporations at home and overseas whose activities, notably in the extractive sector, when carried out on the traditional territories of indigenous peoples, have had a negative impact on indigenous peoples' rights to land, health, living environment and livelihoods," it said.</p>
              <p>The 18-member committee of independent experts on racism also told Australia to do more to integrate recent immigrants from Africa, Asia, the Middle East and other Muslim countries and tackle racism against Indigenous people in Australia.</p>
              <p>Suggestions included negotiating a treaty with Indigenous Australians, giving them better access to legal aid and tackling laws in the Northern Territory that discriminate on the basis of race.</p>
              <p>The committee bemoaned the fact that Australia had not complied with all its previous recommendations and asked the government to report back on what it was doing about the latest concerns and recommendations at the end of October, 2012.</p>

              <p class="wp-caption-text">Why was a sick Aboriginal man left in the middle of a busy road?to die?</p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>NATIONAL:</strong> AMY MCQUIRE* tells the story of a blatant act of racism, which is even more shocking when you consider the attempts to justify it.</p>
              <p>It happened at 2:30 on a Friday afternoon, as parents rushed to pick up their children from the nearby primary school.</p>
              <p>Car after car drove past the man, who lay heaped on the heated tarmac, his body touching the hard white lines in the middle of the road.</p>
              <p>It was unclear how long he had been lying there, vulnerable to the fury of oncoming traffic. It was as if this was a casual occurrence in the Central Queensland town of Rockhampton, a regional centre of 60,000 people, 5.7 percent of them Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander.</p>
              <p>The man was middle-aged and dark-skinned, an Aboriginal man from the nearby community of Woorabinda. Despite this, he looked much older, and had the health of an elderly man.</p>
              <p>His identity smudged out by traffic, his motionless body went largely unnoticed that afternoon. That was until one person stopped.<br>Stella Dempsey, a local who lived right around the corner, was driving her car towards the shopping centre when she spotted a dark mass through the flurry of wheels.</p>
              <p>Horrified, she watched as seven cars drove past him as fast as the 50 kilometre speed limit would allow, while she hurriedly tried to help.</p>
              <p>“I didn’t know what it was,” Ms Dempsey told me. “Then I said, ‘Oh my God, it’s a man! I pulled up and got out of the car. I said ‘mate what’s wrong?’</p>
              <p>“He was hitting his chest, hitting his chest with his hand.”</p>
              <p>Deeply concerned, Ms Dempsey asked the man what was wrong. He said it was a heart attack. “I freaked when he said that,” she says.</p>
              <p>Panicked and without her mobile phone, Ms Dempsey began stopping traffic. After slowing a few cars, and gaining assistance from another man, she was finally able to call for an ambulance. She says it took them about 15 minutes to get there.</p>
              <p>Ms Dempsey says that rather than evoking compassion for a clearly sick Aboriginal man, the incident attracted spectators.</p>
              <p>“I got cranky at a couple of cars. I swore at them. They really were just gawking. There was a woman who lived across the road. She was standing there… I was nasty to her, she was only a hop, skip and jump away and all she was doing was watching.</p>
              <p>“The point was, if you don’t want to get out of your cars, just call the police. Ring the police or the ambulance.”</p>
              <p>By then, police had also arrived. An Aboriginal Liaison Officer was on the scene, but didn’t speak to the man.</p>
              <p>“I’m disgusted at people. Disgusted at the ambulance. Disgusted at the liaison officer who didn’t come over,” Ms Dempsey says.</p>
              <p>“Disgusted that it took over seven phone calls to get the ambulance, and it took them 15 minutes to get there.”</p>
              <p>The man was later transported to the local hospital, where Ms Dempsey was unable to contact him.</p>
              <p>“I was unable to confirm what happened after that, because the man was discharged from the hospital, and had not returned to Woorabinda by the time of press. But the incident was picked up in the local newspaper – the Morning Bulletin, which lead with the headline: Motorists ignore sick man on road.</p>
              <p>I read of it with disgust and complete disbelief that this could happen in my own hometown.</p>
              <p>It had uncomfortable similarities to an incident in Brisbane in 2006, when respected Aboriginal opera singer Delmae Barton was left to lie for five hours in a pool of her own vomit at a busy Brisbane bus stop while bystanders passed her by.</p>
              <p>It was only after a group of Japanese students stopped to help her that she was able to receive some assistance. Ms Barton was actually an elder-in-residence at the nearby Griffith University, and was on her way to work when she suffered a stroke.</p>
              <p>The inexcusable racism of the case put protestations against Australia’s racist present to shame.</p>
              <p>On reading the Morning Bulletin’s story, I immediately thought there would be some sort of community outrage, or at least some soul-searching about how this could happen in a city that claims it isn’t racist.</p>
              <p>Ms Dempsey thought so too.</p>
              <p>Instead, she was confronted by excuses from those who read her story. She says people have asked her “well, what if he was drunk?”</p>
              <p>“No he wasn’t drunk, but even if he was, at the end of the day, it wasn’t about that,” she says. “He was lying in the middle of the road.”</p>
              <p>And he was sick. Comments of this sort were also reflected in the feedback section of the Morning Bulletin’s website.</p>
              <p>One commenter wrote: “Good on you for stopping Stella. I agree with the idea ALL people should receive help in instances such as this. What I do not agree with is media reporting and comments suggesting this person was not assisted due to his race. We all know many people/motorists will not stop or get involved in instances such as this.”</p>
              <p>Ms Dempsey is infuriated by those comments.</p>
              <p>“It was racist. I didn’t make it racist. They did, by not stopping. They didn’t stop and help him. People just drove past. Whether they’re black, white or brindle, you should stop and help them.</p>
              <p>“People said he might have jumped up. But for God’s sake, he was in pain! He wasn’t jumping up anywhere!”<br>When incidents like this happen, I think we should all pose the obvious questions: Could you imagine if this would have happened if the victim were white?</p>
              <p>Could you imagine an elderly white man, lying in the middle of a busy road, being refused help?</p>
              <p>Could you imagine people pondering whether he was drunk, or whether he would “jump” you if he was white? Could you imagine this even being an issue if he was white?</p>
              <p>If the answers to these questions are a unanimous no, then I think it’s pretty clear we have a racist incident. This is black and white. There are no shades of grey.</p>
              <p>It is not a “good Samaritan” issue. Otherwise there wouldn’t be these sort of excuses. People wouldn’t be using stereotypes to justify a deep failure, one that could have killed a sick man.</p>
              <p>I’m not saying that Rockhampton is any different to most towns around Australia, where racism is outwardly frowned upon, but inwardly accepted because white Australia still can’t admit the deep debt owed to Aboriginal people.</p>
              <p>Racism is tolerated because people are scared to confront it. This is reflected when incidences of such blatant racism occurs.</p>
              <p>The community withers from discussing the real issue because they still somehow believe that it mustn’t be their fault. They don’t want to believe it.</p>
              <p>Because that would involve admitting it, and then taking the necessary steps to make amends.</p>
              <p>But let’s be clear. This happened because an in-built prejudice, whether conscious or not, prevented everyone, except one person, pulling over and calling an ambulance.</p>
              <p>I’ve learnt a little bit about this man. He has had a hard life, marred by jail time. His brothers have died, and his own health is precarious.</p>
              <p>He’s a victim too, not only the blatant racism that left him lying in the middle of the road, but also an infuriating institutionalised and intergenerational racism.</p>
              <p>Australia has failed him, just like it is failing Aboriginal people all around the country. Racism is a disease that needs to be stamped out around the country.</p>
              <p>We can’t keep ignoring it. Because if we don’t confront it now, we will continue to hear about these cases, and the disgusting attempts to justify them, for many years to come.</p>
              <p>Otherwise next time, that person lying on the pavement could be my family. Or yours.</p>

              <p>Aboriginal children in Rockhampton, Queensland have been shot in an alleged racially-motivated assault on Australia Day according to The Australian and The Advertiser. The first attack was reported the day after Australia Day, while a second assault was only revealed to have occurred days later when the child concerned reported to hospital after having heard of the first attack.</p>

              <p>AN Aboriginal boy was shot in the back with an airgun pellet in an alleged random, racist attack on Australia Day, a Queensland court heard today.</p>
              <p>Hayden John Nitz, 17, today faced the Rockhampton Magistrates’ Court charged with unlawful wounding and weapons offences.</p>
              <p>Police prosecutor Senior Constable Darrell Dalton told the court Mr Nitz allegedly fired at the 13-year-old boy with an air rifle yesterday in a drive-by shooting outside a house on Alexandra Street, North Rockhampton.</p>
              <p>The boy was allegedly hit in the back and the pellet pierced his skin under the armpit.</p>
              <p>He is reported to be in a serious but stable condition in the Rockhampton Base Hospital.</p>
              <p>Snr Const Dalton said Mr Nitz was in a car with other people being sought by police when the shooting occurred.</p>
              <p>He said Mr Nitz, of Rockhampton, and his alleged accomplices had intended to “shoot indigenous persons”.</p>
              <p>…He was remanded in custody to face Rockhampton Magistrates’ Court again on April 3.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>AN Aboriginal girl initially treated for an insect sting has had surgery to remove an air-gun pellet fired at her in a string of suspected racist shootings on Australia Day.</p>
              <p>Five men already charged over the identical shooting of a 13-year-old Aboriginal boy in the same city will again face court on Tuesday over the attack on the girl.</p>
              <p>Police allege the two teenagers were among eight people who were fired upon in the central Queensland city of Rockhampton on Thursday. The other six were not hit.</p>
              <p>It emerged today that the 15-year-old girl sought treatment at Rockhampton Hospital on Australia Day, believing she’d been stung by an insect.</p>
              <p>Medical staff put a band-aid on her wound and sent her home.</p>
              <p>But the girl contacted police when she saw a media report about the air-gun attack on the 13-year-old.</p>
              <p>When she returned to hospital an x-ray revealed an air-gun pellet was lodged in her back. “She thought she was stung,” said Central Queensland Crime Co-ordinator Detective Inspector Mick Niland.</p>
              <p>“She went up to the hospital and they put a band-aid on it.”</p>
              <p>The girl was expected to be discharged from hospital today after the pellet was successfully removed.</p>
              <p>Five youths have been charged over the attack on the 13-year-old boy.</p>
              <p>The same five will face court on Tuesday, where charges will be laid over the shooting of the 15-year-old girl.</p>
              <p>Two of the five – Hayden John Nitz and Timothy Perry, both 17 – have already faced Rockhampton Magistrates Court on charges stemming from the attack on the boy…</p>

              <p>Police are interviewing a man over an attack on an army helicopter at Rockhampton airport in central Queensland.</p>
              <p>They say the man made his way onto the tarmac shortly after 9:30am (AEST) and damaged the aircraft.</p>
              <p>It is believed he allegedly used a mattock or axe on a Tiger helicopter, as a protest against the joint US and Australian military Exercise Talisman Sabre.</p>
              <p>Police say he is yet to be charged.</p>
              <p>The attack comes as a Rockhampton magistrate fined three protesters for trespassing in the Shoalwater Bay training area.</p>
              <p>Two men and a woman pleaded guilty to trespassing in the training area, where Exercise Talisman Sabre is being held.</p>
              <p>The peace protesters were detained by troops near the Samuel Hill airfield yesterday.</p>
              <p>The magistrate fined 46-year-old Margaret Pestorius $750, 24-year-old Andy Paine was fined $600, and 39-year-old Robert Jones received a $500 penalty.</p>
              <p>Ms Pestorius denies they were putting their lives at risk.</p>
              <p>"We took safety very seriously - we had a GPS, we had a compass, we made sure that we knew where we were," she said.</p>
              <p>"It's very benign country, it's beautiful Darumbal Country.</p>
              <p>"We weren't in the live-fire areas ourselves, but we were looking for other ways of disrupting."</p>

              <p>Rockhampton police inspector John Wacker said a small handgun had been found in the ute the woman was driving.</p>
              <p>"A firearm was located at the crash scene,'' Insp Wacker said this afternoon.</p>
              <p>Police have spoken to the injured man, 36, in hospital.</p>
              <p>A family friend has confirmed the man is the father of the dead child.</p>
              <p>He was in a stable condition after undergoing surgery for a gunshot wound to the stomach, police said.</p>
              <p>Neighbours in Zamia Way have told of hearing a gunshot, and then screams for help when another neighbour discovered the boy bleeding on the floor of the home.</p>
              <p>"We only heard one gunshot, but apparently there were more,'' said Jodiee Bennett, 35, who lives opposite the house where the shootings happened.</p>
              <p>"A man went in there and found the little fella on the floor.</p>
              <p>"There was screaming and everything ... because someone had found the baby hurt. They were calling out to get an ambulance.</p>
              <p>"They thought he had hit his head on the tiles, but apparently that was one of the gunshot wounds that the baby copped in the head.''</p>
              <p>She said her own three children were very upset.</p>
              <p>"It's really freaked our kids out.''</p>
              <p>Ms Bennett said her husband, Tex, saw a ute drive away from the home a short time after the gunshot was heard.</p>
              <p>"My husband saw a ute backing away,'' she said.</p>
              <p>Another neighbour, Lisa Willis, said she didn't know the people involved in the shooting, but she had often seen a woman and the child.</p>
              <p>"We saw the mother walking the baby a lot, without the pram, just carrying the baby, with a rottweiler,'' she told AAP.</p>
              <p>She said the shooting had come as a shock to the community, and most people in the street were staying indoors today.</p>
              <p>"It's a very quiet street."she said. "We're in shock. It's a sad tragedy."</p>
              <p>Regional Crime Coordinator Jon Wacker said neighbours entered the house after a woman was seen leaving.</p>
              <p>"Neighbours of the first residence had entered the dwelling after the female occupant had left and located a eight-month-old baby with a gunshot wound,'' he told the ABC.</p>
              <p>A major incident room has been set up at the Rockhampton police station.</p>
              <p>The house has been cordoned off and a crime scene established. Forensic officers are combing the scene.</p>

              <p>for those people who are in rocky and need to find a job to test the market .i think you would have a better chance in new zealand than rocky.unless you have a sporean  career doing dark,dirty and dangerous enviroment like some condemned criminal,its simply not wise getting jobs in oz.i have seen too much injuries at workplaces in my time in oz.</p>

              <p>things i have seen in such a short time:</p>
              <p>serious injuries to arm of an asian girl till she couldnt go back to work,heavy metal platform knocking down some poor old fella unconscious,unsafe work practices and rotten guidance by most people there especially by aussies doing dangerous work.im sure the tv ,newspapers and news would have much more info than i have.its their culture like in gunfights,murders,axe hacking away front door,drive by shootings and god knows what else.</p>
              <p>dont give them half a chance to blame you for anything under the hot sun.</p>
              <p>Be warned.just stay alive and in one piece.</p>

              <p>An Australian air force employee suffered severe burns to his head, face and chest when a portable toilet exploded beneath him as he apparently tried to light a cigarette.</p>

              <p>"There was some sort of explosion in a portaloo. It's believed the man was lighting a cigarette at the time," a Department of Community Safety spokeswoman said.</p>
              <p>The unidentified airman sustained third-degree burns when the toilet exploded while he was inside, the Defense Force said. He was expected to be flown to the state capital Brisbane for hospital treatment.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/man-seriously-injured-in-portaloo-explosion/story-e6freoof-1226101248336"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Australian military</span></a> and state government are "working closely" to investigate the cause of the blast, The Courier-Mail newspaper reported.</p>
              <p>"The cause of the explosion is unknown and is being investigated," Brig. Bob Brown said.</p>
              <p>The airman was in a serious condition and would be flown to Brisbane later Monday.</p>

              <p><span class="display-hidden-input-highlight">SERGEANT Michael Dunn, who suffered severe burns in a portaloo explosion at Rockhampton Airport, has died.</span></p>
              <p><span class="display-hidden-input-highlight">The Royal Australian Air Force Sergeant received horrific third-degree burns to 40% of his body; including his head, face, arms, chest and airways, from the July 25 explosion during Exercise Talisman Sabre. </span></p>
              <p><span class="display-hidden-input-highlight">He died in Royal Brisbane Hospital yesterday morning where he had been recovering from emergency surgery immediately after the blast.</span></p>
              <p><span class="display-hidden-input-highlight">In July, the Department of Defence said it was believed Sgt Dunn had fuel on his body, which contributed to the ignition.</span></p>
              <p><span class="display-hidden-input-highlight">It said reports from the Department of Community Services that the explosion was sparked by a cigarette, was speculation.</span></p>
              <p><span class="display-hidden-input-highlight">In a release yesterday, the Department of Defence said a thorough investigation was continuing and details may become available once the investigation was complete.</span></p>
              <p><span class="display-hidden-input-highlight">Chief of Air Force, Air Marshal Geoff Brown AM yesterday expressed his deepest sympathies, and those of the Air Force community, to Sgt Dunn's family.</span></p>
              <p><span class="display-hidden-input-highlight">"Sgt Dunn was highly respected and well-liked by his colleagues. </span><span class="display-hidden-input-highlight">Those who visited Mick since the accident were all affected by the courage and determination that he showed during his treatment and are extremely saddened by his passing," he said. </span></p>
              <p><span class="display-hidden-input-highlight">"Our thoughts are with the family, friends and colleagues of Sgt Dunn."</span></p>
              <p><span class="display-hidden-input-highlight">Sgt Dunn served 27 years in the RAAF, and was serving at RAAF Base Tindal where he and his family were long-standing members of the Katherine community.</span></p>
              <p><span class="display-hidden-input-highlight">The Dunn family requested privacy, but said in a statement that they were grateful for the efforts of the dedicated staff in the Burns Unit.</span></p>

              <p>Be prepared for rude checkout cashier folks at supermarkets.I came across one old woman at woolworths who had an attitude over the stuff i bought.looks like she owns the entire supermarket instead of working in the supermarket as a cashier.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>look back angrily at anyone serving you who gave you a poor service.if possible make calls to management to give them a pain in the ass.the receipt ypu get from cashier usually has the items you paid for plus the cashiers name printed on it along with other telephione numbers.if given any bad service ,look at cashier with a fierce look and proceed to call supermarket and give details of cashiers poor conduct.when i received the receipt from the "owner" of supermarket,she was reluctant to give it to me even as she had a sort of worried and concerned look on her old unhappy face.shes lucky  i didnt think much of her and her crappy service.</p>
              <p>apparently she didnt like asians especially when the singapore army is in rocky.</p>
