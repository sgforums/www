              <p>Read some thread on the si card but still confused thats why i need help.<br><br>Enlisted Aug 12 as bp batch.</p>
              <p>Fell down during soc (few week b4 pop ) &amp; landed on knees , at that point of time , the pain was manageable and i thought its those kind of thing where you rub the muscle rub and few days later the pain will get better.Didn't went to seek mo because I thought its like those kind of normal pain where it will go off and heal a few days later.</p>
              <p>Passed bmt and pes upgraded from pes bp to b1l1.</p>
              <p>Posted as air force tech.</p>
              <p>During days as trainee i felt there's pain in my knee esp during running and sprinting. I wanted to see a specialist but going to pass out soon  so i decided to see one when i get post to my unit.</p>
              <p>So went to the polyclinic after getting into the unit and got a refferal to specialist in hospital.Told the doctor about my story and schedule for mri and physio.</p>
              <p>From the mri results , doctor say might be hard to tell from mri , but say something like if open up the knee during operation might see "lines" or something like that , even with surgery also might not 100% recover.</p>
              <p>The memo wrote acl sprain and chondromalacia patella. Then he refer me to another specialist. This one wrote <span class="st">patellofemoral pain syndrome.</span></p>
              <p>Got a call up from my hr cuz i go ma for quite a few times and i got schedule a medical review. So i brought the memos and let the saf mo see , he let me sign a form and told me temp c 6 month. which mean till the month which i ord.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So question is my case , do i eligible for the card which cover my medical fees even after i ord and temp pes become perm pes if condition still remain same ?</p>
              <p>Judging from my current situation , my leg condition is like getting worse cuz</p>
              <p>Running (7.5/10 pain level) , sprinting (hurt a lot dun think i can)  , can't squat (hurts a lot ) , hurt also when bending my knee more than a certain angle</p>
              <p>Sitting down and getting up chair &amp; standing for long period ( common aching )</p>
              <p>walking and going down stairs(on some days i feel the aching a lot)</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Compensations for Service Injuries <br></strong></p>
              <p>Service injuries are injuries sustained while serving NS. <br>This also includes injuries sustained when reporting for duty or going home after duty. <br><br>You will get free medical treatment for such injuries even after ORD for lifetime. <br><br>Remember to first report your injury to your unit MO. Also remember to collect and keep all documents relating to your injury and your treatment. These will help when you submit the injury report and seek claims.</p>

              <p><br><strong>Service Injuries</strong> <br><br>If you sustained an injury during your NS training, it may be considered as attributable to service only when service is the cause of injury. If you sustained an injury during in-camp training (ICT), you are required to report immediately to your unit’s Medical Officer and unit S1. This is so that your unit can arrange to attend to your injury, and document your injury sustained in your medical docket and to officially file an in-service training injury report. <br><br>Before MINDEF determines that an injury is attributable to service, you are responsible for bearing all medical expenses. Treatment for your injury must be sought at government or restructured hospitals at your eligible ward and referred to by a government or SAF Medical Officer. <br><br>In the case of permanent disablement due to service injury, a medical board will be convened. Eligibility for disability compensation will be based on the degree of residual permanent disability as endorsed by the SAF Medical Board. <br><br>If your service injury requires continuous medical or hospitalisation leave beyond your in-camp training (ICT) period, you are eligible for a stepped-down compensation as a form of ex-gratia payment. Compensation will be based on your civilian pay or an equivalent regular serviceman’s pay (whichever is higher) if you do not receive any income from your employers. This ex-gratia payment is compensation for your loss of income during this period. Payment will cease when you are no longer on medical/hospitalisation leave or when disability compensation is paid, whichever is earlier.</p>

              <h3>Service Injuries</h3>
              <p>When an NSman sustains an injury due to an authorised activity
              sanctioned by the Unit Commanding Officer during his In-Camp
              Training (ICT), he is required to report the incident immediately
              to his Unit S1/Manpower Officer and Unit Medical Officer (MO), so
              that his unit can assist him in the filing of his injury report and
              to provide him with the required treatment for his injury.</p>
              <p>NSman is to provide the following, should he wish to submit his
              bills incurred for the treatment of his service injury:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Original tax invoice/receipt</li>
              <li>Certification from hospital/doctor that the bill incurred is
              for the treatment of his service injury</li>
              <li>Statement from CPF Board for amounts deducted from Medisave
              account (if any)</li>
              <li>Statement from insurance company on the amount deducted from
              policy plan for the treatment of his service injury (if any)</li>
              </ul>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div><br>
              <h3>Service Injury (SI) Card</h3>
              <p>Upon the approval of his injury as attributable to service, the
              NSman may be issued with an SI card, if it is certified by his
              attending doctor that he would require long-term medical treatment
              for his service injury. This SI card will provide him with fully
              subsidised medical benefits at government/restructured hospitals
              and polyclinics at his eligible ward for as long as he requires
              it.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div>
              <h3>Medical Reimbursement</h3>
              <p>If NSman has incurred medical fees at government/restructured
              hospitals and polyclinics for the treatment of his service injury
              prior to the approval, he is to retain all original receipts,
              certification from the doctor that the treatment is for his service
              injury and other supporting documents to his payment of medical
              fees. He may submit these documents to MINDEF/SAF Human Resource
              Shared Services Centre (HRSSC) upon the approval of his service
              injury for medical reimbursement. Do note that only medical fees
              incurred at government/restructured hospitals and polyclinics are
              reimbursable by MINDEF and he is to seek referral from doctors at
              polyclinic, hospital's A&amp;E or his Unit MO for treatments at
              government/restructured hospitals.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div>
              <h3>Ex-gratia Payment</h3>
              <p>If the NSman remains on continuous medical leave upon his ICT
              due to his service injury, he may be eligible for ex-gratia payment
              if it is certified by his employer that he is not receiving any
              salary for the period of his medical leave for his service injury.
              He is to provide a letter from his employer to inform MINDEF of
              this and the amount that is to be reimbursed, together with
              supporting documents.</p>
              <p>This ex-gratia payment, which is meant to compensate NSman's
              loss of income during the period of medical leave, will be paid in
              a stepdown approach based on his civilian pay or an equivalent pay
              of a regular serviceman, whichever higher. The ex-gratia payment
              will cease upon the termination of his medical leave or the award
              of his disability compensation, whichever earlier.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div>
              <h3>Lump Sum Disability Compensation</h3>
              <p>If it is certified by his attending Specialist that his service
              injury has stabilised, the NSman is to inform his unit to request
              for him to be reviewed by his Unit MO. He will be required to
              complete an authorisation form to allow MINDEF to obtain a
              Disability Assessment Report (DAR) from his attending Specialist on
              his service injury. The hospital will take about 3 to 4 months to
              revert with the DAR. Upon the receipt of the DAR with no further
              query, he will be scheduled to attend a PD Board by Military
              Medicine Institute (MMI) for the endorsement of the PD that has
              been assessed by his attending Specialist for him to have suffered
              as a result of his service injury. Upon the endorsement and
              approval of his PD Board Outcome, MINDEF/SAF HRSC will then be able
              to process his disability compensation. He will be informed of the
              award of his lump sum disability compensation subsequently.</p>

              <p><strong>How does an injured serviceman make a claim for the medical costs incurred for service injury?</strong><br><br>The PMC (Personnel Management Centre) will issue all serviceman with the SI (Service Injury) Card if their injuries have been approved as attributable to service by the Pensions / Awards Officer.
