              <p>This is absolutely ridiculous. I have tried to defer my NS citing my company factory opening ceremony in China to get deferment since I have to give presentation and entertain our VIPs and our dear SAF rejected my deferment even with an appeal from MP. WTF.. Why is the SAF sooo full of these highly charged testosterone ppl thinking that they are the king of the F#$king world and can destroy anyone's rice bowl and future!!!!! You mean missing me in the SAF for 1 ICT is going to determine our nation victory or lost in a war? Damn!! How many times my company have a factory opening! and how many times it will coincide with my bruddy ICT... I find this absolutely rubbish and ridiculous!!!!</p>
              <p>My boss (overseas) is damn pissed with me because he has supported me for 5 ICTs and now just asking to defer one is so difficult. WHY? How can I answer him? What about my coporate ladder climbing if I cannot even handle a milestone in our company? And all this during recession where company is keeping an 'eye' out on who to cut.....</p>
              <p>Any frens (S**T, I sound like John Mccain) knows if there is any other way I can do this? Appeal to president or unker lee?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sorry for me venting off my anger here.</p>

              <p>well you can always appeal to PM or MID.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>failing that, theres always my way. Skip NS and say your ricebowl is more important that NS. NS doesnt keep you alive for two years with a puny salary while your job keeps you alive. U skip your function and get fired, den go in. When u come out of NS, do you have a job?</p>

              <p>to TS, i support you all the way! yeah, i must say SAF is wrong this time since you have a very valid and important reason.</p>
              <p>make sure you deal with the people in your unit and not some HQ or CMPB whatever, because your unit will care more and you can deal with them on a more personal level.</p>
              <p>KNN.......people need to give very important presentation in China due to absolutely valid work committments and reasons, people need to make clients happy in order to answer to the big boss.......and these guys still ask him to re-service NS?</p>
              <p>seriously, SAF needs to be flexible a bit......if TS fail to get deferment and can't go China for business purposes, then his career and future more or less will be influenced.</p>
              <p>maybe TS's company might even hire foreign talent to fill in the space since FTs don't need to do any re-service.</p>
              <p>and if TS's rice bowl is affected, what then? claim job-loss compensation from MID, maybe? SAF will feed him till he finds another job?</p>
              <p>also ar, TS......worse come worse, try writing to Straits Times Forum deparment about your case and ley everyone know. Then, maybe you can get a good reply from COL Bernard Lim (forgot the name, but he's the director in charge of the Mindef public affairs, i think).</p>
