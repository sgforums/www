              <p>was reading up about the Brunei Royal Land Forces on Wikipedia and
              it set me thinking about how Singapore could reorganise the Guards and
              Commandos formation into an elite regular force supplemented by NSFs.
              Think of a hybrid between  the  French or Spanish Foreign Legions and
              British Gurkhas.</p>
              <p>The combat support formations such as
              logistics, signals, maintenance,armour and engineers would still be
              maintained by NSFs but the combat arms would have a regular force;
              therefore there would be a greater degree of professionalism and morale
              among our visible fighting forces.</p>
              <p>Brunei's regular army is
              currently 4 battalions strong;1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd with Support Battalion
              providing roles such as maintenance, armour recce, combat engineering
              and etc.Each battalion has 5 rifle coys' and a HQ coy excepting support
              battalion. This is drawn from a population in excess of 381 371 as of
              July 2008. They possess a budget of 4.5% of GDp (2006 fig).</p>
              <p>The
              current SAF as of 2007 had an operating budget of 10.58 billion or
              5.04% of GDP. Due to conscription we draw from a population of 4.48
              million (2005 fig), of which roughly a fith is foreign born so should
              be excluded.</p>
              <p>We  have a paratrooper-capable  Commando
              battalion with SOF capability that's a non-div asset and1 ADF along
              with the Guards formation under 21 Div.Evidenced by Tim Huxley's review
              of the SAF in "Defending the Lion City" and as seen by Operation Flying
              Eagle and the landing at Meulaboh,we have superb combined service
              cooperation and logistical capability.</p>
              <p>Given available money
              (unless government spending overseas has reduced availability of
              financial resources), it should be well within our reach to reorganise
              around a majority professional corps of soldiers with NSFs
              supplementing them in support roles such as signals, logistics,
              maintenance and driving.</p>
              <p>There are benefits to having these
              units being wholly professional. It would allow for us to maintain a
              force of greater skill,professionalism,fighting spirit and commitment
              compared to having the currently conscript-majority army (we all know
              the fighting spirit of an NSF).</p>
              <p>It would hopefully negate the
              decidedly low morale among the current cadre and in itself act as a
              force multiplier by having a professional force, as well as allowing us
              to fulfill manpower requirements as well. The limiting factor of
              conscript training is having to train according to the lowest common
              denominator.</p>
              <p>After certain thoughts,countries from which we
              could recruit from are the Philippines, Laos, Cambodia,
              Burma(perhaps),Bangladesh,Nepal and India.</p>
              <p>The political
              reality is that by drawing from these populations we avoid a possible
              clash of interests with the Malay-Muslim majority militaries of our
              neighbouring countries,by virtue of lacking Muslim/malay soldiers who
              may act as a possible fifth echelon within the military.</p>
              <p>They have a culture that is different enough to allow recruitment and integration within the SAF.</p>
              <p>Incentives
              offered would be paid housing,highly subsidised healthcare and free
              education for dependents as well as passport/citizenship/PR after a
              period of service of 6 years.They could also be offered education in
              English as well as upgrading their skills until the diploma level from
              polytechnics.</p>
              <p>This has the dual role of bringing in extra
              migrants who may settle down or not in Singapore and boosting the
              available military manpower.</p>
              <p>Philippines: majority Catholic
              population,general level of poverty would allow for
              indoctrination.Opportunities available to them would be a major
              incentive,given the pay level.</p>
              <p>Laos:mainly Buddhist culture.same as Phillippines - poverty would make incentives provided attractive.</p>
              <p>Cambodia: same as Laos.</p>
              <p>Burma:unsure but possible.<br>might have to rethink</p>
              <p>Bangladesh:
              majority Muslim population but with a culture very different to the
              Malay-Muslim ethnic identity.Prevailing poverty would motivate them to
              join.</p>
              <p>Nepal: Gurkhas.Do your own research. Example based on Indian and British Army Gurkhas.</p>
              <p>India:
              Large, diverse population with several major population centres and
              regions from which men could be recruited. Several areas with
              traditions of military service going back generations, as witnessed in
              history of the regiments of the Indian military. Vast pool to select
              from.</p>
              <p>All countries noted have growing populations with a
              level of economic development lower than Singapore as well as endemic
              corruption within their government systems.</p>
              <p>With the exception of
              Bangladesh and India,all are lacking substantial Muslim
              populations,avoiding the problem of a fifth column of resistance from
              within.</p>
              <p>Similarly Laos and Cambodia provide an ideal in that
              their Buddhist faith would allow integration into the majority
              Buddhist/Confucianist/Taoist Chinese-majority culture of Singapore.</p>

              <p>very interesting topic. TS must have thought about this for quite some time? But the way you phrase it is abit disjointed. And i believe, what you are trying to suggest, might already be in existence...how much do you know abt ADF?</p>

              <p>Assuming that SG is going to built up 2nd tier force. what would be the corel value of this 2nd tier Foreign Legion? What are they fighting for?  politically SG is always the younger brother? SG cannot stand up to the geo power of china n india.</p>
              <p>Than i have a question you have a 2nd tier foreign legion that are more experience than SAF? If it create a positive competition between the 2. and they work collusively together.  But if it create negative dysfunction between the 2 groups, it built tension. A trail of coup in the soup making.</p>
