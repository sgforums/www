              <p>Promotion for the NSF is to recognise his performance and past
              contributions during NS. Due to the onerous nature of duties for
              those deployed in combat vocations, they are promoted earlier than
              those in service support vocations.<br> <br> The SAF regularly reviews the promotion guidelines, the last
              revision to the enlistee promotion guidelines being in 2011 and
              2013. Currently, NSFs may be promoted to the Corporal (CPL) rank
              between the 12th and 18th month of service. The minimum service for
              promotion to Corporal First Class (CFC) has also been shortened in
              the 2013 revision. <br> <br> We would also like to highlight that promotion in rank is not an
              entitlement: servicemen would have to meet the stipulated minimum
              criteria to be eligible. Unit Commanders are also given the
              discretion to assess if a serviceman who qualifies for promotion is
              deserving of the promotion at the given point in time, after
              considering the operational requirements of the unit.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>He is doing 2 years. But his batch is the batch where you still can get 2 year 4 months.

            <div class='col-md body'>there's no guarantee time frame for NSF promotion. sometimes it depends on the unit. there are many below diploma/A levels who ORD as PTEs. and LCP is not a rank that is a must give, many goes form PTE to CPL.<br><br>the promotion time frame varies, for diploma/A levels, normally after 1 year in service CPC will notify the unit that you are eligible for promotion. but do take note that it is not a 100% thing. there are those who never got their CPL rank until they are very near to their ORD.</div>
