              <p>At the Committee of Supply Debates on 12 Mar 2013, Minister 
              for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen announced that he would chair a Committee to 
              Strengthen National Service (CSNS). In order to capture a a broad 
              spectrum of views and perspectives on NS, the CSNS comprises a Steering 
              Committee of 20 members from a variety of backgrounds and experiences.</p>
              <p>The CSNS will recommend measures to strengthen NS as the critical 
              institution for Singapore’s continued survival and success. A strong 
              defence and security protects our sovereignty and way of life. The 
              measures should further:</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;">a. Motivate National Servicemen to give of their fullest in performing their duties;</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;">b. Help National Serviceman balance these duties with family, career and personal commitments;</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;">c. Strengthen support for NS from families, employers, schools, permanent residents, new citizens and the broader community; and</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;">d. Promote recognition and appreciation of the contributions of National Servicemen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The <strong><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/strengthenNS/about/members.html">Steering Committee (SC)</a></strong> will be supported by two Working Groups (WGs), with Senior Minister of 
              State for Defence Mr Chan Chun Sing chairing one, and Senior 
              Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Dr Maliki Osman, the other.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/strengthenNS/about/support_wg.html"><strong>"Support for NS" </strong><strong>Work Group</strong></a><strong> </strong>will
               explore how to better allow National Servicemen to maximise their 
              contributions and abilities to serve NS.  The WG will look at how 
              servicemen can be deployed in a more meaningful way, and how to help 
              them fulfill their duties while balancing commitments and aspirations. 
              The WG will also look into strengthen support from various groups, such 
              as families, employers, permanent residents and new citizens.</p>
              <p>The <strong><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/strengthenNS/about/recognition_wg.html">"Recognition and Benefits for National Service" Work Group</a></strong> will explore ways to promote the recognition and appreciation of National Servicemen's contributions.</p>
              <p>Over the next 6 months, the Steering Committee and WGs will engage 
              Singaporeans through conversations on NS via focus groups, town hall 
              sessions and this website. Committee members will also be participating 
              in these activities, and surfacing the views of National Servicemen and 
              other stakeholders on how NS can be strengthened.</p>

              <p>National Service (NS) is the cornerstone of Singapore's defence. Our 
              National Servicemen are the backbone of Singapore's defence.  With our 
              small population, NS is the only way for Singapore to maintain a strong 
              and credible defence force to protect our independence and sovereignty.</p>
              <p>NS is a rite of passage, a national effort and a shared 
              responsibility. The commitment of our National Servicemen to defence is 
              not possible without the strong support from their families, friends and
               <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/nsmatters/employers/support_for_employers.html"><strong>employers</strong></a>.</p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>The NS Journey</strong></p>
              <p>Our National Servicemen serve in a variety of operational roles in 
              the SAF, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the Singapore Civil 
              Defence Force (SCDF).</p>
              <p>The NS journey comprises 2 years of full-time NS and 10 years of 
              Operationally Ready NS (ORNS). This is the time needed to train our 
              Servicemen so that they are proficient in military skills and are 
              operationally ready, both as individuals and as part of a cohesive 
              fighting unit.</p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Understanding our National Servicemen</strong></p>
              <p>As far as possible, we try to help our Servicemen balance their 
              personal plans and persuits - in education, career and family, with 
              their NS commitments, without compromising training and operational 
              readiness.     </p>
              <p>For example, with improvements to technology and training methods, 
              the SAF has been able to reduce the duration of full-time NS from 2 1/2 
              years to 2 years (2004) without sacrificing training standards. 
               Similarly, in 2006, we reduced the duration of Operationally Ready NS 
              (ORNS) from 13 years to 10 years.</p>
              <p>For In-Camp Trainings (ICTs), while we cannot accede to every request
               for deferment, commanders do try to exercise flexibility to help NSmen 
              meet their civilian obligations without sacrificing the training of the 
              unit.</p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Going beyond the call of duty</strong></p>
              <p>Many National Servicemen have gone beyond the call of duty because of
               their strong belief and commitment to National Defence and their fellow
               National Servicemen.  For example, a number have volunteered under the 
              Voluntary Extension of Service (VES) scheme to extend their full-time NS
               to serve their unit beyond the 2 years.  Under the Reservist On 
              Voluntary Extended Reserve Service (ROVERS) scheme, NSmen have 
              volunteered for ICTs beyond their 10-year training cycle.</p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Recognising our National Servicemen</strong></p>
              <p>What our National Serviceman does is vital to the peace and 
              prosperity we enjoy as Singaporeans. A price cannot be put to their 
              contributions. </p>
              <p>But to show our appreciation, we have instituted several measures to 
              let them know that we recognise the personal sacrifices they have made 
              for all of us.</p>
