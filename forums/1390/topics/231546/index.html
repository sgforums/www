            <div class='col-md body'>Dear all,<br><br>I have been reading a lot on these forums on have finally registered an account. I have noticed that this forum is a wonderful channel for me to share my thoughts and issues with all you amazing people out there.<br><br>It has been a few weeks since I have been posted to this particular camp and I have been developing signs of depressions/anxiety. Over the weeks, I constantly feel very empty and void inside my heart and I couldn't get to sleep at night. Lots of things race through my mind when I shut my eyes to rest but I just couldn't get to sleep. I feel the need to call home to speak with my mum as and when I have the time and every so often after doing that, I feel extremely emotionally upset and subsequently cried. Often I have this nauseous feeling within me and tears will start welling up in my eyes whenever I think of things at home, at camp, etc. I do not want to interact with anyone within my platoon and I am all the time in an extremely gloomy mood. I am really sick and tired of this and I even ask myself why am I behaving like that. It has already been weeks and there has have been no signs of improvement whatsoever.<br><br>I have since relayed all these problems and issues to my mum and the camp MO. I have also consulted a private practice outside (psychatrist) and will be having a consulation with the psychatrist at MMI together with my mum.<br><br>I have a few queries that I sincerely hope will be answered.<br><br>1) What usually happens when I see the psychatrist at the MMI?<br>2) Are cases like mine common?<br>3) What usually happens after the initial visit at MMI?<br><br>All replies are greatly appreciated in advance.</div>

The psychiatrist will give you a thorough psychological evaluation. I'm not sure how, but I suppose it'll be through interviews and such.<br><br>2). How common? Hard to say. I've seen and met a number of patients diagnosed with depression when I was doing SAF Psychiatric Ward duty, but I don't have any hard numbers.<br><br>3). That will be up to the discretion of the psychiatrist you meet. Depending on how his evaluation of your psychological condition, it can range from anywhere between issuing of medications and light duties to downgrading.<br><br>Be sure to tell him that you're seeing a private external psychiatrist as well.<br><br>Whatever the case, seeing your MO and getting an appointment at MMI is a step in the right direction. Keep your hopes up; depression is a condition that can be treated.<br><br>Good luck.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
