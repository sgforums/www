I have noticed that this forum is a wonderful channel for me to share my thoughts and issues with all you amazing people out there.<br><br>It has been a few weeks since I have been posted to this particular camp and I have been developing signs of depressions/anxiety. Over the weeks, I constantly feel very empty and void inside my heart and I couldn't get to sleep at night. Lots of things race through my mind when I shut my eyes to rest but I just couldn't get to sleep. I feel the need to call home to speak with my mum as and when I have the time and every so often after doing that, I feel extremely emotionally upset and subsequently cried. Often I have this nauseous feeling within me and tears will start welling up in my eyes whenever I think of things at home, at camp, etc. I do not want to interact with anyone within my platoon and I am all the time in an extremely gloomy mood. I am really sick and tired of this and I even ask myself why am I behaving like that. It has already been weeks and there has have been no signs of improvement whatsoever.<br><br>I have since relayed all these problems and issues to my mum and the camp MO. I have also consulted a private practice outside (psychatrist) and will be having a consulation with the psychatrist at MMI together with my mum.<br><br>I have a few queries that I sincerely hope will be answered.<br><br>1) What usually happens when I see the psychatrist at the MMI?<br>2) Are cases like mine common?<br>3) What usually happens after the initial visit at MMI?<br><br>All replies are greatly appreciated in advance. </div></blockquote>I suffered almost the exact same symtoms as you. I seem to be ok during BMT, then when i got posted to a combat unit I started to feel like you do... extremely moody, homesick, miserable, don't feel like socializing with my platoon mates etc etc.<br><br>For no reasons also I started to reminisce about times gone by my primary school days etc... even missing my grandma who departed eight years ago and whose death I thought I have long accepted... I generally wallow in self-pity... to the extent that I was very reckless during training in the hope that I will be injured and downgraded.<br><br>In retrospect and reflecting inward, I am not used to the regimental (and hectic) routines of a combat soldier and that is causing me a lot of stress.<br><br>I often ask myself why I dont feel this way during BMT, and I manage to know the answer after a while.<br><br>So how do I get out from this vicious cycle? I am also not sure. But despite myself, in time I started socializing with my platoon mates (those in combat will know that its next to impossible NOT to socialize with your platoon mates... given the amount of time you spent togather lol). That fostered some kind of comradeship and give meaning to the things I do in my unit. The things you and your platoon work towards, the pride when you have made some accomplishments (like being the key platoon in securing the best infantry unit for my unit, watched by minister somemore), and the punishment you all have to go through when you screw up (defaulter's parade anyone?)<br><br>These kind of activities slowly but surely washes out the negative emotions and miseries in the early days of my posting... and by the time we finish all 3 overseas training, I am a proud member of my unit and my vocation...<br><br>Hope that you will overcome your depression in time... Just my 2 cents, but I think socializing with your platoon mates would be a very good start!</div>
