            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Friar, I've seen your thread and i believe that u are suffering what many ppl call BMT blues. I have also been through this phase in my BMT. But i have a more positive mindset, you must have a goal you hope to achieve when serving NS or else you would just think its a waste of time.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> Aim high!!!<br>Like aspiring to go command school. When i was in BMT, i told myself i wanted to go SISPEC. Many of my platoon mates made fun of me by calling me SISPEC but i accepted that instead. In fact, they are are the ones that pushed me to go through whatever my instructors did to me. In fact, 1 instructor from another platoon was very pissed when other started calling me SISPEC and he started dishing out punishments on me. Many of myplatoon mates picked on me whenever they had the chance. I endured it and through this, it made me stronger and more determined. I decided to be proactive in whatever my instructors asked us to do.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Volunteer your services!!!<br>Do not be afraid!!!<br>Although it might attract the jealousy of many of your platoon mates, but, in the end, u will gain their respect if you can overcome anything they dish out to you.<br><br>Towards the end of BMT, I had earned the respect of many of many platoon mates who i have seen some of them breaking down and crying in bunk. Some of them have broken up with their girlfriends and some of them couldn't take the stress.<br>Don't let this affect you!! You must tell yourself if you break down and cry yoursef, you will be like one of them, who are weak-minded and afraid.<br>During the peer apprasial, many of them told me they had voted for me to go command school.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Be confident!! No matter whether you made a mistake, be cool about it. Don't try to cover it up as it will make you seem hypocritical. Just be humble and modest but also at the same time proactive in whether tasks u have to do.<br><br>With determination and aspirations, i believe that you can do it too like many of us who have gone through the fruitful years in National Service. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>( By the way, i just finshed my NS, i still think about the good old times. The bonding with my men, the jokes i shared with my colleagues.... Those are unforgettable. Im going to Australia to study end of this month, but i will never forget to bring my army photos and memories with me there.)</div>

I have noticed that this forum is a wonderful channel for me to share my thoughts and issues with all you amazing people out there.<br><br>It has been a few weeks since I have been posted to this particular camp and I have been developing signs of depressions/anxiety. Over the weeks, I constantly feel very empty and void inside my heart and I couldn't get to sleep at night. Lots of things race through my mind when I shut my eyes to rest but I just couldn't get to sleep. I feel the need to call home to speak with my mum as and when I have the time and every so often after doing that, I feel extremely emotionally upset and subsequently cried. Often I have this nauseous feeling within me and tears will start welling up in my eyes whenever I think of things at home, at camp, etc. I do not want to interact with anyone within my platoon and I am all the time in an extremely gloomy mood. I am really sick and tired of this and I even ask myself why am I behaving like that. It has already been weeks and there has have been no signs of improvement whatsoever.<br><br>I have since relayed all these problems and issues to my mum and the camp MO. I have also consulted a private practice outside (psychatrist) and will be having a consulation with the psychatrist at MMI together with my mum.<br><br>I have a few queries that I sincerely hope will be answered.<br><br>1) What usually happens when I see the psychatrist at the MMI?<br>2) Are cases like mine common?<br>3) What usually happens after the initial visit at MMI?<br><br>All replies are greatly appreciated in advance. </div></blockquote>Tell your OC/CO your problems in the mean time.
