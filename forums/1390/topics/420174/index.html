              <p>I am not in the army, i am still schooling. But yet, i feel that the SAF are not getting the recognition that they deserve.<strong> <span style="color: #800080;">What are they to us? Just some idiots in green uniform, botak, wearing a helmet? </span>WHO ARE THEY DEFENDING? US</strong>. We unappreciative people. Is it their duty to do so? I do not think so. Every guy has to go through NS. But what if everyone decides not to go NS and just go detention barracks for 2 to 10 years? Who will defend you? Your neighbour? Malaysia? Indonesia?<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> DREAM ON. </span></strong></p>
              <p>I feel so lao-kui (embarass)  when i go out and tell others that i am a Singaporean. Why? Because everyone know that Singaporeans are unappreciative. All they do is <span style="color: #ff6600;">complain, write to MP, write to the media and...COMPLAIN MORE...</span></p>
              <p>Sometimes i wonder to myself, "Why are we all so unappreciative? Instead of waiting for others to make the change, why cant we take the first step, take the initiative to change things?"</p>
              <p>People always say "<span style="color: #0000ff;">Adapt or Die. The environment will never change to adapt to you. But you can adapt to the environment.</span>" Singaporeans, lets all get up, stop complaining, <span style="color: #ff0000;">DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT and MAKE A CHANGE.</span></p>
              <p>If you do not agree to what i am saying, explain why. If you cant explain it, go ECP, dig a hole in the sand, put your head in and take a deep breath. Do not call the ambulance, save the earth and precious resources. Stop pollution and wastage. Just die there.</p>

              <p>Do take these into consideration:</p>
              <p>Defense budget covers defence procurement, vehicle/aircraft/ship and equipment spare parts and maintenance, logistics (fuel, electrical and phone bills, meals, air and sea transport costs, that king koil mattress you sleep on, etc), training, building construction and maintenance, and lots of other stuff, not to forget that cheap beer you buy from the mess....</p>
              <p>Say if privates do get $1k a month, CPL all the way up to LTA will increase  proportionately. A domino effect for regular pay as well (if not then where's the incentives for signing on?). Multiply by 12. Throw in an extra month for regulars. Can someone lend me a calculator for that?</p>
              <p>Logically, by cutting the quality of meals or eliminating it altogether, downgrading to wooden board beds, cutting electricity to the plug you use to charge your handphones or power your other stuff, giving you old or sub-standard equipment to train and fight with, it may be possible to raise that allowance but then again, you'd just end up complaining about those. But I hardly fancy more F5s can take on a few SU-37s or more SM1- tanks can overcome MBTs. Then again, good new toys never come cheap.</p>

              <p>no matter how you calculate the budget does not make sense. Ten year ago it is like this, ten year later will be still like this. </p>

              <p>You still have not factored in the increase in REGULAR pay. A 2LT with a $1800 allowance is very close to the starting pay of a regular 2LT. Going by this, regular pay-rolls have to be proportionately increased so on and so forth for all regular servicemen and you end up with the Generals EACH getting much more than half a million a year? So how does THAT amount to ONLY a 1.7% increase?</p>
              <p>Even though the 3 remaining Challengers are not as useful as before, they certainly gave us an edge in submarine operations within the region. I'm pretty sure its better to spend the money on the HIMARs, Leopard MBTs and F-15SGs to awe the other armed forces in the region. Or would you prefer the Indonesians laughing at our toys? I'd prefer to have a bigger and better stick than the others.</p>
              <p>Since you already pointed out the financial model of the current government, what makes you think they'll even consider the idea of raising NSF ALLOWANCE so drastically?</p>

              <p>Why should a NSF 2LT earn any less than a regular 2LT? Is his service any less worthy?</p>
              <p>Singapore does not take that view. NSFs and NSmen are the backbone of the force. We have NSmen MAJs going for command school way into their NSmen years. They should be equally compensated.</p>
              <p>The SAF need not choose between paying men properly and good weapons.</p>
