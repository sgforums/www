              <p>Face the fact. We are a city. We aren't really a country.<br> What we are protecting looks more like a corporate than a
              country.</p>
              <p>How can Singaporeans not complain about the standards of living
              here if the city itself was built from 0 onwards with our own blood
              and sweat while the ministers enjoy the finer life?</p>
              <p>The truth about developed countries are the contrast between the
              struggles of its citizens to against the elites.</p>
              <p>Just look at our soldiers. How much are they being given to
              serve this city? Imagine if the millions of dollars given to the
              ministers were given to our soldiers instead giving them the
              allowance of a full time employees outside. People will definitely
              look at soldiers differently.</p>
              <p>Its really pathetic how a world class country cannot provide
              free transport for NSmen. Really.</p>

              <p>Why should a NSF 2LT earn any less than a regular 2LT? Is his service any less worthy?</p>
              <p>Singapore does not take that view. NSFs and NSmen are the backbone of the force. We have NSmen MAJs going for command school way into their NSmen years. They should be equally compensated.</p>
              <p>The SAF need not choose between paying men properly and good weapons.</p>

              <p><br>True. They both serve in the same capacity. But the FACT remains that Regulars are basically paid more because they are paid to commit their futures to the organisation. If not than what's the whole point of Army recruitment? All the economics and you lack a simple understanding of HR?</p>
              <p>This is a CONSCRIPTED force. You're not the only one short-changed. We're all in this together. Deal with it.</p>

              <p>Sure minimum term is 4 years but if I get the same amount in allowance as a regular gets his/her pay, then WTF would I need to sign on for? Suffer an extra 2 years on top of the NS when I could have gone for other careers or studies? Tell me where's the logic in this from a HR manager's POV?</p>
              <p>So now you're decending into stereotyping when facts that do not support your "vision" are brought up? If the points brought up do not make sense to you or lead you to have that impression then so be it. I don't have to go around justifying what I do nor impress you.</p>

              <p>People sign up because the pay is attractive, they don't sign up because others are getting less. They don't benefit from others getting less. Are you citing a new HR theory?</p>
