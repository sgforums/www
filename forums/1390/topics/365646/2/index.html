              I agree with skythewood statement.  In fact, in a real war, the closer a general is with his men, the more danger he pose to them. 
                  
                  However, I agree with many forumers that SAF lack operational experience.  Peacekeeping mission is still not as realistice as war. Peacekeeping is bascially protecting people while in war is bascially killing people.  However, I believed that SAF is gradually taking up steps to gain more experience by participating in more &amp; more dangerous mission.  
                  
                  While there is a need to gain operation experience, we have to bear in mind that SAF is sending singaporean boys &amp; girls to war zone.  Will your parents allow you to go to Iraq or Agfanistaion to fight along the US now?? What if we read the news tomorrow that certain SAF soldier killed or injured in Agfanisation???

              <p>This is probably why all PSO missions require volunteers. The sensitivity of sending NSFs for combat missions without their own permission is something we are probably not up to dealing with, at the moment.</p>
              <p>Even many Americans were quite unhappy that their state National Guard (which are volunteer citizen soldiers) were federalised and deployed abroad for OIF and OEF.</p>
              <p>However, I'm still optimistic that we are slowly moving up the ability curve, and that our regulars sent abroad are more than able to carry out whatever needs to be done.</p>

              <p>I think we have to be realistic here…which general does not give
                  command from his HQ &amp; dun follow his men to battlefield? Even
                  US generals command the Gulf War &amp; Iraq War from the comfort of
                  their HQ. Likewise those garang generals from <span>PLA</span>, DPRK etc also command from the HQ.</p>
              <p>During the Gulf war, the real command of the battle is from the
                  white house then to the pentagon &amp; lastly the forward command
                  is at saudi arabia. The rationale is that commanding from behind
                  provide a wider perspective of the battlefield scenerio and better
                  situational awareness. Imagine, if a general get killed while
                  fighting his troops, do u think the entire army will be
                  demoralised? How many lives will be lost then?</p>
              <p>Fyi, my former battaltion CO in active days was a scholar also.
                  He was a very young guy then certainly brilliant in his tactics and
                  he formulate many unconvential tactics during our <span>NSF ATEC</span>. We achieved Redcon 2A in the end. Now he is the
                  commander 9 Division.</p>
              <p>Regardless whether he is a paper general or whatever, so long he
                  can accomplish his objective is good enough.</p>

              <p>if this person is only a 2 bar, he is just a junior lawyer, not a 'big name' in legal circles, and for your information, to compare apples with apples, young lawyers earn less than half of what some of young army officers earn, and senior lawyers earn less than our SAF commanders earn. of cos we know from those people who know nothing about these things, they're easily impressed and swayed by social stereotypes about lawyers and doctors.</p>
              <p>I hate to break it to you, but most of the non lawyer and doctors high fliers have earnings that completely obliterate their peanut pay.</p>

              <p>The one day Singapore is attacked and SAF is mobilised to fight off the attackers, is the day you will have this 'real' war experience of our generals you keep harping about.</p>
              <p>Do you realise the irony of this? you're using the peace you enjoy because of them, against them to say they have hence, no 'real' war experience because SAF is doing what it's supposed to do. I'd love to see all of you except singmarine take up your SAR 21 and fight along for Singapore when the day comes, so that you can talk about the general's 'real' war experience, the one day if SAF fails to do its job.</p>
              <p>Also, an ATEC mission is as good as it gets for most countries. And for the officers, it is war to them. It's their war against the other commanders.</p>

                  I hope we appreciate that so long SAF do not need to fight a war that means SAF has already won the war.  10 years has passed &amp; more information are declassified.  Our unit has only 1 year left to MR but we will never ever forget the nerve-breaking experience we went through.  When we return for every ICT, we will always talk abt this memories.

              life in army is regimental, wear a uniform and if you made a mistake, you can be charged and your career in SAF can be finished or condemned.
              
              SAF pay you higher so that can entice people to serve and protect the country, if not who wants to sign on rite. also the career in SAF is quite short, like 50 for officers?
