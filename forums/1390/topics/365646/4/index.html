              <p><br> Good try..but you are wrong again. You will be surprised that BG
                  Chan came from a poor family. He is from a single parent (Mother
                  only) family with 4 siblings. He studied really hard to get the SAF
                  scholarship to pay for his study &amp; living expenses for his
                  younger sbilings. I served under his command during my 8/9 ICT. A
                  very forthfright man, he will fuck the ITI trainers in front of us.
                  I know many of us prefer to see our generals wearing red berets
                  rather than spectacles. But at the end of the day, whether
                  Singapore wins a war depends on brains more than strength.</p>

              <p><br>it's been interesting to see the reaction of the same sour grape jealous types who love to rubbish elites. Me ish laughing ze peasants' reactions to it when people who know your victims strike back... dun think smart people are easy to bully.... So what about you, Nikar3 and Arapahoe and the 936493396363 people online who are so jealous of elites? Dun need to talk about star lah. That's too far liao. Like gloater said, have you managed to achieve what their anal hair has? I guess not huh?? this one from the start of the 1st second we all also know. just that no one says only.</p>
              <p>Why? Cos the society is now full of the cantankerous noisy sound of the jealous have-nots rubbishing the have.</p>
              <p><br>In this case here for SAF, it's the have-it-all, cos such people don't exist in their world, they never saw before in NS, dunno why maybe cannot even baikabaichiew in mindef..and only end up mixing with the have-nots and farmer officers who whole day whine about how garang they are and how they're hard done by... there's only so much of the jealous shit people watching on the side can take. sooner or later, you will bound to see kick back like now. And its just a little slap on the wrist already so hurt and wounded liao.. not even 1% of what you have been doing haha sibeh ho chio.<br></p>

              <p><br> it's been interesting to see the reaction of the same sour grape
              jealous types who love to rubbish elites. Me ish laughing ze
              peasants' reactions to it when people who know your victims strike
              back... dun think smart people are easy to bully.... So what about
              you, Nikar3 and Arapahoe and the 936493396363 people online who are
              so jealous of elites? Dun need to talk about star lah. That's too
              far liao. Like gloater said, have you managed to achieve what their
              anal hair has? I guess not huh?? this one from the start of the 1st
              second we all also know. just that no one says only.</p>
              <p>Why? Cos the society is now full of the cantankerous noisy sound
              of the jealous have-nots rubbishing the have.</p>
              <p><br> In this case here for SAF, it's the have-it-all, cos such people
              don't exist in their world, they never saw before in NS, dunno why
              maybe cannot even baikabaichiew in mindef..and only end up mixing
              with the have-nots and farmer officers who whole day whine about
              how garang they are and how they're hard done by... there's only so
              much of the jealous shit people watching on the side can take.
              sooner or later, you will bound to see kick back like now. And its
              just a little slap on the wrist already so hurt and wounded liao..
              not even 1% of what you have been doing haha sibeh ho

              <p>No idea about Lim Hock Yu, never interacted with him before. What's he like? How old was he when he was CO?</p>
              <p>I heard Chan Chun Sing give a speech to commanders of 9Div before he handed over command to Lim Hock Yu. He freely told everyone that he was from a humble family, and had no money to go overseas to study and just felt grateful that he was given an SAF scholarship that he worked hard for, so he just wanted to give back to the SAF. He's known to be a no nonsense commanders, like most officers, not as approachable and smiley as Bernard Tan but still humble and very much on the ground. Chan Chun Sing will tell you straight what he thinks is BS about the system, unlike some people at the top who have their heads in the cloud and cannot accept negative feedback, he tells you what he thinks is BS  warts and all, and can analyse why, even if the problems are fundamentally hard to change, he'll spit it out analytically explaining to you why the BS is there in the bigger picture, instead of giving you some PR glossy spiel about changing the world so that he can benefit his CEP.</p>
              <p>Let's just say because of Chan, Infantry is becoming the next hot thing. As you know its been armour occupying all the glory in the last decade and these things come in phases, depending on where the superstar of the moment is from. Now its infantry's turn. But this may not last long as there's a chance he's being poached earlier than expected to the civil service, and being courted for political office.</p>
              <p>Tan Chuan Jin is another officer we all respect. Those who worked with in NDP all feel the same. I sat in his dialogue session with officers under his command and worked with him in NDP. Anyone who's had a brush with him talking about SAF will tell you the kind of leader he is. Straight talking, analytical, humble and he knows what you want to say before you finish your sentences. I have friends who raised some points to him, before they can finish talking their sentence, BG Tan has everything figured out and his thoughts and speech are very clear, don't try to smoke him. He's born in the same year of BG Chan and from the same batch in RJC, but he chose to go to Sandhurst for a year when he was a cadet instead of disrupting like the other scholars, and chose to take his scholarship only one year later.</p>
              <p>I started a thread on him after I worked and talked to him during NDP. http://sgforums.com/forums/1390/topics/362413 BG Tan Chuan Jin got himself a stalker fan in the military http://tanchuanjinfan.blogspot.com/ during the <span style="font-size: 85%;">Meulaboh Ops in Indonesia that he commanded.<br></span></p>

                                what you want to say before you finish your sentences. I have
                                friends who raised some points to him, before they can finish
                                talking their sentence, BG Tan has everything figured out and his
                                thoughts and speech are very clear, don't try to smoke him. He's
                                born in the same year of BG Chan and from the same batch in RJC,
                                but he chose to go to Sandhurst for a year when he was a cadet
                                instead of disrupting like the other scholars, and chose to take
                                his scholarship only one year later.</p>
              <p>I started a thread on him after I worked and talked to him
                                during NDP. http://sgforums.com/forums/1390/topics/362413 BG Tan
                                Chuan Jin got himself a stalker fan in the military
                                http://tanchuanjinfan.blogspot.com/ during the <span style="font-size: 85%;">Meulaboh Ops in Indonesia that he

              <p>He is dumber than I had thought and is unable to understand english. no wonder..so this is what happens when..........his mom drank and smoked heavily when she carried him.</p>
              <p>I believe at this point with the latest embarrassing response from him reinforcing what I said, even his brethren is cringing in embarrassment, perhaps that's why none of them came to his rescue.</p>

              <p>Never worked with Lim Hock Yu before so can't comment. he also took over as chief inf officer from BG Chan, who is now Chief of Staff, Joint Staff. Well word is going around that the next COA is down to between BG Chan and BG TCJ. And I'm placing my bets on TCJ.</p>
              <p>TCJ is not short, quite tall, about 180cm I think, well build, you can see his picture here http://sgforums.com/forums/1390/topics/362413 after we all spoke to him, we came away more impressed by him, as for badges, BG Tan has the Guards heliborne badge, don't think he is a ranger.</p>

              <p>of course, the chap can never answer the question about who he really is ... what what is his "elite" background, to speak of a general officer as a farmer in charge of a "worst and least important" unit of a few thousand men .... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>cos he's really a nobody ... or perhaps he's regurgitating what he's heard over the water cooler, between shredder and coffee runs ? ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>hey kiddo, so you claim to be an "elite", and you can drop all the names you want, but like I said, until you can prove that you're an "elite" ... you're really a nobody pretending to be something you're not, not even a farmer, do you understand ? ... resorting to put downs doesn't hide this fact yo ! ... cos those howling lunatics at IMH do the same thing too .....</p>
              <p>I am still waaaaaaaaaiting ! ...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              Hi All,
              
              This thread is supposed to criticize and comment on the recent promotion of Ishak Ismail. I see more &amp; more irrelavant messages get posted up which inflamed others.
              
              For other topics, a new thread should be start to be more focus.
              
              Moderators, you may wish to remove those unnecessary aggressiveness......
