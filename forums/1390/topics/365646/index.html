              <p>What is the big deal here? Its just a promotion!</p>
              <p>The media is playing the race issue here again.</p>
              <p>They titled it "SAF 1st Malay general"</p>
              <p><em>To hear Colonel Ishak Ismail, 46, tell it, his decision to become a regular officer in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) was greeted with some incredulity.<br><br>He recalled yesterday that someone asked him pointedly: “This is your name — you sure you want to sign on?”<br><br>He has replied in the affirmative many times in the last 28 years.<br><br>Yesterday, his time in the military was capped in historic fashion — he has become the first Malay general in the SAF.<br><br>His promotion marks a milestone in Malays’ efforts to be fully accepted in the military, a controversial issue ever since it was disclosed in 1987 that the SAF adopted a cautious approach in placing them in key positions.<br><br>Ishak was one of five who headed the SAF’s annual promotion list and attained the rank of Brigadier-General or Rear-Admiral (One Star).<br><br>The other four were: Colonel (Dr) Benjamin Seet and Colonel Lee Shiang Long from the Army; the Republic of Singapore Navy’s Colonel Tan Wee Beng; and Colonel Kwek Kok Kwong of the Republic of Singapore Air Force.<br><br>The five were among 464 from all three arms — both regulars and operationally-ready National Servicemen — presented with their certificates of promotion at a ceremony at Bukit Gombak Camp yesterday.<br><br>The promotions will take effect from July 1, which is SAF Day.<br><br>For Ishak, moving to the rank of Brigadier-General is reward for what he calls a consuming passion: Developing people to their potential.<br><br>Calling himself a “servant leader”, he said: “What gets me up in the morning and gives me the passion every day is the same reason I became a regular officer: Being able to influence people to something that they may not see themselves accomplishing.”<br><br>He has served in numerous appointments and is now the Commander of the 6th Singapore Division.<br><br>Last year, he received the Public Administration Medal (Silver) (Military) Medal.<br><br>He paid tribute to his wife, who put her career aspirations on hold to become a homemaker and mother to their two daughters, aged 15 and 17.<br><br>His “mission”, he said, is to spend quality time with his family: “I have never made the SAF an excuse for my family to be sidelined.<br><br>“They don’t have enough of me, so I think I should give as much as I can.”<br><br>The other officers promoted yesterday to one-star rank also spoke of the sense of purpose they get from defending the country.<br><br>Said the RSAF’s Kwek, who has served for more than 20 years: ‘Defending the country is a very honourable task, and is what keeps me going.’<br><br>Tan said that his most rewarding moments come from “working side by<br><br>side with people towards a common goal”.<br><br>Commenting on Col Ishak’s promotion yesterday, the Minister for the Environment &amp; Water Resources and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim said it was a proud moment for the Malay-Muslim community and for all Singaporeans.<br><br>He said it showed that hard work and playing by the rules would bring its rewards in a meritocratic society.<br><br>Asked if he hoped more Malays would follow in Ishak’s footsteps, he said it was hoped this would happen, although it would depend on their ability and their interest.<br><br>“No Malays should now feel like they can’t do it. If Col Ishak can do it, we can all do it,” he said. — ST<br></em></p>
              <p>To me, it's just a natural progression</p>

Seen any regular LTC go &amp; sitdown with NS men in range &amp; outfield.  The men I am refering is LCP &amp; Privates..not specialist &amp; officers.

              Not sure whether I am revealng too much here..Mag Ishak Ismail was CO 6 SIR, 7th Mono intake (my seniors).  Attend the ranger course but drop out..that's y he only manage to retain the Thai Airborne badge.
              
              Later LTC Ishak Ismail became Commander 12th SIB then he posted to Commander BMTC and get his COL.
              
              Very fatherly like, he never fail to speak to LCP &amp; private in our annual ICT...in small group informal discussion.  U can always see him tag along 12th SIB BRC mission..walking with the troopers or following our NS battalion on foot behind.  U can see him buying snacks &amp; drinks with men in the "mobile" canteen in SAFTI range &amp; live firing area.
              
              He never differentiate between men &amp; commanders.
              
              In war, we will die to protect him.

              <p>what's the diff between armchair general and paper general? in war, these clowns cower safely under the safety of their HQ........first to shout orders, first to flee with their tails between their legs, while we die first.</p>
              <p>if u say specialists or offficers, then i can respect them (some of them, not all).</p>
              <p>however, if you're talking about these top brass with multi-crabs and stars on their shoulders, who do nothing all day but to tag behind president and give / receive awards, then i seriously would respect that stray mongrel on my street than these guys.</p>
              <p>when war comes, the first thing is not to serve these generals, but to run first.</p>
              <p>if can't, then serve whoever will let you live, be it enemy or whatever.</p>

              <p>In time of War there will be a vertical adjustment those that make it will lead those who can't will drop out.</p>
              <p>But</p>
              <p>Recent years SAF have send out more officers and mens for oversea assignment, particularly in Afghan and Gulf these officers will gain experiences in both planning and deployment.  I think SAF will continue to participate overseas deployment.</p>
              <p>in years to come SAF top General would be better experience than the current badge. </p>
              <p>It bring about a more serious tone to those who choose to take up SAF as career. It will slowly filter out those who can't for whatever reason.</p>

              I think we have to be realistic here...which general does not give command from his HQ &amp; dun follow his men to battlefield?  Even US generals command the Gulf War &amp; Iraq War from the comfort of their HQ.  Likewise those garang generals from PLA, DPRK etc also command from the HQ.
                  
                  During the Gulf war, the real command of the battle is from the white house then to the pentagon &amp; lastly the forward command is at saudi arabia.  The rationale is that commanding from behind provide a wider perspective of the battlefield scenerio and better situational awareness.  Imagine, if a general get killed while fighting his troops, do u think the entire army will be demoralised?  How many lives will be lost then?

              <p>i think what i gather was that most of our forumners are saying our generals does not have battlefield experiences.</p>
              <p>command under stress and command under peace time can be quite different.</p>
