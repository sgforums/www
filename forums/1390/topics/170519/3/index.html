            <div class='col-md body'>I was in the NCC back in my secondary school days and am now in NS so I've had the opportunity to taste the "evolution" in quality of food in camps.<br><br>My first experience as a secondary school cadet tasting "camp food" was in 1998 and it was horrible. After being served undercooked fishballs and soggy vegetables, we had to literally force ourselves to eat. After that meal, we had to "present mess trays for inspection" and those with unfinished morsels were sent back to their tables to consume them. After that meal, I saw a couple of guys vomiting at the nearby washing point.<br><br>These days, not only is the food great in comparison but the service is not bad too. For those who actually bother to look up at the people serving you instead of just staring at your plates being filled, you'd see that the "aunties" and "uncles" are usually quite decent folks. Since enlistment, I've never had to put "lousy" in a survey and whenever I or any friends have had any problems with the food, a polite chat with an uncle or aunty has usually made more of a difference than some survey.<br><br>Well, this is just my opinion since I have heard from other friends that food quality is not always the same across the board.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know what... we should go back to the days of the British Army during the Napoleonic Wars. Each section or squad will "mess" together , I believe that's how the term "mess" came about.  A group of soldiers will be issued rations for one week, including fresh rations.  These are mainly uncooked , raw food. The soldiers were given time in the barracks to cook their own meals.<br><br>How the section does it is that they will nominate one person to be the cook and he will be excused from some duties to prepare food at each meal for his mates. If the section so wishes and thinks it is good to combine, they can approach another section to combine their food rations together for a big cook-out.<br><br>For the NCOs and officers, who get paid more...  they actually pooled some money together to employ servants to cook for them and had a room or tent or place reserved for their "mess".<br><br>How about this in the SAF ? ...and you learn about rationing and budgeting !</div>
