            <div class='col-md body'>Actually.. the survey thing is a gauge of the quality of food serve.<br><br>This is part of the contract between DSTA and NTUC/SFI.<br><br>Why there is a  survey is so that NTUC/SFI do not become complacent and serve sub-quality food to save cost. As you may have been told, the contract pays caterer $5+ per meal served.<br><br>If Lousy is rated more that 20%, as per contract, there will be liquidated damaged to the caterer and this affects the bonus the cookhouse auntie/uncles get.<br><br>I am not sure of the aunty/uncle remuneration package, but I believe much of it is dependant on food surveys, feedbacks and cookhouse maintanance.<br><br>BUT the SADDEST part of it is the end-user (soldiers) are being immature. They have this believe that if you put lousy often enough the food gets better. Actually, the food will stay the same, but DSTA will have a second look if the menu.<br><br>THe caterer is very limited to what they can serve as menu is mandated by DSTA.<br><br>Why sometimes your superior "force" you to put things other than lousy is because too many people put lousy despited acceptable food, so they see this more as a disciplinary issue rather than the food is really lousy.<br><br>Honestly, my entire NSF time, i believe i was served lousy food only 1 time.<br><br>....breakfast chee cheong fun<br><br></div>

Obviously there is some conspiracy in Alpha Coy.<br><br>So CO thinks it is disciplinary problem.<br><br>So CO says, if Alpha enters lousy and hits 50% while Bravo, Charlie, Support seldome exceed 1%, means OC cannot keep company in order...<br><br>so you get the picture now???</div>
