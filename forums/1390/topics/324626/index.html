              <p>My field camp will be coming very soon next week and I am pretty worried about it.</p>
              <p>What I worried most is my big problem that is insect phobia. I usually overeact and sometimes do things that I didn't even realise what I am doing when I see insects which appear to be overly creepy to me. Things like spiders, roaches, centipedes, cicada and others somewhat terrifies me badly.</p>
              <p>Apparently, the only small insects that I am ok with are those ants. And I mean small ants, not that queen ant that looks crazily huge.</p>
              <p>Recently, I asked my PC if I can bring my own insect repellent but was told that I could only bring the SAF insect repellent. I was told that I cannot bring any commercial items for the camp. This makes me feel worst because I don't know how is it going to be like.</p>
              <p>While I do feel quite embarassed sometimes to tell this problem of mine, I still let some of friends know simply because I want to know if they have the same problem. Unfortunately, I seem to be the only one who has such phobia. :(</p>
              <p>Any tips for a person like me during my 6 days field camp?<br>Thanks.</p>

              <p>But does it really repell away all the insects?</p>
              <p>The one I wanted to bring is a 100% DEET solution insect repellent which I did some research and learnt that it is quite useful to repel insects. And I bought that small little bottle at a stupidly expensive price. But at that time, I thought I could bring and I don't mind spending a little more money to ease my phobia to insects.</p>
              <p>And I heard many people still get bitten by centipedes and others. And shell scrape, I couldn't imagine sleeping inside because there are going to be a lot of insects inside there. There wouldn't be any kind of sulphur or pesticide spray before that. So I am really feeling terrible even though today is my last book out for this month before my field camp ends.</p>

              <p>Yea, that is what I am trying to tell myself too, to just get over it.</p>
              <p>But what I worry is because of my phobia(overeaction, etc), I might do something wrong(misfire, too concentrate on the insects and lost rifle magazine all these), hurt the people around me or hurt myself and causing myself being punished, confinement, or even worst, to get charged.</p>

              <p>1. kopi got it right - SAF insect repellent is very powerful. From what I know, it's even more concentrated than most commercial ones.</p>
              <p>2. If you want a real-life example, I've slept in countless bashas and shellscrapes over 2 1/2 years in the army and three years of ICT. I was in a chiong sua unit that went  for outfield like nobody's business.</p>
              <p>I never got bitten by any insects except mosquitoes..... and I really, really don't remember encountering cases of people being bit by centipedes. I'm a company medic, so I would know if anyone in my coy was ever bitten.</p>
              <p>3. How do you want to be a soldier if you're gonna be scared of a few puny insects?</p>

              <p>But does the insect repellent make the insects go away from you or at least avoid you when you have it applied?</p>
              <p>I don't mind tough trainings and tiring craps but insects are really something that bothers me big time. I understand you mean by it is just a few punny insects but I just have no idea why I am so terrified by it. Sometimes I even thought I have a mental problem with these things.</p>
              <p>Usually after the entire thing, when I recall back, I realise my usual reactions are like if I see any insects or suspect any of them are around, I will become extremely careful with every single of my steps in the vincinity. At times, I might not even to continue going on. There was once a beetle flew into my room and I didn't dare to go back to my room until my mum came in to remove it.</p>
              <p>Come to think about it, the only two insects that I dare to go closer to are only ants and butterflies. I feel so stupid sometimes to be afraid of such creatures which are so much smaller than humans. But I have no idea why I just freaked out badly when I see them. I really hope I don't do anything wrong when the phobia attacks and I begin to do things which I don't even realise until the end of it.</p>

              <p>And if telling them that I have such phobia, they are just going to laugh their ass off and continue to make me go for the field camp and see me putting up an awesome comedy for them to watch.</p>

              <p>If there's any comfort, on the first night of my field camp, I

              <p>I just recently get to see some pictures of how the basha tent looked like. At first, I thought was something like a barrack tent that is all covered and an opening at the front to go in. But later then I realise the one that we are going to do at field camp is a f**king hell one ground sheet on the grass and one ground sheet on top and there are openings all over the sides. I couldn't imagine if it rains, how many insects would just come into the basha tent to share the shelter with me. And because I may get freaked out, I am going to give my entire tent to the insects and I will be there standing outside like a total retard.</p>
              <p>By the way, the worst thing is my buddy is somebody who is very dirty and messy and totally indifferent about anything. In bunk his bed is often the one infested with rats, ants and roaches. This makes me even more worry during field camp because that cockster is going to attract lots of creepy crawlers and then sleep with them and tell me that it is only a small thing and don't even kill it.</p>

              <p>Well, me/buddy mistakes in the basha:</p>
              <p>1) My buddy peed at the tree next to our basha. Of course there was a stench.</p>
              <p>2) Not making the groundsheet above us tight enough. It rained and the wieght of the pool of water on top almost make it collapse.</p>
              <p>3) Eating inside the basha.....pretty soon we had uninvited guests, mammals and insects alike.</p>
              <p>But then sleeping in a basha.....is ok, compared to sleeping in a trench, heh heh.....no groundsheet, I used mine to protect the field pack from the rain and there were things crawling around. I placed my faith in my long 4 and boots, placed my head on the sand-bag and slept.</p>
              <p>But you give me a choice, I would choose a trench over the basha, the basha is simply cramped and stifling.</p>
