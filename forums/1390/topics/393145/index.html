              <p>tomorrow will be my last day in my camp. fri morning will be going to my hq (another camp) to collect my pink ic. have been looking towards my ord since the day of enlistment. however, present mood is tat of nostalgia. will miss some of my frens and some of my superiors who took good care of me during my stay there. wonder if anybody who is like me, has been hating ns for almost 2 whole yrs but actually felt a little bit of nostalgia when about to leave. lol.</p>
              <p>i know tat those in service now, particularly those who still has a long way to go is going to curse and swear at me for being siao on and will 'encourage' me to sign on. cos tat's wat i did throughout my 2 yrs in service whenever i see or hear anybody saying tat they miss ns life. but rest assured tat i agree with all of u all tat the army (dunno much abt other services so shall nt comment.) is functioning pretty inefficiently and there are too many wayangs going on. not to mention amt of saikang every nsfs has to do and the number of unreasonable superiors and punishments one will likely to get.</p>
              <p>having say tat, i must say tat i have a feeling tat i ord just at the right time. cos there will be a few 'mega' events from mar to sept. notably YOG and the yearly NDP. those in service better pray that dun kanna these events if nt be prepared to burn weekends, do saikang and lots of wayang. lol. </p>

              <p>hi all. will share with u all my feeling today. as i told u all, tomorrow i gonna take pink ic and today is my last day in my camp. initially everything seems normal with all the well wishes from ppl like.. hey, u ord tomorrow right? so good ar.. etc. din feel much. but at the end of the day when i was about to leave, all my frens started to shake hands with me and wished me goodluck etc. my superior thk me for my contribution and gave me a gift of appreciation. another superior of mine gave me a hug and bade farewell to me as well.. felt sad at that time and almost cried. but luckily nvr do so if not very malu ar.. haha. when i left the camp i took a last look at it and i got a complexed feeling.this is the bloody place which i have been hoping to leave since i gt posted here. however, i actually felt sad when it was time to bid farewell. so ironic ar. haha.</p>
              <p>having said all this, i must be thkful tat nth seriously bad had happened to me during my 2 yrs in ns. though sometimes i will feel angry and frusrated abt the shit tat i have to do, overall i must say tat this 2 yrs is a special period of my life. feel tat if nt for ns, most of us would not have thought of volunteering staying out in the field at night to feed mosquitoes, put some camou on ur face so u will not be seen. staying in camp during public holidays when all ur other frens are having fun. haha. but if u were to ask me if i would repeat the whole 2 yrs again, my answer will be a firm NO. hehe. some things are best left as memory la.</p>

              <p>Your superior specially got just for you a gift or is SAF issued one? If just for you and he specially got it, then you must have been a very good soldier. Don't worry, you will have your ICT to look forward to then you can relive the memories. LOL! Good luck and all the best.</p>
              <p>The world out there is much worse and more cutthroat than NS life, you know why? Cos while serving NS you're a conscript. You are drafted. Its not about anything beyond a commitment that you do not feel you owe. So you are just whiling it away and letting each day pass as it don't matter. You will only want to do it well if you have a strong sense of responsibility, other than that, there is nothing anchoring you to perform it with anything more than just letting it pass by like jail time. Hope the time has served you well and shaped your character for the stronger. </p>
