              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Minister for 
              Environment and Water Resources Vivian Balakrishnan said he hoped to see
               more Singaporeans pursue the hawking profession in the future.<br><br>Speaking
               on the sidelines of the opening of a child care centre on Saturday, Dr 
              Balakrishnan said with more centres opening in the near future, the next
               step will be to encourage people to view hawking more favourably. <br><br>"To
               make sure that there are enough Singaporeans who want to go into this 
              business ... I have to make sure that we send the message that there 
              will be places available, there will be reasonable rentals," he said.<br><br>With
               the announcement of 10 new hawker centres to be built over the next 10 
              years, and the removal of minimum bids for stalls in April, rental 
              prices of hawker stalls have dropped.<br><br>"All these factors mean 
              that rentals are going to fall, and I'm quite happy for that to happen, 
              because our key objective is to provide good and affordable food for 
              Singaporeans out in the heartlands," Dr Balakrishnan said.<br><br>"We're
               also looking at the proposal that there should be some form of training
               and opportunities to upgrade skills ... We will even look into 
              proposals like having some form of central purchasing in order to get 
              better prices through bulk purchases."<br><br>"There are many areas we 
              can work on to uplift our hawking profession, and I think in the years 
              ahead, I want to make it an attractive and honourable profession for 
              Singaporeans to move into, and especially for younger Singaporeans," he 
              added.<br><br>A social enterprise or cooperative to run the Bukit 
              Panjang hawker centre, the first of the 10 new hawker centres to be 
              built, will also be announced as early as June.<br><br>The move to allow
               not-for-profit organisations to run hawker centres is part of a series 
              of recommendations submitted by a consultation panel in March, following
               four months of deliberations and public consultation.<br><br>The 
              Environment and Water Resources Ministry is also looking at having a 
              single agency to manage the cleaning services for hawker centres, as 
              suggested by the consultation panel.<br><br>Dr Balakrishnan said the 
              objective of such a measure would elevate standards of hygiene, achieve 
              economies of scale and improve mechanisation and training in systems.<br><br>"We hope we can get both higher standards as well as cost-effectiveness," he explained. <br><br>"But
               having said that, I also want to caution that over the next few years, I
               do want to see the wages of cleaners go up, and I want to see them go 
              up significantly."<br><br>"It's only fair that all of us be prepared if 
              need be, to pay a little bit more to ensure that the wages of cleaners 
              go up significantly. That's another area I'm paying attention to," Dr 
              Balakrishnan said.</span></span></p>
