            <div class='col-md body'>Shams used by SAF:<br><br>1. SAF Hotline-Gives public the impression that welfare of NSF are well taken care of and they have a listening ear when they are in trouble. Truth is SAF Hotline is just a joke in which you call and they will ask you to go through the chain of command and probably give you some lame advise. That is all that they will do.<br><br>2. Chain of Command- SAF claims that this is to ensure that there is disclipine in a large organisation such as SAF. Truth is this chain of Command is used to prevent complains from getting out of hand, like complains going to the media and letting the whole world know.<br><br>3. Paracounsellors and Orientation Officers in your unit- SAF Claims that these people will help you when you are in trouble. Truth is these people are often good friends with the very superiors in your unit and they will tell them what you have told them. End up will be your superiors will takan you even more and than your life become even more miserable.<br><br>4. Off days- Gives public the impression that off days will be given if NSF do well and SAF recognise their good performance. Truth is off days are seldom given and even if given, the idiot superiors will somehow take it back, like if you come late to work by 5 minutes just once only( Mind you. Late for 5 minutes for 1 day only, is not late everyday), they will take away all your off days.Not to mention also, most people do not have the time to clear their off days and it is confiscated when they ord.<br><br>5. Leave- Gives the public the impression that NSF can clear leave before they ord so that they can enjoy or find a job during this period. Truth is very often, there is work to do and they are forced to clear their leave early(if they are lucky) or they are not allowed to clear leave so their leave is simply confiscated when they ord( Very unlucky).<br><br>6. SAF Financial Assistant- Gives the public the impression that they are all ready to provide financial support to poor NSF. Truth is 99% of applicants can't get it.<br><br>7. $50 allowance increase for all NSF from July 2007- Gives the public the impression that NSF who contribute to the security of Singapore are not forgotton and that when our country is prospering, NSF will get an allowance increase . Truth is our politicians are the 1 who is getting large salary increase and the $50 is once again what wayang king like what the Lee guy do.<br><br></div>
