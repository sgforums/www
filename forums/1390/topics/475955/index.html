              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong>By LEE JIAN XUAN</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;">A SOLDIER who deliberately urinated on an officer's bed has been disciplined by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).</p>
              <p>   The soldier, believed to be a full-time national serviceman holding the rank of Third Sergeant, was court-martialled.</p>
              <p>   His punishment was detention and demotion. the Singapore Army said in a post on its Facebook page yesterday.</p>
              <p>   It did not specify the period of detention.</p>
              <p>   Another soldier who filmed the act was punished as well, according to the post. No details of his punishment were given.</p>
              <p>   "The Singapore Army takes a serious view on the conduct and discipline of our soldiers. The soldiers... have both been identified and disciplined under military law," it said.</p>
              <p>   The incident first came to light two months ago, when a user uploaded a post of the soldier committing the act on citizen journalism website STOMP. The post has since drawn close to 68,000 views.</p>
              <p>   The Straits Times understands that the SAF launched investigations to identify the soldiers who were in the video after it was made public.</p>
              <p>   The soldier had apparently been celebrating his last day in camp by urinating on the bed of his officer, who had given him a hard time, said the Stomper.</p>
              <p>   Screengrabs of the video showed the silhouette of a male soldier urinating on a pillow, and posing for the camera after the act.</p>
              <p>   "You deserve more than this, but I was in a really good mood," it stated.</p>
              <p>   Most users on the Singapore Army Facebook page roundly condemned the soldier's actions.</p>
              <p>   One user called Lawrence Lim deemed the offence "totally unacceptable".</p>
              <p>   "No reason can justify such an act of disrespect," he said.</p>
              <p>   But others like operationally ready national serviceman (NS-man) Marvin Ong felt that the soldier must have lashed out at his officer for a reason. "Maybe the officer did treat him poorly," said the 25-year-old. "But he should have gone to the officer's superiors instead of behaving like this."</p>
              <p>   Six out of 10 NSmen whom The Straits Times spoke to also said that they felt the punishment meted out was appropriate.</p>
              <p>   "No soldier should be doing such things when he is in uniform. The fact that he went so far as to upload it makes it even worse," said 28-year-old NSman and logistics analyst Sherman Lim.</p>
