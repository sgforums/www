            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks guys.. also, how strict are they with regard to ops manning? For example I do a lot of business in Europe. My customers there don't understand this army stuff and probably won't accept the excuse if I have to miss a business trip or something. I know for ICT you have to apply for deferment in advance, but for manning can you just overseas notify? Are they going to ask you for documentation to say why you can't be here, or is it ok just to prove you are overseas? Is advance warning necessary e.g. you have to tell them more than 1 month before or something? Sometimes I just have to go off without much warning and stuff like that.</div>

In my time, there's no need to apply to "defer" manning at all, but I must separately inform my chief clerk (phone) AND the Mindef Notification Center (phone, SMS, email, mail) if I travel overseas during the mob period.  Even more so if you tio recall i/c, so as not to sabo your unit planning.<br><br>Yes, you'll be excused from mob activation if you have passport proof of being overseas at the time. But pre-notification itself won't be enough; ditto if you're still here for whatever reason &amp; didn't report. Chargeable offense.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, MINDEF has been using the ICA's EECUS ("Exit-Entry Control Upgraded System") to monitor travelling reservists for a while now. So much so, they did away with the need to physically surrender exit permits upon returning.<br><br>But, apparently, the system can only "capture the actual departure &amp; return dates of an individual when he returns from an overseas trip. This means that the individual's overseas trip duration cannot be ascertained at the point of departure. In addition, vital personal details such as overseas trip destination, expected trip duration &amp; contact number are also not captured by EECUS." Hence the need to pre-notify MINDEF directly on the details of your trip. <a href="http://app.mof.gov.sg/cutwaste/suggestionview.asp?id=18635" rel="nofollow">http://app.mof.gov.sg/cutwaste/suggestionview.asp?id=18635</a><br><br>I dunno how much the new biometric passport can help track movement via EECUS better, if at all.</div>

              <p>Hi FailureOfTheNation, u activated before CNY to go Maju camp?? lol....</p>
              <p>anyway, it depends on the unit commanders and guidance from HHQ. Normally is to take attendance and ensure that all servicemen on standby react and report on time when recalled. Another point is your FBO. Please get the sufficient items in your packs because you can be charged for not bringing the required items. Check with your unit on the items to bring. In NS.SG forum, there are also threads on mobilisation and ICT discussions. Maybe you will like to take a look at them?</p>
              <p>Another mob is called tech mob whereby there is deployment i.e. everyone reports, draw weapons and all logistics requirements and move out to set up conc area. This will take the whole of Sat (normally) till sunday morning. Hope that the recall does not include a tech mob.</p>
              <p>Some people for their whole life they never get mobilised but some people may get it a few times. So keep your fingers crossed ya???</p>
