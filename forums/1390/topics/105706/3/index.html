            <div class='col-md body'>I enlisted in Dec 83, so very lao jiao. I was issued a very old fashioned pair of boots with the separate toe cap. They were hard as wood. My 3 months as a recruit breaking them in were the worst times of my life. My feet started hurting about 2 month and continued to hurt terribly until after POP. By then the boots were quite seasoned.<br><br>I continued to wear this pair until sometime into my 4th ICT as a reservists.<br><br>During one ICT where we did amphibious assaults I found out my boots were still waterproof. But not in the way you want. They didn't stop water getting in, but they definitely stopped water flowing OUT! My feet were waterlogged for 3 days and nights and a lot of skin peeled off. And continued to peel for several months after.<br><br>Another ICT we walked through river and flooded fields at night and again the water wouldn't come out. What was bad was that even when later walking on dry ground the water inside my boots went "slosh slosh slosh" with every step I took. Fcuking annoying. I had no time to take out my boots and even whe I sat down and raised up my legs the water wouldn't flow out.<br><br>I had enough and decided to get a new pair. I considered all the options, even the commercial Goretex ones. But then I was afraid that being waterproof meant that water cannot flow out once they got in.<br><br>Finally, I settled on American-made canvas/leather jungle boots. They are very light, strong, with steel toe cap and metal plated sole. Most importantly, they had 2 breathing holes that helped water flow out after they got in.<br><br>They are the best option for our climate, I feel. No matter how waterproof your boots are, in tropics you always have to wade into river or swamp so water will still get in no matter goretex or not. So the jungleboot is still the best option as they have these breathing holes and they dry out very fast.<br><br>Only problem is the CSM kept giving me an earful for wearing non-SAF footwear. But since I'm a very disciplined and hardworking fellow he soon left me alone.<br></div>
