              <p>If you are not signing on, don't bother, odds are they will reject you and ask you to stay in SCDF.</p>

              <p>This goes to show that being in NCC doesn't mean you will definitely enter SAF, the same as why most NPCC cadets end up in SAF instead of police force.</p>
              <p>Just take this as a new learning experience, and enjoy it. Many people will be happy to trade places with you.</p>

              <p>SCDF is where they put people that they think are too dumb to
              hold a dangerous weapon, and hence they are handed hoses. This is a
              running joke among everyone in BMT.</p>
              <p>SAF engage in exercises in preparation for war. For that to be
              real, it is the day one/a few of those countries around us invade
              with their tanks storming across the causeway. You're basically
              using the peace we enjoy, which is the result of deterrence from a
              strong military force to argue against SAF, which is of course
              silly.</p>
              <p>It's still quite ok for an NSF to want to go SCDF cos for NSF
              its just serve and fuck off. For regular,..SCDF is the graveyard of
              the uniformed service...where they put all their dead ducks. No
              high value target has ever been sent to SCDF. SAF takes the bulk of
              the govt's high value targets, then is SPF. SCDF the govt doesn't
              care about, sometimes it even forgets it exists.</p>
              <p>For all the undeserved glamour and glory of SAF, no regular in
              the right mind ever thinks that a career in SCDF can even be
              compared with SAF and SPF.Its career you know? not play time or
              NSF..</p>
              <p>Anyway SAF being an armed force means it deals with other
              countries as its core principles, managing multi lateral ties at
              work, it's common sense. The armed force is built Singapore to
              protect against other countries, not itself. Basically it's a
              security force of Singapore against the world. The scope is
              international and influence beyond our shores. Thats why for the
              military there is the preceding element of foreign defence policy
              of Mindef, and also why our Foreign Affairs ministry is headed by a
              BG from SAF, and same reason SAF still lose to SPF in terms of
              career. SPF manages security and domestic affairs of citizens. Its
              scope and influence is domestic and limited to this country.</p>
              <p>But SPF is at least quite treasured by the government compared
              to SCDF. SCDF is a lost cause. It has no hope. To the government
              its where they put out fires in HDB flats and save trapped cats
              from trees. The least glam thing police got to do is catch
              litterbug. SCDF is so obviously and basically at the bottom of the
              food chain.</p>
              <p>This was the running joke circulated around. the order of
              uniformed service in Singapore. Boy Scouts, Girl Guides, SAF, SPF,
              SCDF</p>

              <p><br> U may continue to live in denial. Denial you may be in, Its weird
                                  though what you retorted, since I did not once say that putting out
                                  fires in HDB flats and saving cats from trees is not their job
                                  scope. On the contrary I gave them credit for that. All I said is
                                  preferring to be in a place that primarily hoses fires domestically
                                  as an NSF makes sense since it's slacker and less siong than army.
                                  As career, it's just plain stupid for anyone to believe that SCDF
                                  even stands a chance to hold a candle against SPF and a larger
                                  extent SAF. Just look at where the retired SCDF 'top officers' go.
                                  Nowhere. And both our PM and DPM are both from SAF on top of at
                                  least 4 other full ministers so its just plain stupid to think your
                                  hosing career in the SCDF is anything ppl in the SAF gives respect
                                  to. Then again, there seems to be many more ppl these days living
                                  in denial, if what we see online is a mirror of the reality of
                                  society. What amuses me though is the kind of justifications they
                                  come up with these days when coming to terms with their denials and
                                  inadequacies. Seems that you can't comprehend what international
                                  influence vs domestic influence lmeans. Maybe you flunked your GP
                                  in school...Just take a look at the number of SAF high fliers post
                                  SAF in government, and the smaller number but still in existent SPF
                                  high fliers post SPF in government and the ZERO number of SCDF
                                  people (no high flier) and how PSC does not give a rat's ass about
                                  SCDF and even a blind idiot cannot escape from the truth. If you
                                  are mildly educated, then you could be very young and still in
                                  school and not know what's happening in Singapore. SCDF for career?
                                  Hahaha!!</p>

              <p>Its perfectly fine if you question an organisation's policies or the the way they operate but to put doubt into what those life saving professionals do is a very huge insult.</p>
              <p>By saying that choosing a career with SCDF = to no future it shows how much smoke you have in your brains.</p>
              <p> I am not interested in you yapping about which of the 3 organisations is the condemned one because each of them have different objectives to achieve which is why they are seperate in the first place.</p>
              <p>But i am absolutely disgusted by your feelings towards the people who risk their lives everyday to save people. By doing so you are not only insulting the SCDF, but also the firefighting brotherhood worldwide.</p>
              <p>Give respect where you have to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>would you run up 13 stories with an oxygen tank? And when you reach the top, will you kick down the the door to put out the fire?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its not something any tom, dick or harry on the street will do or can do</p>
              <p>So learn to appreciate what those professionals do.</p>
              <p>Its such a pity that those people have to risk their lives to save an asshat like you.</p>

              <p>importance of each agency due to where the high value targets (HVT) are placed is one thing.. there's also the obvious thing staring which is the budget and size.. defence budget is the hugest shadowing every other ministry, just dedicated to SAF alone. SCDF is among the smallest thing quite at the bottom of the MHA food chain (not sure but is it on par with Prison Services or below). Bulk of MHA budget goes to SPF. A lot of the money to Mindef goes towards buying the leopard tanks, fighters F16, Apaches, choppers, ships and Bionix and other  Infantry Fighting Vehicles of SAF..and see how the government proudly parades them on NDP.</p>
              <p>it'd be a sight to see them parading police cars, hoses and hydrants on NDP. do they?</p>
