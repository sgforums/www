            <div class='col-md body'>There are significant gain for our military if we send in our troops and had a successful mission. i.e. the personel sent there will have good first hand experience. Also, SAF's international prestige will rise, as along with Singapore's prestige. Furthermore, Israel was SAF's teacher, by "Asian" moral value, we should go in and return them a favour.<br>However, Singapore's national policy stress more on economic development rather than military. This mission is a bit sensitive and if mishandled, which is very likely, then we can run into trouble with Muslim states, namely the ones to the north and south of us. Which may in turn cause diplomatic issues leading to possible unrest which is bad for business. The mission is also likely to cause casualty, which would make things ugly and difficult for the governent to answer to the parents of these NSmen.<br>Weighing the cost-benefits...... Don't think we should go.</div>
