              <p>That reminds me of my last year's IPPT.</p>
              <p>I've booked to attend IPPT @ khatib FCC together with my friend. Went there and was shocked to discover that my name isn't in khatib FCC's list but in Bedok FCC. After talking to the PTIs there, they said I can take my IPPT at khatib and they will send the results to Bedok.</p>
              <p>After a month, I received a charge letter stating that I failed to attend IPPT. After calling and calling (for a period of 1 month) they discovered that the clerk whom received the documents never key in my results hence causing the loophole zzzzzz.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And now I have another problem in which the DXO told me that I'm not due for ICT on Oct'08 yet I still receive the SAF100 asking me to attend..... this SAF lapse is hurting my income zomg &gt;&lt;</p>

              <p>See? That's the problem. And you thought when your data is keyed in, it's automatically update nationwide in the ns system. </p>
              <p>So the system then flags you out and you kena charged. </p>
              <p>It's so easy to charge/callup nsmen. Send letter to their house. But when the problem is with their system, what can we do right. </p>

              <p>That is why, all of you should get a downgrade if you cannot pass IPPT.</p>
              <p>I managed to get a downgrade to C9L3, so I need not do IPPT or RT for the full period.</p>
              <p>I log in to my NS portal often to check n confirm that I do not need to do IPPT. If I need, I just book it first. But before that, I will seek the advice of my specialist if I can take IPPT or not. If cannot, then I will lodge in the report to Unit, NS HQ, CMPB and such and arrange for medical board. This must be done quickly, as IPPT/RT is now a serious chargable offence.</p>
              <p>Trust me, I kena charged twice for IPPT. First one I admit, cos it totally got off my mind. Second one I fight, and won case. Save me $100.00.</p>

              <p>An update on my initial charge that was issued to me.</p>
              <p>After numerous calls to ns.sg and "confirmation" from my ns unit, i was informed that i need not attend the charge for failure to attend RT.</p>
              <p>However, 4-5 days before the actual charge date (which was supposed to be cancelled), i had a "feeling" that something was not right and i better call them to double confirm. True enough, when i called in to ns hotline, the lady said that the charge was still on! I said this was not possible and told her the whole story. after a check, she found out that my unit DID NOT inform cmpb/nssc(office in charge of charging). </p>
              <p>At this point in time, i wanted to scream at her. She put up an immediate request to my unit to check again and promised they will contact me the next day.</p>
              <p>The next day, no one called me.</p>
              <p>The following day was saturday and this time i was really pissed off. Called in and the person said he couldnt do anything as it was saturday and asked me to call back on monday morning 8.30. i told him the "cancelled charge" is on monday 11am. He said no choice.</p>
              <p>Finally on monday morning, with my uniform and boots ready "in case" i have to go down after all, i called in and after checking here and there, the officer confirmed that i no need to attend the charge. </p>
              <p>I asked if i will receive any official letter, she said no. I asked how will i know if this time you guys got it correct and i wont receive another surprise? She said the conversation is recorded and i can always bring this up.</p>
              <p>Moral of the story - it's not that i want to say ns is really cock up. But this scenario really prove to me that if you want anything done right, got to do it yourself.</p>
              <p>So let this be a warning for anyone who thinks they are excused from IPPT/RT. ALWAYS check!</p>
