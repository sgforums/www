              <p>Hi everyone, today i received a SAF 264 telling me that i have failed to take my IPPT/RT, and as a result, need to appear at CMPB to answer the charges. Instructions are to wear uniform and decent haircut and enough money in NETS.</p>
              <p>May i enquire (for those who have had this experience), what's going to happen?</p>
              <p>Also i don't understand why this is happening. I took my IPPT for last year but failed so had to do RT this year. However, i have valid SAF medical excuse endorsed by MO for the entire duration of my RT. </p>
              <p>I will definitely report for at cmpb but just wondering why with valid medical excuse still must kena charged?</p>
              <p>Thanks...</p>

              <p>Rednano - if you remember, i recently had ICT but had valid medical excuse. In the end, the unit cancelled my ICT. Had to fax them my MC in the end.</p>
              <p>Bear - took your advice and called the ns hotline to query. the guy on the other line said he will raise the issue with my unit and they will see if i need to answer the charge. It's hilarious but at the same time ridiculous when i told him my unit already recorded my status and excused me for ICT. His reply was "the unit in charge of IPPT/RT" won't know, you have to inform them also."</p>

              <p><br>yeah.. until they shake up the senior management of the place and replace all the freeloaders with high rank who tell the men "i want this this this and this" then go off for canteen break or worse, run off to play golf, SAF will remain a total fustercluck</p>
              <p>from what i heard, the people like my BMT OC are no more.. he trained us.. literally.. wore a red beret, showed us what the leopard crawl was like by crawling up the goddamned Botak Hill and led all the route marches..</p>
              <p>until we get people who inspire their men by doing, instead of using "mouth and eye power", the SAF will remain a fustercluck</p>

              <p>Well, they couldn't do anything. I had the documents, after
              all. Same goes for you.... toss the MC in their faces and
              holler at 'em.</p>

              <p>Whatever the case, when I finally reported to my unit for ICT, they correctly noted my status for the first two days as 'Medic Refresher Training at SMTI'. Finally.</p>

              What happens when you go there.. you have to answer your charge to a 2LT (most of the time) . Tell them you want to appeal. IGNORE what the 2LT tells you, say you want to appeal (that's provided your MC is really valid and you did all the right steps informing CMPB that you had valid excuses not to attend RT)
              
              My 34 year old LCP friend had to answer charges to a 19-21 year old NSF 2LT, when he wants to appeal, the 2LT just told him,
              
              "Just pay the $50 lah, don't get all of us into more trouble. i know you are not in the wrong, but you know procedures is procedures"

              <p>Well i'm not seeking exemption from IPPT. I took my IPPT for 2007 and failed. That's why i had to do RT for 2008. But an injury had my specialist recommend that i rest, hence the medical excuse for RT/ICT/IPPT. I informed my unit about my medical status. I can even view my excuse online at ns.sg. What i don't understand is why i have to inform multiple channels for my excuse. Do i have to call my unit, FCC, cmpb, mindef, or my MP to inform? t's ridiculous. We nsmen have day jobs don't have time to make so many calls to so many people. I'm assuming that if i inform my unit that is more than enough. </p>
              <p>This is a point that i will bring up during the charge (if i have to attend). </p>
              <p>If i can i will appeal, some may say just pay the $50 fine. It's not the money, it's the principle. Besides, if i just pay the $50 fine, that means i admit i was wrong and so it counts as my first offence. I did nothing wrong, why should i have an offence, right? :)</p>

              that's why i say... when you go CMPB to answer the charge, just ignore what they "advice" you.
              
              Most of them will "threaten" you. Say if you appeal then later court martial, they will say the penalty is harsher.
              
              But I am very sure you just lodge an appeal with valid evidence (maybe screen print of your excuse online), they will review and cancel your charge.
              
              Don't sign anything when the officer say just "acknowledge"
