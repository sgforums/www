Who do they think they are? Got 3 stripes or 1 bar so what? My friends and I made an agreement that once out in the corporate world, if we see them, we will give them hell. Lol. My OC was good though. Was a Senior Warrant but then is not commissioned so ended up my company always last to book out and we had to complain to the 2IC of BMTC. We book out at 5pm on Every Sat.<br><br>Luckily had good friends there, I guess going through hardship always create good friends.<br><br>Anyway, Glad I Ord. Since my reservist is 8-5 guess I don't mind going back but not so soon in my career though.<br>Personally, BMT is the worst place of my NS. Crap really.

But sure as hell I would give anything to be able to book out on a Friday night. It would be pure ecstasy. Alas, no such chance. Somehow I loved to wake up on a Saturday morning. Everyone in weekend mood already so everyone is very nice.<br><br>Anyway, I really don't see the point of Tekan. Especially when its done for the sake of it. After BMT, I was fortunate not to be Tekan'ed and we could work out everything nicely without resorting to such methods. It does nothing but just make us hate NS more and bear a Grudge. Grrr....</div></blockquote>If given a choice I would opt for early bookout and more siong rather than late bookout and less siong. Friday bookout makes a lot of difference! Imagine we could still meet up later in town or on Sat with the thought of book-in quite far from our minds. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I have to disagree with you though on tekan. I think tough training makes for good men and soldiers. Well as long as it is not done overboard. I have seen how men who went through relatively easy training became out of control, unmotivated and ill-disciplined when they turned operational. And believe me it it very difficult to get anything done during training or exercise. And this would mean late to return stores, late to go back bunk to rest and ultimately late to book out. It is very frustrating and painful to go reservist if your platoon mates are like these.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I am not a siow-on person. I am in a combat unit, so everyone needs to work together to get things done. If not ultimately, we are the ones to suffer. I am lucky that my current platoon mates are a good bunch to work with, making it a joy for me to go back for reservist. We subscribe to the belief that we slack and work at the appropriate time.<br><br>Anyways, I hope you have a much better time during reservist. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I have I think about four more cycles to go before hanging up my gortex boots. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

The top half of the boots is pretty flexible, not full leather like our old boots, and the soles are thicker. I would say it is definitely more comfortable. One thing you must credit SAF is that they are always trying to improve our personal equipment, although some improvements did not materalise as well as we hope to.</div>
