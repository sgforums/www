            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Theballstopshere:</div><div class="quote_body">Guys, dunno why but I feel extremely nostalgic now. Thus I thought of starting this post for all of us to reminiscence about our BMT days. There were bad but I am sure there were a lot of good too. So here goes: <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I did my BMT 10 years ago, in 1997, in Camp 1, Tekong Echo. I was in the mixed batch of guys, there were diploma holders, degree holders, and ah bengs. We lived in those old, narrow one storey houses. It was fun as you can see almost everyone and the interactivity was very good.<br><br>Wherever we go there was a dog that would follow us, we call him the Echo dog. He was a fine and obedient dog in the daytime but at night he would just stare and bark at nothing. Very weird and eerie. I wonder if he is still alive today.  I once saw a PC feed him KFC leftovers and I asked my dad to bring KFC for the visiting day.<br><br>Training was tough, and my company was reputed to be the most siong in Camp 1. Tekan sessions were a norm anytime of the day. But I think there were others who had it worse. Nonetheless, I did log PTs, duckwalks, countless pushups and situps. Those days, we still eat from metal eating trays and had cookhouse food from SAF cooks. Food was really bad, and I lost a lot of weight. We also had to do cookhouse fatigue.<br><br>A good thing was that during lunch hours, they will play Power 98 over the PA system and everyone could hear it, it was really good as it was the only thing that connects us to the mainland.<br><br>At the back of my bunk I could see Changi Airport. Oh how I long to go home whenever I caught sight of the airplanes touching down. Evenings was great as the sun sets and creates a field of golden corns on the sea.<br><br>It's a shame I lost contact with almost everyone in the platoon. I only have the contacts of one person but I have yet to get him out. Think I should do so real soon. The recounting gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling. It may have been 10 years ago but it still seems like only yesterday.<br><br>I remembered asking an older friend what he felt about BMT, he said that it was tough but he misses it a lot, and if given a choice, he does not mind doing it again. It felt pretty incredulous hearing him say that, but once you have done it and went through all the shit and good times and built a strong comaradarie with your platoon mates, you will think differently, well at least I did.<br><br>Short of saying that I will do BMT over again, I do miss my BMT days to a certain extent. </div></blockquote>I spent my past 2years in Tekong. I must say, the old Camp 1 is an interesting place. We permstaff would jog there simply to enjoy the magnificent views atop the cliff there, where we could see the reclaimed land, Changi, and beyond. It would be hard getting such great scenery anywhere in S'pore! The barracks look a far cry from the new chalet-like ones. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>There is a black dog which would follow us on route marches. Probably not the same dog, after all these years.<br><br>I wouldn't mind doing BMT (as a rec) again! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
