Except for the damn miles set and lim chu kang commando mosquitoes. 1st day, we reach conc area at 7+pm. Starts to dig our shellscrape. The soil is loose and i used a changkol. Slp... and do alert. 2nd day, move off to an airbase in the afternoon by tonner. Fieldpacks on the combat train. Left airbase for LCK at around 6+pm on chinook. My section was chosen to be the block force with ATGM. Slack... but the mosquitoes... My coils and my smoker buddy were useless against them( felt like popping a smoke grenade ). 3rd day, went back to link up with my company but was only able to find them after they did an attack. When we found them, they were doing another attack. As a reserve platoon, we did some combing up the knoll, then re-org = Zzzz. Move off for mandai at night for hasty defence. I didn't dig, just found one badly covered one. 4th day, did an attack but again i didn't engage any enemy. Afternoon RTU. I didn't fire any shots for the first time in many outfields. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
