Pasir Ris is also called Hendon?<br>I believe my answer to him to be very useful. Really. The camp takes care of everything, hell you can even turn up naked with not a cent on you and come out of there in a few weeks feeling you have achieved something just by the fact that you are still alive.

With your disregard for unit philosophy, it's not surprising that you were despised and seen as an outcast, to use your own words.  If you don't conduct yourself as a member of the unit, don't go expecting to be recognised as one.  I expect that few, if any, of the lads would go on a mission with you, but then again I don't expect you to understand the implications of that.</div>
