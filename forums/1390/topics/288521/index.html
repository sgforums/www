Otherwise, can safely act blur &amp; apply "normally" for EP. I'd rather do everything via my unit out of convenience, but that's a personal choice.<br><br>What I meant earlier was that you cannot disrupt reservist if only you're away working for less than one year. Can only defer, geddit now? (Getting approved for disruption means your unit will likely post you out -- back to the holding list -- &amp; drafting in a replacement to fill your spot on the nominal roll. Getting deferment means your unit will keep you on, but you'll probably have to do a makeup ICT if there's workyear time left, or run the risk of getting recycled on later when everyone's stood down.)<br><br><blockquote>What evidence are you referring to for them to confirm I am back in Singapore?</blockquote>Immigration Dept can confirm your passport arrivals/departures.</div>
