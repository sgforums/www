              <p>Hi, new to the forum here.</p>
              <p>I finished my NSF and am staying overseas as PR holding Sin citizen.</p>
              <p>I just do not understand why the Exit Permit for PR only granted 1 year at a time?</p>
              <p>I understand it is because regarding ORNS obligations. Not that I want to siam. Will serve if I stay and work in Sg but if I working overseas it is quite ridiculous to call you back right. Overseas employer have no obligation to Sg to grant you leave of absence. Furthermore I have served 2.5 years for the benefits enjoyed in my childhood. Now that I live overseas, means I do not enjoy the benefits of things like low tax/ HDB (subsidised) housing etc and only in Sg for less than 3 weeks a year cos I have to take leave to go back for hol and visit friends.</p>
              <p>Do they even call such cases back at all? Any experiences?</p>
              <p>If not why dun they jus give an indefinite EP to emigrants anyway they will know if we go back Sin for work right then they can schedule us for ICT since I read that they have link to ICA database now.</p>
              <p>I actually qualify for overseas citizenship but want to hold on to Sg because I was born and grew up there. But why Mindef want to make life so lei chay for emigrants. To tekan us for leaving Sin??</p>

              <p>As long as you hold on the Sg citizenship, u have to reapply for exit permit when it expires.</p>
              <p>Even though they may have the links, they will not be liasing and checking with each other all the time and only in cases where they need check on any suspicious behavior. They are not that free to track the movement of all NSmen each time they leave and return to the country.</p>
              <p>An exit permit does not takes hrs to apply so i don't see why it is so hard to have it done.</p>

              <p>If he does not plan to return, i don't think he can get a disruption since that would normally require a reason and a duration i think. Not too sure about that though cos my friends who work overseas still return to serve their reservist.</p>

              <p>Thanks for all your comments.</p>
              <p>With regards to the responses received here is my take:</p>
              <p>1. I agree that renewing EP every year is easy online. It is the hassle of having to remember it. Its like 1 yr later - Oh! Did my EP expire yesterday or last week. Stress<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/oh.png" alt="oh.png">!!</p>
              <p>2. Being employed overseas means employer do not recognise ICT as reason. If they do, I dun mind  (anyway from what I heard its quite lobo and being paid your full time pay! My friends in Sg say that they wish ICT everytime cos work is much more siong) ve of course). Considering that I have to take leave to return to Sg every year for my holiday. What do you think the boss will say if you told him - "Uh - I need to take 3 weeks leave for hol to visit fr/family. Oh by the way, I need another 3 weeks which should not count as leave because I need to do ICT. So umm can I take about 6 weeks to 2 mths off work every year??"</p>
              <p>Likely reply from superior - "What is ICT - I dunno. Can, you my as well take 12 months off cos we cannot use someone who is away for 2 mths every year!"</p>
              <p>I think I may try the overseas employment option but does that mean that I have to change my EP everytime my employer assigns me to another location (I travel quite frequently for work i.e.approx 15 times a year to various countries).</p>

              <p>Most of the overseas company will not consider ICT as a reason unless you are hired by the company here and request you to work overseas.</p>
              <p>As for ICT, lobo or not, depends on unit. But many see ICT as like a yearly gathering to meet friends etc.</p>

              <p>You sure you living and working overseas now ? or just checking things out ?</p>
              <p>yes you're right, overseas employers don't have the obligation to grant you leave for ICT, that's why FYI, when you are resident and working overseas, you DON'T get called up for ICT, the SAF is not cock enough to ask you to fly back when you have proof of overseas residence, that's why the EXIT PERMIT exists in the first place, so you WON'T be called up. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> </p>
              <p>next, with regards to the length of the exit permit, as long as you can furnish proof of length of required or anticipated stay, you'll get that length of time, I got four years straight away for studies and when that later changed to work, I got it for the entire length of my work visa, instantly renewal just by logging into the system.</p>
              <p>That one year length is to help you, cos ICTs goes by yearly cycles, the clock starts ticking not when you come back, but when your one year exit permit expires, i.e. if you come back, you're only liable for IPPT and ICT the FOLLOWING cycle year.EPs are required only for lengths of overseas stay of more than half a year, it's pretty pointless for you to be scheduled ICT then, wouldn't it ? There isn't anyone sitting behind a desk at MINDEF sipping kopi and monitoring the ICA's database .... "AAHA ! ... fortmax777, one year EP,  is back for a three week holiday ! .... woohoo ! .... shall whack him 1 x ICT while he's in country !" ..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Hi Fatum, Thanks for your reply</p>
              <p>I have been overseas for coming 8 years now.</p>
              <p>I started this thread because I do not understand why I need to keep renewing EP every year for the past 4 years since I graduated. Yes they granted me a 4 year exit permit for my studies before as well.</p>
              <p>How long have you been overseas and have you ever wondered why you need to renew every year for PR EP?? To what purpose.</p>
              <p>I understand your POV that one year length is because ICTs go by yearly cycle. But my suggestion is to have an indefinite EP which you do not have to keep renewing and will be automatically cancelled if you do come back Sg for good.</p>
              <p>Trust me, MINDEF is very effective in detecting people who are back. After my studies before getting a job I decided to take a 2 month break back home in Sg before going back to my "other home" to look for a job. Few weeks after I left they sent a mail to my Sg address saying that my EP is cancelled as I have been back for more than 30 days (proof of their efficiency) and advised me to apply for a new one. Lucky my relly checked my mails and informed me immediately. I immediately went online and apply EP again by the time I got my new EP I already left for abt 3 mths liao but lucky MINDEF never say anything.</p>
              <p>Ever since then I have been telling friends and family to keep reminding me to renew every year and if I go back Sg more than 30 days though unlikely nowadays.</p>
              <p>So it comes backj down to what I said before: "my suggestion is to have an indefinite EP which you do not have to keep renewing and will be automatically cancelled if you do come back Sg for good."</p>

              <p>I get your point, Fortmax.</p>
              <p>My response: Has Mindef ever been known to make things easy for servicemen? Whatever changes Mindef has ever instituted are only for it's own expediency. Do you think that Mindef even care for the servicemen??</p>
              <p>By the same extension, the MIW do not care for the people of Singapore. Isn't that the reason we choose to live in another country?</p>

              <p><br>I agree with you. Like I said in my original post. I think this EP thingy is to add some incovenience to the life of people who have chosen to live elsewhere. Maybe many renewals forget to renew once then they can fine you liaoz.</p>

              <p>Just apply for an exit permit under overseas employment. That gives you 3 years. I do not understand why you are doing it as a PR.</p>
              <p>No, you do not have to apply again everytime your employer makes you change lcoations. I presume your employer has a head office of some sort. If you use that address, then it saves a lot of hassle.</p>
              <p>I am on an overseas EP too, so I know what I am on about!</p>
