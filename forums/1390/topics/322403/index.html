              <p>In my personal opinion, I dun suggest you keng until Pes F cos your record will be shown when you apply for a job in the future esp gov-related one. You must really give it a tot before you try for a short term relief and may yield a long term repercussion.</p>
              <p>The only time I heard someone downgraded to Pes F, is when he kana an accident and was hurt real bad. Pls dun try this out.</p>

              <p>i dunno. imo i just feel that you're immature.</p>
              <p>lets not talk about the keng part first.</p>
              <p>marriage? 18?</p>
              <p>lets see.. most people at 18 are probaly still studying.</p>
              <p>you're thinking of marriage. ok.</p>
              <p>income? have a stable source of income? i think people like you should make full use of the chance to sign on in NS <strong>if possible</strong> because i think with your qualifications, SAF is probaly the highest paying job available. you're breaking your own ricebowl.</p>
              <p>you haven't experienced anything drastic besides NS haven't you? your girlfriend cried for you.. your girlfriend isn't the only one. why rush the marriage? is she pregnant?</p>
              <p>honestly all i can say is that, you're living life the hard way. you wanna burden yourself at such a young age i also cannot stop you. for once please use your head to think.</p>
              <p>anyway since you keng liao also no choice. i just hope you learn to stand up for yourself one day. don't say yourself maybe for your girlfriend. when the tough comes, you run away.</p>
              <p>you throw us men face.</p>

              <p>Let me just say a word of fairness. I don't blame anyone for keng-ing in SAF, since some of us have no love for that organisation in any case. People who pes A or B whole day say despise such people for keng-ing try not to be so righteous lah. If you managed to get through it, then good for you, but remember it doesn't make you more of a person in any sense compared to a pes E person. Despising them and openly criticising them in general only makes you a prick.</p>
              <p>However, for those who choose to keng, when you do so, spare a thought for your fellow colleagues. Like if because of your keng-ing you cause your fellow same rank and appointment colleague to suffer in terms of more work or cannot book out etc, then you are an asshole lah. You deserve to be at the receiving end of mean insults then.</p>
              <p>As for you TS, like many others have said, pes E already very low. What to do? We are born in the sunny island of Singapore and unless you have parents who are ministers, your life is quite good already.</p>

              <p>In my personal opinion, I dun suggest you keng until Pes F cos your record will be shown when you apply for a job in the future esp gov-related one. You must really give it a tot before you try for a short term relief and may yield a long term repercussion.</p>
              <p>The only time I heard someone downgraded to Pes F, is when he kana an accident and was hurt real bad. Pls dun try this out.</p>
