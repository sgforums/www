              <p>im so glad i completed my ns..</p>
              <p>anw, to TS, just go with the flow la.. no point fighting.. serve and fuck off.. why u go and care what they say what u cut urself and stuff..?</p>
              <p>also, im sure ur gf's father will not want to give his daughter's hand to someone who shirks a national liability.. if u even want to siam defending ur country, what kind of assurance can u give that u will defend his daughter?</p>
              <p>why are u so afraid of serving? are u not more afraid of this whole issue dragging for another 3 4 years down the road? all the re entry and withdraw.. and in the end, u served ur 2yrs for 4, 5 years, what's the point?</p>
              <p>grow a pair of balls, accept the fact that u are NOT as seriously ill as the ppl who are pes F, and thank god that u aren't pes F, because I have seen for myself ppl who r really supposed to be pes F, but like me, BMT pes C.. it's torturous just to see them do the most basic exercise until we whole platoon feel like helping him do because he really couldn't take it..</p>
              <p>anw, NS is not as bad as u tink it is.. who can 1st day go in and enjoy? it's all about adapting, accepting, learning.. can u do that? or are u going to shirk ur responsibilities? for now, i will believe that u are going to be a father of THREE.. are u going to adapt, accept and learn how to take care of THREE children? or are u going to push all to ur gf, or wife-to-be?</p>
              <p>accept the fact that NS is something we lan lan have to serve one, and then set ur mind to it.. and sit ur gf tell her u wanna serve and fuck off and come back to the family business and marry her..<strong> i do NOT believe she will say no..</strong></p>
              <p>u can whine, u can say everyone in the fucked up camp hates u.. u can say everyone discriminates against u, so what? do u dare to pick urself up against them? I have seen the armskote man throw away a guy's firing pin just before that guy's inspection coz he is a loser, and that guy sign like siao, i have seen blatant biaseness of superior against NSFs, but so what? they ORD, and lead normal lives.. can YOU do what others can? or are u going to escape? how long can u escape? forever?</p>
              <p>I have given my two cents.. the choice is yours..</p>

              <p>lets not talk about the keng part first.</p>
              <p>marriage? 18?</p>
              <p>lets see.. most people at 18 are probaly still studying.</p>
              <p>you're thinking of marriage. ok.</p>
              <p>income? have a stable source of income? i think people like you
              should make full use of the chance to sign on in NS <strong>if
              possible</strong> because i think with your qualifications, SAF is
              probaly the highest paying job available. you're breaking your own
              ricebowl.</p>
              <p>you haven't experienced anything drastic besides NS haven't you?
              your girlfriend cried for you.. your girlfriend isn't the only one.
              why rush the marriage? is she pregnant?</p>
              <p>honestly all i can say is that, you're living life the hard way.
              you wanna burden yourself at such a young age i also cannot stop
              you. for once please use your head to think.</p>
              <p>anyway since you keng liao also no choice. i just hope you learn
              to stand up for yourself one day. don't say yourself maybe for your
              girlfriend. when the tough comes, you run away.</p>
