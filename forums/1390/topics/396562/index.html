              <p>no. deferring is not that difficult. you just need to provide the proof of your worthiness (importance) or uselessness (medical). </p>
              <p>I think the units will send in instruction letter, when nearing the last week before you reporting. </p>
              <p>Oct is still so far away, who knows, one might injured yourself during a bike accident or dislocate his shoulder when playing tennis, or worse .... Just take it easy, man.</p>
              <p>My advice is "dont fear administration, ride with it." </p>

              <p>Deferring because of studies is much more easily granted than for other reasons.</p>
              <p>As soon as you get admission into the uni, immediately go to their admin office and ask for an official letter to request deferment.</p>
              <p>Then request MINDEF for a deferment, and forward this letter along with your request. </p>
