              <p>1a. I think you are confused. "After your NS??".  You can sign on at age 16, and opt of the study scheme, sort of the military school in Singapore. They will trained you for O level then ITE, then soldier.  If you are super smart, opt of SAF oversea/local scholarship after A level, they pay you for study in Uni and then you come back to serve. You can skip NS, as you are already a SAF personnel. There is also poly scheme...</p>
              <p>1b. You need to be medical/mentally fit to sign on.</p>
              <p>2. You can always opt to join the commando. It is up to them to see if they like your face and see if you can take the training and lucky enough not to get injured.</p>
              <p>3. Special Operation Task Forces? humm they just change their boss. Unknown if they are going the change their policy,  Previously SOTF recruitment is done through internally.  This is what they do.

              <p>2. What are some of the requirements to join the Commandos?
                                                      Also, i've heard that you cant be a commando if you're the only son

              <p>Everyone
                                              who has ever gone to JC knows this. I don't understand why you are the
                                              only one in the universe dreaming that no one else knows. NTU engin has
                                              the lowest cut-off point and the highest intake in all courses in local U, in fact it
                                              makes up 80-90% of the whole of NTU body. When people say they are desperate
                                              and don't know what to do, people will console them by saying its ok
                                              you can always end up in NTU.</p>
              <p>its true that nus law starts at
                                              $3.5k only, accountancy only $2k, all the business courses also $2K
                                              only. the low pay of other courses doesn't mean NTU engin is not a
                                              dumping ground course. for them is low pay but can find job. But NTU
                                              engin is <strong>cannot find job</strong>. u can refer to salary.sg employability
                                              figures, which are figures given by the universities to the media on
                                              the % of its jobless graduates.</p>
              <p>Is your "management trainee"
                                              friend is "fresh grad" ah? I know the pay of bank management trainee
                                              from local U. the pay is $2.2 - $2.3k only for honours. and that was
                                              during boom year (2007). Bluff chewren...now can find job must steal laughter already.. your $4K+ earning friends, is how old? I am talking about young grads. Even a moron can earn $4K at old age and I assure you I know many who do in their old age (30s, 40, 50s) including the morons from NTU engin. If you need to name someone from NTU engin whose eventual income (logically at a pretty mature age) is $4K just to make it sound 'good', i'm afraid it has the opposite effect. $4k for eventual ceiling pay oh my god..such a degree is worse than toilet paper. If I had an NTU engin degree I'd use it to wipe my ass after diarrhea.</p>
              <p>Your words are full of contradictions. If a person's success is not dependent on the school/course he went to, how come you can so certainly tell me the low pay of each of those friends of yours?</p>
              <p>The fact that you want to tell me this course earns how much and that course earns how much, is predicated on set beliefs and principles of income linked to background. If it was a chaos theory like you claimed, then you yourself won't have moral authority to tell me your observations of your friends, since it's all chaotic.</p>
