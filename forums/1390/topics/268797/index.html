            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>NO offense to regulars, but seriously how much of ur work experience is relevant and transferable, unless u r from technical vocations? </blockquote>You're thinking too linear-ly, too much in terms of vocational trade. Also a bit antiquated since MINDEF already has a number of recent schemes in place to help ex-regulars switch to a new job outside. I first noticed them after the economic recession &amp; SARS epidemic earlier this decade, then discovered the initiative has been around since 1998. To summarize briefly:-<br><br>1998 - MINDEF partnered with RMC (Right Management Consultants) to help its ex-officers. This is now coordinated by the Career Transition Branch, under SAFPSC.<br>2004 - RSAF signed MOU with AAIS (Association of Aerospace Industries).<br>2005 - RSN signed MOU with ASMI (Association of Singapore Maritime Industries).<br>2005 - SAF signed MOU with ASPRI (Association of Process Industry), to help its ex-technical WOSPECs.<br><br>So, from my observations: yes &amp; no. Those who "blindly" sought civilian employment on their own instead (for various reasons) found it tough, esp. for middle-management jobs. Hence, you'll see them becoming insurance or property agents, security executives, enterpreneurs, etc.<br><br>Ex-combat WOSPECs, as a whole, also visibly lack a safety net for now. They can't look forward to being disciplinary masters in primary schools forever ;-) but I can see either them or the Police ex-regulars staking the security industry one day, once better professionalism is in place &amp; a proper Association set up. I can see them fitting into the enviromental health industry too if ever the NEA seeks to promote (&amp; outsource) more civilian businesses to work alongside the agency.<br><br>BTW Ex-regulars are quite highly demanded for senior-management jobs, but more so with employers seeking appropriate organizational &amp; supervisory capabilities -- for example, in logistics, transportation, charities, education (curriculum planning), human resource, enviromental health, etc.<br><br>Back to topic: The Civil Service is not for me, but their wages bad, meh? Their total variable component payout last year was 2.7 months' pay plus a one-off $220 (2.15 months plus $200 in 2005), on top of their individual performance bonus (graded by their superior). With a entry-level Poly grad earning $1,500 monthly on the lowest Grade V scale, I work out him/her to have received a total bonus of at least $4,250 for the whole of 2006.</div>
