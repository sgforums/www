              <p><br>frankly i dont agree with cutting NS time anymore.. It will really really pull down our operationally standard.... It took me almost 15 months. then I consider I know what I am doing... anythg lesser, I feel is ridiculous...</p>
              <p>Some country are cutting their enlistment time, maybe they can do it is because</p>
              <p>1) they have a rather huge force of regular army, we dont have this</p>
              <p>2) their NS mainly is defense roll, sg is too small to actually have a defense roll force</p>
              <p>3) Their NS stay in for a long period of time, they only go back home once in a ard 2months.. our every weekend...This weekend going back disrupt training</p>
              <p>4) limited land use, so units take turn to train and need to schedule overseas training...</p>
              <p>so frankly anythg less then 18month of NS is simply ridiculous</p>

              <p>Their citizen, would buy a good cupboard or a store room to store their equipment and weapon and will frequently take it out to miantain.... frankly i really doubt a most singaporean will do that...</p>

              <p class="ni"><strong>2. STANDARD RATIONS</strong></p>
              <p class="mn">Contrary to the belief of some persons, the Japanese soldier does not live entirely on rice. To him, rice is a staple food, just as bread is to us; and, if he had only rice for his meal, he would be as displeased as we would be with only bread to eat. However, rice does constitute well over 50 percent of the Japanese soldier's diet.</p>
              <p class="mn">Both polished and unpolished rice has been captured from the enemy. Polished rice is more common, probably because it can be preserved longer than unpolished rice. To increase the palatability of rice, the Japanese usually season it with a soy-bean sauce (<em>shoyu</em>) or <em>miso</em> paste, which is made of fermented soy beans and which is more commonly used for preparing soup.</p>
              <p class="mn">U.S. rations weigh more and have a higher calorific value than the Japanese.</p>
              <p class="mn">Although the Japanese have standard rations, they supplement these whenever possible with various foods obtained locally—even when standard rations are easily available. There have been many instances during the warfare in Pacific theaters when the enemy has run extremely low on rations, due to loss of shipping and successful United Nations attacks against the Japanese land forces.</p>
              <p class="mn">As a general rule, the Japanese field ration in the South Pacific theaters of operations has not been standardized, but has varied from 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 pounds per man per day. Theoretically, the field ration is approximately 1.5 kilograms (3.3 lbs.). Two types of specially packed field rations, "A" and "B," have been noted frequently. The "A" ration normally consists of 30.7 ounces of rice, 5.3 ounces of meat or fish, and a small amount of seasoning and flavoring. The "B" ration normally consists of 24.4 ounces of hard biscuits in three paper bags (enough for three meals), 2.1 ounces of meat or fish, and a small amount of seasoning (salt and sugar).</p>
              <p class="mn">In New Guinea (June, 1943) a Japanese table of ration allowances listed three separate categories of issue:</p>
              <div class="qq">
              <p class="ni">Basic: 1.3 Kilograms (when transportation is adequate)<br>"A": 1.13 Kilograms (when transportation is difficult)<br>"B": .86 1/2 Kilogram (when transportation is very difficult)</p>
              </div>
              <p class="mn">Under the "A" ration, sweet potatoes, fresh vegetables, bananas, and papayas were to supplement deficiencies to the extent of .85 kilogram (524 calories), while under the "B" issue these local foods were to provide 1.8 kilograms (1,218 calories).</p>
              <p class="mn">It is known that the Japanese use vitamin pills quite frequently as a part of their rations. Vitamin B is supplied in three forms: (1) tablets, (2) as a liquid, and (3) a tube of paste.</p>
              <p class="mn">A "Polished Rice Combination Case" captured by U.S. forces on Bougainville Island contained 40 "portions" (mostly rice). The contents were packed loose in an air-tight tin case enclosed in a wooden crate. A single portion was calculated to include the following:</p>
              <div class="qq">
              <p class="ni">10 1/2 oz. of polished rice<br>1/2 oz. of dehydrated <em>Miso</em> paste<br>Vitamin B supplementary food<br>Vitamins A and D tablets<br>Powdered tea (to supply vitamin C)<br>A portion of fuel and matches.</p>
              </div>
              <p class="mn">Small extra amounts of all items were included so that the rations could be stretched or slightly increased. The fuel was in 3-ounce cans, one can being intended to cook two portions of rice.</p>
              <p class="mn">The daily ration per man for the Japanese garrison on Kolombangara from April to July, 1943, was approximately as follows:</p>
              <div class="qq">
              <p class="ni">Polished rice   .....   1 lb. 7 oz.<br>Canned goods   .....   2.8 oz.<br>Dehydrated food   .....   2.8 oz.<br>Sugar   .....   .7 oz.<br>Salt   .....   .35 oz.<br>Pickles   .....   .5 oz.<br>Soy-bean sauce   .....   .07 pint</p>
              </div>
              <p class="mn">The garrison commander on Kolombangara in May issued an order which read: "Burdock, chopped seaweed, white kidney beans, sweet potatoes, and dried gourd shavings will be issued as dehydrated food. Canned goods will be issued mainly from broken boxes in order to get rid of the goods in the broken boxes. Since the fixed quantity of powdered soy-bean sauce and sugar is not available, they will be distributed proportionately from goods on hand."</p>
              <p class="mn">Emergency air-crew rations found recently in a wrecked Japanese plane (New Guinea) included 20 ounces of unpolished rice and the following other items: puffed wheat, biscuits, a dried fish, two small bottles of concentrated wine (35 percent alcohol), some candy wrapped in colored cellophane, large salt tablets, and a portable water-purifying set. These items were divided among five transparent, water-proof bags.</p>
              <p class="mn">Probably the most common type of Japanese canned food found to date in the South Pacific is compressed fish (principally salmon and bonito), which may sometimes require soaking and salting to make it palatable. Other items of Japanese food found included: pickled plums, dehydrated vegetables (beans, peas, cabbage, horseradish, burdock, seaweed), compressed barley cakes, rice cakes, canned oranges and tangerines, sake (rice beer), powdered tea leaves, slices of ginger, salted plum cake, canned beef, cooked whale meat, confections, and vitamin tablets.</p>
              <p class="mn">On Makin Island, stored food found by U.S. troops consisted largely of rice, which was contained in heavy, woven rice-straw bags. It is interesting to note that after the bags were emptied they were filled with sand and used to protect underground shelters, defensive positions, and so forth. In addition to rice, our troops found considerable stores of canned fish (mostly salmon and sardines), meat, vegetables, fruit, and milk.</p>
              <p class="ni"><strong>3. SUPPLEMENTARY RATIONS</strong></p>
              <p class="mn">The Japanese use a variety of methods to obtain supplementary rations, or food to meet emergencies. These methods include gardening, fishing (sometimes by use of dynamite), dealing with natives, and foraging by individuals and small groups.</p>
              <p class="mn">The Japanese soldier has a fondness for sweets, which he usually gets in "comfort bags" sent from home. He also is issued sweets at certain times, along with a ration of <em>sake</em>. Such issues are usually made to coincide with a Japanese national festival or holiday.<sup>2</sup></p>

              <p>they used that kinda food to break the french army in indo china.......the destruction of british might for hundreds of years  back  in 1941 !from india,burma,malaya to singapore.the british had many soldiers but their defence in navy was backwards and so was their airpower technology in asia.</p>
              <p>even though their soldiers were 2 times taller than  d japanese,british lost because of the poor technology they had as compared to the jap zero fighters and ships.</p>

              3 months is more than enough, think about it, how many people would honestly want to fight fir this place after 2 years of wasted ns?
              
              During that 3 months I've already decided what I want to be to ns, a benefit or a liability. I decided to be a liability, masquerading as a benefit. Seriously, if you want your army to be world class THEN TREAT YOUR SOLDIERS FUCKING BETTER AND SHORTEN THE TIME.
              
              I bet my entire life that you'll have better an army than you ever had, because, remember that soldiers are people too. With dreams and desires,if you don't treat them like a civillian first, then they'll never want to defend a country full of civillians.
