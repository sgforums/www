            <div class='col-md body'>This FAQ very good, wish I had read it before I enlist, not like me, blur blur go tekong and kana...<br><br>I also contribute some:-<br>In tekong, each coy will have COS each day. Company Orderly Sergeant (COS). Basically means one of the 3SG kana duty for the day. So one tip to enlistee:- depening on how the 3SG is, some can be very grumpy when doing their COS duty , so try not to "disturb" them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

COS - Company Orderly Sergeant : the duty third (usually) sergeant for the company; he is usually NOT the duty sergeant for any of the platoons as he need to do things like cookhouse duty<br><br>2. BOS - Battalion Orderly Sergeant (cant rem wats the equivalent in BMTC. SOS? heh..): the duty platoon sergeant for the battalion / school; the one wearing the red band (wats that thing called?);<br><br>3. Tonner - 3 and 5 tonner vehicles are the most common. for troop lifting. 5 tonnes are replacing 3 tonnes now.<br><br>4. Landrover - the jeep like vehicle most commonly used as safety vehicle<br><br>5. Safety Vehicle - vehicle carrying the medic and other first aid equipment that covers training.<br><br>6. Front Scout / Rear Scout - the front / rear guy in route / fast marches. supposed to be 50 m infront/behind the main body. usually consists of a sergeant and a men (recruit). nice "appointment" to take during marches!<br><br>7. Figure 11, 13, 15 - full size / one third of full size / one fifth of full size targets used in ranges. think the connection between the numbers used and their sizes is obvious.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>8. Vehicle Commander - the person sitting next to the driver in any vehicle; usually the highest ranking personnel amongst the passengers.<br><br>9. 5 BX - 5 basic exercises : pushup, situp , heel raise, half squat and burpees; 5 BX + run means add one more run item. and theres always the warm up b4 this. i din do ANY 5 BX in BMTC. haha.. wonder if it will be diff now.<br><br>10. Attend A/B/C - a result of reporting sick; if u attend a after report sick, good luck to u.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> it basically means u r totally fine; attend b means light duties and practically means u r excused from most physical activities; attend c, means go home! other combinations include: normal duties, Excuse X : means u can do everything except for activities involving X. the most common are lower limb, upper limb, RMJ (running, marching, jumping), footwear (boots or even PT shoes), uniform (no. 4!)<br><br>11. Advanced party / store party - means u have to move out earlier than everybody else to the site of training to bring stores there and set up the place; also means u have to help to get ready all the necessary stores before the day of training; also means u have to help to unload and clean the stores after the training and when u go back to company line. sounds shitty? there are hidden perks too!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>12. Target party - means u are in charged to preparing and setting up targets for ranges<br><br>13. Dummy rounds - usually blue in colour; for training purposes only<br><br>14. Blank - can be fired but mostly emits the sound and abit of flash; CAUTION: firing blanks too close to another person can cause injury! the TSR stated safety distance is 10m.<br><br>15. Live Round - self explanatory<br><br>16. ROI - Return of Indent: commonly heard of ranges / training, when u have to go around and collect empty cartridges using your helmet  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> . these empty cartridges are known as ROI and have to be returned to the ammo dump (place where one collects ammo)<br><br>17. Ammo party - means u help ur sergeant go collect rounds for ranges and return ROI after that. usually equivalent to wake early sleep late.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>18. Check clear - check to make sure your weapon is cleared of ANY rounds;<br><br>19. Declare - a parade form declaration where all are to declare that they have checked themselves and are sure they are not carrying any rounds or ROI on them; done after ranges/ training.<br><br>20. OIL - off in lieu - off that they owe due to training or what not and are returning to you.<br><br>anything else?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
