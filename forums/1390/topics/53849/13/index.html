            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone, I'm new here. I just received a letter asking me to book my medical check up. At first, I was all apprehensive and anxious about going to NS, but this thread has done an excellent job at soothing my nerves.<br><br>Anyway, I have a chronic skin condition called Eczema or Dermatitis that is basically a life-recurring condition that is pretty much incurable. My face is very sensitive to sun (because of this disease), and my face itches like mad every couple of weeks (it's chronic) and my face is really red and proned to break out. I have to constantly be on medication (doxycycline) to control my break out.<br><br>I want to ask a few questions:<br><br>1) I've never been to the doc about my eczema condition (it's not curable anyway), so, if I were to go now and ask him to write for me a letter, would it be too late? I'm also allergic to grass (my skin is very sensitive), so, should I ask him to write that in the letter (so that I can show the medical officer on that day)?<br><br>2) Am I supposed to tell the medical officers during my check up that I am on doxycycline and I need to take this medication for a long time to curb my skin? I've been taking doxycycline for two years running now and if I were to stop taking this antibiotic, my skin will revert back to its harsh state. If I have to tell the medical officers of my long term medication on this drug, should I show them proof that I've been taking this product for two years already and need to constantly take this drug while in NS?<br><br>3) Can I continue taking my long term medication while I'm in my PTP and BMT?<br><br>4) There are side effects from taking my medication (lightheadedness, nausea). Should I tell this to the medical officer? I do suffer from the side effects at times, especially if I do strenous activities after taking the medication or if I take it on an empty stomach.<br><br>5) Based on all the above factors, do you think I will be posted in pes A or B? or C?<br><br></div>

They cannot force you to stop your medication.<br><br>4) Yes and based on your condition you might get to downgrade.<br><br>5) Only the MO will tell but I don't think that you will be combat fit i.e PES C.
