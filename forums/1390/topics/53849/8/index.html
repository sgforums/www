            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Common Adjustment Problems</strong><br><br>1. Regimentation<br><br>As soldiers, you are expected to follow the rules &amp; regulations set by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and obey the instructions &amp; orders given by your superiors. Thus some of your may feel a sudden lack of freedom to do what you want and you may find yourself having difficulties submitting to authority. Some of you may be disappointed with the way you are being treated as it may not be what you expect or experienced in your civilian life.<br><br>2. Physical Demands<br><br>It may be a little more taxing for those of you who are less-fit as you are required to go through physical training and attain an acceptable level of fitness during National Service. Some of you may feel anxious as a result of the fast pace and physical demands during training.<br><br>3. Communal Living<br><br>You will have the opportunities to train, work and live with people of different cultural, ethnic, educational and family backgrounds. This new environment may overwhelm some of you who will experience a lack of privacy. In your interactions with others, you may find some people difficult to get along with.<br><br>4. Home Sickness<br><br>Living away from home and being separated from your loved ones may create a sense of loss and loneliness in some of you. You may miss the time spent with your family, the home-cooked food and the comfort of your home. Some of you may feel miserable as you constantly make comparison between civilian and military life.<br><br>5. Financial Needs<br><br>Those of you who worked before enlistment will experience a sudden drop in income as you are no longer drawing salary but allowance. You may no longer be able to support your family financially, instead you may need some financial assistance during National Service.<br><br>6. Work Responsibilities<br><br>You will be given responsibilities that correspond with your respective vocations. It may be stressful to meet the job requirements as well as your superior's expectations. This may be more so for those of you who have no working experience prior to National Service.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>What Can You Do To Help Yourself?</strong><br><br>1. Adopt a positive perception<br><br>Perceive the organisational rules and regulations as means to train you to become a disciplined and effective soldier. Understand that some degree of restriction is inevitable and necessary.<br><br>2. Set realistic expectations<br><br>Expect yourself not to enjoy the same amount of freedom and personal time as before while you go through the training. Expect your superiors to treat you firmly but fairly. Some of you may need to humble yourself in order to be under authority.<br><br>3. Deal with imaginary fear<br><br>Stop yourself from worrying that something bad will happen to you or that you will charged by your superiors as these thoughts will make you lose confidence in yourself and affect your ability to cope.<br><br>4. Build up physical stamina<br><br>Engage in sports and outdoor activities so as to better equip yourself to cope with the physical demands in training. Beware not to push yourself beyond your own limits. This can be achieved by becoming aware of your own strengths and weaknesses.<br><br>5. Overcome psychological stress<br><br>Remember that it is normal to feel anxious and stressed upon enlistment into the army. You are encouraged to share your feelings with others and you will realise that your are not alone in having such feelings.<br><br>6. Adopt a non-judgemental attitude<br><br>In view of the diversity of each soldier's background, a non-judgemental and receptive attitude will be helpful to you in your interactions with others.<br><br>7. Adopt a team spirit<br><br>Do not isolate yourself from others but try to work as a team. Team work is essential as it will enable you to get things done more effectively and efficiently. Being willing and able to take on the role of a leader and/or a follower at the appropriate times are crucial in team work.<br><br>8. Learn to be independent<br><br>Avoid being too pampered and sheltered at home. Learn to take care of yourself instead of depending on your loved ones while you are at home.<br><br>9. Budget your expenditure<br><br>Budget your monthly expenditure so that you will not overspend. You may have to change your lifestyle and spending habits so as to spend within your means. If your family needs financial assistance or if you have financial difficulties, you may consider applying for the SAF financial grant or permission to work after office hours through your unit. Only requests with valid reasons will be granted.<br><br>10. Develop good working habits and attitude<br><br>Do not procrastinate but try to finish your work before the deadline. Clarify with your superior if the instructions given are unclear to you. Do not hesitate to find out your superior's expectations of you as this will enhance your working relationship. Prioritise the tasks given so that you can attend to the more important ones first.<br><br><strong>Who Can You Turn To For Help In The SAF?</strong><br><br>Unit superiors such as Platoon Commander, Officer Commanding, Orientation Officer, Manpower Officer and Commanding Officer.<br>Medial professional such as Unit Medical Officer and the SAF Psychiatrist.<br><strong><span style="color: red;">The SAF Counselling Hotline: 1800-278 0022 </span></strong><br><br><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/dmg/scc/pubs-preNSenlistees.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mindef.gov.sg/dmg/scc/pubs-preNSenlistees.html</a></div>
