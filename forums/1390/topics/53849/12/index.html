            <div class='col-md body'>Well, although I OOCed from PES BP, I managed to lose around 14 kg before I got posted out.Went in at 80kg, and got out at 66 Kg.Thats approx 1-2 kg per week.And I was one of the few who didn't lose much weight, guess it's cuz I have heavy bones.It can be done.During my time, around Dec2002-Mar2003, the training was quite progressive and not too draining on your body.It may or may not have changed, the latter is more likely.So, keep your chin up and you can do it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
