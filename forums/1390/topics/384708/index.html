              <p>Found out during my last ICT that I will be promoted to 3SG from Cpl. I've asked my Plt Sgt and he wasn't sure either as he had ORD'd as a 2SG and had completed SISPEC during his active days. I am a Comms Storeman, so I'm not sure what (if any) course I will have to go through, or if I will have to take more time off from work as a result of this promotion. Has anybody undergone a reservist promotion to specialist before?</p>

              <p>If i am not wrong, courses are only required if your 'job' has been changed together with your rank. Eg someone who is promoted to PS will get a rank promotion and might be required to attend the PS course. If not that i don't think there is any course required.</p>
              <p>Anyway storemen 3SGs are all passout from supply supp course from STC and does not go through SISPEC which is only for combat specs only.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Thanks. Good to know I won't need to go off from work again. I remembered my upper study had to go for the comms tech supervisor course just before his ORD but I heard that vocation has since become obsolete.

              <p> I remember b4 one of my high key reservist period end, the OC suggested promoting us for our performance...the promotion was from 3SG to 2SG</p>
              <p>at that time, we were all surprised and merely told him we will think about it</p>

              <p>Agree with this... any promotions during reservist is usually unwanted. The rapport and team work in my platoon now is pretty good (after my 4th high-key) and I don't really want it to change. Guess they only promoted some of the men because the older appointment holders are going to MR...</p>
              <p>Will be sorely missing some of the older guys when they clear their last high key next in camp... they really turned some of the sai kang into memorable experiences with their antics...</p>

              ............why bother bout rank.............it still means nuthin ina battlefield or in peace time.only the chiobu looks at higher ranks.so if u sitz on mrt train and then u see a sgt walk in...all the gals would look away or cant be bothered...but when u see a captain airforce pilot walk in with his flight wing medals on his chest...u see all the gals sit near him and smile smile at him.....
              
              its money and rank that goes together.....rank alone is like tea without sugar or meat without salt.
