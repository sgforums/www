            <div class='col-md body'>my coy first to book out but we got lion's trail and i seriously underestimated the weight of things<br><br>tried to be smart by loading all my admin/PT kits, 1 water bottle(compulsory) CV clothes, CV shoes etc<br><br>almost broke my back trying to carry it.<br><br>honestly, the night before, my section was in a total mess as we tried to sweep the place clean of dust etc. so that we wont tio late book out during area inspection.<br><br>though the fans were on, we were all perspiring and calling out for each other to speed things up and i believe nerves were frayed.<br><br>when i reached home, i found my room, com, keyboard, mouse, lcd so foreign.<br><br>feel as if i had to re learn typing and my mouse which used to fit my hand to a T now feels like a rock and my lcd screen made me feel as if my eyes were having problems.<br><br>anyway NS,<br>honestly i feel the things to bring to NS list is somewhat long and i wish to add more stuff to it like waht to expect, how to fix up SBO, field pack, helmet etc, because my first week was a super stressed one as we all scrambled to fix them in our limited admin time, unfamiliarity with those things.<br><br>anyway my sgt told us tht they cant really punish us during first 2 weeks until first book out, after which,,,,it's all hell break loose.<br><br>somehow i feel as if some of the sgts cant really....lead ?<br><br>eg, 1 sgt was reading a manual on attending to injured platoon mates just before the lesson itself and he was reading frm the manual as he thought..<br><br>really inspiring lesson....<br><br>for the SBO, 2 sgts gave 2 versions of how to tie some of the straps and we were terribly confused because of it.<br><br>tying the camo to the helmet was another source of stress for us because we tried for days before getting close to the standard required for the helmets.<br><br>then suddenly on the second week, we had more and more admin time but the sgts started to tekan us for stuffs and shouting at as anyhow.<br><br></div>
