              <p>A Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) full-time National Serviceman (NSF) was injured during a live-firing exercise on Sunday.</p>
              <p>21-year-old Specialist Cadet (SCT) Percy Toh Cheng Kai was firing a 
                  40mm Automatic Grenade Launcher when one round exploded prematurely in 
                  the weapon.</p>
              <p>He was handling the weapon at the SAFTI Live Firing Area as part of 
                  his Specialist Armour Course when a 40mm round's propellant exploded.</p>
              <p>SCT Toh sustained shrapnel injuries to his chest, right arm and right cheek.</p>
              <p>According to a statement from Mindef, he was attended to immediately 
                  by SAF medical personnel and then sent to National University Hospital 
                  (NUH) where he underwent treatment for his injuries.</p>
              <p>SCT Toh is currently in stable condition and is expected to be discharged from NUH within the next few days.</p>
              <p>Mindef says the SAF is conducting an investigation to determine the cause of the incident.</p>

              <p>There might have been not too sure but in my last unit there has not been any during my time served.In the navy,195 sqn, I was one of those strict SOB who will pluck my juniors,left right and centre, if I saw them not doing by the book or how I had trained them.Either weapons or seamanship. That maybe why had no case of injuries in my sqn during my time there</p>
              <p>Though I was strict. I did take care of my guys when they had problems. And what i had trained them on they did not forget even after their active service. Was with them during most of my reservist training and they did better than the active guys. They would also comment when I did not pluck at anyone during the time served. Takes one SOB to control all, so mistakes seldom occur, if did not serious enough for injury or death.</p>

              <p><strong>Deaths in 1990s:</strong></p>
              <p>In March 1997, the SAF halted training temporarily after three full-time
                                   National Servicemen died in two fatal incidents. Two NSFs were 
                                  killed when their FH-2000 155mm heavy artillery gun blew up in New 
                                  Zealand because of a defective Made in China fuze. One NSF was killed in
                                   Singapore after an unexploded warhead from a misfired Armbrust light 
                                  anti-tank weapon picked up by infantrymen blew up. Five others were 
                                  injured, including a Lieutenant who lost his arm.</p>
              <p><strong>Deaths pre-1990s:</strong></p>
              <p>The SAF's deadliest accident took place on Jan 24, 1987, when six lives 
                              were lost in a helicopter crash. Staff Sergeant Goh Kim Loong, Corporal 
                              Ramiya Mohan, Lieutenants Ng Soon Hup, Siow Poh Guan and Wee Tong Leong 
                              and Captain Lakbir Singh died after an air force UH-1H Huey crashed 14 
                              nautical miles south-east of Brunei International Airport.</p>
              <p>In April 1984, three SAF soldiers died over a span of 10 days. Recruit 
                              Sim Keat Kee, 19, collapsed after a 2km run. Lieutenant Koh Meah Wan, 
                              23, was killed during an exercise at Sungei Gedong. And Recruit Bak Yow 
                              Hock, 17, died at the School of Naval Training.</p>
              <p>Ffirst reported training death in October 1968. In that incident, 
                              Recruit Allen Tan Chong Huat, 19, was stung by hornets in the Chua Chu 
                              Kang forest. He was rushed to Taman Jurong Camp but there was no doctor 
                              on duty there ( military doctors then clocked an 8am to 5pm shift). What's more, the garrison's ambulance was out on another call. So 
                              Recruit Tan's officers rushed him to the main road to flag down a 
                              passing vehicle. It took an hour to get him to hospital.</p>
              <p>*RSAF accidents (in which pilots ejected): 1986 TA-4 off Tengah, 1986 Hunter Philippines, 1985 A-4 off Tengah, 1985 A-4 in Philippines</p>
              <p><strong>On non-reporting:</strong></p>
              <p>A look at MINDEF/SAF incident reports for the 2001 to 2010 period 
                                  reveals that the MINDEF website does not mention the deaths of 2LT Daryl
                                   Loh (man overboard) in February 2001, CPL Ricky Liu Junhong (2.4km run) in November 2007 and the 
                                  near miss in which a Commando was shot by a Thai farmer in 2010. (Mindef took 73 days to report)<br> <br> It also puzzles me why the loved ones of a full-time National Serviceman
                                   injured in the shotgun incident had to speak up before Singaporeans 
                                  learned that the incident involved more than one soldier.<br> <br> In addition, Singaporeans had to read a Forum Page letter to learn about
                                   the incident where Recruit Liam Kai Zheng fainted at the SAF Ferry 
                                  Terminal in Changi and died in hospital a day later. The letter was 
                                  written by REC Liam's father.</p>
              <p>Apart from old soldiers with long memories, many Singaporeans would 
                              probably not have heard of most of these incidents because death was a 
                              taboo subject for Mindef. Indeed, one would be hard-pressed to find open
                               analyses of past training deaths, especially in the early years of the 
                              SAF.</p>

The missed fire was happen at the end of the exercise where everyone was clearing their weapon. one of the personnel saw the round which was stuck in the barrel of the GPMG then he use the mallet to knock to clear the stuck round .  It so happen that the round just when off after it was being mallet and the poor fella was shot. The GPMG was mounted on the turret of the SM-1 tank and the decease was just standing directly in front of the GPMG.

              <p><br>Dunno about air force, but you are dead wrong about navy. Every step on board taken without care would ensure you get hurt somehow.</p>
              <p>Well.</p>
              <p>You have to serve on board to understand that better.</p>
              <p>The navy has only 4000 odd folks.....of course you would hear less things. Moreover not all injuries are reported.</p>
              <p>And most people there are regulars.....they are not regulars by name only obviously. So they're better at taking care of themselves, and can teach the minority NSFs better working alongside them. That still doesn't mean no accidents and certainly doesn't mean the environment is safe. Quite the contrary in fact.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>During my time, one of my army mates recieved 21 extras for misfiring the 40mm agl, fortunately it was aimed at the range butt, unfortunately there were big shots near the range butt area, even more unfortunate there were guests from brunei at that time, also at the butt area. He was fortunate to get away with 21 extras only because, they attributed the fault to the firing feed system of the agl, even to this day I go in camp for revision, they still talk about this problem of the agl, because to be frank, I think it was a problem that was never ever rectified.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> I like my HMGs.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p></div>
