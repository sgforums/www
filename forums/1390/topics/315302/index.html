              <p>i have a situation and i need help</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i was born in the US, stayed there for 4 years and i came back when my grandma died. this year i will be turning 21 year so i will have to choose my citizenship, whether i want to give up my singapore citizenship or take up US citizenship.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>also if youd like to know i just completed my polytechnic education</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i am to enlist before my 21st birthday though and thus i will not be able to take up my US citizenship before i enlist.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>therefore im wondering that if i were to leave singapore before my 21st birthday, will i get prosecuted even if i switch to US citizenship?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i appreciate any input in advance</p>

              need to furnish a bond, in the form of a Banker's Guarantee of

              <p><strong>Those who require exit permit of 2 years or longer will
              be required to furnish a bond. This bonding requirement is similar
              to the current arrangement where security in the form of Banker's
              Guarantee must be furnished. The amount of the security bond is
              S$75,000 or 50% of the combined gross annual income of both parents

              <p><span><strong>Why must MINDEF impose exit controls on NS-liable

              their NS responsibilities.<br> <br> <strong>Will young males aged 13 to 16.5 who fail to apply for an
              exit permit be sentenced to imprisonment?</strong><br> <br> The penalty for exit permit offences of young males aged 13 to 16.5
              will be a fine of up to $2,000, with no custodial sentences. They
              will however be subjected to harsher penalties should they continue
              to breach of the Enlistment Act after age 16.5.<br> <br> Males above 16.5 years who travel and remain overseas without
              applying for an exit permit would have committed an offence under
              the Enlistment Act. They will be liable upon conviction to a fine
              of up to $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years

              <p>I didn't say I serve willingly. I was probably more bitter than TS, but I still went and tried to make it worth my time. It's those keng till siao, waste the taxpayers' money people I despise.</p>

              <p>i believe you do have the liability to serve NS in view that you have lived there past your 11th birthday.  i tink their take is you have enjoyed the benefits of being a s'porean.</p>
              <p>the ball is not in your court.  you can verify with mindef/sg immigration.</p>
              <p>have you discuss this with your parents?  as a late teenager, you should not have to go through this by yourself.  you should seek adult or somebody with educated information about this.</p>
              <p>good luck!</p>

              <p>i have a situation and i need help</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i was born in the US, stayed there for 4 years and i came back when my grandma died. this year i will be turning 21 year so i will have to choose my citizenship, whether i want to give up my singapore citizenship or take up US citizenship.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>also if youd like to know i just completed my polytechnic education</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i am to enlist before my 21st birthday though and thus i will not be able to take up my US citizenship before i enlist.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>therefore im wondering that if i were to leave singapore before my 21st birthday, will i get prosecuted even if i switch to US citizenship?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i appreciate any input in advance</p>

              <p>what i was told by mindef was that after enlistment, and if i switch citizenship, i will still have to serve the full NS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but then, isnt it weird that I will be serving NS as US citizen?</p>

              <p>and oh no, im not saying NS is a waste of time, its a great time to meet people ^^ and a time for good/bad memories before you join the workforce.</p>
