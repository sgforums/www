              <p>The Singapore Ranger's course is something reserved for the <strong>"elite" </strong><span style="line-height: 1.231;">troops of the SAF.  CDOs will find that the Ranger course is <em style="font-weight: bold;">compulsory</em> </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">(whether you like it or not) and there will be the very "enthusiastic" regulars who will sign on to do it for the heck of it.</span></p>
              <p>This course was based on the American Rangers School course.  However, do not let this deceive you.</p>
              <p>In the US (based on what I know from living there), the <strong>Rangers</strong> are not considered to be particularly "elite".  In fact, their job for the entirety of WW2 was to simply <strong>capture airfields</strong> and provide forward <strong>reconnaisance.  </strong></p>
              <p>You might also find it interesting that the US Army doesn't carry as much weight as say, the US Marines.  </p>
              <p>So in general, you could say that Singapore's version might actually be harder, considering the military population that it is catered to.  Even though it was developed initially in the US, of course.</p>

              <p>bobjoe a bit of correction ranger course only for CDO regulars only not for their NSF its also open to regulars from other arm service,,</p>
              <p>the local ranger course is at lest 10 times harder to pass than the US course , SG course emphesize more on practical , for the US more on theory really felt sorry for SOF guys goin thru the course as the instructors really take '' extra care '' of them</p>
              <p>those with tab on their right shoulders pass out from US while the 1s with tab on left are SG</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>From hearsay, SG ranger course is much tougher than US ranger course. Guardsmen74 is correct, ranger course is not compulsory for CDO NSF. It is only compulsory for regulars.</p></div>

              <p>From what I've heard (Uncle served as a Commando Officer for 12 years and did both) the American version is indeed hardest.</p>
              <p>What happens is you do the Singapore Version of the Ranger Course, and if you perform well, you're eligible for the American one at Fort Benning. </p>
              <p>Makes no sense to me to send troops all the way to the 75th Ranger Regiment for an easier course.</p>

              <p>agreed with you. In the 90s i was involve with several exceicses with several foreign troops.</p>
              <p>I was shocked as I have this notion that they are better, and apparently that not all true..we fair rather well comparing to them.. So dont belittle saf.. We dont send NSF to war does not mean that we cannot fight. Maybe actual experience we dont have. and their combat ration was way better then us... That the early 90s</p>
