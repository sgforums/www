What is your medical status?<br>2. Which unit you go to? Infantry, Armor,Arty etc.<br>3. Where MO and senior medic post you?<br><br>You are in COMBAT medic course. You are trained for combat. I.E. you are expected to go to field!<br><br>Often as a rule of thumb in army, a fresh out medic need to orientate from platoon to company to battelion. AND even if you are a battelion level medic, you need to go field in FBO and BCS bags! and the weight is no less than a platton medic.<br><br>In infantry context, 1 platoon need 1 medic, 1 company 3 platoon + 1 medic 3SG. 1 battlelion 3 rifle company + 1 support + 1 HQ. So what is the chance of a battlelion medic????<br><br>From my experience, Never leave your posting to fate and prayer! Fate often deals a nasty hand to you!!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Look, some medics, probably the service medics, are indeed incredibly slack. It is hard not to feel distaste for people who, whilst you are running your arse out, ride around on bicycles humming in a oh so carefree manner. And then they tell you to run faster. AND, they are pretty helpless most of the time anyway.<br><br>That said, i think being a medic is great is terms of transferable skills. I do not know what civilian accredition SAF medics get (i suspect only CPR), but trust me, when you are in further studies and are looking for a part time job, your experience as a medic can only be a boon.<br><br></div>

After the dunking case, we all had to be accredited to use the AED (automated external defibrillator). You know, that device where you get to place paddles on the guy's chest and yell 'CLEAR!'.... Only the AED is slightly different in the sense that it's automated instead of being manually activated.<br><br>Well, what we learn is parallel to what the SCDF paramedics learn. The combat medic course is essentially two courses in one: a paramedic phase where you get to learn exactly the same things as SCDF Level I paramedics, and a combat phase where you learn lifesaving skills on the battlefield. At the end of the course you get two certs: one for Paramedic Level I, and another for Combat Medic.<br><br>If you do make it to the Spec II course, you'll be learning Paramedic Level II procedures, as well as more advanced Combat Medic training. Once again, you get another to certs to reflect this.<br><br>And yeah, I admit to using the certs to make my resume a little more impressive when I was applying for vacation jobs and scholarships. Nothing wrong with telling employers that I can do some first-aid, I hope.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

No. Each platoon has only one medic. There are a total of only four medics in the entire infantry Coy.<br><br>So for the entire company, there are only 4 x 2 = 8 IV packs.<br><br>So infusion is only for the most serious cases where a lot of blood has been lost. I don't like it either that there are enough IV packs for only 8 casualties in a company of 100++ people. However, there has to be a balance between the number of packs a medic can carry and the number of lives he can save.<br><br>Mind you, every extra IV pack he carries is an additional 1kg of weight. It doesn't sound like a lot, but out in the field, every single ounce of weight counts.<br><br>My MO tried to mitigate this by assigning one box of dressings and one box of IV packs to the store tonner of every rifle company. Even then, it's not always that the store tonner can come down to the Company Casualty Collection Point.<br><br>I'm not trying to be cavalier about this.... but that's the way it has to be.</div>

The medics now are trained to use defibrillators!!! we old sch are not taught and will not be going through them. Now everytime go on reservist, need an active medic to cover!<br><br>I think they do send the old birds back to school... provided that the unit is willing to release you (you volunteer for oversea posting???) and the unit stand down like 9 months to 1 yr... very very rare!<br><br>IMHO, if you are medically unfit for certain vocation, you should fight for your rights. There will not be any tears shed for you if you aggrevate your known injury due to unauthorised training and you suffer for life!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, the CMC instructors are mostly newbies who had just passed out from Spec II, though there are some old birds as well. Some of them are really good. I had 2SG Adrian and 2SG Jean as my commanders.... anyone remember them? Of all the commanders and instructors I've ever had, I respect 2SG Adrian the most.<br><br>Unfortunately, there are also those really-cannot-make-it-ones.... No comments there.<br><br>Most of the old birds teach the Spec II and the Paramedic Level III courses. Those who went for these two courses can surely still remember the legendary Staff Amin, Encik Khairuddin, and of course, the larger-than-life Encik Anuar.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
