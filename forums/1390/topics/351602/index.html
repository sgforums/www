              <p>Hi, after the water parade how long is the time lapse between working out and after downing like 500ml at one go ?<br><br><br>Also, my friend told me almost after a route march one of his platoon mate vomitted, may i know how can that be prevented? Is it over or de-hydration or didnt eat anything or ate too much or what</p>
              <p><br><br>And also im like 45 kg only standing at 170++ but im given pes B and the route march have to carry something like 30++ kg and march 24 km can i voice out ? I mean its kind of absurd to carry nearly your weight and go not just 2.4km but 24 km im kinda worried</p>

              <p>Normally after water parade there is about 15-30mins before a route march will start since they will take time arranging etc etc. For normal training however it would start 5-10mins after water parade if not immediately. Its more determined by how fast your platoon falls in and the officers/PTI are ready to start the training sessions.</p>
              <p>Vomitting is not uncommon, some because they drink too much water, some because of exhaustion etc etc, maybe the others can pin point some more specific causes since i do not know.</p>
              <p>There is no excuse for route march regardless of your weight. The fieldpack is not really 30+kg. SBO+fieldpack should be below 20kg and the rilfe another 3-4kg so total should be below 25kg unless theres any changes to the load.</p>
              <p>Most people manage to survive the route march so you should be fine as well. There will be progressive training for you so don't worry so much. Personally i remember after coming back from fieldcamp, most of us sort of feel that the normal route march fieldpack was very light since we didn't have the extra 2-3kg of ratios to carry and that weight is really significant.</p>

              <p>u will only do 24km route march just before POP. Throughout the bmt, there's increments from 1.8-2.4-3.6-5.8-8-10-12-18km... Unless you're a wussy then voice out, everyone's doing the same march. Furthermore, if u'r lucky... your fieldpack during the 24km might just be newspapers n tidbits, 1 waterbottle of redbull+water; other bottle of Gatorade... .. ;)</p>
              <p>Ppl who puke water out after exerting themselves most probably gulped down the water alot at a time. Nothing much to worry about.</p>
              <p>Ha! On the night u collect 11B, FULL WATER BOTTLE DRINK UP!! :P 1L... Fun.... lol... alot of merlions.. .xD But you'll get used to drinking lotsa water as you really need it...</p>

              <p>you 45KG ar??? wah kaozx... female meh... go and bulk up abit la..</p>
              <p>Route march for you i think would be damn xiong... imagine your 45kg frame with those tiny legs.. walk 24km... die!!!</p>
              <p>Anyway water parade.. ya every morning must drink 500ml... before route march drink, in between route march drink... come back finish drink.. before any strenous activities drink. No choice, it for replenishing. But too much water will lead to water drunkardness, it will also disrupt your body salt balance and thus some times too much water is bad for the body.</p>
              <p>But then if you cannot drink or you cannot route march the sergeants will think that you are "weak". i remember last time my route march (16km nia), got one section mate fall flat forward on his face, the sergeant they all also attended to him slowly... haiz.. so if you dont wanna be treated this way, bulk up and you will be fine. drink water too much, just vomit and fall out.</p>

              <p>oh ya. My time SBO two water bottles. Some guys filled it up with red bull. Vomitted straightaway during the first rest point. Our sadistic PCs make use carry dummy magazines, 2 coke cans (simulate 2hand grenades, which is in the basic contact rate) and a 1.5 litre bottle with sand. We even had to distribute out full set of digging toolsand sandbags.</p>

              <p>Personally I think the water parade is not needed. Soldiers should be given the freedom to drink any amount they like becos they know their body best.</p>
              <p>But I wouldnt say no to water parade esp when there are exercises like route march and ippt.</p>
              <p>Conducting water parade before lights-off are the most idiotic thing that can ever be done.</p>
              <p>So if you are a CO, OC, PC, Specialists, men or whatever... please sound out to your higher authority regarding these issues. These people, should listen, and relay the message to the relevant decision makers.</p>

              <p>FYI, there is calculation on how many litres of water must be consumed in a day. Factors such as hot weather, strenous training, soldier level of training are taken into consideration. Commanders are issued with the chart so that they can enforce it strictly. Comparing a recruit and a 6month soldier to a 1yr soldier the intake levels are different.</p>
              <p>One reason why water parade is done in parade form with comdrs checking is to ensure there will be no smart aleck who decide himself how much to drink and is not hydrated enough for the activity.</p>
              <p>Puking of water is normal fact if the person is newly enlisted and not acclimatised to the intake of water in SAF, once strenous training started, you will begging to drink more water. Especially during March to May period, Tekong is freaking hot.</p>
              <p>One of my platoon guys got heat exhaustion in Brunei, one minute we were walking up Biang, next minute, this guy was flat on his back, spouting unintelligible shit. Lucky got medic to drip him 2 bags full and heli him out. Any later he might have died or worse paralysed.</p>

              <p>When I entered BMT my weight is also around 45+kg at 170+cm, and I went through the 24km route march successfully.</p>
              <p>About the field pack getting lighter, I think it's true. The first time I carried my full field pack, I thought I'm going to sink into the concrete ground. I could hardly walk around, let alone believe I can survive a route march. But as the weeks go by, the field pack somehow feels lighter and lighter, to the extent one could even do pull-up with it on.</p>
              <p>So ya, there's no reason why light-weight personnel can't survive BMT.</p>
              <p>And I agree the water parade is a joke. Yes, adequate hydration is very very important, but to drink one litres at one go, isn't that outright torture? I never understand why they can't allow soldiers to lesser each time but have more water parade.</p>
              <p>Water parade is like...less than 2 minutes? Conduct more water parade (but drink lesser amount each time) can waste how much time?</p>

              <p>oh ya. My time SBO two water bottles. Some guys filled it up
              with red bull. Vomitted straightaway during the first rest point.
              Our sadistic PCs make use carry dummy magazines, 2 coke cans
              (simulate 2hand grenades, which is in the basic contact rate) and a
              1.5 litre bottle with sand. We even had to distribute out full set

              <p>Fire trench was a bitch, you have to dig it to the height of the tallest person in your section </p>
              <p>After you're done and proud of your hard work, they make you cover it up and sleep in ur shellscrape you've dug earlier <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>
