            <div class='col-md body'>Saw this over @ delphi forums.....<br><br>1st one: Old seletar camp(Near Jalan Kayu). Boarded up buildings were seen having lights inside when everything, windows, doors were all heavily boarded up leaving only small gaps where you can see lights(normal florescent lights, not torch light types). Thing was, the entire building block already has its power cut off and we even saw folks removing the lights and florescent tubes before the boarding of the buildings.<br><br>2nd one:<br><br>Did guard duty at camp near Hougang area, an S1 branch clerk committed suicide on the night i did guard duty and a friend had to go cover S3 Ops Rm (duty clerk) that night. He jumped from a high floor from a block nearby our camp. This was the seventh day of the Hungry Ghost Festival. He was sleeping alone in the 2nd floor S3 Ops Rm and came running to the Guard Room around 1am, thinking he wanted to go buy some food(our camp was near coffeeshop), i was about to ask him to help me ta pau when the look on his face stopped me.<br><br>He told us that the phones kept ringing non-stop throughout the night and no one spoke when it rang. There were also constant knocking on the door and when he opened, no one was there. Everyone had booked out of the camp except ill fated folks like us and no one was in the entire block and the whole building was dark and silent.<br><br>He was quite a brave fellow and still stayed there until he heard knocking on the sealed door opposite the main door. (This was an old camp still with wooden buildings, there was supposed to be a staircase from that door before the staircase was taken down and the building remodelled. So now immediately after the sealed door on the other side is EMPTY air) At first he thought that the knocks was on the door again and probably the prowlers were playing a trick on him until he realised that the knocks were actually coming from the "other" door.<br><br>He ran and we called the DO who was inside the office doing the dead clerks incident report and calling CO and the clerk's S1 and assigned me to keep checking on him every hour. So i had to check in on him every hour starting from 2am. First hour, nothing happened, second hour, things were good, third hour he was fast asleep when i got there.<br><br>I was thinking things should be ok then and reported to DO and DO thought maybe he was hallucinating or something so he decided i can go to sleep and let someone take over me.  It was a rough night. So the night passed relatively peacefully except for some neighbourhood dogs making a din for nothing.<br><br>Next day just as we were booking out(Saturday) he came over and thanked me and we even joked about it until he mentioned that he was grateful i was there until 7am. I told him i wasn't as i already went to sleep around 5am.<br><br>So according to him, he heard me coming back at around 6am and again at 7am as the 2nd floor floorboards were made of wood and he can hear me coming clearly. I was a bit surprised and thought the DO assigned someone else but confirmation with him later confirmed that he forgotten and didn't send anyone. Some wicked guys even suggested that it was the clerk who jumped down that night that came and visited him as they were from the same S1 branch.<br><br>He was on 2 days mc the following Monday.<br><span style="color: red;">Haha, this one must be the old simon rd camp</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, found this one.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Accoms block, School of Military Medicine at Ngee Soon Camp. I think it's Bunk 211. It was nearly 11pm. My buddy was chatting with his mom over the phone while i was trying to get some sleep. My buddy hung up the phone abruptly, woke me up and said," eh buddy, my bed is shaking.."<br><br>Knowing that my buddy is a pratical joker, i told him not to bug me but he insisted that i touch his bed. So i reached out to touch his mattress, it didnt shake.. My bed started to shake!! wah!!! We looked below our beds to see if there's anyone t rying to pull a prank on us. There was no body underneath.. Shit..<br><br>Anyway i was too tired and i told my buddy to go and sleep. I went to sleep as well. Now to think of it, its kinda creepy.<br><br>The bunk opposite me is worse. Some guy turned sleepless for a few weeks as he<br><br>1. Heard someone chant buddhist prayers in the bunk.. in the middle of the night.. when everyone else is asleep!<br><br>2. Felt a pair of strong hands pulling his feet!<br><br>3. Heard a weird conversation in chinese that goes. Have they slept? No, they're still awake.. Then how do we go out? Wahhh!! freaky siah!!<br><br>There is a bunk at the end of the fourth floor of the same block. Either some one will try to "unknowingly" strangle someone in their sleep or some one will "unknowingly" try to jump outta the window. Fierce..<br><br>back to the days of bmtc at alpha coy. there was one night where it was raining real heavily. Everyone in bunk saw a figure sitting on top of the table. Accentuate that with howling winds and flashes of light, etc.  No one dared to move, everyone was farking scared. It was only in the morning at 5am then we realised that one bunkmate had placed his uniform and sbo on a chair, on the table. Needless to say we nearly wacked him upside down.<br></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another interesting one. Those who did their BMT in Tekong pls confirm.....<br><br><span style="color: brown;">The year was 1993... I was posted to Pulau Tekong Delta Company for my BMT.  My bunk was situtated diagonally to the infamous Charlie 13 3rd door bunk.  Anyway my tale is not about the 3rd although it did send some chills down my spine in the night.  There were two toilets outside my bunk - a prewar one and a relatively new one.  The new one was locked perennially but once in a while we would climb over the wall (something that we had perfected after the introduction to SOC) because we were just impatient to wait for those in the old one to finish their business especially late at night after an excercise.  It was 6pm and we just returned to our bunk from one Sipei Siong Ex.  Four fellows including myself scaled wall and were in the toilet in no time.  My buddy and I were showering (no doors) while the other two washed their soiled uniforms at the basin.  Soon the three were all done and I was left alone.  Then came "Mickey Mouse", a name given to Recruit Chia for he looked like one.  It was known that he could see "The Thing".  He stood a couple of metres away and bellered in Teochew: "Mei Mei Zhao ah!" (Quick Run!).  "Zhao mei Kai? Wa Buay hoh li..." (Why run? I am not ready lah...) .  With that he climbed over the wall and disappeared.  I took my time to enjoy the cold shower water messaging my tiring body... Oblivious to what the F was going on...  Some time later I went back to my bed and spotted Mickey and two mates talking... When they saw me approaching, my two pals were visibky shaken.  Mickey pointed at me with an accusing finer and said: "Wah Kio li Zhao Ang Zhua ni mei Tia le... ...." (Why didnt you leave when I asked you to..?  The long-hair woman was floating in the air staring at you!  She seemed to be upset with you...).  I stood there speechless of course and never returned there again...

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Manager433:</div><div class="quote_body">Saw this over @ delphi forums.....<br><br>2nd one:<br><br>Did guard duty at camp near Hougang area, an S1 branch clerk committed suicide on the night i did guard duty and a friend had to go cover S3 Ops Rm (duty clerk) that night. He jumped from a high floor from a block nearby our camp. This was the seventh day of the Hungry Ghost Festival. He was sleeping alone in the 2nd floor S3 Ops Rm and came running to the Guard Room around 1am, thinking he wanted to go buy some food(our camp was near coffeeshop), i was about to ask him to help me ta pau when the look on his face stopped me.<br><br>He told us that the phones kept ringing non-stop throughout the night and no one spoke when it rang. There were also constant knocking on the door and when he opened, no one was there. Everyone had booked out of the camp except ill fated folks like us and no one was in the entire block and the whole building was dark and silent.<br><br>He was quite a brave fellow and still stayed there until he heard knocking on the sealed door opposite the main door. (This was an old camp still with wooden buildings, there was supposed to be a staircase from that door before the staircase was taken down and the building remodelled. So now immediately after the sealed door on the other side is EMPTY air) At first he thought that the knocks was on the door again and probably the prowlers were playing a trick on him until he realised that the knocks were actually coming from the "other" door.<br><br>He ran and we called the DO who was inside the office doing the dead clerks incident report and calling CO and the clerk's S1 and assigned me to keep checking on him every hour. So i had to check in on him every hour starting from 2am. First hour, nothing happened, second hour, things were good, third hour he was fast asleep when i got there.<br><br>I was thinking things should be ok then and reported to DO and DO thought maybe he was hallucinating or something so he decided i can go to sleep and let someone take over me.  It was a rough night. So the night passed relatively peacefully except for some neighbourhood dogs making a din for nothing.<br><br>Next day just as we were booking out(Saturday) he came over and thanked me and we even joked about it until he mentioned that he was grateful i was there until 7am. I told him i wasn't as i already went to sleep around 5am.<br><br>So according to him, he heard me coming back at around 6am and again at 7am as the 2nd floor floorboards were made of wood and he can hear me coming clearly. I was a bit surprised and thought the DO assigned someone else but confirmation with him later confirmed that he forgotten and didn't send anyone. Some wicked guys even suggested that it was the clerk who jumped down that night that came and visited him as they were from the same S1 branch.<br><br>He was on 2 days mc the following Monday.<br><span style="color: red;">Haha, this one must be the old simon rd camp</span></div></blockquote>I was formerly from 1 SAF TPT HQ Coy which used to be at Simon Road camp before it moved to Sembawang in 2002.<br><br>I'm in S4 branch and really, no kidding. That place is haunted. Ask any old jiaos from the Simon Road camp and they'll all tell you the same. Not because it's simply hear say but really, that place is unclean. I did COS duty also got hear things. Really, it's not a prank. The CO then make it fucking clear not to play ghost tricks on each other, especially those doing duty at nite. He warned that he will charge those who try to be funny.<br><br>We were all serious regarding this matter coz we knew sometimes when we suay, can see or hear certain things. At nite when got duty, the guards only patrol perimeter of camp n COSs stay in offices. No one tries to be funny but we still can hear things. The whole building is super run down and the floor is made of those old wooden planks which really creaked when pple walked over it.<br><br>The whole surroundings is just so creepy at nite. The toilets were dark dark which used seriously scary hanging tungsten lights which emitted more of orangey light. It's damn scary to shit at nite... I remember when i do duty, i just on light n do my stuff in main S4 office. Dun dare to switch off. It's scary honestly man. If can sleep, juz doze off. So far, i've not seen anyhting with my own eyes but heard about things n hear it directly myself.<br><br>Any old 1 SAF TPT old birds can attest to this man.<br><br>Cheers</div>
