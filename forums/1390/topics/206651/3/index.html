            <div class='col-md body'>Well, a conscript army will always reflect the characteristics of the society it's men derive from. What we have is a generation of soldeirs who have not experienced first hand the struggles and hardships that plagued this nation through it's early years. Thus, that identity which bares the impetus for national defence has evolved from one which requires us to defend our nation, to one which is to "serve 2 years and be done with it" (most of you know the real phrase). I'm certain many realize this need for a impetus that is far greater than the self, in other words, to rejuvinate within the young the understanding of the role of national defence and to willingly paretake of it,  at the expense of individualistic aspirations. This is no easy tasks given that it is individualism which drives our economic and societal (by definition) progress.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think its fair to stereotype and generalise.<br><br>I'm from the last batch to defer NS for overseas studies; I know three other guys here. All of us have been overseas so long (almost &gt;half our lives), that NS seems like a nice change of pace - to be able to go home.<br><br>Note the emphasis on going "home".<br><br>I've got 2 years to go before I have to serve my time, but my buddy here who is going to go back in 4 weeks has begun training since January - he actually flew back in June just to take the physical fitness test!<br><br>I agree with what some of the other forumers have said that the true nature of men will not surface until the time for it calls. Society has changed alot. Used to be men who cry = "gu niang". Now, its alright for men to cry.<br><br>People grumbling and fussing about trivialities is just a reflection of the movement of time - only forward, never backward.<br><br>Maybe you should ask the question, "how good a leader am I" or "how good a soldier am I" when you're complaining about other people complaining. Rather than just sit back, come to sgforums and vent, maybe you should take a positive and proactive step in motivating your peers and men.</div>
