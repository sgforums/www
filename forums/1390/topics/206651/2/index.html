            <div class='col-md body'>I think the increased in the unwillingness to endure hardship does reflect to a certain degree the softening of our new generation of youths. Yet it may also to a largeer extent, refelct the increase in education of the new generation. People who had more education know the means to voice out their unwillingness; the point here is that it may not necessary be that the new generation youths have more complains, but because the older generation do not know how to complain.<br>This is however, certainly not to say that it is a good thing. Complaints are contagious and reluntance in performing duties will certainly have an adverse effect on our military morale, fighting spirit and ethos.<br>I think the possible solution to this case would be to have more military and national education that aim to reduce the individualism among current generation and instill in Singaporeans more team spirit and increase our willingness to sacrifice.</div>
