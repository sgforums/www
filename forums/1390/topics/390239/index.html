              <p>It depends. This is often the case for certain vocations such as clerk, but the superior will usually look through what they have written before signing their name on it. Ultimately, it is still up to the officer to choose the "grading", whether the individual is poor,average, good, very good or outstanding.</p>

              <p>Certificate of Service. <br>Some employers want your certification that you have completed NS. <br><br><br>All servicemen will receive a one to two sentence testimonial (by default).<br>A half page to one page testimonial is an extra document for outstanding servicemen (by default).<br><br>However, some servicemen with "average to good, very good" gradings may also request for an unofficial testimonial from their superior, just like what they do for attachment in polytechnic.<br><br>Of course, if you want your superior to write, they usually request that you write truthfully what is about you and of course, they will read through, agree on it before signing it.</p>

              <p>Actually, I feel that it is acceptable for one to write their own testimonial. Who will know an individual soldier's achievements and contributions better than the soldier himself? Of course,  the superior must ensure that what was written is factually correct. As what TS said, some people words cannot be fully trusted.  I believe that the superiors will actually read through what has been written before putting their signatures on it.</p>
              <p>As for the use of COS, it is an official document so show that one has completed his national service. It consists of a transcript stating your rank, vocation and grades for performance and conduct. Of course, if your superiors are happy with your performance, they will write a testimonial for you. I knew of a few friends who plan to use their testimonials to help them in their university application. They hope that the testimonial can help them obtain a place in the course they desired by allowing the university to look beyond their academic performances. I am not sure of the effectiveness of such tactic though. Maybe somebody who has tried this before kindly enlightens us?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I have seen people getting POOR for both their conduct and performance. I have also seen people crying when they received a GOOD for their conduct and performance when the 'default' grade for 'normal performing' NSF is usually VERY GOOD. OUTSTANDING is usually reserved for those who has really performed well, though some cynical critics may say that these are the people who 'wayang' the most.</p>
