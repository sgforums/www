              <p>Hi there, i've ORDed and am currently serving my 3rd high key ICT. Diagnosed with moderate to severe sleep apnea+ allergic rhinitis in the army, but finished NSF life and 2 high key ICTs without incident. For the past few months however, i've been getting chest cramps/pains, along with excessive sweating and disorientation when that happens.</p>
              <p>Got an ECG scan at polyclinic in October 2011, after which i was refered to NUH A&amp;E on the same day, but no concrete proof of heart problems, hence was given an appointment at NUH heart centre in December 2011.</p>
              <p>Fast forward to now, went to MO during ICT to sound off about recent health problems, he referred to my sleep apnea medical report(ordinary, not specialist) which was compiled on Nov 19 2010., and was told i couldn't be downgraded as i have no concrete medical proof on my heart, only for allergic rhinitis and sleep apnea. I don't mind the fact that allergic rhinitis affects a lot of people and isn't grounds for concern, but the bugger had the cheek to say "your sleep test report was compiled last year, maybe you recovered by now?" Hello, i've been suffering from this since childhood...in the end was told to get a new medical report.</p>
              <p>I wasn't exactly looking for an instant downgrade on the spot, but felt the least he could do was note my concerns and get me a referral from SAF to follow up on this case at NUH. Sleep apnea= no proper rest. Allergic rhinitis = difficulty breathing+constant flus/colds. Combine that with chest tightness and pains and....well. Would you make a guy who cannot sleep well and can't breathe properly go for streneous exercise?</p>
              <p>Did get 3 months excuse IPPT/RT until Feb 2012, not sure if outfield is included.</p>
              <p>Ok long story short, i have the following questions.</p>
              <p>1) What exactly do i have to do at NUH? Request for a more detailed specialist report? Re-visit the ENT section and ask for a follow up/review of my current status? Go for another sleep test which will probably cost a ton?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Is severe allergy to dust mites reasonable grounds to be posted out to other units or jobs? My unit's bunks are those WW1 concrete style buildings (seriously, that thing's almost a century old) and WILL accumulate dust 1 hour after cleaning. Yes, i timed it. And mine isn't the "watery eyes+slight sniffle" allergic, it's "both nostrils get blocked+no sleep" kind of allergic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3)If the MO refuses to acknoledge my condition, are there any other avenues where i can approach to discuss my medical status?</p>
              <p>Don't mind staying in during ICT and it's fun to hang out with the "old birds", but the bunk conditions and health problems make me fall sick quickly. And as you all probably know, more than 2 days MC=ICT no count. Fun. About as fun as getting baked by the sun with a constant headache and cold. And this problem's caused me to default 3 RT periods. Imagine attending 7 sessions, then falling sick for 2 weeks then end up no count.</p>

              <p>You should not wait for the ICT to see the MO.<br><br>Instead, you should take the initiative to book a medical review at the camp medical centre as soon as you get all the latest specialist memos. <br>(as per point number 5 in the guideline.)</p>
              <p>It's a standard practice for doctors to evaluate that a doctor's note/ memo is valid for 1 year from date of issue because conditions can improve/ worsen after a few months/ years. That's why there are always follow-up reviews for any conditions.</p>

              <p>If I am you, I will do the sleep test for sleep apnea and seek out the proper surgery to collect the sleeping problem. After all, I am still young and I have many years of sleeping to do, and much proper sleep to have.</p>
              <p>I will also find out what I am allergy to by doing the skin prick test. I might be surpised what I am allergy to, may be cotton uniform (no. 4)? grass? pollen? soil? These will provide solid evidences for downgrading. Anti-histamine drugs have side effect and should not be take often, unless they are desperately needed.</p>
              <p>I seriously hack care about the ICT, I will just report sick as flu, and get MC regardless. At most they called me back again next round. See who has better patience? Actually, it might be really flu and cold, but not caused by allergy. When a person is exposed to a new environment, the local virus and bacteria, might cause the person to sick. Some places are cold in the morning and it will also cause the person to be sick.</p>
              <p>Remember downgrading is secondary; curing the problem is the priority.</p>

              <p>For your allergies it can be easily solved as MO can give u Loradatine or anti histamines. Used to have severe reactions like yours.</p>
              <p>Was a regular in Navy but left in 06. Used to have chronic ankle pain and kept spraining it thru sports so I went for a check with CGH (company sponsored) when i sprained my ankle while sittingon a SBS bus.</p>
              <p>Did an MRI and Untrasound and found I torn 2 ATFL ligaments and had a cracked ankle bone. Immediately sent the report to my unit where Iwas told to come down for a medical review with a MO. MO did a check and told me unless I have surgery done for these it is highly probable I will not be returned to ship duties eventhough I spent 5 yrs onboard.</p>
              <p>Later in the month unit called me and told me my Pes status had been downgrade from A to C9L9 therefore no more IPPT but still got ICT. Funny thing is that I returned for my first ICT and became OC for land unit!</p>
