Like I said, you'll know if you've been earmarked during OJT, and confirmation comes after you've done all the processes.<br><br>If you have serious concerns, raise them during your interview with your superior at that time. Fear ought not to be one of them - clarify your suspicions here or with seniors. Take things a day at a time.<br><br>Yes, you'll very unlikely be sent overseas if you don't get your wisdom teeth extracted. My guess is that they don't want to take chances with the standards or the accessibility of dental care wherever you're going.</div>
