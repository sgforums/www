            <div class='col-md body'>Honest answer, I'm not aware of any manufacturers of match-grade .5 ammo.  However, it doesn't make too much sense to use non-match-grade ammo in a sniper rifle, and keep in mind that shooters can easily load their own .5 rounds to match-grade standard.</div>

It's common knowledge amongst the precision rifle shooting community here that single-loading a cartridge through the ejection port of a semi-auto rifle eliminates the possibility of the cartridge being damaged when it is automatically fed from the magazine.<br><br>The projectile of a cartridge fed from a magazine strikes the feed ramp as it is being pushed out of the top of the magazine and into the chamber by the advancing bolt. This has the potential of damaging or distorting the projectile and thereby adversely affecting its accuracy. The loss in accuracy might be negligible, but might mean all the difference between winning and losing a marksmanship competition when the spreads between the best and worst shots are measured in fractions of an inch.<br><br>Single-loading through the ejection port also allows a longer cartridge that otherwise would not fit into the magazine, to be chambered and fired.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I understand from your experience and rationalisation why some snipers choose to load from the ejection port but that's not why we do that.<br><br>Nevermind.<br><br>Anyway, some points regarding this discussion thread.<br><br>1) Straight shot theory.<br>I suppose you mean flat trajectory. Well, due to many factors primarily to do with air resistance and a little bit to do with earth rotation, projectiles never shoot quite in a parabolic shape. In fact when I did a little calculation that day, I realised that shooting at higher latitudes will incurr quite a substantial error if rotation of the earth was not factored in, an increase in M.O.A. that is somewhat proportional to the increase in shooting distance if we do not factor in air resistance. All in all for a single shot to be accurate these days, either you have a mathematical chart of somesort with your spotter, or you have a PDA. Cos a whole lot of calculations go into 1 confirmed shot. As for a flat trajectory, STEYR does have a weapon system that shoots a dart with fins that have a flatter than normal trajectory compared to conventional projectiles. But it's huge.<br><br>2)Single load rifle.<br>Can someone recall the name of the movie Dolph Lundgren was in? Silent trigger? OK, go watch that. Self expanatory.<br><br>3)Doctorine against Snipers.<br>1: Another sniper.<br>2:Smoke grenades.<br>3:Artillery, mortar fire.<br>4:Animals. I can only imagine how I would hate this.<br>5:Assuming a male sniper, a naked female with average figure.<br><br>I had been trying to develope a method to escape from sniper fire which does not include any extra equipment, nor the naked female, which encompasses a series of movements that directly neutralizes the tactics used by snipers to take down a moving target from a known distance. Little is left to the imagination of why I have yet been successful. (hint: lack of human volunteer (sacrifice)).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>USing magazine fed does have one more advantage.. it lets you load different type of ammo or loadings on each mag! thus have a quick way of getting the different type of ammo like ( Armor Piercing, Boat tail hollow point ) to the sniper without fumbling with lose rounds.<br><br>Most modern bolt sniper rifle like the Accuracy INternational AWM , AW , SAko TRG series, etc have magazine fed.<br><br>AS for the Semi auto like the PSG-1!MSG90 I would say that is the only True Free float Semi auto SNiper rifle out there due to the unique Delay roller block system that doesnot need a piston or gas port like the M14 or M16 type gas operation.  However, getting a semi rifle to be consistant and accurate like a bolt gun is somtimes very difficult like the Springfield Armoury M1a Super match, PSG-1 ... However, Semi auto gives you quicker follow up shot than bolt guns!<br><br>Saying the MSG90 is better than the PSG-1! well! it is not the same ! MSG90 being 14.1 lb and the PSG-1 17.6 lb! the weight differnce prbably comes from the differnt barrel they use ! ALso! I notice the PSG-1 has a different way of holding the trigger group lower than the MSG-90!  MSG90 seems to be the clip and pin and the PSG uses the latch on type!<br><br>ONe more thing is in Bolt gun! we can neck size our cartridge thus have a fire form brass of the match ammo! thus! bolt gun can get much more consistant ammunition over a semi auto ! reason with semi auto is that we have to always full length resize the brass and thus the cartridge will not fit as good as a well fire form brass for the Bolt action sniper rifle.<br><br>DaveC</div>

Recon missions aside, the objective target is usually known, mode of transport and shelter very often observed. Fumbling with ammunition is usually not a problem.<br><br>I assume this is a reply to my statement that MSG90 is more cost efficient. Whether or not that is the case, I shall explain. The PSG1 is the predecessor to the MSG90, this information is widely available on the net. The PSG1 was designated sniper rifle for law enforcement agencies as with all H&amp;K firearms. The PSG1 is occassionally adopted by paramilitary groups with the extra cash to spare, but realising that spending over USD10K on a single piece of equipment with accuracy that far exceeds their expectation is not really an efficient way of spending public funds, the MSG90 was developed. It was much cheaper to deploy, and fulfills the needs of a police sniper rifle. Therefore more cost efficient. I didn't say cost effective.</div>
