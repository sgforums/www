            <div class='col-md body'>HI Crosshair<br><br>I agree with you that the MSG-90 is a more "cost effective" weapon to the PSG-1 ! must have mis-read your point ! HOwever, be aware that the PSG-1 has the A1 version which has all the nice kool features that the MSG-90A1 does not have! Again! shot both rifle and they do handle differently, .. maybe the PSG-1 stockset is a little more comfortable for me  Also the tripod that came with PSG-1 is a liitle more stable!! I own the MSG-90 system and it is a good solid system ! But if I am given a choice and money aside... I will take the $10k PSG-1! its a class of its own.!<br><br>Comming back to the cost effectiveness !I think the PSG-1 and MSG-90 is way overated!  I have my Armalite AR-10t that would shoot circles on my MSG-90! the AR10t with match ammo will do 3/4 MOA at 100 meter consistantly! And given to a good shooter I have seen it gone better than that!<br><br>DAveC!<br><br></div>

ANyway! come to the PSG-1 and MSG-90 we all know it started thru the G3 series of rifle ! infact a lot of parts in these rifle down to the basic delay roller block system is the same! PSG-1 merely have a slighly differnt bolt carrier design ( have somthing like our bolt assist on M16 to ease hand feeding into the chamber) , match trigger, PSG-1 stock ( which has a heavy buffer over the G3) MSG90 has the same heavy buffer but a sliglt differnt stocjk configuration, reinforcement on the receiver to prevent warpage on the receiver, a weld on scope mount , a differnt barrel and handguard! and the pistol grip! oh! i forgot.... PSG-1 , MSG90 and SR9 series and very early G3 have the Polygonal rifling barrel as compared to the button barrel!<br><br>AS for the ejection, When CETME and HK design the G3, becasue of the roller block system, the chamber in the PSG-1, MSG-90 etc is fluted! to ease the ejection..... thus, on the bolt unlock process the flutein the chamber allow back pressure gas to push the empty out ,and the spent is ejected out plus having the ejector on the bolt makes all G3 have very violent ejection! You got to realize when they design the G3, it is made as a close bolt Full auto rifle ! thus the positive ejection is even more crucial!  due to the heatbuiltup and speed of feeding and extraction a lot of designer would rather over design the extration process than having it just enough in Full Auto rifle!<br><br>I love the HK system of rifle except those new cheaply produced G36 and UMP series! Amazing design on the G3/Mp5 series of guns!<br><br>what U see in the picture is a HK SR-9T.. basically a accurizied G3 similar to the MSG90 but do not have the compensator, reinforce receiver and handguard.   ... which is a G3 with a MSG-90 stockset with match trigger and a Hensoldt 4x scope ...<br><br>sorry! do not have a good picture of my MSG! will post it later!<br><br>Cheers !!<br><br>DaveC<br><br><img src="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y66/davechng/Guns/DSC00163.jpg"></div>

YEs you are right! the MP5,G3 all does not use a Gas system like the AK, M16, FAL!.  They all run on rotating bolt! MP5 just is a minaturized version of the G3.<br><br>AS for the M16 over MSG90! ... we are comparing a 7.62x51mm cartridge over 5.56x45mm cartridge! 147 grain bullet over 55 grain! so! the M16 will gives a lighter recoil impulse!  and belief me! the g3, PSG-1 etc all kick like a son__^*&amp;(*(*().  even comparing an M16 to an AK47 or AKM... the 7.62x39mm has much larger recoil impulse than an M16 .... thus the M16 is so much more controllable in FA firing ! but comaring the 5.45x39mm on the AK74 ! it has less recoil impluse than a full size M16A2.<br><br>As for the M16 Stoner gas system ! it is a direct gas system , so, the bullet will leave the barrle, the gas will be blown thru the gas port into the gas tube which brings back to the bolt carrier which in turns, unlock the bolt carrier on the backward travel, extract the round, load in a new one!<br><br>Cheeers!<br><br>DaveC!</div>

Under optimum condition, the Bolt lockup will be lock until the round leave barrel!  MG may be able to confirm this for me! ..... as for the G3 ! it is the same thing..... the Bolt will be lock and seal! .till the bullet leaves the barrel, .. the delay blow back will delay the backward thrust till the bullet have left the barrel before opening up the chamber and extraction!<br><br>Har har ! very funny! 9mm larger caliber than the 5.56 or 7.62... oh well!<br><br>Well! the buffer spring plus the buffer is there to take out part of the recoil until the spring is fully compress or when the buffer reach its most rearward position! reason I said that , for my M4, I totally replace the rear buffer spring with a MGI hydraulic buffer which in terms have a stronger tension and thus reduce felt recoil and reduce my Rate of fire from about 900 RPM to 600 RPM in full auto fire on the M4.<br><br>Another good example is my freind has a G3... he lighten the recoil spring and smoothen part of the hammer /action and thus you get a glide feel of the G3 bolt carrier ! you can feel the carrier slamming on your face evertime you shoot the gun ! the recoil effect is just unbearable  !so! in that sense, the spring does make a differnce!<br><br>DaveC!</div>

The gas expands and pushes equally in all directions, but it hasn't been vented yet. When the projectile passes the gas port, some of the expanding gas is directed through the port and into the gas tube to push the bolt carrier back and begin unlocking the bolt. At this point, there is still no felt recoil as the expanding gas has not been vented out of the closed system yet. As the projectile exits the barrel, the expanding gas is vented out the muzzle and the bolt carrier, with the bolt now unlocked, is driven by gas pressure back against the recoil spring in the buffer tube. The recoil felt by the shooter is thus a combination of the expanding gas escaping at the muzzle and bolt carrier's rearward travel.<br><br>Does that answer your question? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
