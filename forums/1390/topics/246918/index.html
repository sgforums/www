            <div class='col-md body'>1) Yes, there is: the basic theory is if you don't f*ckin' shoot straight, you won't hit the f*ckin' target.<br><br>2) Snipers like a challenge, so even though the Steyr 69 has a magazine, they prefer not to use it.  In fact, they start with an empty chamber and load their rounds one only after they see their target, just to see if they can load the round, acquire the target and hit it before it disappears out of range.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Eg: PSG1 vs Model PM.</div></blockquote>I suppose you are referring to the Accuracy International PM right? Okay, the difference lies in the fact that one (PSG1) is semi-automatic, while the other he Accuracy International PM is bolt-action (one cock, one shot). Why are bolt action rifles preferred over semi-autos? cuz after a bolt-action is fired, there is no mechanical movement of the weapon's components, making it highly accurate, it also features a free-floating barrel for added accuracy to ensure even if the barrel expands after prolonged firing, it won't affect the accuracy of the weapon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>military snipers usually use single round loading rifles.. why? cos they can lie in wait for several days on end to wait for one sorry bastard to turn up in their field of sight.. then it's bang and go.. fast.. they don't stick around after the first shot is out cos they've already given away their position.. so snipers must maintain 200% concentration and focus for days.. another reason why they use single round rifles is because the weapon's weight would be different if they use magazines and somehow are tempted to fire off more shots, thereby affecting accuracy..<br><br>only sharpshooters use magazines for their rifles.. but they operate with other infantry units around..</div>

Snipers are more concern with judging distance, wind, terrain, barrel heat etc you need to compensate your aiming for these factors (by aiming higher/lower or adjusting your scope ... these are factors that are important than the weight of your magazine.<br><br>Most sniper rifles are either semi-auto or T-bolt action with magazine. Most snipers prefer T-bolt for the reasons spelled out in SpecOps87 posting.<br><br>Also, magazines are necessary for multiple targets or back up shots, you can't afford to load from the (topside) bolt ... sorry i can't remember the actual term.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>projectiles travel in a parabolic curve, going up and slightly to the left (or right, can't recall), of course depending on range. Different barrels will have slightly different characteristics.

It is that hard to adjust the angle to offset the wind over say 300ft (abt 100m) such that even top people like woods made mistake, imagine firing over 700m, with a a few seconds window...<br><br>Do u know some countries doctrine against snipers are arty bombardment?<br><br></div>
