Otherwise, you'll be walking barefooted to bath..  Powder is also useful..  SAF powder isn't very good.  Some people get rashes from using them.<br><br>Bring toiletries also..  The CQ store may not issue toilet paper when you first go in.  The set of toothbrush and toothpaste they issue isn't exactly suitable for usage.  Bring your own and use the given set for standby's.  Bring a shaver and nailclippers as well.<br><br>Some snacks will be good.  Cup noodles too.  Usually will have a spare bed and cupboard in the bunk so the section can have a stores/ food cupboard.<br><br>Extra HP batteries very impt.  Unless your sergeant is a good friend of yours and you can pass your battery to him to charge.  OTOH, you can also use the payphone.  You'll be issued with a phonecard on the first day.<br><br>Something optional but useful would be a duster.  Get those with plastic bristles rather than feathers.  Extremely useful for cleaning cupboard tops during standby area every morning.  Get a rag as well for cleaning other stuff.<br><br>PTP is basically damn slack..  Only 2 lessons a day and you just sit around and laze in between and after dinner.  No sleeping in bunk during office hours though.  So discmans, receivers and books are useful for killing time.<br>Good luck if you enlist into Viper or Taurus coy.  Hehehe</div>

Hehehe</div></blockquote>Regarding the no sleeping in the bunks rule, it really depends on which company you're in. I remember during my whole PTP-BMT experience, almost everyday had at least one to two hours of nap time. Sometimes immediately after breakfast, sometimes after lunch. Damn shiok!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>SAF powder is superb for drying up wet soggy boots during field camp though.<br><br>And regarding black tape, the saying goes: Black tape is the answer to all problems. You'll find out why soon enough. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Basically while there are standard school standing orders, how they are implemented on a company level depends very much on the kind of people your Officer Commanding and Company Sergeant Major are. If they are the super garang, follow the letter of the law type, then good luck. They will stress your instructors and your instructors will in turn have to be tougher on you. On the other hand, if they are the switch off kind, then your instructors will be less stressed by them and be more relaxed with you. Unless you happen to get one of those psycho garang instructors...<br><br>All in all, BMT was one of the most memorable experiences of my life! Glad I went through it!<br><br>My BMT experience was in Jaguar Coy (June 04 intake), btw. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
