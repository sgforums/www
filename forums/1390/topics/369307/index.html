              <p>A few months later he got injured during training and was downgraded to PES C.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The SAF terminated his contract and he have to compensate them. Worst still, he have to serve the 1 year as a NSF drawing a NSF allowance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You think this is fair?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Get injured during training is not his fault what. Is not like he wanted to purposely get injured. Even got downgrade to PES C, they should let him continue to be a Regular and post him to the service vocation mah since SAF got so many service vocation also mah.</p>

              <p>Sad to say. Reality is cruel.</p>
              <p>I can tell that your friend must be those cannot study type. Usually, for that group of people even he is already trained infantaryman. He would get kick out once he is downgraded.</p>
              <p>I dont think it is right for the SAF to ask for compensation. Instead, he should ask for compensation from the SAF. There is an insurance scheme. He can claimed injury and get a few thousands dollar back.Even NSF can claimed.</p>
              <p>The problem with these people is that they cannot fight with PEN. They dont know their rights. And usually being taken advantage of. Sad life.</p>
              <p>Service Vocation? CAN. If he is  skilled trained personnel, like repairing vechicles  ...</p>
              <p>Get some skills, their many skilled jobs which are quite highly paid. Even being a bus driver can earn more than SAF footman. My dad is earning like $2.4 K per month as a bus driver and it is a easy job compare to running around in FBO and not bathing for days. LOL.</p>
              <p>And if he really like SAF so much, can ask to transfer to regular as service vocation. Ask his officer to do his job.</p>

              Not sure if the whole picture is painted here....wat is the cause of injury?  How severe is his injury?  Any alternative career options given to him?  What is his performance &amp; potential in SAF?
              
              When I serve NS in late 90s, there were several downgrade cases but I never heard that contract will be terminated yet. I know of a regular commando got nearly crippled during an airborne jump, he was offered to downgrade to Guards Unit.  In the Guards Unit, he was injured again then downgrade the Infantry.  In Infantry, he was injured again then he downgrade to Air Force (FDS).

              <p>if you signed on the dotted line, the SAF won't terminate your
              contract, but redeploy you to something else .... to follow up on
              the sing fellow's example, there are fellows who got injured and
              downgraded to even log and tech side vocations .... that's why you
              sometimes see fat fuck and blatantly unfit regulars around in camp,
