            <div class='col-md body'>I'm scheduled for enlistment (opps, typed in deferment instead just now, sorry for the mistake) in January 08. However, I'm currently undergoing treatment for a surgery scheduled in December 07 (on my jaws if that matters). I'll need 1 month to recover and my doctor recommends that I avoid vigorous activities 3 months after the surgery. So, I think I'll be unfit for enlistment in Jan 08 (can't even chew on food during the first month after the surgery).<br><br>I've send an email to contact@ns.sg before this Monday (22 Oct) morning, but I haven't receive any reply. The Customer Service Specialist of NS eService Centre merely replied that he had forwarded my email to the relevant department, without informing me which department that is. I'm a little anxious because I don't know if I'd be successful in my application. (Not because I haven't get a reply, just in case anyone misunderstood. I know they'll need some time.) I need to confirm with my doctor that my enlistment is at least 3 months after my surgery before proceeding.<br><br>Now, I need to know the standard procedures for deferment application. Do I have to go to CMPB? If I do, where in CMPB do I go to apply? Also, I'm having my A Levels examination starting next week for 1 month, so I don't think I'll be very free to run down to CMPB often.<br><br>I also want to know if there are any others that you people know who have successfully deferred their enlistment due to medical treatment. BTW, my doctor have issued me a letter which I have shown to the MO during the medical examination, but they'd apparently ignored it. I've also attached the letter in my email.<br><br>Thanks in advance.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Boy, you've made some presumptions that I had to read your post a few times to get the proper meaning.<br><br>Firstly, it can't be true that you're "scheduled for deferment in January 08" when you're still in the midst of application.<br><br>Secondly, have you received your enlistment notice &amp;, if so, when's the date? What's this about "having my A Levels starting next week for 1 month"? Do you mean exams, or the course of study (why so short?)....<br><br>To answer ....<br><br>Yes, being temporarily medically unfit is one of the permissible reasons for NS deferment.<br><br>The NS portal has a "Enquiry of NS Registration and Deferment Status" section which I think allows you to check for any upgraded status (if your application is approved). Look under "Register for NS."<br><br>The proper address is Deferment Office, Central Manpower Base, Depot Road Camp Depot Road, Singapore 109676. Tel : (65) 373 3133/4/5/6<br></div>

I'm so sorry for the mistake, but I meant to type I'm scheduled for <strong>enlistment</strong> in Jan 08, not scheduled for deferment. So, yup, I've received my enlistment notice last week and I'm supposed to be enlisted on 12 Jan 08.<br><br>And as for the statement about my A Levels, 1 month is for the examinations. I'm currently in JC 2, so A Levels examinations are coming soon, just to clarify.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by blitzonic:</div><div class="quote_body">The proper address is Deferment Office, Central Manpower Base, Depot Road Camp Depot Road, Singapore 109676.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Where did you find those information? I can't seem to locate any of those in my enlistment notice or the NS portal. </blockquote>The address is taken off the Singapore Police Force website. I've just called one of the listed numbers (6373-3134) for you &amp;, yes, it reached the right department. Previously, I'd known about the Deferment Office from the former MINDEF website, pre-NS portal.<br><br><blockquote>When I clicked on "Enquiry of Ns Registration and Deferment Status" on the NS portal, I just get information of my medical examination (time, date, etc.) that is well past and the only link I can press is "Exit". </blockquote>Well, I suppose this means they're still processing/considering your application. Check back there from now on. If the eServices system lives up to its claims, then they'll update their deferment database soonest (i.e. once approved) as they do for the enlistment-date one.<br><br><blockquote>An additional question, approximately how long do I need in the application for deferment?</blockquote>Call them yourself &amp; ask. I won't be surprised if it takes as long as a week, assuming you've sent in all the proper documents.</div>
