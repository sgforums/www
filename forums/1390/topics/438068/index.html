               to enlistment, all pre-enlistees have to undergo a thorough medical 
              examination at the Medical Classification Centre (MCC) within the 
              Central Manpower Base (CMPB). This examination allows the medical 
              fitness of a pre-enlistee to be assessed and this subsequently 
              determines his Physical Employment Status (PES).<br><br><strong>Medical Screening Appointment Preparations</strong><br><br>As
               part of the e-documentation, you are also required to select your 
              preferred medical appointment date as well as to complete the medical 
              questionnaire (e7F).  You will need to go through the medical 
              questionnaire form with your parents / guardian so that useful medical 
              information about you is captured. <br><br>To ensure that your medical 
              experience with us is pleasant and that the overall screening process is
               not unnecessarily delayed, we have compiled a checklist for you:<br><br></span></p><ol>
