              Clerk is not a slack vocation. The mental stress is the same as any civil office jobs. The social pressure and environmental stress is much higher level than any civilian clerks due to military lifestyle. If you have social anxiety disorder or asperger syndrome, the environment may make it worst. This makes military clerk and civilian clerk very different.
              
              Storeman is about the same but with much less mental stress than clerks. The mental stress is replaced with abit of physical like carrying light boxes. Storeman also have to endure dust environment.

              <p>They will tell you formally what is your vocation (job), what
              unit....etc. what training you will go through....its not a uniform
              supermarket.</p>
