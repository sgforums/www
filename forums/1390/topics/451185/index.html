              Hello, I just went for medical checkup at MCC (Medical Classification Centre) last month.
              i get all A's for the checkup but i declared that i had Diabetes Type 2 so the MO(Medical Officer) gave me Pes D for 3months for further investigations.But the Blood Test results shows that i have higher Tryglycerides but everything else is fine.
              
              Do i really have to wait for 3months? or more??
              
              They said they will send me the Summary of Status (SMS) as in final Pes Status through mail. Will my posting result come with the SMS? One of my friend that is in NS he said that both of them will come. He was Pes D too.
              
              What will my Pes be? I do not get Hypo's during exercises even after 5hours.But i don't have any memo from doctor to declare that i won't get Hypo during exercises.
              
              Will i be able to upgrade my Pes Status for my case?
              
              Thanks alot.

              <p>NS camps doesn't allow outside food to be brought in. Though, I don't know whether it applies to all or some camps. Military exercises is different from regular exercises. I heard from friends that sometimes they must eat lunch finish within 2-3 minutes and rush to fall-in. No freedom to drink water too. Everyone drinks from water parade or meals, not during exercises. Let alone eat sweet mid-way. Think twice about upgrade higher pes status with diabetes.</p>

              <p><br>If pes D case, you get summary of final pes status letter first. Then, the posting letter comes in between afew weeks to 2-3 months later. Two separate letters.</p>
              <p>Yes, outside doctor can't decide which pes you'll get. Only MO can rank you appropriately. Outside doctor can only recommend to MO through memos about your do and don't on your condition.</p>
