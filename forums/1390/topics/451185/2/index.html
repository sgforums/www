              <p>Short answer: no.</p>
              <p>Long answer: not for you to decide, but since diabetes is a lifelong condition.... probably no.</p>
              <p>Smart answer: It's out of your hands, so why even bother thinking about it?</p>

              <p>Ok then, the other questions:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><strong>Do i really have to wait for 3months? or more??</strong></p>
              <p>I don't know. No one knows. Depends on how long it takes for the doctors to decide.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><strong>They said they will send me the Summary of Status (SMS) as in final Pes Status through mail. Will my posting result come with the <span>SMS</span>? One of my friend that is in NS he said that both of them will come. He was Pes D too.</strong></p>
              <p>Your friend has already answered your question.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><strong>What will my Pes be? I do not get Hypo’s during exercises even after 5hours.But i don’t have any memo from doctor to declare that i won’t get Hypo during exercises.</strong></p>
              <p>I don't know, no one knows. Leave this to the doctors to decide.</p>
              <p>And FYI, I have gotten hypoglycaemia a few times after spending several days straight on outfield mission, and I'm not even diabetic. At one point my MO had to run to a ninja van to get a Coke for me when I was starting to faint. 5 hours of PT is hardly a good indicator of your survivability in the jungle.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><strong>Will i be able to upgrade my Pes Status for my case?</strong></p>
              <p>Again, this is something only the doctors can decide.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok, that should just about sum it all up.</p>

              i know its somehow impossible but not 100% impossible. if there's a chance. just a glance of hope. i won't give up. When i'm young my dream is to be a part of uniformed services. (spf,cnb,scdf,army combat,medic.) but they all have requirements. So i won't give up so soon. i know its impossible for me to choose. But i just don't want to give up so easily its my dream since young. This is life perhaps? We won't ever get what we want. And others got what we want but they don't like that certain thing we want.

                  Starting i was only interested to be part of SPF/CNB. but after my doctor told me that i was diagnosed with diabetes. i started to put my target further and wider. so any other uniformed services even the lowest status types Cisco/Aetos im willing to accept. if really can't join any of so many of them. Accept Fate. im willing to die for my dreams. die happy and proud rather than die with regrets. Even just awhile inside the uniformed services. Few months. Few weeks before i die on duty. i rather die on duty than die at hospital bed.

              <p>Don't be disheartened if you get pes c-e combat support vocations due to your condition. They still save and improve lives. Combat-support have the same importance as combat-fit. They need each other to function as a military.</p>

              <p>In war situations, you can hear people said, "Die protecting your country!<em>".</em> It's a wrong mindset. You should think with a mentality of, "Live protecting your country!". If you die, who's going to protect your country?

              <p>This is why you must have the mentality to live on duty. Dying during duty won't make you save or protect people. Always find opportunity to live on duty. It's better for you to be in suitable environment/vocation for your condition that makes you live longer so you can save and protect more lives. :)</p>

              <p>You should still change your perspectives about non-combat vocations on the quoted sentence. It'll at least give you a positive mindset when you enlist later &amp; not see things hopelessly. Military clerks does save lives. While combat-fit vocations are the limbs, non-combat vocations are the brain. Do you think pes a/b vocations can function without military clerks/storemen? Think further and wider on how they work hand-in-hand to save and protect people. Then, you'll realise non-combat vocations save, improve lives and higher responsibility than you can imagine now.</p>
