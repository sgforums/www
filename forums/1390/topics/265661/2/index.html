            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>i noe now still got mortar, i am referring to active arty battalion (NSF)... i dunno of any active arty unit still operating mortar</blockquote>Oh, I see. Different wavelengths. You're right: no more mortarmen in the formation now, all gunners. I was from 21SA, back when they it was still SP mortar &amp; not SP howitzer like now. We'd trained to convert to towed arty before ORD, a fate which I figured my unit "descendents" might've also kena -- unless you're telling me the SAF has proper 'Primus' BNs for reservist now.<br><br>Armour still have SP mortar or not? In my time, some SAR units have such detachments &amp; I recall one or two of my coursemates being posted there after vocation training. Any of them reposted back to Arty for reservist would've likely found it hard, due to the lack of experience operating on a BN level. This readjustment was what I'd in mind too.</div>

Doubt any DIV command will want aging "inactive virgins" anymore, when they can expediently get by using those IOU cases doing make-up ICTs. But, that said, anything can happen.

Many forums fielded queries on the postings.<br><br>My broad understanding is that MINDEF, TRADOC &amp; all the combat divisions (3th, 6th, 9th, 21st, 25th) have their own reservist holding lists. Not sure about PDF; they might recruit liberally from the non-ops ready register (MINDEF or TRADOC).<br><br></div>
