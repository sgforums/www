Doubt any DIV command will want aging "inactive virgins" anymore, when they can expediently get by using those IOU cases doing make-up ICTs. But, that said, anything can happen.

You didn't mention your PES status the other time.<br><br><blockquote>What about those servicemen kena downgraded to PES C during active days? Will they be required to go reservist?</blockquote>Those C1 &amp; C2 are liable for the full reservist cycle. Once posted in, as I recall, they are excused from IPPT &amp; formal parades.  Any deployment limitations, as assigned by the L-Codes (L1, L2, L3), would've already been factored in when the CO worked out his nominal roll.</div>
