            <div class='col-md body'>Recently, i went to mount elizabeth hospital human behaviour clinic to find a psychologist and spoke to him about insomnia and depressing issues that i had all along. It was a free assessment, meaning its just a consultation with no fees given. However, i was told that i will be arranged for counselling there and also told to go to a polyclinic to get medication for my insomnia problem and also to be asked to be referred to a specialist.<br>The next day, i went to a polyclinic with my mum and i was diagnosed with insomnia and given medication and some vitamins. I was also referred to IMH Alexandra Behavioural Care Centre. An appointment was made.<br>What i am very very worried now is that i had already went for my first medical checkup at cmpb a few months back and given a PES A because at tt time i still had the inability to connect with people and i didn't know that it was that serious until my mum encouraged me to find some help.<br>What will happen to me now??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;&gt;i was having anxiety problems ever since young&lt;&lt;<br><br>I'm no expert, but otherwise has suspected as much: anxiety disorder. Which is different in degree from clinical depression per se. One is irrational fear (however persistent); the other is intense melancholia (sometimes manifested in suicidal thoughts or substance abuse).<br><br>Stop feeling sorry for yourself into self-delusion, lah. Introvert, shy, sheltered, whatever -- life is about growing up. Granted, it's easier for some people than for others, but it's also something everybody goes through.

Is rank so imporrtant to the potential<br><br>employer? How do the potential employer knew whether they suffered from psychiatric problem?</blockquote>I think Venny has exaggerated a tad, but shall let him respond for himself. Who knows, he might be thinking of certain jobs in mind when he wrote his post.<br><br>Or he might be thinking of Pes E's instead. I'm an employer myself, &amp; must admit I don't hire the latter at all (even for desk jobs). But no particular prejudice against Pes C -- a lot of reservists get downgraded accordingly when they get older anyway -- but will associate more according to the L-code grouping when I ask about their NS vocations during interviews.<br><br>Shall be quite clueless too if my employee keeps quiet that he's seeing a quack doctor on the side. But, at the same time, he's got to be straight with me when applying leave or asking time-off too. At least I'm not as strict as the civil service, whose job-application form must declare all sorts of potentially-awkward questions, from serious-illness history to criminal records to backruptcy to bond-breaking.</div>
