            <div class='col-md body'>With the non-battle tested SAF, how many staff officers could chalk up "heroic" stories? ~lol~<br><br>I suppose LHL's was the highest profile, when he directed the tri-service rescue operation for the Cable Car tragedy (RSAF helicopters, RSN Diving Unit, SAF Ops &amp; Medical field HQs).<br><br>There was a lot of media writeups about his army days prior to his inauguration. He also once reflected that his stint as a battery commander was one of the most happiest periods of his life, a comment that had stuck with me. The HP41 calculator we used for calculating Arty data then was said to be developed on his initiative; that was more the type of achievements he contributed to the formation.<br><br>BTW All 3 were the among pioneering batches of SAF scholars - LHL in '71; GY, TCH, (plus Lim Hng Kiang &amp; Lim Swee Say) in '73 - so they actually belong to the same age group.<br><br>TCH was the longest-serving regular among them. LHK was a LTC, in the RSAF before heading to MINDEF. LSS switched to the civil-service side supposedly after peaking only as a MAJ, but his subsequent achievements do suggest that maybe the military wasn't the ideal career for him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BG Neo is a nice guy? Ok, I don't know him personally, but everything I've heard about him has been anything but "nice." Very stern, demanding man is what I've heard. But excellent strategist and formator. Probably why he's heading Tradoc.<br><br>The current COMD 9 Div/CIO, COL Winston Toh however, is a supremely "nice guy." Anyone who knows him would tell you. One heckuva friendly and gracious fellow. Very approachable and warm. Also a Guardsman. Getting his well-deserved BG rank next year... I mean, <span style="font-style: italic;">this</span> year.</div>
