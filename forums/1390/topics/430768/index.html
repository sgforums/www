              <p>I committed an OPC traffic offence.I paid up my fine and the case was closed.</p>
              <p>I did declare it in my security clearance form.</p>

              <p>u should worry about yer contract being terminated for reasons of unsound mind.whats your squadron unit number?!</p>
              <p>people like u shouldnt be in any prime high risk position when they even handle a simple security check!</p>
              <p>i say u are pretty much screwed if folks like the MSD key in RSAF engineering officer found in tethers over a simple security check!!u wad??from another planet is it???you what?space alien is it?</p>
              <p>have u tried getting a job with less nightmares than what u are applying for?obviously folks like u will have a hard time within the force from the looks of it.</p>
              <p>u should join the navy..its less risky as compared to aircrafts.u do know u could be punished from missing inventories,missing paperwerk,aircraft badly maintained by yer men.....u could be driven to insanity in fact.</p>
              <p>its alright......the higher ups will squeeze u till they feel like u are outa blood if u cant perform at werk every hours fer next few years.</p>
              <p>u want help....?are u sure u got the right job?damn....this securoty clearance is just the tip of it.....they will do it often even after msd has done their thing .u will get discovered if u have anything on u.security clearnce is the least of yer worries....there are way lots more to worry really that can get u thrown out doin the job or commanding the operations really.u can get thrown out if u dun perform at werk.</p>

              <p>and what the hell are u doing putting yer traffic fines as a security threat for???!!!!</p>
              <p>its a security clearance!!!!</p>
              <p>are u afraid here?????and whatever are you afraid for?these are the reasons that warrant for more detailed examination.</p>
              <p>at one glance at what you had filled in ..the MSD officers will not only look at your form with great displeasure..they will call in the other folks to do a mind probe on u as well!!!!they do have head doctors in the organisation too!</p>
              <p>and whoever told u to put in the traffic fine as a security clearance?!!!</p>
              <p>from looks of it....u do sound kinda scared.well....to ease yer fears.......it will take a month.but after what u filled in your form with the OPC traffic fine.......u could have made things worse for yerself.remeber u are not there as a NCO...but a officer!every thing u fill up goes through people trained to detect abnormalities in yer paperwerk.</p>
              <p>next time,try to be careful in what u put down!</p>
              <p>its a security clearance applicatiion not some application to a primary school!</p>

              <p>do u understand  or do u not understand that statement they asked u on court of law?</p>
              <p>have u been charged in a court of law?its pretty obvious u are confused n scared with the question?hide what??i would say u failed to understand facts.</p>
              <p>do u understand that statement first of all?!how old are u anyway?any decently educated person will know what it means!</p>
              <p>and for one thing...im pretty sure you dont fit in even as a technician let alone as a senior tech or engineer.get it right when they ask u a simple question!</p>
              <p>how do u feel when they lock u up because the aircraft u fixed crashed n blew up.do u know its legal for them to do so do u not?u miss one part on the airplane with the thousands of other complicated parts its the slammer for u ....maybe no lawyers ever needed.</p>
              <p>before u go around lecturing or even to be an aircon mechanic.....its best u understood that simple question first from security clearance!</p>
              <p>from looks of it u may not even last thru the first contract.</p>
