I remember burning weekends during BMT.)<br>[*] go for 24km route march the night before your POP at 9pm unitl 4/5am in the morning. (Ours started in the morning around 5am. POP was in the afternoon)<br>[*] carries garang looking duffel bag instead of sissy looking ones with wheels.

But is it really fair or rational... that seems to me another thing.<br><br>But really no standard meh? You seriously think that they are sending deficent troops to be in the front line units? I don't think so. If you look at most of the requirements that our fighting grunts have to pass you'll realize that it hasn't changed all that much.<br><br>Is BMTC really a fair place to judge the entire SAF on? Note that this is a school training recruits from literally all walks of life as opposed to your mono intake dudes who have been streamed straight into the fighting vocations. Many of the BMTC recruits end up in non combat vocations that may result in them not even seeing another firearm for the rest of their NS, and some were never even physically able to in the first place.<br><br>In the light of all this, are the standards really lower standards or simply smarter standards? How much exactly can you train a recruit in the three or so months anyway. We all knew that BMTC was just more of an induction to military life then anything else... it's in SISPEC, OCS, and AIT where the real combat training starts and the standards are really imposed and made to matter.<br><br>Is it not counter productive to over train a recruit to be the kind of soldier that he will not end up being for the rest of his NS?<br><br>At the end of the day BMTC still trains them in the basics of how to use a rifle, how to shoot it, and some basic movements... but the real complex stuff like how to actually function as an infantry unit is taught elsewhere and the standard don't seem all that reduced to me. When the stuff really hits the fan and we go to war you aren't exactly going to stick a rifle into a pes C or E dude and ask him to chiong... if it reached that point it's most likely we're screwed beyond hope liao.<br><br>It seems to me the emphasis is being placed on doing things smarter rather then tougher... true doing tough stuff is nice to brag about in forums but you can really win a war without smarts.<br><br>Is BMT life easier then the old days? Certainly. But does it mean that the current SAF recruits are lousy? I doubt it... I think it's more of apples and oranges... last time is different from now.<br><br>And it would be nice to stop spreading rumors like there's no more leopard crawl and stuff and spin off like... 56 threads making noise about things that aren't even true to begin with... take it from a guy who was in BMTC and eventually became a BMTC instructor: they still leopard crawl, field camp is 7 days straight, we still shoot real bullets at them and they have to crawl BIC, 24 click is still 24 clicks full, and a large number of the recruits can still do their IPPT and SOC.<br><br>The system hasn't gotten that much softer, but it has become more forgiving to those who obviously are hopeless for soldier stuff and finds more useful things to do with them. And also some of the dumb stuff that was found counterproductive like cookhouse cleaning, excessive boot polishing and using silly Ali Baba bags that make it impossible to take your things out quickly have been dropped. So what's the big fuss?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just a personal opinion lah, i thought the whole idea of tekan during BMT is to break you down as a civilian and build you up slowly as a soldier to prepare for the rest of your NS life<br><br>if BMT don't do that, i think there is a risk that new privates will retain the civilian mentality and kpkb during unit life<br><br>for their own good lah i think, or else, they might not be able to take unit training</div>
