I brought my specialist letter to the Tekong MO.The MO read the letter and arrange for me to go for Medical Board Review to downpes.</p>
              <p>However I was not given a medical board review but another specialist appointment at MMI. The specialist there took less than 2 mins to check on me. He said physiotherapy shall do and pain is common for ns-men. What should i do to downpes??</p>

              <p>Because it is not a big problem.</p>
              <p>The MO offer you to go physio then go loh.</p>
              <p> Usually the medical side, will adopt a "wait and see". If physio is able to "CURE" you then you dont need to down pes. Since you are able to POP means that you are fine with marching, or whatever. It is troublesome now. Hope when you POP and get posted out to other unit, then request for downgrade.</p>
              <p>It is a fact that most kids dont do much physical activity and will only show problem when physically stressed.</p>

              <p>Hi blade,</p>
              <p>I believe the best thing for you to do now will be to wait for the physiotherapy session to be over and see if it is effective or not. If it is not, seek help from the MO of the unit which you are posted to. </p>
              <p>I will suggest that you do not try to seek the MO at BMT Tekong for help right now, as he may wrongly assume that you are malingering. Do inform your commanders of your situation, it is unlikely that they will force you to perform any activities that may aggravate your injury.</p>
              <p>Cheers. </p>

              <p>If it cause you to have pain, take MC, fall out or whatever.  </p>
              <p>If you have a medical record from specialist, it should be in the medical system. It is very easy for you to take mc. The MO will usually refer to history for reference.  </p>

              <p>See bold:The specialists at MMI are all NSmen Medical Officers who are Orthopadic Specialists at the Hospitals u love so much.No NSF MO is a specialist.Only the regulars are and they mostly do not open clinic unless needed.What do you expect??U want a Maj(Dr) to listen to u whine??</p>
              <p>For the person with Chondromalacia patella,physio is for not serious cases and it will be a long time b4 u get a perm pes.In the DOD of a page i shall not mention,it warrants a C9L2 x 6/12 only.PERMANENT PES FOR CMP IS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE CHAIRMAN</p>

              hi Lord_Nazrul, you sound experienced in this matter.  Could you guide me on how to get a temporary downpes to recover from the injury?
              
               i am currently on course and the commanders have mentioned that should i keep booking out for physiotherapy, i shall be out of course. The MO has told me to finish the physiotherapy and see how the results fare.
              
              Guohua tan- i don't wish to go under the knife, unless the specialist has said it is necessary.

              <p>So get out of course loh. Since you are unfit and unable to walk, long march or run, getting you trained to be something or anything, will get you anywhere !!?</p>
              <p>Please understand the meaning of ORD (operational ready date) = getting you really to be operational-ready. Even if you are going to finish the course, are you considered combat-fit?. Then why bother to get trained in the first place?</p>
              <p>Isnt it a mistake that you get Pes B and go to BMT in the first place? You are covering mistake with more mistake? Face it! U are not heathy and fit, like average people. And due to your handicap you are not trainable, as per normal individual. Your fitness level will not enhance anymore, so dont talk about having a mission, marching across jungle. </p>

              Lokey- I am in course now, i shall talk to my inchek see what he can do or recommend  me to do. I shown the camp mo the specialist letter. He said the most he give me temporary downpes for 1 or 2 months, i guess is linked to my next specialist appointment in 3 months time. I am afraid i will OOC when the combat training when i cannot perform physically ( i like my vocation so i dont wish to OOC, unless i am given a non-physical vocation to recover, which i think is impossible..haha)

              <p>Is your health more important or is staying a combat medic more important to you?</p>
              <p>Not all OOC equals to a change in vocation since certain vocational schools will allow a person to stay in the school and helpout with the admin stuff and let the person join the next batch of trainees if his condition was only a temp 1 that would heal by the time training for next batch starts.</p>

              Surely is health. But in all if i cannot temporary downpes to recover, i can only hope i pass out and get posted to a medical centre, which is less physical demanding on most days and recover from there onwards.

              <p>Posting to medical center is more a service medic vocation and not a combat medic vocation i believe so unless you are revocated, i doubt that would be possible and there is no assurance that combat medics will surely be revocated as service medics.</p>
              <p>Combat medics are expected to chiong with their units and you will have little time in the medical center to rest at all since most units combat medics get posted to are usually active combat units that requires the combat medic to follow for all their training.</p>

              <p>Well if u cannot take the training then I suggest u ask the MO for excuse, whether will u be OOC or not, depends on the your PC liao. Btw if u managed to pass of the cbt medic course, if u end up in a cbt unit like SIR etc, u still need to chiong with the men, but if end up in a svc medical centre like Tekong, air base...then you get to relax more...</p>
