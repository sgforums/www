              <p>Once you are better, regardless what vocation you might get would also be more managable than for you to continue training with your injury which might worsen if not taken care of properly and affect your life in future.</p>

              <p>Hi ppl, let me update on my situation.
              
              I had talk to my inchek about the mo not putting me on medical board.</p>
              <p>He said the mo here are less caring and tell me to finish the course. He said once i pass out from the course, my new unit camp mo will take care of me (Hearing this was not very comforting, since that is what my bmt PC told me). He added if i am a platoon medic, the people there will drop me to be service medic if i cannot hold up because of my knees.</p>
              <p>I am getting more depressed since i feel like a ball being passed around. Even worse with my friend being a platoon medic in a mono intake camp saying the commanders and mo wont care about your condition. They will think when you are chao keng, when you complaining of pain and push you to carry on.</p>
              <p>Right now, i only thinking about getting OOC and use the spare time to go for physiotherapy. Not really possible to book out for physiotherapy while in the course, since there is a lot to learn and RT for those that fail test.</p>
              <p>Any bros out there with a solution for me?</p>

              <p>You think service medic don't have to learn all these? You are a trained to be a medic, service or combat, you are required to save life not to take life. Even service medic are required to go out field to do medical cover at times. Trust me, throughout the NS liablity most of the time the only injuries your'll see it's heat exhaution....people like you trying to go OOC, revocate....what you learn, if u get to see amputation or intestines popping out...you are damn lucky. At the end of course, it's still luck where you are posted to, my friend was lucky kenna posted to a service medical centre got to stay out, fyi, he got a friend pass out as service medic but got posted to a combat medical centre got to stay in. I was lucky too, posted to combat unit, then all the medics were attached to the medical centre where everyone stayed out.</p>
