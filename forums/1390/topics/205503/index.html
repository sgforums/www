SENSITIVITY - ie. how likely the type of test in question will pick up all the people truly with disease in a screened population ( sensitivity represents the proportion of truly diseased persons in a screened population who are identified as being diseased by the test. It is a measure of the probability of correctly diagnosing a condition)<br><br>2. SPECIFICITY - ie.  specificity is the proportion of truly nondiseased persons who are so identified by the screening test. It is a measure of the probability of correctly identifying a nondiseased person.<br><br>In most tests you have to trade off sensitivity for specificity and vice versa - and it usually makes sense.<br><br>If say, you have a highly infectious disease and you have to screen the population and want to capture all of the likely sick, even the not truly ill ones get captured - so your test has high sensitivity, ie like put all people in quarantine so long as you suspect on a screening test.<br><br>But if you have a diesase which can be cured but the treatment has many side effects - you want to be absolutely sure that the patient has the disease. So the test must have high specificity.<br><br>You can plot sensitivity and out as a Receiver Operating Charcterisitic (ROC)Curve [ROC curves]. And balance your requirements.<br><br>Now you know why no doctor can give you an absolute guarantee.<br><br>Science and medicine is the accumulation of evidence - ie. the evidence "SUGGESTS" one truth, the probabilityof finding a result stranger than this suggestion (ie, P-value &lt; 0.05 -, that is a less than 5% chance - this again is arbitrary and depends on the type of test and scenario being looked at)<br><br>SO ... ....  Pay your doctor more and listen to them.<br><br>All these info are freely available on websites on medical statistics, diagnostic testing, ROC curves, etc.</div>

Don't take my word for it, read the medical journals on these. This is also coupled to physician experience.
