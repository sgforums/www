            <div class='col-md body'>actually so far i noticed that recourse is really for those extreme cases, for example, you fail your ippt very badly as in you only pass 1 or 2 stations.<br><br>never heard of people recourse because of range, sit test or whatever. anyway you can hardly fail your range what. but it really depends on the companies and the OCs. you dont even need to recourse if you fail your SOC.<br><br>and yes if you recourse with a rank you are allowed to wear that rank, at least thats what i see nowadays in BMTC.<br><br>regarding when you will get recourse if you fail your bmt depends on the time of the year. if there is an intake straight after your batch pop, you will most probably go for immediate recourse. if not, most prob u will do sai kang in your company and wait for the next bmt to start and then go there for recourse.<br><br>also, as to whether you go thru the same training or not depends on the OC and PC. during my time the recoursees in my batch were excused for some activities because they completed them during their previous bmt. again it depends on whether the OC garang a not loh.</div>
