Wait till you hear about my friend.<br><br>My friend was celebrating his birthday , he received his NS enlistment letter and guess when he was enlisted ? The next day. No kidding , that puts a stop to his birthday celebration. I can remember how shitty feeling he felt after reading the letter. After being in the army for 1 and a half years , all I can say and agree with others is that the organisation is screwed up but other then time flew passed very fast for me. I enjoyed the good, bad and ugly times of SAF. Cannot wait to ORD.<br><br></div>
