              <p><span><strong>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</strong>: What is the outcome of MINDEF's 
                                                  investigations into the deaths of full-time National Serviceman Private 
                                                  (PTE) Lee Rui Feng Dominique Sarron, and Private (PTE) Amirul Syahmi Bin
                                                   Kamal; (b) what are the measures in place to ensure the safety of our 
                                                  servicemen, especially those with medical conditions, as they undergo 
                                                  training; (c) whether the investigations revealed any deficiencies in 
                                                  systems and procedures or human lapses; and (d) whether remedial 
                                                  measures would be taken to prevent similar incidents in the future.</span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><strong>Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to
                                                   again offer my deepest condolences to the families of Amirul Syahmi Bin
                                                   Kamal and Lee Rui Feng Dominique Sarron. MINDEF is committed to assist 
                                                  these families during these difficult times.</p>
              <p>Sir, in every case involving the death of a National Serviceman, a 
                                                  number of investigations have been activated and are proceeding 
                                                  concurrently to specifically address the same queries which the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Member</span> has posed. First, in MINDEF, the Armed Forces Council has convened an 
                                                  independent Committee of Inquiry or COI to thoroughly examine the 
                                                  circumstances surrounding each of the two incidents. The COI is to 
                                                  ascertain fully the facts leading to the death and determine the 
                                                  contributory cause or causes of death. The COI is also tasked to 
                                                  determine if measures taken to treat, resuscitate and evacuate the 
                                                  affected NSmen were adequate and prompt, and recommend measures to 
                                                  rectify shortcomings, if any. It shall also determine whether there were
                                                   any breaches of relevant instructions, directives, orders and safety 
                                                  regulations. The COI shall ascertain whether the incident could have 
                                                  been prevented or avoided, and recommend appropriate measures to prevent
                                                   future occurrence. This four-man COI is chaired by a senior civil 
                                                  servant from outside of MINDEF, with a senior doctor from the public 
                                                  sector as one of its members. The Committee is empowered to call any 
                                                  witness and hear his or her testimony, as well as receive any evidence 
                                                  regardless of its admissibility in civil or criminal proceedings in 
                                                  court.</p>
              <p>Second, the Police will submit their independent report to the State 
                                                  Coroner who shall ascertain the cause of and circumstances connected 
                                                  with the death. The Coroner’s inquiry is held in an open court. As part 
                                                  of this process, the Police will report to the Public Prosecutor if 
                                                  their investigations conclude that a person or persons may be arrested 
                                                  and charged in connection with the death.</p>
              <p>Third, the State Coroner will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">review</span> findings from post-mortem examinations to establish the manner and 
                                                  cause of death. The period to complete full post-mortem examinations by 
                                                  the Health Sciences Authority varies depending on the need for 
                                                  supplementary laboratory tests. For some complex cases, it can take as 
                                                  long as 3 months. As a matter of routine, MINDEF does receive the 
                                                  findings of these post-mortem examinations, to aid us in our 
                                                  investigations.</p>
              <p>As these investigations are on-going and MINDEF has not received the 
                                                  finalised reports of post-mortem examinations of these two cases, I can 
                                                  only reveal some facts at hand in response to the MP’s question.</p>
              <p>First, on PTE Amirul. On 15 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">March</span> this year, PTE Amirul did not turn up for a routine roll-call. A search
                                                   was initiated and PTE Amirul was found unconscious in a locked toilet 
                                                  cubicle, with a rope tied around his neck and hanging from the shower 
                                                  beam.</p>
              <p>Resuscitative procedures were immediately activated on site and 
                                                  continued en-route and at Changi General Hospital. Unfortunately, the 
                                                  resuscitation failed and PTE Amirul was pronounced dead at Changi 
                                                  General Hospital.</p>
              <p>Second, on PTE Lee Rui Feng Dominique Sarron. PTE Lee was noted to 
                                                  have breathing difficulties while participating in a platoon exercise 
                                                  involving the use of smoke grenades at a training facility at Lim Chu 
                                                  Kang on 17 Apr 2012. The unit Chief Safety Officer immediately 
                                                  accompanied him to exit the building. Outside the building, PTE Lee lost
                                                   consciousness and received Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation on the spot. 
                                                  He was given supplemental oxygen and evacuated in the safety vehicle to 
                                                  the Medical Centre. Resuscitation efforts by a SAF medical officer 
                                                  continued at the medical centre as well as en-route to the National 
                                                  University Hospital in an SAF ambulance. Unfortunately, the efforts were
                                                   not successful, and PTE Lee was pronounced dead at NUH.</p>
              <p>PTE Lee was noted to have a history of asthma during pre-enlistment 
                                                  screening on 4 Jan 2011 with his last reported asthma attack more than 3
                                                   years prior to enlistment. Based on the SAF medical classification 
                                                  system which is devised in consultation with leading senior medical 
                                                  specialists from the public and private healthcare sectors, NSmen with 
                                                  well-controlled asthma are given a PES grading of A or B and certified 
                                                  fit for military training. Based on SAF’s medical records, PTE Lee did 
                                                  not report sick for any asthmatic attacks in the five-month period after
                                                   enlistment until this incident.</p>
              <p>The concurrent investigations will examine all the facts to determine
                                                   the cause of death, and if the asthma or smoke grenades were 
                                                  contributory factors. Smoke grenades have been commonly used for many 
                                                  years during military training and the SAF has not had any similar 
                                                  incident in the past. Sir, we will have to await the conclusive findings
                                                   of these investigations to determine the cause and measures to be taken
                                                   arising for these two specific cases.</p>
              <p>Allow me to share general aspects on the existing system, which have 
                                                  incorporated lessons learnt from previous incidents. The on-going 
                                                  investigations are conducted so that we can continue to improve our 
                                                  system to ensure the highest standards of training safety for our NSmen.
                                                   This is our top priority and the SAF will do its utmost to implement 
                                                  all recommendations. This includes appropriate disciplinary action 
                                                  against any SAF personnel whose negligent actions have contributed to 
                                                  the death.</p>
              <p>For NSmen, the SAF stands guided by leading medical specialists drawn
                                                   from the public and private sectors to formulate both medical screening
                                                   protocols as well as a classification system based on known medical 
                                                  conditions to ensure the safe training and appropriate deployment of our
                                                   servicemen. For this purpose, all NSmen are subjected to a compulsory 
                                                  and detailed pre-enlistment medical screening to detect anomalies and 
                                                  diseases. Additional screening is also conducted prior to onerous 
                                                  training activities such as overseas exercises. We have and we will 
                                                  continue to review our medical screening procedures on a regular basis, 
                                                  to make sure that they stay in line with international and national 
                                                  standards of clinical practice. After medical screening, NSmen are 
                                                  deployed to suitable vocations to undergo military training. This 
                                                  Physical Employment Status or PES system has been in use since 1971, and
                                                   NSmen with a history of well-controlled asthma have been graded PES A 
                                                  or B and suitable for military training for more than 20 years.</p>
              <p>In addition, ground commanders know that they have a responsibility 
                                                  for the safety of their servicemen during training. They have to keep a 
                                                  keen eye on the safety and condition of their servicemen before, during 
                                                  and after the training is completed. They have the prerogative to stop 
                                                  training for any serviceman at anytime if they sense something is amiss.</p>
              <p>The SAF also reminds individual servicemen to ensure their own safety
                                                   and that of their NS buddies. Servicemen who are unwell at any time 
                                                  during training are required to highlight their condition to their 
                                                  commanders. They are asked proactively before exercises and given the 
                                                  opportunity to excuse themselves. If in the course of their national 
                                                  service, they develop a new medical condition or injury, they have ready
                                                   access to SAF Medical Officers or the public health care system. If 
                                                  need be, they would then be excused from certain types of training or 
                                                  redeployed to a role more suited to their medical condition.</p>
              <p>Sir, safety is top priority for MINDEF and the SAF. We know that we 
                                                  have the responsibility to keep sons of Singapore safe while training. 
                                                  Every incident resulting in injury or death is painful to us and gets 
                                                  top management priority, to make it right. We will spare no effort to 
                                                  investigate every incident thoroughly. We will also incorporate findings
                                                   and recommendations from independent investigations by the Police and 
                                                  Coroner. Where there are mistakes, we will own up to them, learn, 
                                                  rectify and continuously improve. That way, we can put in place a robust
                                                   safety system that will prevent all avoidable injuries and deaths. Once
                                                   again, MINDEF and the SAF extend our deepest condolences to the 
                                                  families of the late PTE Amirul and PTE Lee.</p>

              <p style="font-size: 0px;"><span> Supplementary Questions <br> </span> <span> </span></p>
              <p><span><strong><br> Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</strong>: I would like to thank the Minister for his 
                                                  useful replies. I would like to focus my supplementary questions on PTE 
                                                  Dominique Lee who was my resident and also suffered from asthma. Sir, 
                                                  asthma attacks can kill quite quickly if the sufferer doesn't receive 
                                                  emergency treatment. Yet despite the seriousness of his condition, PTE 
                                                  Lee was exposed to the asthma triggers such as smoke grenades during the
                                                   training exercise. Can I ask the Minister that given the fact that NSF 
                                                  medics are not trained or equipped to give emergency treatment for 
                                                  asthma, why does MINDEF not exempt soldiers with asthma from such 
                                                  training which puts their lives at undue risk. Can I also ask the 
                                                  Minister, given the fact that acute asthma attacks can lead to death, 
                                                  and can be triggered by exposure to smoky and dusty environments, will 
                                                  the Minister agree that there is a need to confront the recruitment of 
                                                  asthmatic recruits, given that the militaries in US and UK have also 
                                                  reviewed their processes, and tightened the rules, and in fact also 
                                                  discharged soldiers with asthma. Can the Minister <span style="text-decoration: underline;">review</span> the SAF medical classification system and screening test, and improve 
                                                  the safety culture to ensure that our military system identifies and 
                                                  disqualifies recruits with chronic diseases such as asthma that could be
                                                   exacerbated by combat training? And I urge the Minister to expedite the
                                                   Committee of Inquiry, so that things can be put right quickly to 
                                                  prevent such unnecessary deaths and to assure parents that indeed MINDEF
                                                   does take the safety of our NSmen seriously, and that deaths which can 
                                                  be prevented and eliminated, will have the utmost seriousness of MINDEF 
                                                  and will be eliminated.</span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><strong>Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen</strong>: Sir, before I reply <span style="text-decoration: underline;">member</span> Irene Ng's question which I share her concern, I just want to state a 
                                                  caveat that we don’t know the cause of death and we should await the 
                                                  investigations of the COI. As I said, the terms of the COI will 
                                                  determine if the cause of death was contributed by the asthma and the 
                                                  smoke grenade, so until then, we should not make that conclusion, and it
                                                   is better for a panel of medical experts and the COI to determine that.
                                                   So the questions that I am answering specific to asthma doesn’t mean 
                                                  that the SAF and MINDEF have pre-judged that it was indeed related. 
                                                  We’ll have to await the findings of the COI.</p>
              <p>With that caveat, the member's concerns are similar to ours. We are 
                                                  careful to ensure that the medical classification system that we have 
                                                  developed is safe enough for our NSmen to train. As I have said, the SAF
                                                   stands guided by our medical experts who are drawn from the public and 
                                                  private sectors, and they tell us which diseases, or if a particular 
                                                  case of asthma, whether mild, moderate or severe asthmas, where they can
                                                   be deployed. As I have said in my reply, mild asthmas have been PES A 
                                                  or B for the last 20 over years, and this is the first such incident 
                                                  that we had in the presence of a smoke grenade. I don’t know whether it 
                                                  has been caused, and the COI will determine, by the presence of a smoke 
                                                  grenade.</p>
              <p>Just in terms of frequency, asthmatics are quite prevalent among our 
                                                  servicemen and they follow the general population. The prevalence of 
                                                  asthma is around 20 percent of our servicemen are found to have some 
                                                  form of asthma, of which majority are mild. Many of them have been put 
                                                  through training without adverse effects. The member asked if our medics
                                                   are trained to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">deal</span> with asthma attacks and the answer is yes. They are trained to 
                                                  administer substances like ventolin through metered dose inhaler if the 
                                                  patient is already prescribed with one. In this particular case, 
                                                  supplemental oxygen was administered.</p>
              <p>I take the member's suggestion that we should review our medical 
                                                  classification system if the COI does recommend it. We will try to 
                                                  expedite it, but we have to wait for a number of investigations to be 
                                                  completed, including the forensic reports and lab tests, but I share the
                                                   concern that we should do this as quickly as possible without 
                                                  compromising full fact-finding.</p>
              <p><strong>Dr Lim Wee Kiak</strong>: Mr Speaker Sir, I would like to thank the 
                                                  Minister for his reassurance that the SAF takes safety as paramount, 
                                                  especially in training. Certainly it has been the concern of many 
                                                  mothers after hearing the mishaps that has happened recently, especially
                                                   over last weekend, Mothers' Day. I have received much feedback on that.
                                                   I’ll like to ask Minister as to what is the estimated duration of the 
                                                  COI. Is there a time limit given for the COI? You can’t be dragging on 
                                                  forever. When does SAF declare a timeout, for example in the earlier 
                                                  case, why wasn’t a timeout declared? In the recent incident, why was a 
                                                  five day timeout declared? What is the purpose of the timeout? Would the
                                                   safety review of the timeout be made public after it is done? Last of 
                                                  all, will the SAF review its medical response for severe injury, whether
                                                   the evacuation to the medical centre is the most appropriate, or should
                                                   they be evacuated directly to the hospital if there is a nearby 
                                                  hospital, because the hospital’s capability is definitely higher as 
                                                  compared to medical centres. Thank you, Minister.</p>
              <p><strong>Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen</strong>: Sir, the first question on
                                                   whether there is a timeline for COIs to be completed, obviously the SAF
                                                   and MINDEF is also keen to have the COI concluded, so that we can 
                                                  improve our system if there are any recommendations. As I have said, 
                                                  sometimes it depends on laboratory tests which can take up to 3 months, 
                                                  so it varies. From experience, it usually takes around a few months, not
                                                   forever, but a few months. We will expedite it as much as we can.</p>
              <p>On when does SAF take a timeout, that's a command decision that our 
                                                  commanders on the ground have to assess, and in this particular instance
                                                   they felt it was necessary, and I backed them. What was done during the
                                                   timeout, basically there was a stop to all field training. The Chief of
                                                   Army called all Commanders, all Warrant Officers who were in command 
                                                  positions to emphasise to them, to give them the facts. Independently, 
                                                  the safety inspectorate will also review our SOPs, our processes to make
                                                   sure that our safety guidelines were adhered to.</p>
              <p>Another question related to our evacuation and resuscitative norms; 
                                                  apart the COI examining this, we are not going to wait for that. 
                                                  Obviously our HQ Medical Corps within the SAF is also reviewing these to
                                                   see whether the steps taken, and whether the facilities and expertise 
                                                  are up to par. So I want to assure members that every incident does 
                                                  cause us to re-examine the system. As I said, we want to do this 
                                                  deliberately, but we are giving the top management priority and we will 
                                                  learn the right lessons to make our system stronger.</p>

                                                  All national servicemen undergo compulsory medical screening by the SAF 
                                                  before their enlistment. When a medical condition is declared or 
                                                  detected, the SAF will conduct follow-up medical assessment to determine
                                                   the suitability of the pre-enlistee for NS training.</p>
              <p>As part of this medical screening, pre-enlistees are specifically 
                                                  asked whether they have any previously known or suspected allergies. The
                                                   SAF medical officer will conduct a more detailed clinical assessment of
                                                   any allergy reported. Depending on the outcome of the clinical 
                                                  assessment, the pre-enlistee could be referred to a specialist doctor to
                                                   confirm the diagnosis and to determine the underlying substance causing
                                                   the allergic reaction. The result of the screening will be factored in 
                                                  the deployment and employment of the serviceman. Similarly, if a 
                                                  serviceman reports that he has an allergy during his NS, his case will 
                                                  be assessed using the same procedures.</p>
              <p>I think as the Minister has highlighted in his earlier replies, the 
                                                  SAF’s medical screening protocols are developed and reviewed regularly 
                                                  in consultation with leading medical specialists from the public and 
                                                  private sectors. Likewise, our approach to allergy testing is in line 
                                                  with established national and international clinical practice 
                                                  guidelines. We continue to monitor these guidelines, and as these 
                                                  guidelines change, we will also adjust our protocols to enhance the 
                                                  robustness of our medical screening.</p>

              <p style="font-size: 0px;"><span> Supplementary Questions <br> </span> <span> </span></p>
              <p><span><br> <strong>Dr Lim Wee Kiak</strong>: Sir, let me thank the MOS for his answer. Certainly I believe that the SAF will await the medical <span style="text-decoration: underline;">review</span> to see whether allergy testing is required. May I ask the Minister that
                                                   in short, the answer is no, which means that there is no allergy 
                                                  testing at all done in MINDEF currently, unless the serviceman give an 
                                                  answer that he has allergy before. The problem now is that a lot of 
                                                  allergy may go undetected. Since SAF already knows what your NSmen are 
                                                  exposed to, there is a whole range of antigens, and antigen testing is 
                                                  now possible, I would like to urge the SAF to reconsider, to ask the 
                                                  medical community within MINDEF to review this seriously, to see if they
                                                   can introduce an allergy test for all NSmen. </span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><strong>Minister of State for Defence and Education Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>: I thank the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">member</span> for the supplementary question. The first part of the clarification is 
                                                  indeed the current medical guidelines do not recommend routine allergy 
                                                  testing in individuals who do not show any symptoms of allergy. We go 
                                                  through a process which I have elaborated earlier. As to the question on
                                                   whether this system is robust enough today and can be reviewed, I think
                                                   we are reviewing as I have mentioned, on a regular basis. There is also
                                                   a COI which is ongoing, and if there are observations made within the 
                                                  COI pertaining to this particular aspect, certainly we will improve our 
                                                  system.</p>
              <p><strong>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</strong>: Sir, given that there are some 
                                                  soldiers who suffer from asthma but they may not have the symptoms at 
                                                  that period of time, or even for several years; can MINDEF explore 
                                                  improving its diagnostic tools and implementing some tolerance test for 
                                                  lungs, so that they are properly assessed before they are sent out for 
                                                  combat training which involves exposure to dust and smoke and allergens.</p>
              <p><strong>Minister of State for Defence and Education Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>: I
                                                   thank the member for the supplementary question. I understand where she
                                                   is coming from and the concerns that she is highlighting on behalf of 
                                                  the soldiers, especially if they develop some medical symptoms along the
                                                   way. I think that there are processes in place where if the National 
                                                  Serviceman develop something and find difficulties in the course of his 
                                                  training, there are processes where he can approach his commander and 
                                                  get appropriate medical attention at the medical centre. We do have 
                                                  avenues and platforms for the National Servicemen to approach the 
                                                  commander to go to the medical centre and to get attention. If indeed 
                                                  something has developed in the course of his training, which may not 
                                                  have been identified earlier, then the National Servicemen will be 
                                                  redeployed and put to another appropriate level of training. The 
                                                  training will be adjusted according to his medical condition. So we are 
                                                  aware of these concerns. I think we will continuously make sure that the
                                                   system that we have is adequate, is robust; and will ensure the safety 
                                                  of our National Servicemen during training. As we have highlighted, it 
                                                  is a very serious matter; we take the issue very seriously. We 
                                                  continuously finetune our protocols and guidelines, not just for 
                                                  screening, but also for medical treatment of servicemen through the 
                                                  course of their training, whether they are in schools, or whether they 
                                                  are in their units. We will continue to finetune these guidelines and 
                                                  procedures in consultation with leading medical specialists, both in the
                                                   private and in the public sector.</p>
