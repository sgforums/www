            <div class='col-md body'>Its pretty hard to fail the range.<br><br>For those that fail it during the company range, they will most likely be "ta-baoed" (packaged food) to other companies do join them for the range. Basically, all the companies will try to help one another and pass their "ta-baos".<br><br>So if you are lucky, your company is amongst the first to do range. In the condition that you fail, you will "ta-bao" to the next company for their range test. If you fail again, you join another company again. Simple.<br><br>There are also what we call "conditional pass" for the BMT, i.e., we pass even though the trainee has failed 1 of the 3 critical units of IPPT, IFC, BTP. Most of these conditional passees come from the fail IPPT category. Fail BTP makes up a small category.<br><br>In any event, magic rounds do the trick.<br><br>Your instructors try their best to pass you. Nobody likes to look bad...<br><br></div>
