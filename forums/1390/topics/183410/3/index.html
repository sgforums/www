They are involved in operations rather than exercises.  Naturally, these are quieter and lower profiled units.  It is possible to sign on as these vocations, but their selection is kinda stringent.<br><br>As for the remaining of SAF, you are right that they are more involved in training preparations rather than operations.  Hence most of their work involves exercises.  But that also makes operations more "satisfying" when accomplished.  Recent example being Operation Flying Eagle.  All the personnel involved were proud to claim that they played a part, no matter how small it was, in rendering aid to Bandar Aceh, Meulaboh n etc.  Such successful operations would not have been possible with rigid discipline and dedication.  It wasn't exactly a war op, but it demonstrated how fast SAF could mobilise and deploy.</div>
