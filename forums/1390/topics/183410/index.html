            <div class='col-md body'>Basically, you'll be doing your BMT at Sierra Wing in OCS, followed by your tri-service term. During your BMT, the female recruits (or cadets, as they are already wearing their 1 white bar during BMT) have the entire wing to themselves as the guys would still be doing their BMT at Tekong.<br><br>After the BMT phase, the guys will join the wing and tri-service term (TST) is with the guys. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Training is exactly the same</span> as for the guys and is done together with them except for the standard obstacle course (SOC) which the female OCTs clear in clean fatigue and skip some stations (as far as i can remember). Some female OCTs may have trouble with some of the obstacles especially the low wall due to their relatively short stature. But i think since you're signing on with the air force, the only SOC you'd have to do is during the BMT phase as TST got no (hardly any) SOC sessions.<br><br>The only time you'll get to dirty yourself with mud and grime is during the BMT phase and the 3 day leadership field camp during TST. Because you'll be transferred to the Air Wing after your TST where you'll kiss your camouflage uniform and all your green barang-barang goodbye. Yes, those horror stories you may have heard about the field camp is true (well, mostly). Go round and round, up and down the rolling scenary of Pasir Laba training grounds in full battle order (FBO) till you peng san. And it's all because you're still a new soldier then, yet unconditioned to the pace and intensity of officer cadet training. But it's ok, cos you'll get used to it very soon. And as a future WSO, that's also the first and last time that you'll be experiencing such 'xiong' training.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Yes, i agree that military training tends to be tougher for the girls due to their physique. But many lady officers have been through all that and excelled. Ever heard of the female OCT who could complete her 2.4km run in 10min and who beat ALL the guys in Sierra Wing to clinch Wing Best Cadet during service term 1 (ST1)? Too bad she quitted after ST1 cos she decided to take up an overseas Public Service Commission scholarship. Otherwise she could well end up as a sword of honour (SOH) recipient.<br>And in case you're wondering, no, she was not the least bit tomboyish. In fact she was the object of fantasy for many male wingmates, a very ACJC kinda pretty look.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Privacy-wise, back at wingline (accomodation quarters), the female cadets have the entire top floor to themselves, which is out of bounds to male cadets and instructors. (Although there's nothing to say that the girls can't go downstairs to join their male colleagues for a quick *ahem* in the male bunks with the door locked). But when outfield... you'll have to do your business just like the guys. I'm afraid I really can't comment on how the girls cope when their "time of the month" comes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>After your transfer to the Air Wing after your TST, I'm afraid i know very little of what those folks do, except that a period of the WSO training is conducted in the Air Force School. But what they learn is definitely more academic compared to the folks in army, and minus the grime (and the fun, in my opinion).<br><br>But anyway, i think the most important message for you is to go for it if you're interested. There's always a shortage of females in the SAF.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

And their promotion is also faster. Degree holders who sign on are commissioned as full lieutenants (LTA) and go on to captain (CPT) directly whereas diploma and A-level holders who sign on commission as 2nd Lietenants (2LT), go on to LTA 1, then LTA 2, before getting their 3rd bar. As a dip holder, be prepared that you'll have to work for more than 5 years before you get your CPT rank.<br><br>But when (and a big IF for dip holders) you hit the senior officer ranks (LTC and above), there is supposedly no difference in the payscale whether or not you're a degree or dip holder.. that's as far as i understand.<br><br></div>

When the female cadets first step into the military world as recruits, they are put under the charge of a female officer throughout the duration of their BMT training (and beyond, as far as possible, although this does not always happen due to a shortage of female officers) who will of course be in a better position to advise the girls and to understand their problems compared to the male instructors.

Hmmm.. i'm not sure of the contract for female officers though. This I think you have gotta call and ask the recruitment guys to find out. Actually, we do have a lady officer here in sgforums, but I haven't seen her post for a long long time liao.</div>

Only later  then they will over you the SAVERs long term contract with pension and all that.<br><br>For WSO C3 the training can get pretty tough mentally. If you can't handle multi-tasking (i.e talking to pilots while scanning your radar) while getting shouted at than consider going for something else. Granted that it is almost 90% less physically strenous than other vocations, but the 'failure' rate for the C3 courses can be pretty high sometimes.</div>
