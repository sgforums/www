Quite confused on which career path 2 take. I applied for NTU school of information n communication as well as NIE (dip ed).. but strangely i don't really feel the passion for these 2 courses lar.. dunno whether it's the advertisements i saw on the streets n in the magazines portraying females in SAF as very cool individuals, i'm sort of inspired 2 join la.. i'm not attracted to the "stable job" image or good pay, but rather the kind of "shuai" feeling when wearing the uniform.. haha<br><br>I'm consider air force weapon systems officer, either C3 or UAV.. but can some1 tell me more abt what they're abt? The websites don't seem 2 say much leh. very brief nia.. and i don't have any foundation on stuff like that, coz all i study is abt the media industry. then also, what r the stuff that females shld take note of when going bmt and ocs.. actually the thing i'm most worried abt is "the time on the month".. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br>It'll be good if some female officers can share their experience with me.. then is it very hard 2 get in also? the drop out rate high ma?<br><br>my parents keep saying that females who go SAF all very tom boy 1, n think that i too guniang liao, not suitable.. dunno leh.. </blockquote></strong><br><br>EEE... air force... sux la... no honour 1...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Think twice before u sign on,i have a lot of friends regretted very much in signing on from air force ,saf and even police Lol and most of them want to opt for early release.<br>Don't be tempted by the commericals,the main purposes of the commercial are to attract people loh.<br>Since you can get into NTU,it best to go for a degree lah.A degree in  Uni can be used in the society,but experience gain in army , etc is usually useless in the job sector(unless you are a pilots,technicians,MO,etc) .Before long ,time files,your bond is gone , let say u are 30 -yrs old(i am uncertain abt the time period ),if u do not continue in the forces,u will need to catch up alot in the commercial world , have to fight against young fresh graduates,it is not easy loh,unless u save up enough money to form your own business.<br><br>You might be interested in the job in army now,but to tell u the truth most people,i am saying most,have different impression towards the army b4 and after enlisting<br><br>Take a look at this<br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=182634</div>

'Good salary' is highly subjective lor, what's good salary to you?<br><br>Ok, just to give you an idea of what the average pay is like, this is from an Army Officer recruitment booklet that's been accumulating dust on my shelf:<br><br>A Levels/Diploma:<br>(Pay by rank)<br>OCT (Officer Cadet): $1584 - $1695<br>2LT: $1648 - $1807<br>LTA: $1711 - $3201 (LTA 1 -&gt; LTA 2 -&gt; CPT 1)<br>CPT: $3171 - $5017<br>MAJ: $4227 - $6228<br><br>Graduate:<br>OCT: $2075 - $2555<br>2LT: (Grads skip the 2LT rank totally)<br>LTA: $2388 - $2823 (They go direct from LTA 1 to CPT 1)<br>CPT: $2472 - $5017<br>MAJ: $4623 - $6711<br><br>SAFOS/SMS/Grad (Good Hons):<br>OCT: $2555<br>LTA: $3303 - $3432<br>CPT: $3726 - $5446<br>MAJ: $5431 - $7162<br><br>As you can see, there are 3 distinct schemes depending on your qualification. Even with a degree, there is a world of a difference between a normal pass degree and a top honours degree/overseas scholarship. Of course ultimately, performance plays a part too.<br><br>But i think the bottomline is, no point comparing yourself to others, cos there will always be someone who is promoted faster/getting a fatter pay packet than yourself. Just ensure that it is a job that you enjoy doing, and make the most out of it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
