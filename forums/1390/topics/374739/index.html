              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Defence spending and NS liability in Singapore should be cut. If the defence spending is cut, the GST, income tax and corporate tax may also be cut as well. Thus, bringing more income and purchasing power to Singaporeans and businesses. With more purchasing power in the hands of Singaporeans, it can lead to more demands for goods and services and thus, better business to the companies.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><br><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">With a reduction in corporate tax rate, it can also boost business profits in Singapore and attract more foreign investments into the country and create more jobs for Singaporeans.<br>Why should the welfare of 1 big money wasting machine (not war fighting machine) come at the expense of Singaporeans? Does a huge defence spending lead a strong SAF? With a huge army based on a forward defence strategy, with its offensive weapons such as attack helicopters, MBTs, Chinooks, it also generate the risks that a war with our neighbours can be sparked off in times of crisis due to military necessity, instead of resolving through diplomacy. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><br><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Moreover, by launching a 1st strike becos of military necessity in times of crisis with our neighbours, Singapore will become the aggressor in the eyes of international community. Hence, Singapore may be condemned by UN instead. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><br><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Well, terrorism is an internal threat and comes under the purview of the Home Affairs. Does a few terrorists need such a big army to fight? Moreover, while the PAP is calling Singaporeans to defend their home, they are at the same times bringing in more foreign talents to take away the jobs and HDB flats of Singaporeans. Hence, Singaporeans had been called to serve 2 years of NS and 10-ICT cycle to defend the jobs and homes of the foreigners living in Singapore. Statistics of Singapore revealed that 34% of the population are PRs/foreigners.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><br><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">With the influx of foreigners into Singapore, Singapore has already been colonised by foreigners through economic means, not military means. Hence, the threat of national security and defence of our nation is no longer at the military front. Hence, defence spending should be cut and foreign talents restricted in Singapore. This is what the government should be focus on in terms of national security. The PAP is focusing on defending Singapore in the wrong front and the RP is right that defence spending be cut and foreign workers restricted in Singapore. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In peacetime, SAF regulars has to be given a pay above market rate to serve the country, while NSmen are not. In wartime, SAF regulars stay in aircon room to “direct” the battles, while NSmen go and die for the country. After wartime, foreign talents come in and rebuild the economy, and married the wives of NSmen who died for the country. For those wives and daughters whose husband or father died in the battle to defend Singapore, they had to earn a living to provide for themselves. If cannot find a job becos of influx of foreign talent or new citizens, the wife and daughters of those NSmen who died for the country had to sell their body to these foreign talent and new citizens. This is the price to pay for being a Singapore citizen.</span></p>
