            <div class='col-md body'>hey man, i was also in the scdf, i'm also chinese, it's true you won't get used to being the minority, and it's true that you will feel uncomfortable... think of it this way, with the issue being minority, it's a good chance to feel how it's like, then you understand the indian people here, they have been minority here in singapore for like many years, and you, just some weeks until you POP, don't get too stressed up. As for the hygene stuff, well, you'll get used to it. I also feel damn sadz during BMT, play chess with those guys, play poker, do stupid stuff. Last time bmt i super lao lan, dun listen to authority, coz they play punk, but at the end of the day, everyone just want to finish the bmt peacefully and the authorities also want no troubles, because anything happen, everyone genna... so my suggestion is, just bring some books, talk cock, listen mp3, don't bring expensive stuff into your bmt unless you dun mind losing them, and then after you POP, time to celebrate bah...</div>

Even if you can't fully assimiliate, you can always learn to cope: be open-minded, get familiarized, develop routines, take time-outs, etc. After all, S'pore is sited in a Malay neighborhood so, who knows, attaining the fluency &amp; comfort zone can help you greatly after NS.</div>
