And you get to fly off the moment the guys are on the ground. If you land, you actually take longer and have a possibility of being grounded. I suppose a well-trained group can take less then 10secs to be fully deployed as opposed to a helo landing and the troops getting out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In military terms, Guards are known as heli-borne. You might see them as elites of infantry as commandos are, but their main differences are in their missions. Infantry's main mission in modern days are to "hold" a certain ground and other "normal" missions. Commandos specialised in special ops behind enemies line. Guards are trained to conduct "raids" which is "SAF" "Shoot and fuckoff". Notably, the SAF is actually quite well-known among neighbouring countries' military field for its ability in conducting raiding operations. Much of this reputation will of course has to be credited to the Guards.</div>

Infantry's main mission in modern days are to "hold" a certain ground and other "normal" missions.

Notably, the SAF is actually quite well-known among neighbouring countries' military field for its ability in conducting raiding operations.
