Bcos I was from 3rd Guards in the year 03/04.<br><br>MODS, I dun noe whether this should be allowed here, so delete if u feel necessary.<br><br>To answer his qns......<br>In the 2 GDS battalion, 1&amp;3........ there will be a Bn specialising in aerial ops while the other specialises in naval insertion. The heli-borne Bn is call A while the naval insertion one is known as B. Both GDS bn will rotate this arrangement after each mono, thus ur fren may be a B Bn, thus he is not aware of TAG.<br><br>After this division of A and B, each Bn will emphasis heavily on their appointed specialisation. For Fencer, usually they will train the Bn to operate on Endurance Class LST and be familiar we FCEP, FCU and RPL. All this vessels are machiam like ur saving private ryan those boats. FCEP is the smallest can carry a plt size, while FCU is slightly larger being able to carry a single AMX10, while the RPL the largest yet the slowest, can carry a coy++ of men and 4 light vehicles. These boats rocks like hell even in the calmest sea of SG on a sunny day. They learn coastal hook and amphibious assaults. I won't elaborate on those. But I did those stuff even though i was not fencer.<br><br>During then, I was in A. We learn repelling, hover jump and I'm proud to say, I sit before all the 3 types of helos in RSAF. In fact in my 2 yrs life as NSF, I took heli for abt 8 times like dat.<br>So wads TAG?<br><br>TAG: Is a training given to a particular plt in the Bn. This platoon is responsible to be the first to be inserted into the enemy grounds, after the scouts. Their aim is to mark out the designated sector that allows helicopter to land, usually 3 to 4 birds. For day, orange colour panel are planted to the ground to direct the helis, at night, IR emitting instruments are planted This platoon will be also responsible to maintain comms with RSAF and to challenge password to any incoming helis. If they are contacted by enemy patrols they will halt the helis from coming and beat a hasty retreat to the next nearby alternative landing zones<br></div>
