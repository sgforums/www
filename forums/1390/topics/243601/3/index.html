By that time I blur liao, so he explain to me that each platoon specialises in certain skill.. i.e. Platoon 1 trained in TAG, Platoon 2 in river crossing, Platoon 3 in assault, blah blah... but they are cross-trained, so they can take over each others role...<br><br>Then from what I interpret the entire Guards is trained in all aspects liao.</div>
