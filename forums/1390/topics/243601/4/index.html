Is this some form of raiding ops that is re-introduced to GDS?<br><br>Bcos back during conversion course back in 2003, we had this EX SUMMEX in which is a concluding exercise that encompasses what u learnt all this weeks. It is a 7D6N back to back exercise with minimum amount of lull time in between(eg. rest).<br><br>In this ex, we are divided into red land and blue land. Both force are supposed to attack each other through ambush, fighting patrol, security and things on that line. But what interest me was this component. Each section is supposed to attack this water treatment plant that have been designated as communication facility for this Exercise. The opposing force will send out fighting patrols, and ppls to provide perimeter defenses. Before the force set off for this mission. we are supposed to make cross-charges and carry many blocks to simulate block charges, that we learnt during explosive ordance lessons.<br><br>It was free for all in which the blue force or red force platoon will think of how to carry out the attack at night under the command of the PC. The OC later gave a little discussion on the possible route of attack.......... in the morning.<br><br>Is this considered as some form of raid or something else i was not aware.............</div>

I believe numbers about an infantry / guards battalions have been discussed rather openly already.  Heck it even came out in Straits Times many years back..  Its operational concepts that are more sensitive.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Talking abt the issue of GDS, since the tsunami episode, in which RSN failed initially to deplo the FCU and FCEP due to the debris, why have the army not considered alternatives like the AAAV-7 vehicle for the GDS formation. In times of war, the beach head may be flooded with natural obstacles that hinder FCU movement, and the FCU are not protected from shrapnels, thus the AAAV-7 can provide the protection and mobility that GDS needs. I mean, troops can move faster in land rather than wait for other modes of transport. We need not get too many. Enough for one BN is suffice in my view.<br><br><img src="http://photocdn.sohu.com/20060214/Img241814611.jpg"></div>
