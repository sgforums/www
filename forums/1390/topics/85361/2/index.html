But your block leave will be burned as you will require to retake the test during the period but if still fail then they also can't do anything about it other than not letting you to go SISPEC and OCS.....<br><br>For Obese I am not so sure but for PES C ppl, everyone will get their block leave as lots of them don't need to do IPPT, SOC and IFC.......</div>
