              <p>Hi all, i am currently a student in sp. i was from Dip in nautical studies but was required to change course due to attachment company closing down. was not able to get another company due to the economy crisis. changed to mechanical engineering but was not very interested. I failed the modules and is losing interest now. Currently in year 2 with around 1.5 years to go. Thinking of stopping school to sign on diver den after that continue studies. what do you guys think? signing on cause i want them to sponsor my studies. i have aldy spend 4 years in school and im getting really tired of it.</p>
              <p>I have talked to a recruiter but its not very clear. heres what he told me. possible to be officer only with outstanding performance. slow promotion, lower pay compared to others with higher qualification. sponsorship to studies after 3 year based on military performance.</p>
              <p>So i just wanna ask you guys if theres anyone like me around? maybe enlighten me on my move? and whats the exact low pay am i expecting? how will the career be like? im interested to make it into SWG, how can i do it? and hows life in swg?</p>

              <p>Possible to be officer, but almost impossible since you do not have at least a dip.</p>
              <p>Slow promotion, as in really slow. You will see your peers many ranks above you a few years down the road.</p>
              <p>Lower pay as in really much lower. The higher you go, the wider the pay gap. </p>
              <p>Most important thing to note: Sponsorship to studies not guaranteed.</p>
              <p>You should know now why the recruiter does not speak to you clearly about everything. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
