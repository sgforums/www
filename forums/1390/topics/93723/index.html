            <div class='col-md body'>From what I know, those in Enhanced will get a shot at being a junior commander, i.e at least a 3SG rank.Technicians belong to the specialist category so you might not get that vocation.The usual combat vocations should apply to you.Signaller, Infantry, Guards, Commando, BRC, MP/RP etc.</div>

This course trains combat-fit commander-potential recruits in the basic military skills.  These recruits usually go on to do Specialists or Officer courses to become commanders.  The Enhanced BMT has additional modules to train and select these recruits. For those who failed to achieve the NAPFA test  silver award, they are required to undergo a 6-week Physical Training Phase prior to the Enhanced BMT.<br><br>Standard BMT (8 weeks). To train recruits meant for combat vocations1 such as those who will be assigned to units as signallers, combat medics and military policemen, etc after their BMTC. <strong>The training is similar to that for Enhanced BMT, less the modules on training and selection of commanders.</strong> Similarly, those who failed to achieve the NAPFA test silver award are also required to attend a 6-week Physical Training Phase before attending the actual BMT.<br><br>http://www.mindef.gov.sg/history/index.asp?cat=histdisp&amp;id=74</div>

By the new millenium, though, much of my vocational skills were already made redundant, when the SAF upgraded to new technology &amp; weapons.<br><br>During active, I basically carried the PRC-77 signal set for the FO (a 2LT/LTA) or FSO (a CPT) whenever attached out for infantry exercises. Can honestly say I've followed every SIR, Guards, even the Commando unit out to the field before - even spent 5 weeks jungle-training in Brunei (with 6 SIR).<br><br>Not bad for a ex-PES C1/Cat C soldier, eh? I was part of the overweight platoon in Tekong, but under the old BMT format where we got extra runs every morning whilst other companies were doing area-cleaning. Lost 30 lb. when I passed out 3 months later.<br><br>Last 6 months of my active stint was spent with the Arty Training Cadre, instructing a mono intake.<br><br>I got smart come reservist, upon being posted to an IHL unit &amp; finding out my appointment was with the recce team. The job is vehicular-based, with a lot of autonomous mobility (as we hunted for deploying grounds, &amp; also makan stalls) &amp; also, technically, a 155mm howitzer BN isn't frontline troops ~lol~ The scheduled Ex Starlight trips were very attractive too.<br><br>The 3rd part of what I was trained for at SOAY - calculating FD data - is something I "si-amed" all the way. I absolutely abhor working with numbers, to the extent of volunteering to follow infantry when I couldn't even pass my BMT SOC - as my then-BC pointed out during our 1st unit interview. Came to "regret" that decision many times during the NSF, not just for the physical exertions but also the burnt weekends out on attachments (&amp; then expected to follow the Arty exercises during the week). Compiled over 40 off-in-lieus days as a result.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Manager433: wow just as what you've mentioned you had gained a FOC driving license which I think is at least rewarding  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> , lol those were the "days" man, the government groups Nsfs according to their "physical employment status" not their "education level", but heck I do think you had a nice time with your peers right irregardless of their "education level" ? not forgetting some memorable and fun moments too. Seriously for me I do think BMT's certainly much more memorable compared to unit life lol, so much so that I'm going back for a "second" helping  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
