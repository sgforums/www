              <p>Okay,</p>
              <p>so in brief, I have been abroad for many years on an exit permit working and have never done one single ICT or IPPT after ORD. Now, I have a chance to be deployed back to  work in Singapore for an extended period. So, say work 4 months in Singapore, and 8 months in "X" foreign country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So how does the exit permit work here? I read that if I come back for 1 month or 4 months it will be cancelled. Is it 1 or 4? is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">4 months continuous or 4 months in total </span>for each calendar year? </p>
              <p>i read through the various FAQ's and there doesn't seem to be anything on it.</p>
              <p>Can anyone shed some light on this matter?</p>

              <p>Yes I know. My exit permit is still valid and I have been renewing it every 3 years. But what I am asking is how long if I stay in Singapore will it be invalidated?</p>
