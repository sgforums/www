            <div class='col-md body'>Hey everyone,<br><br>I need some help-- one of my friends showed me a gold pendant which I recognized is the Singapore commando jump wings, with the word "Singapura" across the front.  He said that he used to be in Guards. Do the Guards undergo parachute training?  How about diving courses (I'm not referring to just the coastal swim they have to undergo, I'm referring to actual underwater diving, similar to NDU's duties)?<br><br>Thanks!<br><br></div>
