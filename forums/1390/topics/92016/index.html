            <div class='col-md body'>Here's my review. Could only go at 5pm Saturday due to work, but I think I covered 60% of the attractions in just over 3 hours. 20% more were organized for the kids/uninitiated &amp; thus "fluff" events for me, &amp; I'm going to see if I can go down again on early Monday evening for the remaining 20% - primarily the Live Firing Safari, which ended at 7:30.<br><br>Despite the recommendations, FORGET ABOUT GOING TO AREA "A"/LIVING FIRING SAFARI WHEN IT IS NEAR DUSK. I made it my 1st stop, taking a shuttle bus from the SAFTI Library to, basically, the shooting ranges opposite FOFO Hill for the rifle &amp; GPMG firing (long queues), SAR vehicle rides (long queues), 5-tonner rides into the live-firing areas (no more visitor pickups at 7:15) &amp; "Adventure Land" (nee the obstacle courses/confidence jumps).<br><br>Then reality hit me: the mosquitos &amp; sandflies - somehow long forgotten in my mind - were going to show up as darkness fell, &amp; I reactively sought for the shuttle back. Funny enough, there was these 3 girls who looked out of place in their orange tees &amp; white skirts, spraying "Off" cans to promote their brands, &amp; whom quickly disappeared when the irritating insects made their presence!<br><br>Nonetheless, the commute trip between modern SAFTI MI &amp; the older Pasir Laba Camp facilities (albeit some ongoing construction there) was nostalgic; you could literally sniff out the old times, spot some well-trodden footpaths out of the woods &amp;, on the way back, see the entire area shroud in darkness with very little streetlights.<br><br>Alighted near Warriors Hall, where there was some exhibitions showcasing Army culture &amp; 3G transformation, etc. Very educating &amp; pleasing to the eye, nice way to revisit a stand-by-bulk locker &amp; FBO items &amp; stuff. Passed on volunteering to execise on the jazzed-up IPPT stations, but picked up some of the Army Recruitment posters being distributed. Tip: Some "chio" female personnel thereabouts, unlike elsewhere (either old/dumpy or okay-but-tired-looking - perhaps it's a long day). Run into a kid my mum used to babysit; last saw him during CNS when he was a blur Tekong recruit, &amp; he's now a OCS cadet (Armour) who just returned from Brunei &amp; will be commissioned in 4 months' time! Spent quite a while catching up news with him.<br><br>Followed his directions to the parade square, where the static displays are held. Walked the steps uphill (past Peng Kang Ave); nothing's on at the open-air amphitheatre but there was a mobile column-cum-entertainment show nearby. Unimpressed with the inane musical item on show - provost-twirling rifles &amp; NCC girls dancing in vest-&amp;-slacks, according to the MC - &amp; was attracted more to the civilian stalls selling tees &amp; stuff. In fact, I'll give these businesses &amp; the various food kiosks &amp; even information counters (free Mentos sweets!) an A+ for variety &amp; a quick pick-me-up. Civilian ferry services were quite prompt &amp; frequent too.<br><br>The equipment displays at the parade square are divided into Arty/Logistics on one side &amp; Armour/Infantry on the other. Checked out the new ARTHUR battlefield radar &amp; joked with the 24SA guides about how "mysterious" their unit was - they certainly don't operate the howitzers we gunners are more familiar with, neither do they seemingly compete in intra-formation sports like the rest of us too. Then, at last, I looked up at the majestic SSPH-1 Primus. Bantered with the 21SA guides &amp; climbed inside for a looksee - boy, was it spacious! A lot of it is computerized (no more manual orientation) &amp; comms are by radio waves (no more telejays); they even had built-in fans (no air-con yet!) &amp; they said they don't need to do camoflaguing nor dig shellstrips anymore!<br><br>Detoured to the command-post tentage where they had all these futuristic laptops &amp; computer softwares, which we knew about but SOAY "refused" to teach us old-bird reservists. Ah well. Had fun telling the disbelieving guides about how my preceding NSF generation - i.e. Lee Hsien Loong's 1970s-early 1980s batches - were using mathematical log tables &amp; primitive scientific calculators to work out firing data.<br><br>Wanted to hang around longer but it was getting to closing time. Walked briskly over to the Armour displays. Saw nothing really revolutionary - sorry, I was in a hurry &amp; they were closing shop - before heading to the infantry arms section. Cursorily scanned the weapons but couldn't spot the MP-5, for one. But I did see the SAR-21 (never handled it before) &amp; a WO was kind enough to patiently brief me on its characteristics. Cradled it - it was lighter than I expected - &amp; then sighted it. Immediate thought: how could anyone not shoot marksman with its eye-friendly design?<br><br>By then it was 9:00 on the dot &amp; I had to make my way to the ferry stop back to Jurong East MRT, thus missing out on - amongst others, the Commando small-quarters takedown room (the Straits Times reported it) &amp; the Chinook display on the field next to the stadium (saw it on my way in). Would've also liked to familiarize myself with the BV-206 &amp; other all-terrainers that's now purported standard vehicles in Arty.<br><br>All in all, it was a nice way to spend Saturday evening. Yes, cameras &amp; camcorders are allowed &amp; the excursion was quite free-&amp;-easy, though human traffic between attractions is quite tightly managed &amp; there was a lot of mazy barriers put up to direct visitors on proper routes. I'm guessing quite a few thousand NSFs burnt their weekends to serve as marshalls, etc. as well. Security was quite tight; the MPs &amp; police conduct their scannings at the bus interchange itself &amp;, since Area "A" is a life-firing area, there are armed soldiers guarding non-entry roads &amp; security checks are also conducted at the shooting ranges.<br><br>Gosh, now I'm thirsty to take the 5-tonner &amp; hopefully revisit the famous landmarks in Area "D" again.  Monday, I'm promising myself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just got time off; will head down again this afternoon (Monday).<br><br>Alamak x 3: thunder &amp; rainy clouds again ;-(<br><br>But no drizzle yet.<br><br><blockquote>do they really issue live rounds for u to fire? or is it using laser pointer? </blockquote>Those attractions at SAFTI MI, no. At the Live Firing Safari, yes. I followed down the mazy barriers for the rifle shooting, but gave up after seeing how long the queue for the SAF-21 was (almost 150). They used the full 3 chambers - 6 firers each - with proper ammo point &amp; collapsible targets. Appears to be run on an own-time-own target format, with conducting officers on the ground rather than in the control room. Everything was quite clockwork/regimented: visitors closely seated on the training-shed benches, soldiers collected &amp; distributed ammo, &amp; also luminous-vested soldiers leading each detail both in &amp; out to the security-check areas. They provided helmets &amp;, I seem to recall, #4 shirts, though I dunno about webbing &amp; earplugs. I took in the scene for only about 3-4 minutes before I turned back.</div>
