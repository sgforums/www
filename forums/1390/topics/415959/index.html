              <p>hi guys. im currently in pes BP (fat kids). halfway thru my BMT and have yet to complete my HG test, rifle range and SIT test. these are the only high key events i need to complete, outfield and the rest all completed.</p>
              <p>i have this skin problem which has been popping out since my confinement week and a very bad rash will appear all around my legs to thorso area. i have reported this twice to the MO and have been given 3 days excuse-uniform, the rash only subsides after 2-3 days of wearing more ventilated clothings.</p>
              <p>i went to my family clinic today to get a memo from the doctor who has my skin problems records since i was young. in addition, i visited another skin specialist and got a memo from him as well. both doctors asks of the MO to 'excuse me from wearing no.4 and activities that will expose me to heat and dust'.</p>
              <p>should i only present the 2 memos after im done with the remaining high key events, or show it to them ASAP?</p>
              <p>since im excused from no.4, technically, i wont even need to do my range and HG tests right?</p>

              <p>What is hg test?</p>
              <p>First thing to do is to see if can downpes or not.</p>
              <p>If cannot, no point in showing the memo, since you will be expected to come back to complete BMT near the end of your NS since you skip the major components. I don't think your skin will get any better then.</p>
              <p>If cannot downpes, wait till you finish the major components (Sit Test, field camp...) then get a new memo and show to your MO.</p>
