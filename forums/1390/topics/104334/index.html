            <div class='col-md body'>well...to provide explanation to running shoes....<br><br>the Brooks Maximus is more of a Motion Control shoe with a cross-trainer-like outsole....<br><br>main shock-absorbing material of Brooks footwear is the Hydro Flow system...<br><br>in my experience of running shoes....The Brooks maximus should be worn by people with low arches due to the generous amount of the dual density medial post(the grey-coloured cushioning at the medial-side of the foot) ..Dual density medial posts control overpronation(which are commonly suffered by people with low or flat foot arches)<br><br>now on to the new balance...this is a stability shoe<br><br>its main shock-absorbing material is the 'Abzorb' system....It is similar to the Brooks in that it also has a dual density medial post..<br><br>the feature that sets it apart is what the new balance company calls...the 'Stability Web' which is that plastic/rubber material at the midfoot...this stabilises the foot and is good for runners who supinate and/or suffering from plantar fascitis...an easy way to explain this technology in a shoe is that the stabilty web controls a runner's footstrike....this is especially useful for runners with weak ankles...and are forefoot strikers..forefoot strikers are runners who run more on the outside of the foot rather than pronating as per normal...<br><br>anywaes...the best way to choose a shoe for ureself is to look at ure current running shoes rather than looking at the arch.....examine the wear....if ure shoe wears more on the outside...then u are considered a supinator...or a forefoot striker...if it wears on the inside...then u are considered a pronator...if there is even wear in the shoe....then u are a neutral runner...<br><br>nowadays there is a growing number of flatfooted and low-arch runners which supinate...including me....well..from my experience...i love stability shoes like the New Balance 380...even my Nike Air Pegasus is modified with a graphite insole to make it stable...<br><br>if u overpronate...u need a motion-control shoe like the Brooks Maximus...<br><br>if u underpronate/supinate...or needs stability for ure foot due to weak ankles or other reasons...get the New Balance 380...<br><br>if u are a neutral runner....u are in luck as u can wear both kinds of shoes...but i would recommend a stability shoe due to the fact that when u are fatigued or tired the stability functions in the shoe would help give u extra support....<br><br>What i say here comes from money wasted on the wrong pair of shoes and alot of pain caused by them.....alot of trial and error was done in my part for the past few years of running....and i think the way of choosing the shoes in this reply should be taken into consideration.........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>are recruits given both shoes? when i went for my medical checkup many months ago (enlisting in jan) the person sorta looked at my foot and told me to try on the brooks one. and they had both kinds, so i dun think recruits are given both to try. anybody can clarify??<br><br>anyway i think asics is still the best shoe for runners. doesnt waste too much money on advertisements so u know the money u pay is really going into the shoe. and it provides much more cushioning than nike shox or other brands. somehow it manages to fit the foot really well and provides the right amount of cushioning at different places.<br><br>anyway is asics available in the camps?</div>
