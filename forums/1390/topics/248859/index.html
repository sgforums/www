Eyesight below 200 degrees for NDU, above that usually CDO but of course there are many exceptions. and Pes A for high chance of being shortlisted.

In typical light-infantry style, anything that isn't worth its weight is discarded, and this approach extends to practices as well as equipment.<br><br>In my case, the sergeant asked a question that he and I both know was useless.  By pointing it out, I inadvertently displayed the "no wayang" attitude.  On top of that, Commando culture is irreverent if not rebellious - by asking the question in the manner that I did, I showed the sergeant that I'd fit right into the culture.<br><br>When you get down to brass tacks, the whole Commando thing is much more a matter of the mind than of physical fitness.  As Captain Roger Courtney said to one of the pioneer batches of the Special Boat Squadron in 1942, "You think you're tough?  If so, get out - I want f*ckers with brains".</div>

By that measure alone the SAF cannot afford to do what all-regular armies do, i.e. avoid direct intakes into their paratrooper units.  Have you seen the conscript model do Israel any harm?<br><br>If it's not about the training, what is it about?  Are you going to take your chances with nature and pray for a bumper crop of supermen each and every year?  Personally, I'd go with factors that I can control and focus on implementing a training system that produces the best results regardless of the material that you start with.<br><br>I've said it many times before - plenty of men from other units can outrun, outjump and out-situp Commandos.  On the other hand, put a Commando and an infantryman side-by-side, have them charlie-mike for 96 hours and then get them to solve a tactical problem, and then you'll see the difference.  Sure, both will be tired, but betting odds are that the Commando will be less vulnerable to the "shack cannot think" syndrome.  I don't care if you can run a four-minute mile - if you can't think at the end of that four minutes, you're still as useless as teats on a bull.<br><br>Guess what?  The difference doesn't lie in what either man was like when he enlisted.  Instead, one would have been pushed to the limit in training while the other would not - it's that simple.  I used to be astounded by hearing men from other units (which I won't name) KPKB about doing two rehearsals before an exercise.  We used to do 25 rehearsals, covering all the different permutations and combinations of casualties and remaining teams, before each exercise, and these guys are complaining about having to do it a second time?<br><br>You're right, Chan - it's simply the training that makes the difference.  Hell, right from enlistment day the instructors used to give an evil grin and say, "You <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can</span> be trained".  If you think that the raw material is more important than the training, you really don't understand the job at all.<br><br>As for CDO not being SF, well, duh.  We're light infantry with airborne capability and we always have been, just like the US Rangers and British Paras.  I don't know where you get the idea that we're SF.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me personally, i feel that real elite soldiers r those who can think on their feets , have a above average AQ , can command the respect of their fellow soldiers, and of course fearless to point out errors that others have made, be it ur superior or ur platoon mates. that i think  is wat  SAF need</div>

The key difference is the area of operations.  Infantry theoretically works around our front lines, Commandos work behind the enemy's front lines and Guards work in no-man's land in between.  The further forward you are, the less support you can expect, and the training is built around that amount of support.  For example, with light infantry (including airborne infantry), they're trained to achieve their objectives with minimal support from armour and arty, while Infantry troops would be trained more to work in conjunction with such support.</div>
