While the simplest solution is often the best one, you can't take that as an assumption.  The most effective solution is one that suits the situation and is reasonably simple to execute, but you don't necessarily fall back on automatic drills.<br><br>Case in point: I was in a four-man recce team on a BTEC exercise against a Guards unit.  As the last man to cross a track, I just started making my way across when three Guards Rovers came round the corner.  I dived behind the bush where the rest of my team was and the Rovers stopped on the other side of the bush.  We were most likely outnumbered, and the simple and stupid thing to do would have been to get out of Dodge right quick.  On the other hand, if the Guardsmen decided to come after us, it would all be over.<br><br>I sent two guys a few metres to the right while I and the remaining team member laid down fire, and I started shouting, "Section 2, right flank!".  The other two guys waited a few seconds and strated laying down their own fire.  Once we finished one magazine each, we headed for the hills.  After getting about half a click away, we checked back just in time to see an umpire pop smoke, simulating arty.<br><br>What I pulled wasn't the simplest solution, but I still reckon we'd have been done like dinner if we simply ran.  By scamming the other side into thinking they were facing a platoon strength and getting them to delay by calling arty instead, we bought enough time to get out without getting hassled.</div>

Very spec ops in my opinion.</div>

If you were talking about SWG or whatever their equivalent of SOF is, I'd say yes, but otherwise it's not really unconventional enough to count as special ops.<br><br>At the end of the day it's a big grey area.  In "In the Combat Zone: Special Forces Since 1945", Robin Neillands suggests one system of classification that would include special forces (including units like the Rangers and Paras) and special operating forces (including units such as the SAS and Green Berets).  In fact, Neillands lists both CDO and NDU as special forces units operated by Singapore in the appendix of his book.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just read Jane's Special forces recognition guide and they list Singapore Commando Battalion as a special forces outfit.<br><br>NDU A and B (combat) as well. So i believe there are exceptions in CDO and NDU.</div>
