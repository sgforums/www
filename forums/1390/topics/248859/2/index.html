By that measure alone the SAF cannot afford to do what all-regular armies do, i.e. avoid direct intakes into their paratrooper units.  Have you seen the conscript model do Israel any harm?<br><br>If it's not about the training, what is it about?  Are you going to take your chances with nature and pray for a bumper crop of supermen each and every year?  Personally, I'd go with factors that I can control and focus on implementing a training system that produces the best results regardless of the material that you start with.<br><br>I've said it many times before - plenty of men from other units can outrun, outjump and out-situp Commandos.  On the other hand, put a Commando and an infantryman side-by-side, have them charlie-mike for 96 hours and then get them to solve a tactical problem, and then you'll see the difference.  Sure, both will be tired, but betting odds are that the Commando will be less vulnerable to the "shack cannot think" syndrome.  I don't care if you can run a four-minute mile - if you can't think at the end of that four minutes, you're still as useless as teats on a bull.<br><br>Guess what?  The difference doesn't lie in what either man was like when he enlisted.  Instead, one would have been pushed to the limit in training while the other would not - it's that simple.  I used to be astounded by hearing men from other units (which I won't name) KPKB about doing two rehearsals before an exercise.  We used to do 25 rehearsals, covering all the different permutations and combinations of casualties and remaining teams, before each exercise, and these guys are complaining about having to do it a second time?<br><br>You're right, Chan - it's simply the training that makes the difference.  Hell, right from enlistment day the instructors used to give an evil grin and say, "You <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can</span> be trained".  If you think that the raw material is more important than the training, you really don't understand the job at all.<br><br>As for CDO not being SF, well, duh.  We're light infantry with airborne capability and we always have been, just like the US Rangers and British Paras.  I don't know where you get the idea that we're SF.</div></blockquote>Gedanken, I understand our conscript army and our limitations. That doesn't stop me from being worried at all.<br><br>As for training what I thought would be best was they take the cream of the crop and train them to be even better, not take some ordinary conscripts and train them to be commandos. I.e. Take the best of the conscripts and train them. From what I see now CDO selection is 100% random. (though of course, I am speculating)<br><br>Maybe our logistics simply cannot handle the selection process.</div>

Because it brings back images from this movie called Soldier by Kurt Russell a number of years back.

The civil service sucks in whoever is good ACADEMICALLY. There are different needs in the various diff ministries so being academically good (even under the current guise of being good in both academics and CCA) may not be enough. Whereas for the CDO selection and qualification, the CDOs (more or less) got the type of people with the mentality that they want.

Another guy was the inter-school hurdles champ - he lasted about eight weeks.<br><br>On the other hand, most of the guys I marched out with on 19 June 1993 were nothing special to begin with.  Two and a half years earlier, many of us couldn't make a 2.4 in less than 11 minutes, but we all ended up doing it in less than 8:45, and they're a damned sight tougher than the guys who could run 9:45 on enlistment day.

The nature of commando-type work is that betting odds are that the chips will be down - think Bastogne, the Suez canal and Wireless Ridge.  In that kind of situation, the most important, if not only, quality needed is that the fellow next to you has to be there doing what he's supposed to be doing.</div>
