Life is not about having a glorious and exciting military life, just as youths in other countries without a conscript military grew up to be fine men who contributed to their countries and the world. You have to get this clear first. Once you get this clear, then proceed.<br><br>Why do people hate NS. Not all but most. Its true, they hate NS. NS represents a platform to challenge your taste for combat. Its like having that perfect cup of coffee. Some like it bitter, some like it sweet. Too sweet, and you get bored, and you wanna die. Too bitter, and....you wana die. Just right, and you will want to come back for more. Now, in CDO, your life will be more exciting than Infantry or Engineers, and that's a fact. Some will grdually develope this taste for that excitement, they leave the army with a sense of pride and accomplishment no words can describe, but a handful will leave with a body full of injuries and bitterness no one else can understand.<br><br>If you are thinking about when people drop out, that is the wrong thing to keep in your head if you want it bad. The key is to give it all, do not have any reservations, and do what you are told. Keyword: OBEY.<br><br>The CDO training is divided into several phases lasting a few months each, with the exception of airborne course. Time to operational is about 1 year. You will experience hell in the first 6 months, you will learn to live in hell, joke in hell, laugh in hell, make friends for life in hell, and miss hell. Then when you come to operational, you will still be in hell, with more levels to choose from. But from it all you will discover you human physical limits. It's kinda fun and interesting, especially with that mass puking session.....hahahahah. Oh and you will have to clean up after that.<br><br>Talking about this makes me wanna go back and sharpen my ontario knife.</div>

You did not have the luxury to choose to take up the mission and therefore when you achieved the objective, you were just obeying orders. Right?<br><br>As for hell.....well, seriously, when I was immersed in that environment, I could not find anyone who would disagree with me.

And when I came back I was sort of seen as an outcast and despised by some more popular figures. My only contribution was as a pacer in Brunei for my coy. For the whole week. It was sick, I couldn't stop counting. I even counted the number of times I put the spoon in my mouth when I ate. Oh and I was designated camel too.<br><br>Gedanken, what was your designation, what did you do, and what were you good at?</div>
