              <p>the moral of this tragic story is : BE A TOTAL WEAKO, A TOTAL WIMP, when you enlist for NS. meaning that DO NOT GO TO ANY GYM or play any sports during your poly / JC years. this way, you'll be a scrawny, nerdy, wimpy nerd when you go to CMPB and BMT, which is good.</p>
              <p>then, after NS, you can be a strong guy again.</p>
              <p>getting sent to CDO, Guards or any battalion unit during NS isn't worth it.</p>
