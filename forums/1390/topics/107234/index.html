            <div class='col-md body'>Maintenance units operate slightly differently in terms of unit culture and mission statement.They are just that slightly more oriented towards a customer-first culture and behave somewhat as a military-run entity with commercial-like goals.Productivity and efficiency is championed but the biggest stumbling block to lofty ideals is the fact that you cannot expect private-sector performance from "employees" who are paid peanuts.NSF officers are closer to the WOSEs because they are often of the same age as the guys.Rank and hierarchy closer to the WOs than the PSOs, plus the fact that they are new and need mentoring.</div>

I guess that is why the MWO saluted the 2LT then..<br><br>I saw before during a NO.1 parade the SWO typically yell and screw the 2LTs who were marching with the colors... no give face.. things should change. i mean its time specs WOs and Officers work collaboratively in a parallel partnership fashion rather than top down.<br><br>All are human beings... if treated properly I sincerely believe everyone will put in their best. Even if a spec decides to leave the service, the commitment and drive to excel will prepare him for the outside world, so nothing to lose at all. I knew a spec then who was a highly motivated person and was well liked by his peers and officers. even though he planned to leave the service, his commander was willing to make an effort to land him a job via his personal contacts! cool <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
