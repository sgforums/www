Might as well promote MSG directly to 2LT rite?<br><br>But i certainly agree that the WOs deserve respect for their experience in their particular fields and i believe the majority of officers feel the same way too.

They run parallel with warrant officers but instead of being subject matter experts, they perform more of management roles. They are still of lower rank than officers though. wonder if this LDO concept can be applied in SAF  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
