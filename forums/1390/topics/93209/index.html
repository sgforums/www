            <div class='col-md body'>hehe... reminds me of my fond stories...<br><br>becoz of the 8 men bunk in School Of Artillery when i was doing my Pro Term... 2 beds were joint together... so at night, after lights out, my buddy would continue to talk on the phone, then i would disturb him... by goin under his blanket, eavesdropping on him (of course he knows and he will start his trademark giggling)... so damn funny... then sometimes at night i would just suddenly pull away his blanket... and expose him... hahaha... and then sometimes we would wrestle too... haha... i gave him the DUO(2) MING(1) JIAN(3) DAO(1) JIAO(1) and have his head pinned in between my legs... hahaha...<br><br>I would say that my bunk was the most havoc one... during the last few weeks of pro-term, we had pillow fights in bunk after lights out. Our friends would then asked us next morning what happened in our bunk coz they heard noises... Managed to trick one fellow into thinking that we're abt to go pillow wallop someone from the opposite bunk, and then we locked him outside... hahahahaha...<br><br>Man, those were the days...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My only Army "buddy" (as commonly defined) was the one I had in BMT. He could do 28 chin-ups &amp; run a 10:05 2.4km, but got graded PES C1 like the rest of us cuz he must've stood only 1.49 metres tall. Absolutely cannot clear the SOC low wall on his own! I ended up constantly sharing the detail with him, giving him a leg-up &amp; pushing his butt over every time. Never saw him again after Tekong.<br><br>I also hit it off warmly with this budding singer who was in my platoon section. He was already signed to a record company, &amp; thus was a bit of an informal White Horse in Delta Coy. How chummy were we? Enough to arrange for me to "date" his then-fellow shi mei, Delphine Cai, for our POP function - had to fight off a lot of platoon suitors for the honor. Delphine Cai is better known as Cai Xing Juan, the petite Taiwanese songbird. Yup, that's how old I am! ~lol~<br><br>Anyways, when I started vocation-training onwards, there's no more "buddy-buddying". It's more about "kaki-kakiying", whether it's in camp, out in the field, or going to tea dances/discos on weekend bookouts.</div>
