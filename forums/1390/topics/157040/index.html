Their girlfriends would get angry over their bfs not calling every night (they never heard of night training, I guess), their bfs not going out with them on weekends (they've never heard of extras and guard duties, I suppose).... the list goes on.<br><br>Besides, for every failed relationship, I also see relationships which grew stronger because of NS. As they say, absence makes the heart grow fonder, and this did apply to the relationships of some of my other friends.<br><br>Bottom line... it's not a matter of whether or not NS is the reason for the breaking-up of a relationship. Rather, it's a matter of how you react to the difficulty of having NS in the equation.<br><br>If the girl thinks that she can't live with having the guy stuck in NS, then seriously, the guy deserves better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to: ahkico<br><br>i share the same feelings for you.<br><br>well, bf in Tekong  for BMT.. today is his 6th day there. I don't know. I think i am matured enough to know what i want in a relationship. I believe he is faithful and me too. And yeah i am not an  A level student as mentioned in the other post that A level girls tend to be unfaithful. But yeah you guys might say, Uni girls also can be unfaithful mah! I think people at my age date seriously as compared to people of the JC age (this is my personal opinion). Breaking up isn't just 2 words. It really involves a lot of pain, tears and time. You enjoy breaking up meh? i don't unless something is really wrong with the relationship.<br><br>NS i believe will make my dear more sensitive and responsible. I do believe the changes will be good.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i was a jc guy.. in fact last yr im still one. so, naturally i heard lots of jc gals who ran away, or break off.<br><br>first of all.. i will take the assumption of 'jc gals always break off with guys during ns' true.<br><br>now, have u ever put in mind. why will the relationship with these young ladies b more fragile as compared to poly or other counterparts?<br>to acknowledge this problem, u have to look into the background of these ppl.<br>of course i'm one of those sad souls who r now unattached. i will still speak for them into some extent. those ex-jc girls, are normally in universities, working part-time when their bf are in army. so as to say, they are actually proceeding with another stage of their life. a stage of life when they begin to realise what theyy wan and dun wan. university is often the place where ppl meet their lifelong partner.<br>and when u are getting on with ur life. in this newly unexplored, more advanced level. u bound to see guys who have better qualities, character.. who have matured tru the yrs and the ns-term. these young man who just ord-ed normally have in mind what they want. they normally have a greater insight than man who haven't served.<br><br>jc relationships are often like not as sturdy.<br>becoz, u know that u will still have another level to carry up to. and  yes, u need someone to share the pain and tears of studying with u, so when u find someone who matches u. why not?<br><br>pardon me for my stereotyping and over-generalising.<br>but on the other hand, the poly girls having a more sturdy relationship.<br>why? becoz they are still in an unchanged environment... whereas they r still in poly. the ppl are more or less.. the same lv. environment is still status quo.<br>even for poly graduates, more or less.. the relationship is expected to last into working environment. which is normally hostile to fresh bloods. simply becoz of the age-difference in ppl. which keeps these young adults to their own clique. and it is harder to penetrate into the hearts of these pppl.<br><br>another thing is... just like dilution<br>u put ppl into the society, it is 'harder' for ppl to match. becoz of the age difference. company size. the approachability of ppl.<br>in U its difference la.. in the same fac there are just hundreds. which u see daily... there's orientation.. cca. most important of all .. it's a new environment..<br><br>just my 5 cent worth.<br></div>
