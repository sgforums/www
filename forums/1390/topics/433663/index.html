              <p>Friday September 24, 2004, 8:17 PM<br> Commandos trial: Witness relates dunking death of soldier<br> <br> <br> SINGAPORE: A witness has told a subordinate court hearing the death
                                          of Second Sergeant Hu Enhuai he saw the 19-year-old struggling
                                          violently as his head was being dunked into the tub of water.<br> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Sergeant Hu was a Guards sniper</strong></span> who died after attending a "Prisoner
                                          of War" training session at Pulau Tekong last year.<br> <br> Yen Li Khai, who was a National Service infantry sergeant sent to
                                          the Commando camp to help conduct the Combat Survival Training
                                          Course at that time, said Sergeant Hu's hands were held down to
                                          prevent him from struggling and his head was held underwater for up
                                          to 20 seconds each time.<br> <br> Sergeant Yen, who is now studying in Australia, also said <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">he was
                                          shocked by how the Commando trainers treated Hu and Captain Ho Wan
                                          Huo.</span></strong><br> <br> He said the <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Commando trainers treated these two trainees much more
                                          harshly than any of the other trainees.</span></strong><br> <br> Sergeant Yen's job during the training was to blindfold and bind
                                          the hands of the trainees who were "prisoners of war" and to escort
                                          them to the water treatment area where the trainees would be
                                          interrogated by the Commando trainers.<br> <br> Sergeant Yen said he was about 15 to 20 metres away from the tub
                                          used to dunk them.<br> <br> He testified that he saw Lieutenant Ng Chin Fong push and hold
                                          Sergeant Hu's head underwater for 10 to 20 seconds.<br> <br> Sergeant Yen said: "He (Hu) stuggled violently. After that, he was
                                          brought out of the water for about four to five seconds before his
                                          head was submerged again. During the time his head was lifted out
                                          of the water, the deceased was gasping for air."<br> <br> Sergeant Yen continued: "He was breathing heavily when his head was
                                          lifted above the water. When the deceased completed the session,
                                          Lieutenant Jeff pulled the deceased out of the tub and the deceased
                                          fell to the ground.<br> <br> "The deceased was motionless and I saw water coming out of his
                                          mouth. The deceased was vomiting water from his mouth."<br> <br> As for the other trainee Captain Ho Wan Huo who survived but almost
                                          drowned, Sergent Yen said Lieutenant Divanand Hari had covered his
                                          mouth, nose and eyes and then pushed his head into
                                          underwater.<br> <br> During the course of the evidence, the prosecution brought in a
                                          dummy blindfolded and hands tied behind the back for Sergeant Yen
                                          to demonstrate to the court how the dunking of Sergeant Hu and
                                          Captain Ho had been done.<br> <br> However, the family members of Sergeant Hu were not in court to
                                          witness the demonstration.<br> <br> Under cross-examination, Sergeant Yen said there were other
                                          instructors helping Lieutenant Diva during the water treatment
                                          component of the survival training.<br> <br> Sergeant Yen added that another accused person, Captain Pandiaraj,
                                          was at the scene and he could have stopped the instructors from
                                          continuing the treatment. - CNA</p>

                                      terrified during dunking exercise</strong></span></span><br> By Dominique Loh, Channel NewsAsia<br> <br> SINGAPORE : Captain Huo Wan Ho, who was nearly drowned by the
                                      commando trainers during the ill-fated Combat Survival Course, was
                                      screaming in fear and gasping for air as he was being dunked.<br> <br> Third Sergeant Ong Chin Wei who was helping with the course said
                                      this on day 7 of the trial of four commando trainers.<br> <br> The four are accused of nearly drowning the captain and causing the
                                      death of another trainee, Second Sergeant Hu Enhuai.<br> <br> Sergeant Ong was the enemy in the survival course and Captain Ho
                                      Wan Huo was his prisoner of war.<br> <br> The trainees were made to line up to wait their turn for the water
                                      treatment.<br> <br> And Sergeant Ong says the commando instructors picked Captain Ho
                                      from the back of the line and brought him to the front.<br> <br> The sergeant's task was to escort Captain Ho to the water tank to
                                      be interrogated by the commandos.<br> <br> Third Sergeant Ong Chin Wei is the second witness to testify what
                                      he saw during the water treatment phase of the course.<br> <br> He had only seen the water treatment on Captain Ho.<br> <br> He said what he saw had frightened him.<br> <br> He had also demonstrated in court using a dummy and a water tub how
                                      Captain Ho was immersed during the water treatment.<br> <br> The sergeant testified that Captain Ho was blindfolded, his hands
                                      tied behind his back - and was then dunked 6 times.<br> <br> The commando instructors, he said, seemed very enthusiastic.<br> <br> In stark contrast Captain Ho, he said was very frightened and was
                                      screaming and gasping for air.<br> <br> The sergeant, who is a former classmate of Hu En Huai - the trainee
                                      who died - however did not see the commandos dunk Hu.<br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The court also heard that this is not the first dunking death in
                                      the military - there was another case back in 1976.</strong></span> - CNA</p>
