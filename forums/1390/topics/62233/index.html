            <div class='col-md body'><br>Have you ever wondered if your buddy or another recruit in your platoon was a "white horse"?<br><br>To many people it seemed strange that the armed forces would single out a small group of soldiers to make sure that they are treated like everyone else.<br><br>And there were widespread suspicion the "white horse" scheme was being abused and these enlistees were actually being given special treatment.<br><br>Mr Cedric Foo, Minister of State for Defence, said: "Anywhere in society, there will be people who are more prone to boot-licking, but let me say it is not a quality in the SAF. And no commanders who may misinterprete this system although it doesnt exist now and we don't look too highly upon."<br><br>But the Defence Ministry has again defended the "white horse" label.<br><br>Especially since in the early days there were more combat-fit soldiers than the army needed.<br><br>Mr Foo added: "Some of these combat-fit soldiers would be deployed into non-combat positions. So in order there isn't this perception that sons of influential Singaporeans are posted to these softer options, the SAF went through a long-thought process to define who may influence such NS vocation assignments."<br><br>So since the late 1970s, the armed forces had a system to identify and monitor "white horses" based on who their parents were, what jobs they held, and how much they earned.<br><br>But just who are these "white horses" and how are they identified? According to a MINDEF directive, there are four categories of "white horses".<br><br>Mr Foo said: "They include sons of ministers, members of parliament, ex-ministers, ex-MPs, nominated MPs, ex-NMPs, doctors, senior civil servants like senior SAF officers above the rank of LTC. Or senior police or SCDF officers above the rank of Deputy Assistant Commissioner and also a big group of people who earn $9,500 a month."<br><br>But instead of perks and easier training, the Defence Ministry said there was even greater scrutiny when these "white horses" had to be downgraded for medical reasons.<br><br>And there was a rule that "white horses" could not be posted to desk jobs at MINDEF.<br><br>Yet the system was scrapped in 2000.<br><br>The Defence Ministry said it was just not cost-effective to have a system to track such a small group. - CNA<br><br>[/quote]<br><br>so desnu! veri ez to be a WH it seems!</div>
