              <p><span>From 1 Sep 2012, camera mobile phones will be permitted in
              designated areas within 14 Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) camps as
              part of a pilot security zoning programme.</span></p>
              <p>Selected for the high volume of Operationally-Ready National
              Servicemen (NSmen) and full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) who
              pass through for training or administration, these include camps
              that house fitness conditioning centres, training institutes, the
              Central Manpower Base and Basic Military Training Centre.</p>
              <p>Areas in camps where camera mobile phones are allowed are termed
              Green Zones, though the existing security stance on photography
              remains the same. Unless authorised by unit commanders for special
              events such as open houses, graduation parades and cohesion
              activities, photography is prohibited. Examples of Green Zones
              include medical centres, accommodation bunks and cookhouses.</p>
              <p>Within the Red Zones, which are areas where sensitive and
              classified information is present, camera mobile phones are not
              allowed. Before entering a Red Zone, camera mobile phones must be
              deposited in lockers. Examples of Red Zones include units'
              operation rooms and offices with computer access to classified
              information.</p>
              <p>The pilot programme was implemented for the convenience of
              servicemen, and because of the proliferation of smart phones,
              according to Chief of Staff-General Staff Brigadier-General Tung
              Yui Fai, who announced this initiative at the Infantry Training
              Institute (ITI) on 31 Aug.</p>
              <p>He added: "This security zoning allows us to better secure areas
              we think we need to protect better. At the same time, it allows
              flexibility and convenience for our servicemen who operate within
              the camp."</p>
              <p>Enhanced security measures will be in place at the Red Zones.
              Where practical, a perimeter fence will be erected to demarcate the
              Red from the Green Zones; clear signboards will be prominently
              displayed at the entrance of a Red Zone, and digital locks and
              close-circuit cameras will be installed for added security.</p>
              <p>Only camera mobile phones are allowed in this pilot programme,
              which will last for six to nine months before a review is
              conducted. Tablets such as iPads, laptops and digital cameras are
              still prohibited.</p>
              <p>For NSman 3rd Sergeant (3SG) (NS) Lavin Achudan, a
              marketing manager with Johnson &amp; Johnson who uses an iPhone 4S
              to access his work emails, being able to bring his camera phone
              into camp eases his workload. Previously, he would borrow his
              brother’s basic NOKIA phone when he had to go for his In-Camp
              Training.</p>
              <p>"As a marketing manager, I have to constantly reply to emails
              from my sales team and customers, and replying emails in the
              shortest time possible is my highest priority. Allowing me to bring
              my iPhone to camp allows me to communicate with my customers
              efficiently, and that is very important to me," said the platoon
              sergeant of 731st Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment.
               </p>
              <p>"When I am not training, I can reply to these emails
              immediately, as opposed to having to wait till I book out at night
              to reply to emails. It allows me to reply whenever I have time...
              It's about the convenience of being able to bring in a phone which
              I always use, which happens to have a camera," added the
              28-year-old.</p>
              <p>Echoing this sentiment is 20-year-old NSF 2nd Lieutenant
              (2LT) Kok Chun Hou, who is a curriculum coordinator at ITI. He
              uses a basic NOKIA phone in camp and an iPhone 3GS outside of
              camp.</p>
              <p>Citing some inconveniences of using two phones, such as having
              to input contacts into both phones, 2LT Kok said: "This current NSF
              generation grew up in the IT age; it's our habit to stay connected.
              We live, work and play differently from previous generations, so
              connectivity is very important to us."</p>
              <p>"I would also use my smart phone for personal banking and
              stock-investing. With the implementation of the pilot scheme, I now
              have the option of just stepping out of the office to use my smart
              phone," he said.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>==============================================================</strong></em></span></p>
              <p><span>For the convenience of our servicemen, the Singapore Armed
              Forces (SAF) will be implementing a pilot security zoning programme
              across 14 selected SAF camps. Under the pilot security zoning
              programme, these 14 camps will be segregated into two distinct
              zones: Red and Green Zone.</span></p>
              <p><span>From 1 Sep 2012, servicemen will be allowed to carry
              camera equipped mobile phones into the Green Zones of the 14
              selected SAF camps. For servicemen who need to enter the Red Zone,
              they must deposit their camera equipped mobile phones at designated
              lockers prior to entry.</span></p>
              <p>Photography in all SAF camp premises for both Red and Green
              Zones remain prohibited unless expressedly allowed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) will be implementing a
              pilot security zoning programme across 14 selected SAF camps on 1
              Sep 2012. These 14 selected SAF camps will be segregated into
              either Red or Green Zone. Servicemen will be allowed to carry
              camera equipped mobile phones in the Green Zones. Possession of
              camera equipped mobile phone is prohibited in Red Zones. Before
              entering a Red Zone, servicemen who possess a camera equipped
              mobile phone are required to deposit them at the provided
              lockers.<br> <br> <strong>Red Zones.</strong> Areas where sensitive and classified
              information and equipment are processed and managed. These areas
              may include server rooms, unit operation rooms, and offices with
              computer access to sensitive information. All other areas outside
              the Red Zone will be designated as Green Zones. Some examples of
              Green Zone areas are medical centres, accommodation bunks and
              cookhouses.<br> <br> Enhanced security measures will be implemented in the Red Zone.
              Wherever practical, a perimeter fence will be established to
              segregate the Red and Green Zones. Clear warning signboards will be
              prominently displayed at the entrance to inform servicemen that
              they are about to enter a Red Zone. Digital locks will also be
              installed to control access into the Red Zones. CCTVs with images
              wired to the unit operations room will also be installed at
              selected locations within the Red Zone.<br> <br> Photography in all SAF camp premises continues to be prohibited
              regardless of the zone.<br></span></p>

              <p>You must understand the rationale behind this mah. common sense.</p>
              <p>It was never about the camera, but rather, to open up more choices for handphones for army personnels.</p>
              <p>What are the 'good' phones nowadays, with 3.5g and at the same time come with non-cam? Virtually none.</p>
              <p>Nowadays, army people only carry 3 sorts of phones:</p>
              <p>1) Those cheap nokia non-cam phones</p>
              <p>2) HTC snap. Its a damn old model by now.</p>
              <p>3) Blackberry Bold. also a damn old model.</p>
              <p>What will happen when one day these 2 manufacturers decided to stop making non-cam smartphones? Everyone from top to bottom revert back to using nokias?</p>
              <p>It is very hard to maintain that you are a 3G army, when you are forced to rely on 2G phones. haha</p>

              <p>You must understand the rationale behind this mah. common

              <p>It was never about the camera, but rather, to open up more
              choices for handphones for army personnels.</p>
              <p>What are the 'good' phones nowadays, with 3.5g and at the same
              time come with non-cam? Virtually none.</p>
              <p>Nowadays, army people only carry 3 sorts of phones:</p>
              <p>1) Those cheap nokia non-cam phones</p>
              <p>2) HTC snap. Its a damn old model by now.</p>
              <p>3) Blackberry Bold. also a damn old model.</p>
              <p>What will happen when one day these 2 manufacturers decided to
              stop making non-cam smartphones? Everyone from top to bottom revert
              back to using nokias?</p>
              <p>It is very hard to maintain that you are a 3G army, when you are
              forced to rely on 2G phones. haha</p>

              <p>Here's a thought: many of us here went through their NS liability <em>without</em> smartphones. Want to surf the internet? Then use the unit's computer room if you have access to it. Or wait for the next bookout. </p>
              <p>If the thought of buying a cheap phone for camp use gives you pause, then please consider that you <em>do</em> need a cheap backup handphone anyway. After all, if your smartphone breaks down, what will you use for calls? My cheap Nokia is not just for Army use; I also use it during the times my smartphone broke down.</p>
              <p>Anyway, what would the common soldier do with a smartphone in the middle of the jungle? Having a 3G army is one thing, but it does not mean having all-3G equipment. Which is why such a huge collective facepalm happened when the news that recruits would get iPads broke out.</p>
              <p>We all got along just fine with GSM. There's no reason why everyone must die die go for 3G.</p>
              <p>Besides, getting an ah beng handphone seller to surgically excise your camera is not easy, not cheap, and you run the risk of ruining your own warranty. Good luck to all those who want to walk this route.</p>

              <p>Yes, you do need to have a back up phone that is cheap when your smartphone fails.</p>
              <p>However, it is only intended as a back up. You still stick to using your smartphone most of the time.</p>
              <p>Many of you went through NS w/o smartphones, and that's simply because smartphones aren't prevalent in people's life back then. Singapore society nowadays expect people to be connected all the time, and phones have to evolve beyond texting and calling. It is unrealistic and also unfair to demand a very significant group of people to cut themselves off from normal mainstream technology.</p>
              <p>It is regressive to ask nsfs to use the unit computer room or to wait until the next bookout, if he wishes to use internet. It is very much the same as your parents insisting on you to finish dinner, complete yoour homework, before allowing you to use the internet.</p>
              <p>NS is already a sacrifice of personal freedom, where a person has to commit for a duration of 2 yrs. We should not impose further deprivation of basic rights such as the access to common technology.</p>
              <p>A cheap phone is useful when undergo training in rough conditions, such as outfield, where you probably do not want to risk damaging your more precious smartphone. But face it, how often do you have such trainings that would necessitate you to even bring a phone out to the field?</p>
              <p>The trouble of maintaining 2 phones is the hassle of switching sim cards. It might still be alright for the average NSF, who only bookout once every week, and only have to change to his smartphone once, and only for the duration of 2yrs.</p>
              <p>What about those who does not stay-in, or those who work in an office environment?</p>
              <p>This group of people also includes regulars, DXOs and other non-saf support staff, i.e. canteen staff, cleaners, maintenance workers etc. These are people who are employed on long term basis, and often their job nature does not entails rough conditions, and thus, other than cost, there is no reason why they should not be allowed access to smartphones.</p>
              <p><strong>We all got along just fine with GSM. There's no reason why
                                      everyone must die die go for 3G.</strong></p>
              <p>That is a regressive mindset. Going by that logic, people of the previous generation all got along just fine with books, phones and typewriters, and therefore there too is no reason why everyone must die die go for computers and internet.</p>
              <p>It is no longer acceptable today to be technological laggards. With the world already moving on to 4G mobile technology, it is unacceptable for a person, regardless of whether he's a civilian or military personnel, to be confined to outdated 2G and 3G technology.</p>
