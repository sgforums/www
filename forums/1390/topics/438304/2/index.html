              <p>Which is what I've been saying, but some people don't seem to get the point.</p>
              <p>Seriously, an el cheapo phone from 7 Eleven works well for everyone and can go a full week without charging.</p>
              <p>They also tend to be more resistant to damage and less likely to be stolen (because they're just not worth stealing).</p>
              <p>But those of you who insist on performing surgery on your smartphones, go ahead. Just be clear that you do so at your own risk, and your warranty will definitely be voided.</p>

              LOA letter of authorization allows one to bring camera phone to camp within period of time. (Get from Mindef or Min. S2 - If your uncle is one of them)
              Thats explain why OC, CSM and above can use camera phone (If they have LOA). Admin clerk from S1-4 can obtain if S2 staff officer gives.
              BUT LOA never allow people to use camera phone on DUTY so never get caught in DUTY.

              <p><span>From 1 Sep 2012, camera mobile phones will be permitted in
              designated areas within 14 Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) camps as
              part of a pilot security zoning programme.</span></p>
              <p>Selected for the high volume of Operationally-Ready National
              Servicemen (NSmen) and full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) who
              pass through for training or administration, these include camps
              that house fitness conditioning centres, training institutes, the
              Central Manpower Base and Basic Military Training Centre.</p>
              <p>Areas in camps where camera mobile phones are allowed are termed
              Green Zones, though the existing security stance on photography
              remains the same. Unless authorised by unit commanders for special
              events such as open houses, graduation parades and cohesion
              activities, photography is prohibited. Examples of Green Zones
              include medical centres, accommodation bunks and cookhouses.</p>
              <p>Within the Red Zones, which are areas where sensitive and
              classified information is present, camera mobile phones are not
              allowed. Before entering a Red Zone, camera mobile phones must be
              deposited in lockers. Examples of Red Zones include units'
              operation rooms and offices with computer access to classified
              information.</p>
              <p>The pilot programme was implemented for the convenience of
              servicemen, and because of the proliferation of smart phones,
              according to Chief of Staff-General Staff Brigadier-General Tung
              Yui Fai, who announced this initiative at the Infantry Training
              Institute (ITI) on 31 Aug.</p>
              <p>He added: "This security zoning allows us to better secure areas
              we think we need to protect better. At the same time, it allows
              flexibility and convenience for our servicemen who operate within
              the camp."</p>
              <p>Enhanced security measures will be in place at the Red Zones.
              Where practical, a perimeter fence will be erected to demarcate the
              Red from the Green Zones; clear signboards will be prominently
              displayed at the entrance of a Red Zone, and digital locks and
              close-circuit cameras will be installed for added security.</p>
              <p>Only camera mobile phones are allowed in this pilot programme,
              which will last for six to nine months before a review is
              conducted. Tablets such as iPads, laptops and digital cameras are
              still prohibited.</p>
              <p>For NSman 3rd Sergeant (3SG) (NS) Lavin Achudan, a
              marketing manager with Johnson &amp; Johnson who uses an iPhone 4S
              to access his work emails, being able to bring his camera phone
              into camp eases his workload. Previously, he would borrow his
              brother’s basic NOKIA phone when he had to go for his In-Camp
              Training.</p>
              <p>"As a marketing manager, I have to constantly reply to emails
              from my sales team and customers, and replying emails in the
              shortest time possible is my highest priority. Allowing me to bring
              my iPhone to camp allows me to communicate with my customers
              efficiently, and that is very important to me," said the platoon
              sergeant of 731st Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment.
               </p>
              <p>"When I am not training, I can reply to these emails
              immediately, as opposed to having to wait till I book out at night
              to reply to emails. It allows me to reply whenever I have time...
              It's about the convenience of being able to bring in a phone which
              I always use, which happens to have a camera," added the
              28-year-old.</p>
              <p>Echoing this sentiment is 20-year-old NSF 2nd Lieutenant
              (2LT) Kok Chun Hou, who is a curriculum coordinator at ITI. He
              uses a basic NOKIA phone in camp and an iPhone 3GS outside of
              camp.</p>
              <p>Citing some inconveniences of using two phones, such as having
              to input contacts into both phones, 2LT Kok said: "This current NSF
              generation grew up in the IT age; it's our habit to stay connected.
              We live, work and play differently from previous generations, so
              connectivity is very important to us."</p>
              <p>"I would also use my smart phone for personal banking and
              stock-investing. With the implementation of the pilot scheme, I now
              have the option of just stepping out of the office to use my smart
              phone," he said.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>==============================================================</strong></em></span></p>
              <p><span>For the convenience of our servicemen, the Singapore Armed
              Forces (SAF) will be implementing a pilot security zoning programme
              across 14 selected SAF camps. Under the pilot security zoning
              programme, these 14 camps will be segregated into two distinct
              zones: Red and Green Zone.</span></p>

              selected SAF camps. For servicemen who need to enter the Red Zone,
              they must deposit their camera equipped mobile phones at designated

              camera equipped mobile phones in the Green Zones. Possession of
              camera equipped mobile phone is prohibited in Red Zones. Before
              entering a Red Zone, servicemen who possess a camera equipped
              mobile phone are required to deposit them at the provided
              lockers.<br> <br> <strong>Red Zones.</strong> Areas where sensitive and classified

              may include server rooms, unit operation rooms, and offices with
              computer access to sensitive information. All other areas outside
              the Red Zone will be designated as Green Zones. Some examples of
              Green Zone areas are medical centres, accommodation bunks and
              cookhouses.<br> <br> Enhanced security measures will be implemented in the Red Zone.
              Wherever practical, a perimeter fence will be established to

              prominently displayed at the entrance to inform servicemen that
              they are about to enter a Red Zone. Digital locks will also be
              installed to control access into the Red Zones. CCTVs with images
              wired to the unit operations room will also be installed at
