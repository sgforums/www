              <p>Hi.</p>
              <p><br>I am currently a pre-enlistee, waiting to enlist on June 5th. I have developed a foot problem which I suspect is a stress fracture. I only took notice of this as it wasn't really painful from the start (which was 1 1/2 months ago). It got worse ever since I started jogging (to which I have stopped a week ago). When I put pressure on the ball of my right foot, i will feel a sharp pain. Of course, the degree of pain varies with the activities concerned, but even so, basic stuff like walking down a single flight of stairs will cause sharp pain.</p>
              <p>I was worried that it will cause more pain (and permanent damage) if I went through BMT with all the physical aspects on marching, running etc. As such, I was hoping for a temporary downgrade of my PES from BP.</p>
              <p>I have called the CMPB MCC hotline to inform them about this. They recommended that I go see the MO at CMPB with a memo from a specialist instead of going to CMPB empty handed hoping for a referral.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Questions</p>
              <p>1.) How long would a polyclinic referral take, suppose I notify them of the urgency behind this case (not long from conscription) ?</p>
              <p>2.) What is the likely PES classification I would get supposing it is a fracture.</p>
              <p>3.) Will I need to recourse my BMT if I went thru the Modified BMT under a temporary PES C grading?</p>
              <p>4.) Will I make it in time I went to a specialist at CGH straight away?</p>
              <p><br>5.) Will they give me a PES D grading if I approached CMPB first (to obtain a referral)?</p>

              <p><br>1) It's the same waiting time using both options. Unless you walk-in at A&amp;E, priority given but you pay more since you will be billed as private patient.<br><br>2) It's once you get the specialist memo, head down immediately to CMPB to hand in the memo. Most important is the specialist clinic appointment date.</p>

              </p><p class="MsoNormal">Greetings, Sir,<br> <br>       During my BMT, I fell and injured my ankle. I
              went to see my specialist, and he gave me a full cast and said that the injury
              (which he says is a torn ligament) could be due to a loose ankle from the
              pervious, much more serious complete ligament tear injury. My specialist wanted
              to give me a MC, but I felt embarrassed to take it. However, in camp, the itch
              in my cast got very bad, but I managed to brace through till book out (It was
              only three days, as my attend C from my send out lasted till then, and even
              though it was just three days, the inability to bath and itch in my cast was
              getting horrible)<br> <br>       After I booked out, I went to a nearby GP to ask
              for medication for my itch. To my amazement, the GP gave me 6 days of MC (which
              I ready took because I realized that, with my cast, staying in camp was too
              tough); because the GP said that I should rest and elevate my leg to reduce the
              swelling.<br> <br>      This is my first day of attend C and I am getting
              worried. Is a GP's MC valid in NS? Also, regarding the loose ankle, should I
              get my specialist to write a report, or would it be a waste of my money (I may
              have to pay for the report as the specialist is a private specialist)?<br> <br> Thank you, Sir.</p>

              <p>Greetings, Sir,<br><br>      During my BMT, I fell and injured my ankle. I went to see my specialist, and he gave me a full cast and said that the injury (which he says is a torn ligament) could be due to a loose ankle from the pervious, much more serious complete ligament tear injury. My specialist wanted to give me a MC, but I felt embarrassed to take it. However, in camp, the itch in my cast got very bad, but I managed to brace through till book out (It was only three days, as my attend C from my send out lasted till then, and even though it was just three days, the inability to bath and itch in my cast was getting horrible)<br><br>      After I booked out, I went to a nearby GP to ask for medication for my itch. To my amazement, the GP gave me 6 days of MC (which I ready took because I realized that, with my cast, staying in camp was too tough); because the GP said that I should rest and elevate my leg to reduce the swelling.<br><br>     This is my first day of attend C and I am getting worried. Is a GP's MC valid in NS? Also, regarding the loose ankle, should I get my specialist to write a report, or would it be a waste of my money (I may have to pay for the report as the specialist is a private specialist)?<br><br>Thank you, Sir.</p>

              <p>Hi...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since when I was in primary school, I discovered my joints would pop easily. I don't know it this is a condition or what.</p>
              <p>Almost all my joints would pop when I bend it to the limit, especially my knees. Foot on floor, and I try to twist my whole leg, my knee would pop very loudly. Sometimes my joint would feel very tight, and popping releaves the sensation.</p>
              <p>I also have neurofibromatosis, heriditary condition from father's side. Have some<br> neurofibromas on my arms, head and thigh. The thigh one causes pain when I press on it, and sometimes my whole leg goes numb and can't move bcause the tumour is pressing on other nerves. Need few minutes to regain sensation and movement. Also notice half of my face is not as "movable" as the other half. If I smile, my smile is somewhat lobesided unless I make a concious effort to smile on the other side of my face too.</p>
              <p>I'm going in in July. Any recommendations?</p>

              <p>i planned to consult the psychiatrist silently without SAF notice in order to avoid the 'black mark' record by SAF. So I declare i am very healthy. I already consulted the polyclinic doc and obtained a referral letter for an appointment to a psychiatrist from NUH.

So I plan to take a private one and they told me its on May 20 but it is a consultation from a psychiatrist consultant before going to the actual psychiatrist for therapy AGAIN. What I am i gonna do?? I doesn't want NS to know but my enlistment date is coming.. Is it possible to tell the CMPB to delay a 1 or 2 months? Must i really declare? please advise me because i even had a hard time typing this question..</p>

              <p>I don't see why you should worry about people laughing at you having OCD nor why you would hide it from the MO. I don't know why OCD will make it hard for you to even post here since you are unlikely the 1st OCD person or for that matter people with psychological problems who post here for help.</p>
              <p>As eac mentioned, declaring of all medical problems is important. There are too many cases of people didn't declare because they worry about affecting their future, affecting their chances to become officers etc and later lead to more serious problems happening to them due to them not declaring during the initial medical checkup.</p>

              checkup as its coming already (25 may 2009)</p>
              <p>1) im borned with dyslexia and ADD and i got phycologist report
              on it so does that give me a chance to go to a lower pecs?</p>
              <p>2)i am have allgerys to dust mites and have sinest (im so sorry
              i cant spell well) and i undergo operation in the past and the
              surgeon removed one of my nose bones and also means my nose bleed

              <p>3)i got this weird rash since pri 5 and its been on my body (not
              face) and at times it tends to be painful escpailly when theres a
              change in tempreture and its like tons of needles pokeing me. i did
              highlight this to 2 doctors but they cant cure it</p>

              <p>Skin problems most prob u can try going to the National Skin Center for checkup etc and maybe they can give you a letter etc to get you excuse uniform/boots if you want.</p>
              <p>Sinus and allergy is still mostly PES B unless you have a specialist letter that recommends you for stayout if not it won't have much effect i think.</p>
