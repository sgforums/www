              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>Would like to ask about medical subisidies for my case.</p>
              <p>Recently I had a follow up with the doctor at TTSH regarding my high blood pressure and kidney.</p>
              <p>After my 24 urine test it is concluded that the protein content isn't dropping so the doctor asked me to do a renal biopsy.</p>
              <p>I'd be warded for 3 days and I understand I have to pay 20% of the ward charges (C class, not upgrading)</p>
              <p>The nurse broke down the other charges to the biopsy procedure(subsidisable) and lab test/research for the report.</p>
              <p>I both the hospital billing side and the HR side of SAF couldn't give me a clear answer if I will be subsidised for the lab test/research costs as it might be under admin costs which will not be covered by SAF.</p>
              <p>I'd like to get you guys' opinion of whether it will be subsidised or not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'll visit the MO tomorrow to get an opinion too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks in advance!</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I'm supposed to POP in a week's time but just yesterday I fractured my jaw and lost some of my teeth. I was given 14 days MC and if I need to go for an operation, the specialist told me he may need to give me 3 months of light duties. Just wondering, with this condition, how will it affect my posting and PES status?</p>

              winter season. I was wondering if I can get down PES from PES B
              even if I get a skin specialist report or memo?</p>
              <p>Regards,</p>
              <p>Shawn</p>

              <p>Pink book states that this condition will get you C1L3 with excuse physical condition for 6mths. Of coz, i heard some cases get C9L3 with excuse uniform for 6mth too. So it depends on how the memo is written. Good luck to you.</p>

              <p>hi im currently in sispec and have just OOCed from ASLC. I am
                                      pending a temporary down pes to a unkown PES as the MO didnt reveal
                                      to me the pes status. my reason for down pes was due to taking
                                      accutane for my cystic acne as i didnt know it had adverse effects,
                                      what is the most likely pes i would be getting and wat kind of
                                      vocations would it come with and how long will the medical board
                                      take to decide my pes status?</p>
              <p>furthermore after my temp down pes will i be upgraded to my
                                      original pes of B and be revocationed again? and wat would happen
                                      if i were to do my reservist?</p>
              <p>also would this down pes hinder me from being able to get a 3rd
                                      sergeant rank? if not is it possible to ask the mo not to down pes
                                      me that extremely or dont down pes me at all.</p>

              <p><br>Hi, before answering, below is all purely my opinion, which may not be true.</p>
              <p>What I understand is that, as long as you pass out from BSLC successfully, no matter what PES you are in, you will still be able to get to 3SG, because you will already be CPL when you pass out.</p>
              <p>Most likely, you will be just temporary downgraded to PES C since you only consulted a MO, instead of Specialist.</p>
              <p>After you down-PES temporarily, you will be asked to visit the MO again for a further checkup, to see if you have recovered, and if you have, you will be upgraded back to PES B.</p>
              <p>It is up to MO's discretion whether or not to downgrade you. Do not argue or request from MO.</p>
              <p>That's all I know, hopefully someone with more knowledge may be able to assist you.</p>

              <p>If you pass out of BSLC but did not complete your ASLC course, you will still not be eligible for 3SG but just stay CPL all the way. Without completing ASLC, he cannot be a infantry/guards 3SG and there is no way he will be posted to other vocations and go for their spec courses especially since hes temporary downgraded.</p>

              <p>Hi Saab,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have a question here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Im currently having this condition. It is caused by a virus, i think? which many people got no idea what it is, even my MO or some other GP outside. In chinese we call it SNAKE.I have this in my sec sch days, and i got it treated by a chinese sinseh at that time and it got better. now the pain is back again. So what normally happen to me is whenever the sun is hot and strike on my back, or my body temp rises, or i do upper limb and heavy load activity, it will start to ache and i can concentrate at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The thing here now is a lot doctor/ MO dont know what it is and what they merely do was just give me a few days of excuse UL and HL. but afterwhich my pain persist. when i told my commanders about my condition, they do not know what is it either and think that i am geng-ing. and im currently with a specilist in SGH.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would like to know what are the approriate steps i could take</p>
              <p>IF my MO still don't know what to do (because they dont know what snake is),</p>
              <p>IF my specilist do not take any action for me at all apart from physio.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What should I do in this case?</p>

              <p>Since you are seeing a specialist, get him/her to write a strongly worded memo about your condition and submit to the MO. Without a specialist letter, there is nothing else you can do.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>i just wanna ask, if i have a medium to high allergic reaction to grass what pes range would i be in? The specialist has already asked the MO to give me an open date excuse outfield. So i know its most probably a L3 or L9, but what i'm curious about is since i'm still fit ( can do IPPT no EX UL/LL) will it be a C1L3/9 or issit C3L3/9 coz normally i hear ppl talk its like C3L9 or C9L9 so is there also a C1L9? If so, whats the difference between the vocations i'm eligible for between these classifications? Thanks</p>
