The specialist decided to write a letter excusing physical exercise. I went to let MO at Maju camp, place for this RT to have a look. He recommended to downgrade until C9L2.

Now my forehead has this piece of permanent plate covering almost the half of the forehead(think is titanium or something).  I was downgraded to pes E for 3 years and upgraded to PES B recently.  One MO told me I would definitely be pes C then when I go for the MB, they gave me pes B because they can't find anything in the 'secret' list!  Still dare to tell me no guide...<br><br>I am very worried about my forehead as I need to wear helmet during reservist.  I do not want to risk injuring it again.  What should I do?<br><br>I have also another problem with my knee joint for several years since the day I went army.  There will be this sharp pain in my right knee now and then.  Sometimes, I don't encounter this pain for a few months then suddenly the pain will come back.  I am required to carry heavy loads for my vocation.<br><br>Can I be downgraded?  Thanks.</div></blockquote>Your fracture would have healed by now and so that per se is not a reason for downgrading. Wearing a helmet will not cause you further injuries.<br><br>You are a reservist (like me). If your knee problem adversely affects your reservist training, you should see your private orthopaedic surgeon and have it worked up. If your doctor finds something of significance, get a letter from him and report sick at your camp. Whether or not you can be downgraded depends on what you have.</div>

Then if i am in PES B, and this sinus problem does affect my day to day life while training... what can i do? Thanks </blockquote>No, your problem sounds like vasomotor rhinitis rather than a sinusitis. It is very common and I had it throughout my NS too. I got used to it after a while and managed to go through everything, including overseas training. I use the nasal spray initially but there can be a rebound phenomenon when you stop. So I use it only occasionally when I need quick relief. I find Clarinase (a non-sedating antihistamine with pseudoephedrine) quite useful.</div>

Right now I'm diagnosed with anemia due to bleeding in my small intestine. I'll need blood transfusion of 2 units of every 2 weeks or even lesser. The blood is lost via a white patch that covers my small intestine as well as my main blood vessels providing blood to my internal organs from the heart.<br><br>I'm seeing a surgeon at the moment to discuss for a possible operation later this year as the white patches are causing the blood lost. The operation will remove the white patches either partially or fully. As it also covers my blood vessels, I might need to do a en-route of my blood vessels and remove the current wrapped-up blood vessel.<br><br>My low blood count was discovered when I was given a FBC check when I was referred to the A&amp;E department and my blood count dived to 4.7 (normal 12 - 1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. This low blood count gives me occasional headaches, chest-pain and serious dizziness and also being easily out of breath. The cause was only discovered when I underwent intense scans as well as multiple CT scans and eventually found out the exact bleeding area and cause through a MRI scan and scope test with biopsy taken from the bleeding ulcer inside my lower end of my small intestine.<br><br>If I undergo the surgery in a couple of months and return to normal lifestyle, will my health condition be considered during my enlistment ? Because the white patches could grow back again if not fully removed.<br><br>Hopefully someone can clarify my doubts here as I'm pretty confused and my doctor aren't sure how the NS MO will determine my condition.</div></blockquote>Much depends on the pathology of the resected specimen. From your description, it sounds like a vascular malformation of some sort. After the operation, the pathologist (a specialist who will examine the specimen and diagnose the type of tumour or disease) will find out what the problem is. Depending on the diagnosis, the condtion may or may not recur. The pathologist will also be able to tell if the abnormal area has been completely removed by microscopic examination. Based on his report, the SAF MO will then be able to assign you an appropriate PES grading.<br><br></div>

Epilepsy can be controlled with appropriate medication and I wonder why you are having so frequent attacks. I wonder if you are taking your medication correctly. Depending on what your specialist's opinion is, the medical board will decide accordingly or the SAF specialist may wish to examine you himself.<br><br>Gilbert syndrome is a common inherited cause of hyperbilirubinaemia but no treatment is necessary and only supportive care needs to be provided during acute episodes.<br><br>From the sound of it, you have been downgraded already and vocationalized as a storeman, which is appropriate for your condition. It is for your unit and MO to decide if you can be transferred elsewhere but medically speaking, I do not see where your unit is should affect your medical condition.</div>

I am PES A and gonna graduate from poly in march: possibly enlist june or september.<br><br>Replies much greatly appreciated![/b]</blockquote>You'll need a letter from a specialist if you want to appeal the results of the medical classification exercise.<br><br>Since you are not yet enlisted, you need to see your polyclinic or GP for referral to a specialist. An audiologist will assess and certify if you do have hearing loss and the type of hearing loss. Not all such cases can be downgraded. As for night blindness, that should not affect most of your training anyway except for the night shoot, perhaps. But to be honest, I couldn't see a thing during my night range either. Whereever the traces went, I just pointed in the general direction and shoot... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>As for piles, lots of soldiers have it to varying degrees of severity but it should not affect training. If it is severe enough to give you pain, you can have it removed during your holidays to prevent it giving you trouble in the army. Your GP can refer you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi MO.<br><br>I'm currently an nsmen serving my reservist in an SIR unit as a Sect Comd. During my active time, i broke my right master arm during FIBUA training. It was a clean break and I had 2 metal plates and 12 screws inserted on my radius and ulna bones to secure my forearm. I was temp downgraded to C2L2 for 6months till I ord.<br><br>3months later i was sent for a medical board and got a Perm downgrade to C1L1, excused Chin Up and SOC. I have dfficulty twisting the wrists of my arm fully without feeling any discomfort. During my first BCTC, I thought I would be revocated to less demanding role, however I was still asked to as a Sect Comd. During the training, I had to perform normal infantry training but was excused from doing the Battle course.<br><br>I had my metal plates removed a year after the accident. I thought that with the plates removed, I would be able to twist the wrists of my arm as per normal however the discomfort was still there.<br><br>For my subsequent ICTs, I did most of the normal chiong suah stuffs and all but i have been very careful about proning and getting up from prone position using both hands instead of my right hand only as I was afraid I might injure it again. I have not tested it to carry very heavy stuffs or digging of shellscrape and fire trenches yet and i'm wondering whether I'm able to do that when the training requries me to do so.<br><br>Is it advisable for me to further downgrade so that I dont have to do anymore combat duties or should I just continue and just be extra careful during training? I dont mind completing the rest of my reservist as a Sect Comd since its only a couple of days/weeks a year but I sometimes have a phobia that I might injure my arm again during training. Whats your advice?</div>
