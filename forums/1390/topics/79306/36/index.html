            <div class='col-md body'>So I went for the x-ray this week since I couldn't get it done last week and the results were all normal. Didn't really like the doctor I have this time as he kept snapping at me stating everything is very "common" after every single sympton I tell him. Basically he told me that my hip might my loose (which is coincidentally what the MO in my camp said as well) which can't really be detected through x-ray and stuffs. I told him about the numbness I feel in my toe and he said it's very "common" as well because the boots is tight etc etc even though it's already been numb for 1 month and even throughout my 12 day block leave period where I didn't even touch my boots at all. Right now I'm basically waiting for the specialist appointment whose date I don't even have. Apparently the MO in my camp is supposed to refer me but it's not really been done yet. Blargh.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi doctor,<br><br>Just a question to ask..over the weekend, I had severely pain to my lower back which radiates down to the back of my left leg, so I went straight down to A&amp;E and was given the diagnosis of "prolapsed intervertebral disc". I think it means slipped disc though the A&amp;E MO could not confirmed it from the x-rays taken. She then referred me for a specialist doctor appointment and a M.R.I scan may need to be done. Question I need to ask;<br><br>a) Since I ORDed from NS (actually about 2 years back), I know I will not be subsidised in terms of cost of such MRI scan, thus, may I know the cost of a MRI scan will be like? Can pay from Medisave?<br><br>b) What would be a possible remedy for a slipped disc patient? Will he need to go through an operation etc? Is there any degenerative condition which will occur in the future?<br><br>c) Lastly, my next reservist date is unknown for 2008. If possible, I try not to downgrade coz I serving the same reserve unit as my NS buddies so, the idea of joining another unit is kindda demoralising. Can I stay active (PES A) given my condition?<br><br>Thank you.</div>
