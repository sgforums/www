The cost of non-subsidized MRI scan is $600 but need some admin charges will become cost to $700.<br><br>------<br>------<br>------<br><br>Thanks it helps.</div></blockquote>full spinal scan cost a lot... maybe within in the $1000 range already, even with govt. subsidy.. i not too sure too though, better check wif the specialist. and see whether medisave/insurance can claim or not... i think more or less in part or best at all in full cost...<br><br>the lumbar (lower back) scan is the most important. for the upper and middle spinal scan, well... let the hospital specialist decides...</div>

Nearly all deaths related to water intoxication in normal individuals have resulted either from water drinking contests, in which individuals attempt to consume several gallons over the course of just a few minutes, or long bouts of intensive exercise during which time electrolytes are not properly replenished, yet massive amounts of fluid are still consumed.<br><br><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication</a></strong><br><br><strong><a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-water-poisoning.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-water-poisoning.htm</a></strong></div>

Nearly all deaths related to water intoxication in normal individuals have resulted either from water drinking contests, in which individuals attempt to consume several gallons over the course of just a few minutes, or long bouts of intensive exercise during which time electrolytes are not properly replenished, yet massive amounts of fluid are still consumed.<br><br>[b]<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication</a></strong><br><br><strong><a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-water-poisoning.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-water-poisoning.htm</a></strong>[/b]</blockquote>then is it a form of diseases?<br><br>will it be downgrade?</div>

That is without contrast. With contrast will cost about 1000. So Full back MRI prolly $1500??<br><br>According to the nurse, before the MRI, they will check whether u need to be injected with something to make the MRI image come out more visible.
