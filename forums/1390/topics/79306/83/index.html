              <p><span>Hi seniors, I have some doubts and I wish you guys can clarify for me. I am a Pre-</span><strong><span>Enlistees</span></strong><span>, I went for a checkup during Jan 2009. I had a motorbike accident April 2009. On that night, I went to a nearest clinic and the doctor apply stitches on my chin and clean the wound on my knee. After a month, although the wound from my knee has healed, but I still feel the pain on my knee. Therefore I went to the polyclinic for consultation. The doctor refers me to the Changi General Hospital for an Orthopedic and he told me most likely they will do a MRI for me. The hospital referral letter is at 21th of July which falls after my enlist date which is July 13th. The doctor therefore wrote a memo for the army to excuse me for lower limb exercise for 2 months.</span></p>
              <p><span>After reading the instructions from this website, I went down to cmpb to submit the memo. The MO in the cmpb put me in pes D and told me to come back for another pes review on September.</span></p>
              <p><span>After coming out of the MO office, I was asked to sign a confirmation letter to downgrade to pes D. As I was signing, the people at the counter told me that if I am doing my checkup over at a government hospital, the army will help me cover all the expenses cost for the checkup. But if let’s say I am doing it on a private specialist, I have to pay the fees myself.</span></p>
              <p><span>The doubt I am having is will the army really cover the cost of my checkup? Or the guy over at the counter is giving my wrong information. If the guy was right, how or what I should to do in order to get my medical fees covered. I heard from my friends that consulting an Orthopedic and doing MRI maybe quite expensive. I am currently just a fresh graduate from polytechnics and I am not working so therefore I am worry that the medical fees will be a little too much for me to pay.</span></p>

              <p>erm . . . I currently only have a refferal letter from the polyclinic which was given to me before i went to cmpb to submit my memo.</p>

              <p><br>11B is the Military ID Card, which is given when you enlist on the 1st day, you will exchange it with your Pink NRIC. When you ORD, your NRIC will be given back to you. The 11B is used concurrently with the NRIC when you report for Reservist In-Camp Training thereafter.<br><br>On the day of the specialist appointment, when you show the Further Reporting Order paper to the receptionist counter, they will automatically bill the charges to Mindef. Just to be safe, just bring along the stated 1), 2), 3) forms and given it to the receptionist when billing.</p>

              <p>Hi to all. i am currently a private who just passed out from BMT
              and i just got my posting this morning. and unfortunately i was
              posted to 3SIR Infantry Recee Trooper.</p>
              <p>However, i have a medical problem with me which is flat feet. i
              know that this condition is rather common these days. but i would
              like to ask if it is possible to get out of course for this
              vocation because i know myself that i will not be able to take the
              highly demanding schedule such as all the marches and running.</p>
              <p>i have a specialist memo with me indicating that i have flexible
              pes planus and some other problems which i do know really
              understand the scribbles. Previously i failed the FFI and the MO
              knows about my condition and ask me to seek help from the Unit's MO
              to see what can they do about my condition.</p>
              <p>Now i am afriad that i will not be able to get out of course for
              this vocation. I know my condition the best myself and others might
              think that i wanna chaokeng but everytime after route marches,
              jumping and running, i will experience both ankle and back pains
              which makes me unable to sleep at night.</p>
              <p>Please help me to answer this questions as i will be enlisting

              <p>Have you shown the MO your specialist memo in tekong?</p>
              <p>If you have not, bring it to unit when you report.</p>
              <p>If you have and still kanna this vocation, you might like to go see your specialist and ask for a more strongly worded memo to request for you to be downgraded if he feels you should be.</p>

              <p>oh okay! thanks for your advice. Im still feeling very moody
              about my posting because the others all are in rather slack
              units.</p>
              <p>Do u have any idea if my chances of OOC are high?</p>
              <p>i was talking to my GP tutor moments ago and she advised me to
              see the MO in case there are any complications and it might results
              in future complications in terms of medical health.</p>

              <p>As i say it depends on the seriousness of your condition and what your specialist wrote. I'm not a MO nor a medic during NS so my medical knowledge is close to 0.</p>

              <p>hi all, here's  a brief background of me. i was given a pes bp prior to enlistment  as i was overweight which was eventually changed to pes b because i got a silver for napfa. i have got no medical history. after two years of ns, i somehow managed to put on weight, from a 70+ before enlistment to a 90kg on my ord date. since then i have managed to bring it down to 85kg. i have been exercising regularly after my ord, almost exercising everyday. recently my birthday just passed which means i have to attempt my ippt. during my ns days. i was able to obtain a silver during the 1st window (sispec) and a pass during the 2nd window.</p>
              <p>i have been training for the past month and i believe with my standard i would be able to achieve a pass for my ippt. i would want to train for another two weeks to gain more confidence for the test itself. but recently, for the past few days, i have been experiencing chest pain about 1km or less into the run. even when i lower the intensity it still happens. once i experience the pain i immediately slow down to jogging. i do recall that during a medical checkup for uni two months ago, the doctor and nurse checked at least 3 times during the day and deduced that i have high blood pressure. and i have not been following up on that either. any advice on this? should i continue with training and go ahead with the ippt?  </p>

              <p>hi everyone.</p>
              <p>im waiting to be posted to a new unit tmr, which is 35SCE Bridge. the problem is, before i POP i consulted with the MO in tekong regarding my migraine status, backed by a private specialist letter. i guess my migraine condition is not eligible for immediate down-pes coz i've been referred to the SAF specialist in august.</p>
              <p>in the meantime, <strong>my status is excused helment and sunlight until 8th july</strong>, reason being to give me time to recover or sth along tt line. problem is my condition is a permanent one and even during my block leave now i get headaches now and then. with this condition, im still posted to a heavy-work combat engineer unit ( even the MO previously told me not to go for command sch which i listened to him ).</p>
              <p>so is it possible to request for a ooc when i look for my unit MO tmr? not that i want to chao keng, but this migraine has already been affecting me since BMT and got worse during the last 2 or 3 wks in tekong because i garang too much earlier ( wanted to go OCS then ). i don't want my condition to worsen further before my specialist appt which is still a long way ahead. advice appreciated thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi to all. i am currently a private who just passed out from BMT
              and i just got my posting this morning. and unfortunately i was
              posted to 3SIR Infantry Recee Trooper.</p>
              <p>However, i have a medical problem with me which is flat feet. i
              know that this condition is rather common these days. but i would
              like to ask if it is possible to get out of course for this
              vocation because i know myself that i will not be able to take the
              highly demanding schedule such as all the marches and running.</p>
              <p>i have a specialist memo with me indicating that i have flexible
              pes planus and some other problems which i do know really
              understand the scribbles. Previously i failed the FFI and the MO
              knows about my condition and ask me to seek help from the Unit's MO
              to see what can they do about my condition.</p>
              <p>Now i am afriad that i will not be able to get out of course for
              this vocation. I know my condition the best myself and others might
              think that i wanna chaokeng but everytime after route marches,
              jumping and running, i will experience both ankle and back pains
              which makes me unable to sleep at night.</p>
              <p>Please help me to answer this questions as i will be enlisting
