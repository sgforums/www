              <p><br>a rare case indeed... i dun think (atopic dermatitis + jaundice) warrants a further downgrade to pes e range... <strong>but</strong> he can always try for a medical review provided if he gets a specialist memo (<em>as i always recommend</em>), he might get some other perm excuses these and that as a "consolidation"...</p>

              <p>c9l9 perm is already considerable good enough. lowest point of the pes c range already.<br></p>

              <p> Hi <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>I got injured during BMTC. I fell down from a high obstacle around 4m and i broke my right wrist and my Sternum quite badly, the body of the sternum broke into 3 parts. I have a few questions  to ask. :P</p>
              <p>1) I signed up for medical review on the 4th June at BTMC, till now, there is still no reply from them. Does medical reivew takes that long or it is still not my turn for the review</p>
              <p>I am Posted to guards despite of my injuries</p>
              <p>2) I was given 2 months light duties by my hand specialist. He told me to do only paperwork and strictly no carrying of heavy load. However, light duties in Guards is not light at all. There is not admin work they can let me do because we are a combat vocation. Guards is in charge of  NDP this year and all those on excuses  in Guards are given the task to carry stuff around the different camps and schools. The boxs are quite heavy and it is quite tough for me. Sounding off to the commanders don't really help as they have no clue how serious my injuries are and they keep thinking that i am just trying to find excuses not to work. I just went to see my 2nd specialist for my sternum not long ago. I told him about my working condition in camp. He says he will write a letter about it to my MO. In the end, the MO gave me 6 more days of light duties in addition to my 2 months of light duties. I mean, how does giving me 6 more days of light duties help me in anyway.  I am only worried about getting injured again. Is there anything that i can do ?</p>
              <p>3) My mum is quite worried about me having to do all these labour work even though i am injured. She went to see the MP for help last Mon and the MP told her that she will write a letter about this. This Mon, I got a letter from MINDEF saying that they have recieved my request from the MP and will get back to me shortly regarding the medical review. Is queuing up for medical review any faster though the MP ? I have been waiting for 6 weeks already by signning up in BMTC.</p>
              <p>4) I am still waiting for my Neuro Specialist appointment. I knocked my head during the fall and passed out once. I am having a lot of headaches these days. Does the Medical Boards knows of NSF patient's medical appointments when they are doing thier reivew ? Do they take into account of possible injuries that has not been verified by a specialist because thier review is earlier than that of the specailist ?</p>
              <p>5) Will the Review be done by the MOs of my own camp or those in CMBP ?</p>
              <p>6) Do you have any clues what Pres would i be, should i get a down pres.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank You and i look forward to your reply :P</p>

              <p><br>1) u r eligible and should have to file a Service Injury report to get some compensation and a SI ID card to get any further treatment bill to saf even after u ORD... but now, a bit hard cos need the BMTC signatures, witness accounts...etc... these r mentioned in the recruit handbook... u no read meh...</p>
              <p>pls check that whether ur hardcopy medical files docket is being transferred from bmtc to bedok medical centre already or not? even if not yet, u can still go to ur camp medical centre <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by ur own follow-ups</span> , cos now report sick/reviews softcopy are shared interlinked among all camps with its EMR Info System. admin lapses do often happen, that's y pls do ur own follow-up.</p>
              <p>2) read point no.4 from<a href="/forums/1390/topics/315224"><span style="color: #333333;">: </span></a><a class="entry-title" rel="bookmark" href="/forums/1390/topics/315224">8 Simple Rules to Medical Board (Genuine Medical Cases)</a><a href="/forums/1390/topics/315224"><span style="color: #333333;"> </span></a>and also, tell ur specialist for any further memos to include the wrist rest period he/she recommend.in addition, r<em>equest the specialist to write about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reviewing of PES and medical board / anything specific</span> to your conditions, if u want the MO to KIV ur case statement for pending medical board assessment for pes review.<br><br></em>u have already went by the chain of command in ur coy, so next can safely to do is to find the chief clerk/dyS1/ S1 manpower officer for assist in ur voicing out of ur vocational work problems.</p>
              <p>3) no, it might be admin lapse. e.g. time taken to transfer of medical documents from tekong to all camps' med centres. pls do ur own follow-ups. ns is rush to wait, wait to rush...<br><br>but then, there is a EMR IS, mentioned in point no 1.</p>
              <p>4) they dun know. on ur part, u will have to tell the MO abt this and that during ur reviews to only keep them informed.<br><br>they will be more decisive and will take into account the specialist input <strong>when a copy of any specialist memo is submitted for review. by just telling the MO of just an appt is of little use.<br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>for now, deal with the wrist and sternum 1st. step by step. after u get a specialist memo from the neuro specialist, then u make a medical review for the neuro problem.<br></strong></p>
              <p>5)  reviews are done by ur camp medical centre. only if ur case is being referred to medical board for KIV pes downgrade, then it is scheduled for medical board meet (held once monthly) at the formation HQ medical centre. for Guards, HQ Guards is at dieppe barracks, near chong pang there.</p>
              <p>6) for wrist, the pes is usually within pes c1 range. i already mentioned a lot of times that i knew a friend who had wrist fracture is pes c1l3, with permanent excuse chin-ups and push-ups.</p>
              <p> <br>for sternum, it is held and supported by the rib cage. even if it's broken, but if there is no piercing broken bones detected to risk the internal organs, it should be of less concerns.</p>

              <p>Questions:</p>
              <p>What does a medical report to CMPB from a public hospital specialist consist of? Diagnosis? Causes for illnesses?</p>
              <p>Also, it has been confirmed that I've mild hearing loss and tinnintus. Period. Despite that, I've gone through tests and tests and tests and they still can't find the causes for it. Last week I was at CGH for a review and what the specialist said was "You have hearing loss. We don't know the causes. We're sending you for a MRI scan. But that cannot tell us the causes. It only tell us if the nerves are sitting on your hearing nerves yada yada". I've been Pes D for AGES (seriously. Since Feb) and I just wanna ask why can't the specialist just send the medical report stating that I have tinnintus and mild hearing loss? What if I don't want to get treated? I'm having my A levels and Prelims and I'm visiting the doctor every week! My mom got really impatient with the specialist and even requested not to get treated. All the specialist said was "Go think about sending your son for an MRI scan. We'll see you for a review next week."</p>
              <p><br>I was kinda surprised since I was there for a review after my ABR scan and now I've to return again for a review if I wanna go for an MRI scan which can't tell the specialist the specific cause. -.-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why can't the specialist just write a report stating: This guy has tinnintus and mild hearing loss. ????</p>
