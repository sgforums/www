            <div class='col-md body'>Dear dustbuster<br><br>Your medical board is probably a board in absentee type, in which your medical officer will present his petition to a senior medical officer for consideration.<br><br>Few things possible<br>1. Medical boards fully booked for months and hence your case has not come up for review.<br>2. Your medical officer has forgotten about your medical board and hence no medical board for you condition has been arranged<br><br>What I would suggest would be to ask the senior medic of the medical center when you medical board is scheduled for. Medical officers are always ORDing but the senior medic is the one regular person around</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sirs,<br><br>i just had an ankle operation(bostrom gould) for my right ankle due to ankle instability. Yesterday, i visited my camp MO, and showed him the specialist letter which suggested permenant downgrade.<br><br>But my MO Sir said he could give me a temp 6months status. And he said since i am going to ord in March, i should ask for a medical review after I ord. And it would be easier to downgrade as a NSman.<br><br>Is this true?<br>Why doesn't he want to downgrade me immediately? He even said,"why do u still need a downgrade when ur ankle ligament is repaired?"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting question<br><br>The purpose for the temp downgrade is for conditions which are expected to recover after a period of resting, hence no need for a perm downgrade.<br><br>For your particular condition I am not too sure what the directory of disease manual states as to the recommended PES status, but in all likely hood should be minimum PES C.<br><br>As to why you medical officer has refused to do the necessary procedures for perm downgrade, it is quite likely that you will ORD before your case comes up to board, hence administratively it would make more sense to arrange for the board after you ORD.
