              <p>hi..</p>
              <p>i would like to share this topic and maybe get some help from
                                      MOs, NSFs and ORD-ed personnels regarding my problem.</p>
              <p>I'm a PES BP converted PES B NSF.  I POP-ed 1yr ago,
                                      afterwhich i was sent to <strong>SMTI (Medic
                                      School)</strong>.  I had no interest in it as i wanted to be
                                      other vocation except for medic for i'm not the studious type, and
                                      i'm a very very slow learner.  Also,  i am <strong>afraid
                                      of handling peoples' lives</strong>.  It was hard to talk
                                      about this to my platoon SI cos all they ask if we have medical
                                      problems, but they didnt ask if we can take up this medical and
                                      life-saving responsibilities.  most of the time, i'm
                                      feared.</p>
              <p>During my course <strong>P-033</strong>, i was OOCed because i
                                      failed several tests.  I was relieved cos i truthfully cant be
                                      a medic and i didnt understand anything.  Unfortunately, i had
                                      to recourse.  Shit!!</p>
              <p>In <strong>P-034</strong>, i was <em>easily passed</em> by
                                      instructors and testers because they knew they can't OOC anymore
                                      people. But deep inside i was dead worried and guilty.</p>
              <p>Graduated, I was posted to a camp in the west.  By
                                      vocation, i'm a Combat Medic, but in my unit, i work in a Medical
                                      Centre and do safety covers.  <strong>Stay out,
                                      8-5. </strong> <em>But It didnt mean a thing to me</em>..
                                      SERIOUSLY.  cos i honestly can't save life.  I do not
                                      know what i am doing.  At times when they conduct several
                                      lessons and mini-tests, i COCK-UP big time in the treatment
                                      room. </p>
              <p>I feel depressed.  I'm in the goddamn wrong vocation.</p>
              <p>As a medic, theres TOO MANY things to absorb and to
                                      remember.  <em>I have developed insomnia, (sleep ard 1-2hrs a
                                      night), anxiety and PHOBIA of coming to work.  Feels lethargic
                                      at work, NERVOUS.</em>  Sometimes i thought of going AWOL so i
                                      land in DB.  It was hard to talk to senior medic and MO about
                                      this cos its so hard to approach them.  And they expect so
                                      much from us, and me, being a blur cock.</p>
              <p>I honestly can't do this.  I'm supposed to be in other
                                      vocation.  I don't care if mine is a combat intensed vocation,
                                      like rifleman, and what not.. but NOT to be a medic please.</p>
              <p>Cos this is a matter of people's lives and i honestly can't do
                                      this.  <strong>I didnt know who to seek help
                                      from..</strong>  :(</p>
              <p>However I did consult an external psychiatrist.  He wrote
                                      me a Memo to show my MO but i do not know when is the right time to
                                      show it to my MO yet.  It was reflected in the Memo that i
                                      have developed phobia, low mood, anxiety, and stuff like me
                                      expressing huge desires to revocate to other suitable vocations
                                      with accordance to my abilities.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Seriously, i'm in the wrong vocation.  I can't
                                      be a medic, and i don't wanna be one.</strong></em></p>

              <p>hi i would like to know whether i can get excused from camou cream because of <strong>Seborrheic dermatitis</strong> as it usually worsens my complexion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My posting is to 1 guards as inf recce and im worried that the training there would do irreversible damage to my skin.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it possible to get my condition diagnosed while it isnt flared up? Since im having my block leave now, my condition has subsided, so is it possible to get it checked out now? or do i need for it to worsen 1st?</p>

              <p>a main question id like to ask is that, the specialist wouldnt be able to perform a proper diagnosis if my condition doesnt flare up right? so.. if it so happens that my condition gets better during my appt, the specialist wouldnt b able to help me right?</p>

              <p> since u r so sure that u have the seborrheic dermatitis, it must be preliminary diagnosed clinically by a polyclinic doctor/family doctor/ GP right. if so, get the GP to write a memo about the condition to the specialist, like that the specialist would be more better understand your condition than a clinically undiagnosed patient right.</p>
              <p>so long as there is a memo/ any certified supporting documents, the specialist will not simply brush off the skin condition as "just a typical allergy reaction"...</p>

              <p><br>during RT, yes there is a mo around for rt sessions, BUT he is not from the same camp. it's a duty roster rotation of MOs.<br><br>therefore he can't handle these reviews. he is mostly there for nsmen to endorse MCs for those excuse this n that for ippt/rt, and to handle any emergency cases/injuries during his duties time.</p>
