              <p><br>Yes, it is downgradeable, when supported by the specialist memo.<br><br>Meanwhile, u can try to extend ur current temp status (if any), backed with a memo from a specialist or ur attending doctor (e.g. GP).</p>

              <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
              <p>Even with the referral letter from the polyclinic, it take about 2 months before i can see the specialists regarding my conditions. But, the problem i now face is that i am due for enlistement and i have no time to wait 2 months for the hospital appointment. What should i do?</p>
              <p>Tell the MO at CMPB first so that they can refer me to hospital for checking or go to polyclinic to get it done? Which is faster?</p>

              <p><br>4 likely options:<br><strong>1)</strong> go polyclinic 1st is better and faster.<br><strong>2)</strong> see a private specialist (when u can afford)<br><strong>3)</strong> a memo from ur family doctor (e.g. GP),<br>(a GP memo is better than nothing, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>at least for ur BMT period</em></span>)<br><strong>4)</strong> Self check-in at a hospital A&amp;E.</p>
              <p>Try to call CMPB the 1st thing in the morning ASAP to ask them for further instructions. Otherwise, u can only just enlist 1st and in the meantime book ur specialist appt. Anyway, it's a little late to do anything now if you already know your enlistment date / enlisting in just a few weeks time.<br><br>If u r already given an official PES by CMPB, <strong>the question is why didn't u voice out ur 2 problems to the CMPB MO in the 1st place?</strong><br>Even so after the CMPB checkup, u can always call the general line of CMPB Medical Classification Centre @ <strong class="excerpt_highlight">6373</strong> <strong class="excerpt_highlight">1340</strong> to at least get a fax no. to fax over a specialist memo to back up ur medical problems.<br><br><strong>Note: The CMPB MO can't do much with just all your explanations on just symptoms alone.<br><br>It's puzzling on how you can actually be bochup about not wanting to know what is the actual name of the clinical diagnosis / illnesses / medical conditions you are suffering from after all these years...</strong></p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>recently I went for my medical checkup and they told me I have blood in my urine. Thus they booked another appointment for me 2 weeks after and I went for it yesterday.</p>
              <p>When I got there, I went straight to the urine test station and did the test. The person just told me everything is fine now and that I can go.</p>
              <p>So is there no documents to tell me which PES am I in?</p>
              <p>Another question is, I have an ongoing problem with my arm but haven't consulted a doctor yet. If I do have a serious problem with it, do I need to report anything to them to tell them?</p>
              <p>Thanks!</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p> I was referred to CGH by my camp doc for checkup. After a series of checkups, the doc diagnosed me with 135/89 daily avg BP, diagnosed hypertension and recommended my gp to increase my med dosage.</p>
              <p>What must I do from here? Wait for camp call up? Or do I go back on myself to the camp doc? Was temporarily downgraded before the referral. I have been on temp status all the while when I am on medication. Will it continue this way? Or will they send me back to CGH specialist again?</p>

              <p><br>it depends on what's written on the memo, which is to be given to the camp MO. e.g. diagnosis, whether it's a temp or perm case basis.<br><br>usually, the person will remain in the current vocation (sometimes temp attach to company HQ to do misc work) ;<br>with assistance in terms of counselling from the camp MO, coping interviews with PC, OC... and periodic medical review consultations with both the camp MO and the saf psychiatrist.</p>

I have had <strong>allergic conjunctivitis </strong>since young and have been consulting this doctor <span style="text-decoration: underline;">since 2004</span>. For more than half a decade, <strong>most of my relief have been coming from over-the-counter ocular drops that contain a combination of vasoconstrictors and anti-histamines</strong>. Of course, I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">should not be relying on such medication as it is known to be harmful in the long-run</span>. So due to the longevity of the reaction this time, my doctor prescribed the strongest yet medication* given to me. I was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">also prescribed Nasacort AQ (triamcinolone acetonide) that I have to use faithfully everyday for 6 months</span>. All this medication cost well over $200. I also requested a <em>medical referral</em> to an eye-specialist, which granted a 1-page hand-written letter from my doc - I have not seen its contents; as far as I know, my doctor has the records of my visits to him since 2005, but I do not know if such information was included in the letter.<br><br>You might be surprised to hear that I have never seen an ocular specialist of any kind despite having so many problems with my eyes. This is partly due to uncertainty, largely due to procrastination and perhaps a slight fear of potential fiscal burden.<br><br>I have 2 questions: <br><strong>(1): With the given knowledge, what PES do you think I might end up in?</strong><br><strong>(2): Should I seek an ocular specialist before the medical check-up, or should I depend on the medical referral?</strong><br><br>I also have myopia [780/840] and actively use computers (I do design)</p>

              <p>1. Guy A is mildly deaf. Given PES C1L2 excused from explosives and loud noise vocations. His titinnus that causes his deafness just got worst again and he's going for BMT on the 28th. Is there anyway that he could be downgraded to L3 to excuse from firearms? He claims that firing, even tho there's ear plugs, is still kinda loud and may harm his ears :S</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Guy B has necrophobia and claustrophobia (like seriously) but not medically shown. He's going to book out on Friday (i think. he's pes B or something) and he wants to ask is there anyway to voice out these phobias in camp 'cos he kept worrying that he may run and die in there or smth (no kidding. pls don laugh thanks. i thought it was funny at first but it seems that he has some serious phobias).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>any advice? thanks</p>
