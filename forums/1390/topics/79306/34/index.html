            <div class='col-md body'>hi sir, i would like to ask a few simple questions.<br><br>i am suffering from back pain and reported this a few times to my BMT and current camp MO alr. My GP suspected a slipped disc and the camp MO put me out of course accordingly but couldnt downgrade me until i had the MRI done. However, i went for a consultation with a private specialist and he wrote a memo to the camp MO recommending a temporary downgrade and excused combat vocations as i am waiting for postings. My MO looked at it and jus dismissed it, saying he couldnt downgrade me temporarily. but how is that fair? I am suffering from back problems, especially when sitting or standing for qte some time, and carrying heavy loads, and my camp MO didnt wan to refer me for an MRI yet expected me to produce one. and didnt temporary downgrade even when the specialist recommended it. he just gave me one month light duty and excused heavy load.could the resident doctor provide some advice please? thank you!</div>
