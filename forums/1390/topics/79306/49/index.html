              <p>Hello MO,</p>
              <p>I would like to ask for advise regarding issues on my health problems. I have breathing difficulty for more than one year. And Im an NSF who have been already serving for a few months. Im a PES A. I did not voice out this problem during the medical checkup.</p>
              <p>Recently, my breathing problem got worst and i started to see a govt specialist. I do not know the root problem of my breathing difficulty and the doctor i see told me that it may be due to psychological disorders, which caused my body to feel hungry for oxygen.</p>
              <p>My problem of breathing difficulty affects my training as it cause me to feel panicky at times when i am gasping for air. At night, i will also feel breathless when i lie down and hence have difficulty sleeping. At times, i may just wake up feeling that i have not enough air. I also have difficulty during and after pt and also even when im sitting down doing nothing.</p>
              <p>I would like to ask for advise:<br>1) whether this is a physical or mental problem?<br>2) whether i should stop seeing my specialist and see a psycharist instead?<br>3) what can i do to help ease my anxiety of being unable to breathe?<br>4) will i be down-ed PES due to this medical problem?<br>5) what can i do if this problem continue to persist?</p>
              <p>Thank you MO. Im very worried about my health. This problem occured suddenly about 1 year ago and have not subsided since only worsen. Iam troubled and feel very irritated and fatigue about this. Please help me.</p>

              <p><br>1) asking here will not help. go see doctor/specialist. if after all that tests done is not due to any illness, then its most highly likely mental illness.</p>
              <p>2) play safe for ur own good. see both. ask mo/hospital specialist for referral to see psychiatrist.</p>
              <p>3) deep slow inhale/exhale breathing, just like mediation... cool down breathing exercise</p>
              <p>4) unless u get documented qualified specialist diagnosis (govt/private hospital specialist letter/memo/report/support documents), then the camp mo will write and put up ur case statement for a KIV medical board meet pending to discuss pes status.<br>5) very obivous self-answerable question... see qualified professional help... medical doctor, psychiatrist or even a counsellor...</p>

              <p><br>ask ur specialist to write a memo to the camp mo abt the itch and pain, and to write the memo sounding like a 'revocate to a non-outfield' work environment. its general depends on how the specialist write the memo.e.g. usage of 'stronger words'. some govt. hospital specialists r good and kind enough, but if u r desperate, then spend some good money on private specialists.<br><br>do note that the specialist can only recommend, and if the camp mo is kind enough to help u to temporary excuse u outfield for a few weeks while put up ur case statement for medical board review.</p>

              <p>Hello Sir,</p>
              <p>last week I was deemed unfit for course from a particular leadership course and was refered to a specialist for further treatment. I was deemed unfit from course because I have a soft lump of tissue growing on the top of each foot, somewhat close to the ankle. This has cause my feet a lot of pain whenever I participate in any long or high intensity run. It has gotten so bad that I am even having difficulty walking after a certain period of time. I often find myself resorting in walking with the side of my foot to ease the pain. My calves are also giving me several problems as well such as numbness and strain. there are mornings when i wake up with a sharp unbearable pain on my right calve which last for several minutes.</p>
              <p>however the shocking part about this whole incident was...just two day after being ooced from this leadership course, I was posted to another combat unit as an infantry recce trooper. this totally shocked me as I have yet to see the specialist refered to me by the MO yet. it does not make sense for me to be posted to another combat unit when i was just occed from a combat course due to my leg problem.</p>
              <p>i am certain that i would not be able to cope with the training as well as i am already in pain whenever i walk. please advice me on what to do. thank you.</p>

              <p>Hi, I'm a pre-enlistee about to sign up for my medical checkup. A few questions have been bugging me, and I would appreciate it if someone could clarify them for me. Thanks in advanced!</p>
              <p>I have been diagnosed with depression resulting from my generalized anxiety disorder/panic attacks when I was in secondary school, and have seen three different psychiatrists and been prescribed with different medications for both depression and anxiety (prozac and xanax). However, due to certain complications, I did not consult these psychiatrists on a long-term basis, and have not been on their prescribed medication. As a result of these problems, I missed one year of secondary school.</p>
              <p>The next year I began secondary three a year overaged, but was faced with the same problems. However, this time I managed to work things out, with the school counsellor, after a turbulent four months, without having seen any external psychiatrists, and hitherto things have been running rather smoothly; I am now in JC2.</p>
              <p>However, I am still prone to excessive panic attacks and anxiety; it's just that they are not as often as they were in secondary school as I have managed to acclimatize to my current situation in life. In fact, I would say that I pretty much feel 'normal' right now, but I fear that the stability of my condition due to the routine of school life that I have gotten used to would be shaken once I enter NS, and my anxiety attacks would start to intensify, resulting in depression and all that again.</p>
              <p>Hence, I am wondering if I should bring this issue up during my medical check-up, or if I should keep it to myself, and only alert the relevant personnel if my condition is triggered and exacerbated in NS?</p>
              <p>Once again, thanks for any help!</p>

I'm 18 this year, suffering from colour blindness, night blindness and audio-visual synesthesia.
