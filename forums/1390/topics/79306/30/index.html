Often times, you'd need another agent (eg. allopurinol) for long-term control. But speaking as a doctor. maybe i could suggest good dietary control? because  you're still at risk of a flare again. Try eating less purine-rich foods and hydrate well.</div>

That is horrible to think of. The first 2 days of my medication do very effective, i can walk normally again. However, i start to feel the pain in my feet again on the 3rd day onwards. And i find walking difficult, feeling something inside my feet and the annoying pain on evey steps. It is not sharp pain this time, but feel like pain in the bone, crushing on the ground. Never know that walking can be difficult, dreadful to know i have to live with gout, maybe forever. I see that my father is suffering from Gout for years.<br><br>thank you very much and i hope my GP or the polyclinic doctor can quickly wite me a memo to defer my ICT next month. The polycinic doctor did ask if i am still doing my ns obligation but did not offer to tell me more or write me any letter to defer.

Furthermore, if you're already on treatment, someone (your endocrinologist) really needs to re-evaluate the dosage(s). At this rate you may end up PES F!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

All seafood, all meat, all bean type, califlower, spinach, all mushroom, gravy etc. Almost everything cannot eat. Confused. I wonder if i go back ICT, can i tell the MO I cannot eat half of the cook house food.<br><br>I think i am going to lose much energy and "life" without meat and serveral veg. That is horrible to think of. The first 2 days of my medication do very effective, i can walk normally again. However, i start to feel the pain in my feet again on the 3rd day onwards. And i find walking difficult, feeling something inside my feet and the annoying pain on evey steps. It is not sharp pain this time, but feel like pain in the bone, crushing on the ground. Never know that walking can be difficult, dreadful to know i have to live with gout, maybe forever. I see that my father is suffering from Gout for years.<br><br>thank you very much and i hope my GP or the polyclinic doctor can quickly wite me a memo to defer my ICT next month. The polycinic doctor did ask if i am still doing my ns obligation but did not offer to tell me more or write me any letter to defer. Hopefully, my blood test will help this time.<br><br>best regards to all who ofifer help.<br><br></div></blockquote>You're very welcome.<br>Yes. gout is a chronic  problem. however, as I mentioned earlier - there will be a need to Start on definitive treatment. Do check with your GP or at the<br>polyclinic. Bear in mind though that sometimes the blood test may be normal'<br>(and high levels of uric acid do not equate to gout either). You can request a deferment based on the fact that you've had a recent FLARE and have limited mobility.</div>

And also consider burning your bedsheets (  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> chargeable offence) or washing them in hot water and sun-<br>drying them.  Dust mites and associated droppings can be quite a potent trigger.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear green_saccades<br><br>You are right to say that a blood test may not reveal anything about gout. My uric acid is normal. However, the blood test shows that my red blood cell is  low. I wonder what i can do next. On one hand, if I have gout, i should avoid meat, liver etc. On the other hand, if I have Anemia, i should eat more meat and food rich in iron. Very expected outcome.<br><br>Now my question has changed from Gout to is Anemia downgradable? My recent sign was that after my ippt test run, i vomit 2 times and find myself too tired to stand or walk, feeling that i am going to faint anytime. I never have such feeling before. So i ended up in the medical center and rest for some time. After which, i feel well again after an hour to drive home. Luckily i pass the test.<br><br>Happy Labour Day, which also my 33 birthday!<br><br></div>
