              <p><br>1) bring hosptial discharge summary report, memo and MC to medical centre for review.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) % of chances, the medical centre MO will then tell u. MC after operation sure got excuse one. yet whether or not the MO agrees with the period the specialist give u attend b light duties/whatever excuses recommended is up to the MO's discretion. e.g. specialist may recommend 1 month attend b, but the medical centre MO have the power to shorten to say, 3 weeks? OR he will jolly well agree with the specialist in giving u the full 1 month MC.</p>

              <p>hi eac..some questions..</p>
              <p>i've reported sick at camp for back problem and got 3 months excuse for some activities.</p>
              <p>u mentioned in one of ur earlier posts that the official medical directive gom states that "any status EXCUSE mc MORE than 84 days will need to be submitted to the medical board pending KIV discussion for downgrade.</p>
              <p>however, after the camp mo issued me the excuse, he did not inform me of this directive...so what should i do now? Should I go back to the medical centre to remind him of this?</p>
              <p>Also, the specialist referral is about a month away from now and the back pain is unbearable everyday...would u recommend me to take a faster route by visiting a private specialist and get a memo instead?</p>
              <p>Would memo or specialist reports from private hospitals eg: frequently mentioned mount elizabeth be recognised as valid documents for downgrade? cos i heard that reporting sick have to go through proper channel which i already did but its too slow..is that true? what should i do now?</p>
              <p>Pls advise and thanks in advance :)</p>

              <p><br>i guess u have to wait till the specialist referral appt to get a specialist memo, then report sick at medical centre for further review supported by the memo to request camp mo to refer ur case statement to the medical board. a month's wait isnt that long.<br><br>any govt/private hospital specialist's memo/report is recognised <strong>so long as a final diagnosis is made n written in the memo. <strong>if u can afford, by all means visit private specialist, the waiting time may be shorten if u need further tests such as MRI or CT scan for better details to see if ur lumbar spinal is affected. x-ray doesn't see much, it is a very basic n primary tool to detect, then doctors will next order MRI/CT to further analyse in greater details.</strong></strong></p>

              <p><br>in what way does this relates to medical? i dun see the link... this is purely admin side issue in ur unit's manpower branch. go ask the clerks there for those with similiar cases.</p>
              <p>anyway, go read up for the reservist guide in <a href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a> ... there the myORD module after u log in.<br><br>extracted from myORD:</p>

              <p>u havent ord n kan cheong spider abt reservist unit...u will get a <strong>safer answer</strong> <strong>from ur manpower br... pengz..................<br></strong></p>
              <p>fyi, no one will know his actual reservist unit until after he ord... a few months later after ord, an official reservist letter will be mailed to inform u abt it.. the chart serves as a general reservist posting concept...<br> </p>
              <p>u r just stubborn not to go to <a href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a> to dig up official info n <strong>read the <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/nsmen/home.html">official reservist guide</a>, n do the myORD module to at the very least grasp an understanding.</strong></p>
