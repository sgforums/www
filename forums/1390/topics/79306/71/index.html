              <p>as for 1., can he voice it out during BMT cos there's not much time to go for a specialist just to downgrade one land deployment code right? it's kinda lame too just to spend cash and wait? can he just voice to the mo in BMT during live firing or something?</p>
              <p>can he just go see a GP and get a memo (i saw something in the previous posts) for the BMT period? it's kinda a waste of cash to go to a specialist just to downgrade a land deployment code?</p>

              <p>Hello sir,</p>
              <p>   I am a JC student waiting to enlist on the 28th of Jan. Yes, the govt loves us and want us on the third day of CNY (not that it's their fault).</p>
              <p>   Anyway, I was in PES B but after a referral from my eye doctor, I was demoted to PES C1L3 due to severe myopia with a post-cycloplegic refraction of OD -12.00/-2.00x10^0 and OS -11.50/-2.50x175^0 and the fundoscopy reveals bilateral peripheral white-without-pressure degeneration.</p>
              <p>  The question now is, when I went to make my NS back up specs, my optometrist told me my degree have increased (in the span of 4 months) by 200 degrees and after some tests I am seeing more floaters.</p>
              <p>  Also, I was outdoors in the sunlight for around 4 hours with my friends and realized that my eyes may be photo-sensitive; I squinted my eyes practically all the way and it got to the point where I got dizzy and headache and had to lie down. (and I can confirm it's not dehydration, I had plenty of fluids the whole time)</p>
              <p>  Now I am confused as to what to do. I want to go back to my eye doctor for eye problems affect not only my NS route but my future and my entire life as well. However, I am scared that the MO may feel that I am trying to escape from my duty to the nation and do something funny to me.</p>
              <p>  Sorry for the long post, but I really need some answers. Hope to hear from you soon.</p>

              <p>                       I just got a MRI scan result. I got mild degenerate disc with posterior annular tear and posterior protrusion. Is this considered as slipped disc? Will it affect my pes status?</p>

              <p>                       I'm not too sure when my next call up will be. Heard that this year there wont be any. If my ict is next year 2010, will it make any difference when i submit?</p>

              <p>Yes, this medical condition is usually within the PES C2/C9 range, depending on the extent of the disc degeneration, disc rupture/herniation (tear), and the protrusion (bulge)...etc.<br><br>I urge you to book the medical review appointment as early as possible, even if there isn't any ICT call-ups this workyear.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the reply. I got another question.</p>
              <p>Does it make any difference if I go for the review asap and going next year? Is the MRI scan result valid for a lifetime? or I may be asked to do another MRI if its like more than a year later?</p>

              Hi,
              I've a medical problem, anxiety disorder. I got the specialist memo already, to be handed over to mo. however the date of ICT is one month away only. Do I still need to go to www.ns.sg to get an appointment for medical review or when I go ICT, I go see MO there without booking for review? 
              
              I have this coming low key ICT and a half day session and I'll have completed my reservist obligations. If I got to attend ICT at another date with another unit, will I serve more days ? 
              
              Thanks a lot.
