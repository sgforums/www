But I do not see a medical reason why someone with eczema cannot stay in camp. Unless you have a letter from NSC certifying that you have allergic contact dermatitis to the army?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, i'm concern about my medical status and want to know likely when my PES status will be out. Here's my condition:<br><br>-FlatFoot<br>-Mild Hypertension(High Blood Pressure)<br><br>Here's the process of my Medical Examination:<br><br>1)I booked my appointment for medical examination and started collecting all my medical reports including the above 2. I got a letter from the SGH podiatrist for my flatfoot and a letter from my GP regarding my Hypertension as my GP is the one reviewing my BP for a long time.<br><br>2)I went for the Medical Examination on the appointment date and go through all the normal precedure. I thought i'm gg to be given a PES status on the spot but i wasn't. The MO gave me a PES D for 3 mths and asked me to get an update of my condition from my GP and podiatrist and told me to ask both my doctors whether my condition can recover in 2-3 weeks  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> ...<br><br>3)I went back and get the update from both my doctors and went back to the MO in 1 mth time. The MO then send me for a 24hr Ambulatory Blood Pressure Measurement(ABP). So i have to go back for this thing on a next day.<br><br>4)Back on another day for the ABP in the morning and then go back home for the measurement and go back to the CMPB the next day to remove the device. (Btw, its a pain in the ass for the ABP becoz its like a person strangling your arm for 24hrs haha and more imptly, i am not allowed to bath <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> ).<br><br>5)After the ABP is removed, spoke to the MO and i was told that my condition is quite bad as my Blood Pressure is constantly high(including my heart beat rate). So i got send to a specialise in NUH and again given a PES D.<br><br>6)I went to the hospital and the doctor there agrees that my BP has been high and wanted to know about my heart beat status. So this time she's going to send me for a AECG(Ambulatory ECG) to measure my 24hr heartbeat. I booked an appointment and is going but i was told by CMPB to go back and get a letter from them so the consultation will be free. So i went back to the CMPB and get the letter.<br><br>7)My appointment for the AECG is coming and i have to go NUH to put on the device. And have to go back the next day to remove the device(No bathing again!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> OMG haha).<br><br>8 )Then the appointment to consult the specialise is not on the same day with the removal of the device so i have to go back to NUH for another appointment.<br><br>That's my condition now... can i know briefly when my PES status will be out?<br>I thinking of signing on Police Force... but if i'm physically unfit... i wun be allowed rite? how likely will i be downgraded?</div>

The chances of spread by saliva is low, although the virus can be present. Unless you have liver damage already, Hep B carrier status will not affect your fitness. Obviously, you cannot donate blood.<br><br>Sharing toilet bowl will not cause anyone to be infected with Hep B.</div>

So first of all, your diagnosis must be reviewed by a neurologist to confirm if it is true. Medical treatment is effective in a large proportion of cases. If so, you can still be combat fit. Your PES status will therefore depend on your specialist's recommendation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey MO.. i have blk nose and serious cough these daes.. went to do a spyrometry test todae in CMPB..( deep breath and exhale all the air into this machine).. in the end MO in CMPB said my lungs were not able to expand well. Be4 todae's consultation session, they said i have some white scarring on my right lobe of the lungs but SGH scans said it could be due to past infections, not TB. But todae my cosultation with MO said the scarrings could affect my lungs and now i am downgraded to Pes C9 L2... Is there ani chance that i could upgrade to Pes B. If i am able to prove that my lungs are functioning well, can i appeal to upgrade my status? i seriously want to return to pes B status. Thx</div>
