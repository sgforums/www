              <p>1) u r eligible and should have to file a Service Injury report to get some compensation and a SI ID card to get any further treatment bill to saf even after u ORD... but now, a bit hard cos need the BMTC signatures, witness accounts...etc... these r mentioned in the recruit handbook... u no read meh...</p>
              <p>pls check that whether ur hardcopy medical files docket is being transferred from bmtc to bedok medical centre already or not? even if not yet, u can still go to ur camp medical centre <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by ur own follow-ups</span> , cos now report sick/reviews softcopy are shared interlinked among all camps with its EMR Info System. admin lapses do often happen, that's y pls do ur own follow-up.</p>
              <p>2) read point no.4 from<a rel="nofollow" href="http://armedforces.sgforums.com/forums/1390/topics/315224"><span style="color: #333333;">:</span></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://armedforces.sgforums.com/forums/1390/topics/315224">8 Simple Rules to Medical Board (Genuine Medical Cases)</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://armedforces.sgforums.com/forums/1390/topics/315224"></a>and also, tell ur specialist for any further memos to include the wrist rest period he/she recommend.in addition, r<em>equest the specialist to write about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reviewing of PES and medical board / anything specific</span> to your conditions, if u want the MO to KIV ur case statement for pending medical board assessment for pes review.<br><br></em>u have already went by the chain of command in ur coy, so next can safely to do is to find the chief clerk/dyS1/ S1 manpower officer for assist in ur voicing out of ur vocational work problems.</p>
              <p>3) no, it might be admin lapse. e.g. time taken to transfer of medical documents from tekong to all camps' med centres. pls do ur own follow-ups. ns is rush to wait, wait to rush...<br><br>but then, there is a EMR IS, mentioned in point no 1.</p>
              <p>4) they dun know. on ur part, u will have to tell the MO abt this and that during ur reviews to only keep them informed.<br><br>they will be more decisive and will take into account the specialist input <strong>when a copy of any specialist memo is submitted for review. by just telling the MO of just an appt is of little use.<br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>for now, deal with the wrist and sternum 1st. step by step. after u get a specialist memo from the neuro specialist, then u make a medical review for the neuro problem.<br></strong></p>
              <p>5)  reviews are done by ur camp medical centre. only if ur case is being referred to medical board for KIV pes downgrade, then it is scheduled for medical board meet (held once monthly) at the formation HQ medical centre. for Guards, HQ Guards is at dieppe barracks, near chong pang there.</p>
              <p>6) for wrist, the pes is usually within pes c1 range. i already mentioned a lot of times that i knew a friend who had wrist fracture is pes c1l3, with permanent excuse chin-ups and push-ups.</p>
              <p> <br>for sternum, it is held and supported by the rib cage. even if it's broken, but if there is no piercing broken bones detected to risk the internal organs, it should be of less concerns.</p>

              <p>I was called for a medical review on the day i posted this question by the S1 branch.

No one ever called me or was a letter sent to me to inform me about this.</p>

              <p> appt cards r "good to have and show MO", but it's generally of little use. using an analogy, say... u got an job interview appt, but whether u got the job or not... <strong>the point is the outcome, that's the important part...</strong></p>
              <p>i defer the "troublesome" problem part...getting the memo is far more useful than <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #808000;">all the waiting game</span></span></strong> for cmpb to raise a memo RMR request, then post it out by snail mail, then wait for specialist to type and reply by snail mail...</p>
              <p>for the case of a typical medical centre, when the MO raise a RMR* from a hospital, the MOPA will type it out, print, then snail mail out the request letter to hospital. next the hospital will revert back to HQ MC at nee soon camp 1st, the MR clerk will then photocopied/ scan into PACES2 for reference 1st, then snail mail out to the respective medical centre.</p>
              <p>*RMR = Request Medical Report</p>

              <p><br>yup, see how that is because u is all talk and no specialist memos to show MO during the cmpb checkup. <em>no written medical proof, get it?<br><br>as i assumed u r given pes b.</em><br><br>for the collar bone, cannot then see MO for a couple of days of excuse upper limbs.<br><br>for the heat rash, use snake powder as a temp relief. cannot then see MO for a couple of days of light duties (att b).<br><br>grass also, cannot then see MO for a couple of days of light duties (att b).<br><br>MOs see physical proof, and want specialists' memo as the supporting documents.</p>
