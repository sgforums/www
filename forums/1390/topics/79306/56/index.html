              <p>Hi Mo,</p>
              <p>Thanks for the response. I've checked that the next medical review session is available only like around mid-end Aug, however, i've been scheduled a RT (my first RT) in maju camp on early-mid july.</p>
              <p>So if i would like to highlight my case (beta thalassemia), can I do it during the RT session? Will there be an MO there as well? Or how do i bring up this case prior to starting my RT? </p>
              <p>Thanks</p>

              <p><br>research on the word "crepitus"<br><br>
              <table border="0" width="100%">
              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td><span style="font-size: small; font-family: arial;"><strong>My knees pop when I squat, should I be worried?</strong></span></td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>
              </p>
              <p>The clicking noise you hear is called crepitus. While crepitus is often listed as a symptom of osteo-arthritis, it is not always an indicator of it. In this case, creptius is caused by bone grinding on bone as the joint integrity is diminished. Crepitus also sometimes accompanies tendonitis. The cause of pain-free crepitus is unknown, but the leading theory is that the sound comes from the release of gas from small bubbles within the joint structures or tendons. If crepitus is accompanied by decreased range of motion in the joint, stiffness, or pain, a physician should be consulted.<br><br><a href="http://painrelief.com.sg/how-would-i-know-whether-i-have-osteoarthritis.html">http://painrelief.com.sg/how-would-i-know-whether-i-have-osteoarthritis.html</a></p>

              <p>Hi eac,</p>
              <p>I have some questions, hope you can answer. I have 3 more serious medical problems.</p>
              <p>1) Seeing a  ortho specialist at a govt hospital. MRI revealed bulging disc at lower back region.</p>
              <p>2) Seen MMI specialist for hearing problems and report stated I had some high tone hearing loss and the MMI MO and specialist gave me excuse grenades&amp;explosives, loud noise environment. I shown this MMI report to my unit MO before but he told me to report sick in OCT/NOV for another hearing test. My unit MO did not endorse this status given by MMI.</p>
              <p>3) I am seeing a skin specialist at National Skin Centre. They diagnosed me as having chronic cholinergic urticaria and gave me excuse from activities that may precipitate a flare of urticaria. I went to endorse this memo at my unit MO but he did not approve the status given by the specialist and he told me to report sick whenever I had rashes.</p>
              <p>Just recently when I went to endorse the ortho specialist memo and MRI report, my unit MO said I will be boarded soon (for back problem).</p>
              <p>I would like to know what will happen when I am being boarded? Will the medical board interview me face to face? Or will the medical board just decide on my pes status without needing to talk to me.</p>
              <p>If I do get to talk to the medical board, will I be able to show them the reports from NSC and MMI ear specialist and to let them consider my pes status based on these 2 reports as well?</p>
              <p>And, I will be having my ATP soon. But, offically am I excused from live range? Since the MMI specialist gave me excuse loud noise environment but the unit MO did not approve it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks</p>

But while my private DOCTOR said it may go worse or remain, the govt specialist (a young woman lol) said that it doesn't affect anything and suggest a Pes A/B for me. (laughs) I don't wanna go deaf due to live firing or get lost in the jungle and can't hear sh*t. Should I go to my private DOCTOR to be referred to a specialist and write a memo, or just use the govt memo? The govt already sent a memo in. Is it alrite for me to go to a private specialist and then send it to CMPB too?</p></div>

              <p>it's of course alright for you to get a memo and send it to us.</p>
              <p>problem is: your doctor says it may get worse or remain the same, ie your condition so far is more or less stable, and your pes grading most probably will end up the same (since we'll have to grade you based on your current condition). so end up you'll be enlisting with your same pes grading.</p>
              <p>if you want to update the status of course it's fine. if not, it's still fine too, cos in the end after you enlist, you can juz report to the MO if it gets worse or anything.</p>

              <p>Hi doctors.</p>
              <p>I've been to CMPB for check ups few months ago, and actually went there 4 times, reason being is for my hypertension,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The MO at that time who attended me, actually wrote my a letter and suggest me to go to the polyclinic.</p>
              <p>However, I didn't go to the polyclinic at all, reason being, my parents don't really approve to have medication for my hypertension cause its gonna be a life time medication.</p>
              <p>Thus, I'm enquiring if, I fail to go to the polyclinic before my enlistment, will I 'kena' anything from the officers during any point of my NS LIFE especially during BMT?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sorry if this sounds stupid, but it really kinda bothers me a bit.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>to shao ming: it's really up to you, but i think you should go ahead and get meds. i mean, at least you have meds ready at hand when you need even if you dun take it. and at least you'll have some professional advice at the doc's.</p>
