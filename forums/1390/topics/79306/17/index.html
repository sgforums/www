Even losing the medical docket does not mean it loses your right to report sick.<br><br>As for your 2nd qns, SAF MO are trained in profession to be a doctor.

What is a "P" case?<br>- Will in appear in the certificate when he ORD? Will it affect his future as a civil servant as well as finding jobs in the public sector?<br>- Is it true that only "P" case NS man can downgrade? I have another friend who also suffer depression, but he wasn't downgraded. Why?<br><br>Thanks... My friend is really frustrated now and he wants to upgrade his PES. Please help him... </div></blockquote>I think if ur fren is suffering from anxiety, he should not be too worried esp he<br>will get a PES status C1 or below. When he ord next time, the certificate is not going show anything detrimental to his future prospect.<br>I also pity those servicemen suffering from this kind of illness.</div>
