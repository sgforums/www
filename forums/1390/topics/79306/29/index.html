If all cases of OSD are downgraded, the army will lose alot of combat fit soldiers (unfortunately, recruiting foreign talent to fill the vacancies is not an option <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) Your MO will be very reluctant to recommend a permanent downgrading and the board president will be extremely reluctant to downgrade as well. They will most likely hope that with time, your condition will get better (as it does in many people). After ORD, your liability of 2- 4 weeks a year during reservist time is not too bad and most people with OSD can cope with it.<br><br>If you want to get a downgrade, your best bet is to go shopping for a private specialist who is willing to write a recommendation to that effect.<br><br>The SAF is used to handling OSD and sports injuries that are considered far too trivial for the hospital physiotherapist at TTSH. You must understand that a place taken up by you for having some pain when you squat may mean that a patient with a stroke may not get a slot for his physiotherapy which will be delayed. That's why we used to send soldiers with these conditions for physio at the soldier performance centre (not sure what they call it nowadays). In any case, as you admitted, physio did not help your dad much either (whom I presume has the same condition).<br><br>During my time, OSD cases do not get downgraded at all. I was considered combat fit even though I was cripppled with a birth defect (club foot) but had an operation to correct it when I was older. By the time an X-ray was done after I got gone through BMT and OCS with a persistent limp after every SOC, my ankle joint is completely deformed. That's just life! The army is certainly more welfare-oriented nowadays..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey MOs,<br><br>I've gt a problem here...<br><br>what happened was i was posted to a unit tat actually clashes w my current health problem. I have been diagnosed w vernal keratoconjunctivis about 6 years ago and it hasn't healed since. I was told to down pes from my current pes status of B all along but I tried to garang a little till things got worse these few weeks. The unit I was posted to requires me to undergo training that exposes me to air pollutants that would have adverse impact on my health.<br><br>The funny thing was that I did declare about my medical problem when I was doing the FFI back at tekong but it seems like the medical board totally DISREGARDED my health problem.<br><br>Recently, i've visted my specialist to get a memo which states something like " he has to excused from all activities that would expose him to dust or irritants". However, the problem now is such tat the MO tells me i have to wait at least THREE months for the pes status to be reviewed which would mean after the end of course.<br><br>Is there any way i can speed up the recertification process?<br><br>If not, can i insist on just trying out the training for once and see if it's suitable for me?<br><br>Also, will the MO request for a report from the hospital I've been visiting?<br><br>I dun wish to  waste my time attending a course despite knowing that i would not pass out due to my physical inability to complete the course even though ive already declared my medical situation right from the start - give me something to do that would mean good for both myself and SAF.<br><br>help please help.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>PS: anywayz the specialist wrote "keratoconjunctivitis" on the memo which is like totally vague, so do u think i should ask for another memo which states explicitly what I'm suffering from?<br><br>here are links tat would help u further understand my medical problem.<br>http://dro.hs.columbia.edu/vernalk.htm<br>http://www.peacehealth.org/kbase/nord/nord562.htm</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Guys,<br><br>As part of my uni thesis, I have recently co-patented a special flash autoclaving(steam heating) unit. It allows surgical instruments to be autoclaved/sterilized at half the time it used to be. This instrument is useful for all our brudders for field training or disaster relief cos you can autoclave it quickly and bring it into the battlefield. Hopefully, this will save more lives and limbs when we go outfield in case there is a shortage of sterilzed instruments. Dirty surgical instruments are the no.1 cause for gangrene and amputations....<br><br>The only problem I face before bringing the technology back home is that i need to noe if SAF medical centres still use autoclaving for surgical instruments, this is becos i'm ending my stint here and i need to hammer down the dimensions for the unit... Hopefully any brothers working as Army medics or even best Medical Officers can provide some information on how we do our autoclaving so that i can adjust accordingly. If you can Email me or IM me on gmail, that would be the best... Lets make SAF stronger and save more of our brother's lives and limbs....<br><br>My contact details are as follows:<br><br>Email: Tabletop@gmail.com<br></div>

OSD very commmon, as I said before. Most cases not downgradable. You should have an X-ray and a specialist opinion. Costs depend on which private specialist you go to...consultation should be about $80 and the X-rays will cost about $200 (depending on how many he orders). A specialist medical report will cost another $30-50.<br><br>In addition, if one specialist thinks it is mild and unlikely to be downgradable, some servicemen would go shopping around for a specialist who would issue a different opinion. The costs will build up of course.<br><br></div>

If the X-rays of the spine show that the scoliosis is mild, your MO cannot do much. You will need a powerful letter from a very senior orthopaedic surgeon who is willing to strongly recommend downgrading to persuade the medical board to downgrade. If your condition satisfies the criteria set out in the 'secret book', it's open and shut case. If not, the medical board can only consider it on a case by case basis. Your specialists must be very well respected and his opinion must be clearly and  strongly in favour of downgrading.</div>

Some people think that having two medical problems can be additive in some way and you can downgrade further. You cannot.<br><br>Second, if all you have is MVP, it is unlikely that you can be downgraded further given that you are already C2L2perm. Some cases of MVP can be associated with mitral regurgitation and you may need to have an echocardiogram to assess the severity. However, since your GP only mentioned MVP but not a murmur, I doubt it but you should have it checked by a cardiologist. As you are now a reservist, you have to pay to see your own specialist. If you also have a mitral regurgitation that is severe enough, there is a possibility of Pes E but I doubt it based on what you have written.<br><br>Go and seek a specialist assessment. If you indeed have MVP, you should inform your dentist so he can put you on prophylactic antibiotics if necessary.</div>

I have been diagnosed w vernal keratoconjunctivis about 6 years ago and it hasn't healed since. I was told to down pes from my current pes status of B all along but I tried to garang a little till things got worse these few weeks. The unit I was posted to requires me to undergo training that exposes me to air pollutants that would have adverse impact on my health.<br><br>The funny thing was that I did declare about my medical problem when I was doing the FFI back at tekong but it seems like the medical board totally DISREGARDED my health problem.<br><br>Recently, i've visted my specialist to get a memo which states something like " he has to excused from all activities that would expose him to dust or irritants". However, the problem now is such tat the MO tells me i have to wait at least THREE months for the pes status to be reviewed which would mean after the end of course.<br><br>Is there any way i can speed up the recertification process?<br><br>If not, can i insist on just trying out the training for once and see if it's suitable for me?<br><br>Also, will the MO request for a report from the hospital I've been visiting?<br><br>I dun wish to  waste my time attending a course despite knowing that i would not pass out due to my physical inability to complete the course even though ive already declared my medical situation right from the start - give me something to do that would mean good for both myself and SAF.<br><br>help please help.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>PS: anywayz the specialist wrote "keratoconjunctivitis" on the memo which is like totally vague, so do u think i should ask for another memo which states explicitly what I'm suffering from?<br><br>here are links tat would help u further understand my medical problem.<br>http://dro.hs.columbia.edu/vernalk.htm<br>http://www.peacehealth.org/kbase/nord/nord562.htm</div></blockquote>Vernal keratoconjunctivitis is downgradable meh?....in the past, we would just prescribe the serviceman with steroids or other immunosuppressants. As for dust, it's true that it might trigger the condition. If it does, we give the serviceman a pair of mist-free clear goggles and he can continue training as usual. I am sure your MO can allow you to wear goggles during training.<br><br>The medical board is highly unlikely to disregard the recommendation of a relevant specialist unless the president of the board (the most senior doctor in charge is usually a specialist) is a more senior doctor than your private specialist and holds a different opinion. You may not realize it but some of the SAF regular MOs are part-time senior eye surgeons.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just went to see a doctor in polyclinic, after visual examination, he says he is quite sure i have Gout. I am 32, and experience sharp pain (sting) often (ten times or more) everyday for the past 3 months. Each time, it comes, i experience very sharp pain on my left feet, the patch near to my 4 smaller toes. I first experince such pain last year july during my running training. However, it becomes worse now as it happens everyday during any walking.<br><br>I will like to ask if Gout is downgradable for my case. Next month is my ICT and i don't think i can catch up with the exercise. I even have problem walking properly when the sharp pain occurs on my left feet, and happen everyday.<br><br>If downgradable is an option, how do i go about telling my ICT MO? Do i need any letter from the polyclinic doctor. He has given me some inflammable medicine for 1 week, and ask me to see him again if the pain persist. Is it useful if he can write me a letter to show to the MO? Or am i wasting my time.</div>
