Our senior instructor warned him that one more day of ATT C means OOC, so he went to report sick in the afternoon.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi all, got 2 questions here. I have persisted numbness on my left shoulder most of the time. The numbness will mostly be at the position near to the place where you can feel the shoulder bone. I have this problem since sec sch, but during that time I thought that its was a only small problem, so i did not went for any treatment. But over the year, from poly to ns till now, the numbness is still there and the pain from the numbness can be so bad that sometimes I wish I can chop off the whole shoulder. Also if I am to rotate my shoulder, I can heard a 'creak - crack' sound.<br><br>2nd qns. I have back pain sometime in the morning when I woke up. The pain can be either at the lower end or just below the shouder level, at the centre of my back. When I did sits up in NS, the moment I reach ard 5 or 6 times, its will start to hurt. The same thing happen when I try to run, cant really run for a long time.  I have tried to put a pillow below my back when I went to slp, but the next morning when I woke up, my back will feel very stiff. My physio at AH told me before that my back problems are due to the fact that gap between the bones are not smooth enough, causing it to sort of 'fused' together. He will helped me by 'cracking' the bone apart. I will feel less pain after that, by 1 -2 weeks later, the pain will return and I will go for my physio again, and the cycle repeat.<br><br>I am thinking of seeking further treatment and if possible, a downgrade, as I am unable to pass IPPT ever since I enlisted. I was a Pes B Storeman during my NSF and now NSmen. But I will like to have a clear idea of my problems 1st so that I can choose the correct treatment.<br><br>Thank you and regards</div>
