One question is that are these problems aggravated with exercise or strenuous activity? Second you were saying you have"occasional gout" in your ankles? How did you come to that conclusion.<br><br>first go get a blood test done to establish your uric acid level. Perhaps you would also need to take an Xray of the most problematic joints.<br><br>If results are normal, and if your problems seem to be aggravated with activity, your joints are probably painful from overuse.
