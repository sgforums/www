When I still did not recover, he ordered an MRI and discovered a tear...by then, there was no way i could find the relevant witnesses and officers for the service injury report as my previous batch of officers had already ord-ed....how?</div>

For someone your age (I presume you are a NSF serviceman), it could be a goitrous nodule (benign overgrowth of the gland) or hyperthyroidism (over functioning of the thyroid gland). Less commonly, young people can develop benign and malignant tumours of the thyroid.<br><br>Who told you there's a thyroid disorder? Find out more from your doctor.</div>
