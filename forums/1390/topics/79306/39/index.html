And when i walk out of the swimming pool and see my footsteps, they are totally full foot prints, with no visible arch. When i went to the CGH podiatrist, she told me to take off my slippers and from her desk, she said " wow your foot is really flat, i can already see it from here". Yet later when i asked if it will affect my PES status, or if i could get a downgrade (im PES A now. I didnt mention flat foot during CMPB check), she said "NOPE".  The thing is i also have knee problems (cartilage is wearing out) and im wondering if its related to my flat feet. The podiatrist prescribed insoles for me. But im worried about IPPT.
