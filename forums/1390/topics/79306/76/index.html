              <p>I currently have a gastronology apptment scheduled in july. Illness is GERD. I had this diagnosed when i went to A&amp;E in SGH with chest discomfort and breathing difficulty.</p>
              <p>Was given 1week of Omeprazole. Symptoms were lifted significantly. Wasnt given memo. i discharged after seeing the general practitioner and given medicine.</p>
              <p>After around 1 week of finishing my medication, i'm experiencing same feeling as before.</p>
              <p>What shld i do?</p>
              <p>Btw i have a bit of wheezing now and then, shaking hands when i got accelerated heart rates but all like minor cases. So never mentioned to anyone.</p>

              <p>Hi I would like to ask something but let me first give y'all a brief background.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm pes C1L2 for hearing loss. 3 weeks ago some fker misfired a blank at my ear. I've been having vertigo (spinning+dizziness) and tinnitus since then. I went to Tekong MO and they referred me to MMI. So on Wednesday, I went to MMI as instructed by SAF and after checkups, the doctor told me that I should see a specialist at CGH which i went before a year ago to get my pes status (that old dog told the CMPB to upgrade me from pes E wtf). So now here's my question, I just went to CGH today to see the specialist and he told me to come one month later to monitor my vertigo. I'm sick of going there. Would I be charged if i don't go one month later? The thing now is, the SAF din instruct me to go to CGH and I actually 'paid' using 11B. So is the checkup under my own free will to go or instructed by SAF?</p>

              <p><br>Of course it will be billed to Mindef for it's referred by SAF / MMI.<br><br>Since the appt is already booked for you 1 month later, please <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">do</span></strong> go follow up.<br><br>Or else, if your condition is worsened later, you can't fault Mindef since you are the one who didn't follow up on the scheduled appt.</p>

              <p>Hi.</p>
              <p>I will be going for my pre-enlistee medical check up soon. I am asthmatic and have been so since I was a child.</p>
              <p>I have been seeing a respiratory specialist for some years. I was diagnosed with mixed obstructive and restrictive ventilatory defect. I have also been diagnosed with moderate volume dependent airway collapse. My specialist believes I should avoid vigorous physical exercise.</p>
              <p>Should I bring my specialist's letter as well as medical reports to my medical check up? I understand there are lots of different tests that are carried out...when should I pass these documents to the staff there? Should I pass it directly to the doctor at the end or is there some other procedure to follow?</p>
              <p>Also, what would my likely PES status be? I doubt I would be PES A...would I be downgraded to PES C given my condition?</p>

              <p>Hi.</p>
              <p>Thks for the reply to my original posting above. I have a couple of other queries. I've read your general guidelines on medical board reviews and you say that its best to have your specialist specifically address the medical review board and specifically say that you should have your PES downgraded - would the same apply for pre-enlistee check-up? Should I get my specialist to mention that I shouldn't do vigorous physical exercise and also recommend PES C? Or should he just do the former?</p>
              <p>Second, you said that my condition "should be within PES C range"? Does that mean that there's a good chance I might be PES B as well? If I do get PES C, would C1 be the most likely?</p>
              <p>Thks!</p>

              <p>Hi.</p>
              <p>Thks for the reply to my original posting above. I have a couple of other queries. I've read your general guidelines on medical board reviews and you say that its best to have your specialist specifically address the medical review board and specifically say that you should have your PES downgraded - would the same apply for pre-enlistee check-up? Should I get my specialist to mention that I shouldn't do vigorous physical exercise and also recommend PES C? Or should he just do the former?</p>
              <p>Second, you said that my condition "should be within PES C range"? Does that mean that there's a good chance I might be PES B as well? If I do get PES C, would C1 be the most likely?</p>
              <p>Thks!</p>

              <p><br>Yes, the guideline applies to pre-enlistees too.<br>Yes, please include about exercises too.<br><br>The specialist might not specifically write "PES C" in the memo. Typically, specialists will usually write "As the patient is diagnosed with ______, hence, please place/ downgrade patient accordingly."<br><br>All I can say is it's within PES C range. As to what PES C level, it's really dependable on what and how the specialist memo says. <em>(As pointed out in point no. 7 in the guideline.)</em></p>

              <p>hello im here to ask advice for my friend who is serving his NS...</p>
              <p>My friend was posted to an infantry unit after his BMT and prior to that he didn't have any chest or heart medical history. When my friend started his training in his unit, he suffered from frequent chest pain and the pain worsened while running or doing strenuous exercises, causing him to fall out for all the runs. He went to the MO once but the MO asked him to take an ECG. The ECG turned out normal and my friend was put on drip (he told me it was freaking painful when they poke him for it) and observed for 4 hours before he was let go without status. Subsequently, the pain continued and he went to the MO a second time despite being afraid of the drip and sent to the sickbay again as the pain was really great and he was really worried. This time the ECG done turned out to be abnormal and the doctor says his heart is beating too fast. The doctor sent him to sickbay (again!) for observation and took a blood test for some thyroid thing. After about 3 hours, the doctor noticed that my friend's hands were trembling and his pulse was super fast and advised him to go see the A&amp;E department of any hospital.</p>
              <p>So my friend went to SGH and they realised that his blood pressure is quite high and did ECG and chest xray for him. But eventually they found nothing and he was sent home. They suspect that the chest pain was musculo-skeletal in nature and said that the pain should stop after awhile. However, my friend still continue to experience chest pain while running or walking at a fast paced and keeps falling out from runs. He was also accused of malingering many times by his platoon mates and he feels very upset and depressed about it. My friend is now very worried about his condition and the numerous trainings he has missed. He also hope to revocate to a less physically-taxing vocation so that his pain will not act up and he can serve his NS with a peace of mind but he doesn't know how to go about it.</p>
              <p>Does anyone here have any advice for my friend?</p>

              <p>I just called my friend in camp and he told me he has seen a specialist last week but the specialist couldn't find out what is wrong with him. He didn't know if he should ask for a letter to revocate since the specialist said he will be fine. However, he is still experiencing chest pain now though. My friend wants to find out if revocation to a physically less taxing vocation such as driver require a specialist's memo as well since it does not involve a downgrade of pes status.</p>
