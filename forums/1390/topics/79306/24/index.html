Immediately after injury, you may have a lot of disabilities but most of that may be temporary. With time, you get better and regain more functions. The law is clear that the compensation depends on the amount of permanent damage. If your specialist cannot be sure if the healing process has completed and that there is no prospect of future regain of function following physiotherapy etc., they will defer the assessment.<br><br>That was why the PD board was delayed for 2+ years, but even then perhaps your specialists felt that you could still get better? If their opinion is that your disability can get better, the board will not award compensation until the specialists can come up with a definite opinion.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I sustained a pretty bad injury during my PTP and now i can't really move my right wrist. It swells up every now and then and I am on painkillers everyday. It was an old dislocation injury 5 yrs ago that caused my right wrist to be injury prone, and this is the 4th time i had injured it.<br><br>I was refered to a hand specialist at NUH by the MO and was told that it was most likely a torn ligament and inflammation around the wrist area. I was given a splint, 3 weeks of attend B and mid to long term hand therapy.<br><br>The qns is how can i complete my BMT with the injury, it hurts even before the injury when i tried to do chin ups and push ups or even lifting up the duffel bag. I sounded it to the MO at cmbp during my medical checkup but the MO didn't really bother and just asked a few qns.<br><br>I have difficulty adapting the use of my left hand to have my meals, area cleaning and other simple tasks. And everyday im at the sideline with other guys on status watching them train, which is pretty depressing.<br><br>Will I be OOC cos i really don't wanna keep retaking BMT my whole 2 years. Any advice?<br><br>Furthermore i'll be continuing my studies after NS and my course requires a fully working pair of hands. I'm afraid further injury or strain might eventually result in disablilty. I feel so down and out</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>went polyclinic to see doc regarding my flat foot and he said that he dunno of any case that flat foot can be downgrade and initially refuse to give me a referal letter to specialist saying that they also cant do much except that they will only give me insole which is not useful to me in the long run but in the end he gave it to me. however my appointment is on 12/01/07 at TTS hospital. i need to settle this in 1-2 wks time. is there any other faster way to get to a specialist? do SAF take a private specialist recommendation into consideration?<br><br>any MO here that can give me any advice? coz the pain is somehow getting worse. hope that everything can be settle b4 i reach the combat phase of the medic course.</div>
