              <p>Dear MO</p>
              <p>I took isotretinoin early this year, and was stopped by my derm cuz of 2 reasons, namely you cannot enlist while you're taking this drug, and my personality totally changed to becoming easily irritated and moody. I also had suicidal thoughts while on isotretinoin.</p>
              <p>i stopped 6 weeks before my enlistment, feeling moody occasionally during these 6 weeks. I was looking forward to enlistment. after 4 days in bmt, i had a breakdown where i couldn't control my tears and the suicidal thoughts continued. i had already declared that i had these symptoms to my pc on day 1. i went to see the MO on tekong and he declared me unstable and sent me home immediately. </p>
              <p>i went to saf mmi at alexandra and the mo there gave me a week off and review 1 week later.</p>
              <p>i am currently pes a as during my checkup in apr last year i didn't not have any major problems.</p>
              <p>what will happen to me?</p>
              <p>thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi eac,</p>
              <p>I fell off the stairs a month ago and had a fracture to my ulna bone. doctor at TTSH gave me in total 7 weeks MC.</p>
              <p>went back to camp to endorse my mc, and MO asked what happened. he then checked his system which somehow linked to some site where he saw my diagnosis. the system wrote that it was a hairline fracture.</p>
              <p>the doctor at TTSH (on my 2nd follow up) said that the bone was healing well, although i was still feeling some pain in the injured region. Just wondering, would i be considered for downgrade, even if it's temporary?</p>
              <p>Also, will there be any possible repercussions of the injury in the future? </p>

              <p>Well, I guessed that the Govt should already linked up all Govt Hospitals with Mindef EMR (Electronic Medical Records)?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, hairline fractures (#, short form code in medical context) is generally heal n recover without much complication.<br><br>The significance of the Temp downgrade is mostly 3 to 6 months, on the fracture site. how deep n long is the hairline...etc. This is deemed by the x-ray or ttsh records, and up to the MO discretion. If not serious enough, then just excuse this or that status for a few weeks only.</p>
