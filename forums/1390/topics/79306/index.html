I'll give you 1 day MC"<br><br>was almost unable to get out of bed the next day and had to, by sheer willpower, drag my carcass out of bed to go see him again for another day's medical leave..<br><br>why?<br><br>do doctors want us to go to work and spread the bug around? or have us endanger ourselves and others around us by being too ill to concentrate on work?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MCs are meant to assist in your recovery in the acute phase. Not to cover you until you are 100%. Imagine if that was the case. Half the Singapore work force would be at home. Of course we know that a bout of flu will take about 5 days to completely recover but by about the 2nd day you should be fit enough to go to work, be it not completely recovered.<br><br>Of course there are exceptions where you still feel like shit for a few days, then just get your MC extended. No big deal.<br><br>As for myself, i have worked for 6 years now. I think I have only been on MC for maybe 2 days. It does not mean that I do not fall sick at all.

            <div class='col-md body'>Asked by Dorian X<br><br>Are MOs all Guai Lan?<br><br>My reply<br><br>Guai Lan?! Hahaha......it really depends<br>I have to admit that some are but a generalization is not fair<br><br>Let's put things into perspective. I will refer to recruits and trainees<br><br>Firstly have you seen the report sick number in Tekong. You can get up to 700 report sick a day. This is not including other FFI they have to conduct and other administrative work. Having only about 4 MOs max. The work load is overwhelming. If you do your sums right, based on an 8 hour day, each MO has to see about 22 pts. an hour. Not much time is there!!<br><br>Secondly to tell you the truth about 40-50% of report sick are really not that ill. Not to say that they are malingerers but well they are not trying hard enough....<br><br>Thirdly an MO is a CPT. They are most likely higher rank than most PCs and even some OCs... How many recruits or trainees actually give them as much respect or fear them as much as their PC or OC. This lack of respect towards the MO and lack of discipline within the medical centre can sometimes drive the MO up the wall... Literally.<br><br>Remember a MO is still a NSF. He does not enjoy being there as much as most trainees do not enjoy trainning. So when the work piles up they are going to be grumpy. Grumpy people are not usually the most friendly.......unfortunately. Professionalism.......well they are still humans!<br><br>This whole problems stems from the lack of interest towards NS. A fact still stands that most people would prefer to be watching a movie in Orchard than crawling in mud with your instructor shouting at you. Commanders must provide the motivation and interest......Rewards must be provided to soldiers who try hard and incentives to those that do not report sick. This way less will report sick, more will bookout early and the MOs will have more time to do their job properly.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another Question<br><br>What happens and why am I given PES A or B at CMPB if I have a medical problem. Esp. if I already have specialist letter<br><br>Reply<br><br>Depends on what your medical condition is. Depends on whether or not your specialist has been black-listed.<br><br>There is a secret book which they would refer to to see whether your condition qualifies for a downgrade. It is NOT dependant on the whim and fancy of your MO.<br><br>In most cases serious medical problems backedup by appropriate investigations and recommendations by a specialist will NOT be ignored<br><br>Don't panic, just enlist and on the first day talk to your PC or OC to get an appointment at the medical center. Bring ALL your documents and investigations to support your medical condition. The MO will either OOC or give you enough light duties to cover you till you are investigated.<br><br>Cheers</div>
