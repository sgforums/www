              <p><br>agreed with rednano. u just think too much, in other words, paranoid.<br><br>my advise is too, follow rednano's saying, just in pro 1st, find S1, Chief Clerk, OC, CO and let them read the memo. anything else, just go to the camp medical centre. just bring along your supporting documents, the same ones u showed the camp MO for your excuse memo n pending medical board case.</p>

              <p>Actually, the ___ course is not held in the usual ICT camp, only some in the entire unit needs to go for the course (which makes me even more pissed especially since I am excused from it), so the S1, Chief Clerk, OC, even the CO, etc would not be there.</p>
              <p>And it's not even pending medical case, medical board has been held some months back, downgrade has taken palce  but Unit did not send the results to me (I called medical centre to confirm), and the Unit is too lazy to remove me from the course.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I have 2 medical conditions and will be going for a medical review with my unit soon. Just need to check here for a better understanding</p>
              <p>1. Having chest pain (happening everytime even at rest) for the past 2 years, after seeing a cardiologist, was diagnosed with Mild Mitral Valve Prolapse. Had gotten a specialist report and pending results for the threadmill stress test.</p>
              <p>2. Ringing sound in the ear after a live fire exercise during the previous ICT. Seen the ENT and was diagnosed with Tinnitus. My audiogram shows that I am having 40db from 3kHz onwards. The ringing sound seems to be permanent now.</p>
              <p>Can I know what I can be downgraded to based on the above 2 conditions? Also, it is possible to claim insurance for the Tinnitus which is obviously caused by in-camp activitiy?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I've received a letter from CMPB recently about my medical review. It says that I must 'bring medical report from pte psy'. Does that mean I am supposed to see a private psychiatrist independently and request for a medical report to bring to my medical review in CMPB? Will there be repercussions if I am unable to do so in time?</p>
              <p>Thanks!</p>

              <p><br>1) get a stronger worded memo from the specialist then, and book a medical review again for an appeal.<br><br>2) no.</p>
