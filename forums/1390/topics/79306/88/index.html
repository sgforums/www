              <p>hi guys, an nsf here.</p>
              <p>been suffering from lower back pains the past 3 months. couldnt
                                      take it one day as i had trouble walking and the pain, which
                                      radiates down my right leg, is quite unbearable at times.</p>
              <p>went to consult a private specialist and did x-rays and mri
                                      scan. diagnosis was facet degeneration at l2/3, l3/4, l4/5 and
                                      l5/s1 levels, and facet overload. the spec wrote me a memo which

              <p>now my case is being sent to the board. mo told me likely to be

              <p>Dear Sir,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would like to ask a few questions. I was downgraded to PES C9L2 due to diffuse disc bulge at L4/5 during the PTP phase as an NSF back in 1999, and was posted to a unit as a clerk in S1 office. I stayed in this vocation as a clerk until ORD in 2001.</p>
              <p>All of a sudden, 8 years after my ORD, I am being asked to take my IPPT. When I enquire, I was told I am in PES B status. Is there any personnel I can seek help with  regard to this matter?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I went to see my specialist again and had another MRI done. Unfortunately, I now have diffuse disc bulge at L4/5 and L5/S1. I went down for another medical review yesterday but the Medical Officer did not say anything. All I received was a medical certificate to excuse me from IPPT, RT, heavy load, running, marching and jumping for 3 months by post today. May I know if I will be downgraded? If I will, will I be informed?</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>
