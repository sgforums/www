              <p><br>extension can be given for the current 2 months rmj excuse.<br><br>as for the memo, try to get it from a govt hospital specialist. flat foot is common nowadays... unless if ur case is severe type, get the specialist to write a much more hard worded memo.</p>

              <p>U can still pass BMT w/o  IPPT. As for posting, depending on your unit. But very highly chance that you will be revocated if you are in a service vocation.</p>

              <p>Hi MO,</p>
              <p>I was diagnoised with bilateral patellar joint pain in late Dec 07.<br>Went to SGH specialist and he put me for 4 months physiotheraphy.</p>
              <p>I was given temporary excuse for lower limbs for 3 mths by the camp MO<br>but after 4 months of physiotheraphy, the condition doesn't improve and the<br>principle physiotherapist said nothing can be done except less running, climbing<br>etc.<br><br>My specialist from SGH agreed with that and he wrote 2 memo letters to my camp<br>MO...indicating "please renew his pes &amp; vocation status accordingly."</p>
              <p>However, my camp MO refuse to downgrade me when i showed him my specialist memo. His reasons are mainly the specialist memo is "not strong enough".</p>
              <p>What should i do about it since i have difficulty in running and standing too long.<br>Can i appeal my status? I feel my camp MO is not listening to my health problem.</p>
              <p>Btw, i'm pes B and a reservist.</p>
              <p>Look forward for your reply.<br>Thanks.</p>

              <p><br>in layman term, it's consistent pain at both knee joints.<br><br>if u have the next appt with the specialist, pls tell him/her the situation at the camp medical centre. hence, pls request the specialist to write a much more hard worded memo to the camo mo, with the latest treatment/medication...etc.<br><br>after getting this 3rd memo, arrange for a review at the camp medical centre. if even with this 3rd memo, the camp mo still reluctant to want to put up ur case statement for medical board. try to politely tell him, "sir... this is my 3rd memo, i think it's possible to pls put up my case for medical board. Let the medical board chairman decides..."   if u can come up words that r something better, then use yours.<br><br>another delayed possibility is... keep on extension the lower limbs excuse for 1 or 2 more times, (either with the medical board pending meanwhile, or just continue the excuse alone). then when these 1 or 2 extensions ends, coupled with the memos, tactfully reason with the mo to pls submit ur case for medical board.<br><br>anyway, u already a reservist. fyi, during my ns time i knew of a guy who had both knee replacement surgery done got a c2l2 permanent.</p>

              <p>Woah. That is a fast reply.</p>
              <p>Yep, intending to do so for next coming medical appt with the camp MO.</p>
              <p>Right now i can't even run more than 400m, attempting to complete 2.4km is hurting my knees and always ended up limping after that. Before that still have to go through the RT programme. And boss and colleagues doesn't seems to be happy when i had to go early for the RT. Work get piled up and shortage of manpower. So in the way, this knee problem is affecting my work too.</p>
              <p>Probably my tone of voice with the camp MO is abit rude and frustrated when<br> he told me he can't put my case to the medical board by just examing my kneecap<br> externally.</p>
              <p>And i questioned his credibility, is he the specialist for knees, sthg along that line.<br> How can he make a judgement just by looking? I questioned his
              profession, shouldn't he take the X-ray first and seek for opinions
              from the SGH specialist before making the decision?</p>
              <p>I'm thinking the camp MO mindset is...most ppl with specialist memos are malingering and so he can't be bothered with it.</p>
              <p>Do you think seeking for another private specialist memo helps?</p>

              <p>I'll most probably be enlisting next year but i haven't gone for my medical check up yet.

But will this by any chance affect my PES grade when i go for the medical check up due to my condition?</p>
              <p>Should i inform the MO that i'm Thalassaemia Minor or the medical centre will do the appropriate blood tests? (Should i also get the proper documents to show that i'm a Minor before i go for the check-up?)</p>

              <p><br>also try to get the specialist to further his/her diagnosis to pinpoint the exact cause of the pain. i dun think x-ray can "see the pain".<br><br>e.g. anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear, meniscus tear, "runner's knee"...etc</p>
