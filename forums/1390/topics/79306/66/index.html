              <p>Dear eac,</p>
              <p>I'm currently a reservist and was sent a SAF 100 to attend a ___ course (outfield) some months ago. Subsequently, I saw the MO and was given an Excuse  ___ course permanently, followed by a downgrade to a non-outfield PES Land Deployment code, as well as a re-vocation recommendation.</p>
              <p>I have sent my unit the MO's letter, can the CO still insist that I attend the ___ course and charge me with AWOL if I don't?  Would the excuse memo from the MO constitute "Official Leave"? I know that reservists have been charged for AWOL if MCs are not endorsed, but this is a letter direct from the endorsed source.</p>
              <p>Knowing how SAF works, what good is a complaint?</p>
              <p>I ask because dead men tell no tales, considering what has happened in SAF over the past few months, who knows whether the servicemen in question were strong-armed by their superiors to perform the training even if they were officially medically excused, the superiors can just simply deny foreknowledge.</p>

              <p>Dear eac,</p>
              <p>Sure you can ask and challenge them "Who will be responsible if anything happens?" but the question is what if they take that chance,nothing happens, they win, something happens, they blame you for not notifying and assuming that you are dead, you will not be around to challenge that, so either way they win.</p>
              <p>That's why I brought up the AWOL/insurbodination question.</p>
              <p>Looking forward to your response. Thanks in advance.</p>

              <p>Dear rednano,</p>
              <p>I did fax the mc to the clerk, initially they were even hesitant to forward it because they thought I was still under the old PES, mind you, their computers were updated to the new PES (I know because they asked me how come the PES stated in the letter was different from the computer's, I got downgraded after the MO's letter was prepared), yet they failed to inform me through mail or otherwise or even take me out of the course.</p>
              <p>Should the response not come before the course commences, would the MO's excuse letter justify non-attendance, after all, it states "Excuse from  ___course permanently." ?</p>
