              <p>hi doctors out there,</p>
              <p>im a first yr serving nsf now. i had
              pneumothorax (spontaneous) in 2007 (i think the lung deflated close to
              50, prob ard 40plus percent) and was given a pes B status. However,
              every now and then i have on and off chest pains, especially when i
              engage in strenous activities and carry heavy things.</p>
              <p>i read online that it is possible for small pneumothorax to
              occur for those who have gotten it before and that there is normally no
              treatment for it except to leave it to heal by itself. i went for x rays but it does not show any signs of pnemothorax as i think the small pneumothorax would have healed itself by the time the xray is done.</p>
              <p>These pains make it difficult for me to continue with my
              training, esp. since im in the infantry unit. i was wondering whether
              it is feasible to consult a specialist and request for a revocation?
              and what are the chances of success? would appreciate a useful reply.</p>
              <p>thanks.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, that breakfast will cost you to apply another half day off from work again.<br><br>To fast is to check the most accurate reading of your blood lipids and glucose readings.<br><br>Note: <strong>You can <span style="text-decoration: underline;">drink plain water only</span></strong> during the 8 hours fasting period.</p>

              <p>Hey, to any doctors or anyone that went through what I am experiencing now:</p>
              <p>I am experiencing chest pain occasionally, and when I breathe out hard, I can always hear a "crack" sound coming from my chest, specifically, my sternum.</p>
              <p>After researching, I found out that it's costochondritis. Reading through the information found online, I read that it'll heal eventually. However, my chest pain is coming at a higher frequency, and I feel that the condition is getting worst.</p>
              <p>Is this "normal", or should I consult on my MO on what to do? Will I be pulled out of course, or get down-pes if I report it?</p>

              Hi doctors or anyone who can help.
              
              If someone has asthma when young and as and when he got a flu whereby the cough will come along.  He has to be on the inhaler to prevent the asthma recurrence.  His family doctore knows his history and his records will given to the SAF before enlistment.
              
              Is it safe that while a person having cough can take his IPPT?
              
              Is it true that when he did not take his IPPT, he will have to go through another 9 weeks of BMIT?  Its hell! no one wants to go through again.... so what can he do?
              
              He is not finding an excuse but really wanted to pass his BMT and get out of this BMT

              Thanks eac for your reply, but the problem is that I was told about it from one of the recruit in BMT sch 2.  Sorry no name mentioned here.
              
              Hope the recruit misinterpret the  meaning himself or that the captain be abit more specific in telling the recruits.
              
              Is it true that the Ninja, Jaguar, Orion coy training are very different from others coy?
              
              I heard that the training are very shiong compare to others.  thats why everyone gives different opinion.
              
              I think it should be fair to all.

              <p><br>1) NSmen = reservist = citizen soldier = civilian. therefore, from ur own pocket...</p>
              <p>2) then last 6 months of service, book as many specialist appointments as possible. use ur 11b card to let saf pay under its civil servant employee benefits scheme.</p>
