              <p><br>specialist opinion <strong>related to army</strong> is usually not included in <strong>official</strong> medical report <strong>which you pay for</strong> because report is supposed to state conditions and details officially, and is just providing an insight of how your condition is. it will then depend on the MB doctors to decide based on the report.</p>
              <p>memo as Rednano mentioned is impromptu note, which the doctor will <strong>usually</strong> write their recommendations <strong>related to army </strong>cos you specifically requested the docftor to write a memo for a particular purpose (be it to request change of vocation or anything), and he/she is kind enough to comply.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I have some enquiries. I am born with my right hand, second finger naturally shorter than my left hand. Just 3/4 of the normal length. I have past experience in handling rifle during my npcc days, where i could not reach the trigger. Did show to cmpb Mo, and he is unsure if i could touch the trigger too. Was prone to skin allery (big red patches around whole body if infected) too. Therefore im posted to pes C1 L2.</p>
              <p>Would like to ask if i have to report my finger problem again during my bmt? What will i be doing if reported?</p>
              <p>Thanks a lot.</p>

              <p>Hi MO, 2 quick questions regarding IPPT for nsmen.</p>
              <p>I read this from ns.sg - "<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">However, you can only be exempted from the annual IPPT if you have a 6 months consecutive or 9 months cumulative of valid medical excuse within the same IPPT qualifying window." <span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">In this case, who should i contact if i want to request to be exempted from annual IPPT?</span></span></p>
              <p>Also, i understand that "<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">You are advised to contact your NS Unit to request for a medical review if you have more than 3 months of medical excuse for a particular injury that prevents you from taking your IPPT."</span></p>
              <p>I have 6 months of cumulative medical excuse and have been to a medical review at my ns unit in august. The MO has requested for a medical board for me (in absence). However it has been almost 2 months and i have not received any call or letter. When i called the unit, the person said that the medical board might take 3-5 months to process and that it is not in their procedure to inform nsmen of when the medical board will take place, only that we will receive a letter after the board has convened.</p>
              <p>Is this correct?</p>
              <p>The reason i ask this is because my specialist recommended to excuse me from IPPT for 9 months, and when i went for the review, the MO said he will give me "3 months first" and sent me for medical board. What if the medical board comes back unfavourable, can i appeal?</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>
