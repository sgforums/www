              have you see an opthamologists yet? what did the specialist said? what was your condition called and history?
              
              based on what you described, its not a strong case to downgrade, dunno if it is a medical condition or not.

              <p>Precisely as i waiting for the appt by MO i haven seen the specialist. sadly i do not have any recorded medical history. But since young my eyes have been allergic and naturally dry. So i frequently have to put eye drops just to keep it moist.</p>
              <p>Ya i know its nt a strong case thats why i am worrying. Cannot be ask me to everyday sore eyes and put the antibiotic eye drops ma. Its very harmful to eyes in a long run... And it is affecting my sleep in camp too. So I think overall i have a strong reason to downgrade. But whether they give it to me or not its another story....</p>

              why dun you call your medical centre and ask when the appointment is made. appointment made in public hospitals is very fast made one. looks like your medical centre medic are slow in making appointments. all they have to do is call the hospital dept, make an appointment on behalf for you.
              
              if there is a long delay, go to polyclinic and ask for a referral. they will make the appointment for you and tell you the appointment date.
