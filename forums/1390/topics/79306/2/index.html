Never heard of that.<br><br>The closest we normally get to the action is at the BCS. This is usually managed by an MOIC And a MO2IC. The fellas collecting casualties from the front line to the BCS are the combat medics.<br><br>MOs that are posted to units like commando and Guards will usually go thru their conversion courses. It is not a must but there is usually pressure from the unit CO to do so. Again their primary job is to man a BCS. NOT to fight or collect casualties<br><br>Cheers</div>

Depends on whether or not your specialist has been black-listed.<br><br>There is a secret book which they would refer to to see whether your condition qualifies for a downgrade. It is NOT dependant on the whim and fancy of your MO.<br><br>In most cases serious medical problems backedup by appropriate investigations and recommendations by a specialist will NOT be ignored<br><br>Don't panic, just enlist and on the first day talk to your PC or OC to get an appointment at the medical center.

The MO will either OOC or give you enough light duties to cover you till you are investigated.<br><br>Cheers </div></blockquote>i have some doubts on here:<br><br>1) from what i know if we developed new conditions or current conditions worsens before enlistment we should bring along the relevant proof to cmpb right?<br><br>2) so which option is better? cmpb or tekong?<br><br>3) if we tell the mo in enlistment and downgraded eventually should our stay in bmtc be more than 7 weeks?</div>

Having heaps of specialist letters or investigations done will NOT make a difference to your PES status. "But what if something happens" seems to be the next question... Well tough luck, try sueing the SAF. It will be difficult.<br><br>That being said, the SAF does put in tremendous effort to take care of their soldiers. If you feel that your condition has worsened in some way which might affect your trainning or health. Highlight it to your MO.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok i have a burning qn...albeit not really regarding SAF.<br>I have flexible flatfoot (when i stand..it becomes nearly flat, when not, arch can be seen). Whenever i run...i look a little funny coz my foot will angle to the side abt 30 degrees..but no serious pains on knee or foot..and can run normally. Can i ask..does my condition affect my running stamina? Or do i run 'poorly' due to lack of training ?<br><br>Thanks.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
