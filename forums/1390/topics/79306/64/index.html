              <p>Hi guys. is new here and wanted to ask smth with the MO here.</p>
              <p>Currently i am taking isotretinoin for my acne. My outbreak has gotten much better after 4 months and much controlled. However the frequency of my face getting red sometimes even for no reason at all is still the same. Is there any way to reduce it, like when my body get used to the medication?</p>
              <p>Also, i got different opinions on working out while on isotre. One of my friend, whose face now had NO pimples/acne at all after like 1 year of medication not to do exercise/activity that will caused me to sweat much, as it will hinder my recovery process. On the other hand, some of my friends and relatives retorted that exercising and sweating helps detox the body 'poison'.</p>
              <p>Stuck in a dilema whether i should continue my usual workout. Normally hit the gyms twice a week plus a short run. But after my friend who told me to reduce my sweating out, i change my run to swim instead.</p>
              <p>Thus, would need advices. thanks in advance.</p>

              <p>Gd evening everyone,</p>
              <p>i need some advice. i just submitted my memo of me taking isotretinoin on tues and signed the form for the medical board. MO said i will be downgraded to PES E9L9. i stated i have guard duty for the month, so he kindly gave me an 30 days excuse guard duty (i ording on 12 nov tis year). i then asked him for any documentation to prove to my superiors that I am indeed going to downgrade to PES E9L9 he said no, I just have to wait for the medical board to come.</p>
              <p>Thinking that the excuse guard duty will be sufficiently to cover me, when i showed that to my centre sergeant major, he went ahead to tell me that my condition should be able to handle guard duty and that he will call the MO to check, and to let MO know the job scope of guard duty. He then advised me to stop my medication for 1 day before my duty to reduce the effects of it on my duty day. Apparently when the CSM called me back, he said he checked with the same MO and that i should be able to perform my duty. He agreed on the part where PES E9L9 cannot do duty. Does this implies that since im not yet PES E9L9, i can still do?</p>
              <p>A few questions to ask,</p>
              <p>1. Is this really legal?</p>
              <p>2. What should i do next?</p>
              <p>3. When will medical board usually come? And how to know immediately whether im downgraded? Because by the time the admin lapse and send the letter to tell me my pes, its already too late.</p>
              <p> 4. The difference between me and me probably 1 month later is - same medical condition, but one PES B(now), one PES E(1 month later). So i just cant understand why i cannot be excused..</p>

              <p><br>with ORD in less than a month, i suggest u just bear with it. use wisely your offs and annual leave days.<br><br>with isotretinoin-takers sensitive to sunlight, hence the best u can do is to try to get the sentry post.<br><br>normally, medical board meet is held within a day once a month. so if ur case pending is not scheduled this month, then will be next month's.</p>

              <p>Hi Mr MO,</p>
              <p>Need your professional advice here...</p>
              <p>I've got a medical memo from SGH ENT specialist dated 4th SEP 2006. Yup, the memo is dated 2yrs ago b'cos I've lost it due to misplacement and just found it again recently while packing my stuffs. Below is what has been written in the memo:</p>
              <p><strong>The Patient has moderate obstructive sleep apnea with an AHI of 21 and lowest oxygen desaturation of 86%. He is exploring the use of CPAP.</strong></p>
              <p>So my questions</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ol>
              <li>Is the 2yr old memo still valid? (I didn't followup after that year)</li>
              <li>What are chances of being downgrade? (I'm age 30 &amp; currently doing my reservist)</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
