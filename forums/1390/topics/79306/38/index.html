            <div class='col-md body'>I am a pre-enlistee. When I went to CMPB for my medical screening, I had some problems at the station where they 'staple' my finger to draw a little bit of blood. After the MO took my first blood sample, he asked for another sample because he thinks there is a problem with my blood, which he confirmed after testing the 2nd sample. So when drawing blood, the other MO drew 2 test-tubes instead of 1 for testing. I was put on Pes D for 1 month, the remarks was "A/W FBC" (I think it means awaiting full blood count?).<br><br>I have since gotten a letter saying that I am upgraded to Pes A L1. But they didn't say anything about the result of the blood test. Am I not entitled to know the result? Is there anyway to find out the result? Or since I'm now in Pes A, it means that there is nothing wrong? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

When I went to CMPB for my medical screening, I had some problems at the station where they 'staple' my finger to draw a little bit of blood. After the MO took my first blood sample, he asked for another sample because he thinks there is a problem with my blood, which he confirmed after testing the 2nd sample. So when drawing blood, the other MO drew 2 test-tubes instead of 1 for testing. I was put on Pes D for 1 month, the remarks was "A/W FBC" (I think it means awaiting full blood count?).<br><br>I have since gotten a letter saying that I am upgraded to Pes A L1. But they didn't say anything about the result of the blood test. Am I not entitled to know the result? Is there anyway to find out the result? Or since I'm now in Pes A, it means that there is nothing wrong? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>U know I spent 30 minutes at that place cos hard to draw my blood .<br><br></div>
