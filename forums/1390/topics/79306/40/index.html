            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br>I have a condition that my skin suffers a bad reaction to insect bites. The affected area will start to swell and then the skin will jus tear and pus start to flow out. I have seen my unit MO and refer to a skin specialist. I have applied the cream prescribe by specialist and helps a little but more areas will get infected whenever i go outfield. This skin problem is unbearable and i always did not have enough sleep becoz it really itch. I wonder is there any solution to help me as I cannot use commercial insect repellent and the SAF ones doesn't help at all. And is this condition downgradable?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ask MO to refer you to the skin specialist again, if the specialist recommend downgrade, then you be put on medical board. But whether you be downgradable or not, it depends on the board. Fyi, most of these skin problem is not downgradable, unless it affect your breathing or anything may cause life and death.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br><br>I am a NSman and my PES status is C2L3.  I understand that L3 means excuse field. Recently, I got called up to an ICT. The OC insist that I go out field to follow the motion.  He explained that there is a change in policy and that commanders has discretion to bring L3 status soldiers outfield.<br><br>I was not convinced and saw a MO.  The MO wrote a letter to my unit to explain that I was excused. To my disbelief, my OC brush the letter aside and said that the MO has interpreted the directives wrongly!<br><br>In the end, the S1 outprocessed me from ICT. The advice for me is to seek medical review to downgrade to L9 so that the unit can post me out.<br><br>Can anyone advise me if there is change in the definition of L3 status?</div>

Thus during active time and i kept quiet. Anyway the pain seems be more endurable then.<br><br>However, through the years and probably also due to my work nature, the injury is getting worse.<br><br>I now experience pain when/after doing strenuous activities (jogging, tug jumps), standing for long time (in MRT) and in my line of work also need to carry heavy stuffs around sometimes.<br><br>I feel pain in center of the lower back and soreness in the left and right quadrants the lower back during/after strenuous activities. The pain comes and goes after a couple of days. Basically, if i dun over exert then normally is all right but if i do then pain/sore for a few days.<br><br>I have gone through a few ICT and and am really worried that i cannot take the outfield anymore and would injure my back more.<br><br>I have a HK ICT coming up soon.<br><br>I have a few questions:<br><br>1) If i report to ICT with some statues (for example: excuse heavy load) given by my family doctor. Will the camp MO covert it into a SAF MC ?<br><br>2) My friend advice me to do a MRI scan. I am worried that the scan would not find anything and secondly it is expensive. But my friend said that no one back's perfect and some defects would be found. Is it true that the MRI Scan will find all defects?<br><br>3) i also have some problem with stiff shoulders and neck sometimes but i think it is more related to my sitting or body posture.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi eac/other docs,<br><br>My case is almost similar to mark_136's; I am a NSman but vocation is infantry PC.. and the upcoming one is high key ICT..<br><br>Again, like him, during active time and a few ICTs I have back pain but I am the "shy" kind, i suffered in silence, and also thinking the pain is due to age. I am in my early 30s btw.<br><br>However, nowadays it is worse, prolly due to the fact there was/is really an injury, or it came with age or the strain i get from work; I am doing enforcement kinda work. i used to play soccer very regularly so maybe it came from there; falling &amp; sliding sure got but I dun remember a major back injury tho..<br><br>Now i'll experience pain after some time (not very long) of sitting/standing or just wake up, or after a few secs of carrying heavy load etc. I dunno how to explain where the pain is but primarily it is about 3 inches up from the tip of the tail bone. could my case be slipped disc too? But a recent x-ray showed nothing tho..<br><br>I actually went to poly (that's where I got the x-ray) &amp; got a referral to SGH specialist but the hospital appt is on the 1st day of ICT, which is 2 weeks from now..<br><br>1) Should I wait for the SGH appt or now hiong hiong go private hospital? Cuz I am shy to tell my OC/CO i got to go hospital for appt just after i in-pro. If I go the SGH one, will they give me any scans eg. MRI? If so, how long away from 1st appt? Will they cover me with light duties while waiting for the scan? If so, is it "pakai"? ie. will the camp MO (prolly a reservist) endorse/"honour" it? How should the light duty thingy be worded, btw?<br><br>2) If i hiong hiong go pte hospital, how long away is the MRI scan? Again, will I be covered with light duties till the scan? but like mark_136, cost is a worry too, as in if detect something still ok but if not, heart very pain..<br><br>3) Then, same like mark_136, i also have some problem with stiff neck sometimes. Issit linked to the back prob?<br><br>4) Last thing, like i mentioned in earlier para, i very shy so never done such thing b4; everytime also due to pride &amp; shyness endure everything. In fact i shy until i tried to defer using work commitment (really got commitment but got rejected). So now I dunno wat is the "procedure" ie. should i upon in-pro, go see the MO or should i see OC?<br><br>5) Sorry for all the noob questions... Thanx a lot-in-adv! Will appreciate any other advice too! Esp. now time is of essence... only 2 weeks to ICT.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the advice will4.<br>I have one question<br><br>1) A lumbar scan you mentioned is a scan on the lower back area right?<br>I was hoping to have a full back scan so that i can scan my neck and shoulder area all togather lol.<br><br>Rogue13. Following is based on my experience(i am from Amour unit).<br><br>1) You are correct. Reservist MO will see their Reservist experience. I have a friend who has a slipped disc. It was only detected during the MRI scan not thru the X-Ray<br><br>2) Having asked around. The cost of non-subsidized MRI scan is $600 but need some admin charges will become cost to $700.<br><br>3) I am also the "shy" type so i understand your feeling and concerns. Especially since you are the PC. I dun know about you but i feel our body is more important.Somemore, you are 10 extra cycles to fulfill. NS/ICT is to me a waste of time.<br><br>4) Since you are the PC, i suppose you have the contacts of your OC at least or maybe even your CO? Maybe can ask them to let you in-process one day later to go for your scan?<br><br>Thanks it helps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I think if pay private fee, the waiting time will be shorter??<br>(not too sure about that - maybe the doctors can advice)<br><br>Since you already have an appointment, the best thing should be<br>to ask your OC/CO to allow you to in-process one day later then the rest.<br>This will allow you to go for your appointment and ask the doctor to get you status for the rest of your ICT. Then go back and the second day and report sick.<br><br>Yes, sometimes i have back pain when i lie down. Usually need turn left/right or kinda "push up your body" to straighten your back to get rid of it.</div>

The diagnosis for my skin problem is PLC (pityriasis lichenoides chronica). Im told that pityriasis is a disorder of the skin causing many patches of scaly, rose-coloured, inflamed skin. Lichen Planus is a recurring itchy disease while chronica refers to chonic. Therefore, its a very serious recurring skin disorder which when exposed to the elements would cause swelling and bleeding. Indeed it causes many inconvenience to me and pain when my uniform rub against those swelled lesions..<br><br>Me specialist had recommend to change my vocation to office work.. and my MO has oredy decided to sent my medical condition or a medical boarding..<br><br>Some questions i wuld like to ask..<br><br>1. Im seen previous replies that i wunt be downgraded.. but will it be still possible for a change of vocation? Cos seriously my skin condition will get worsen if i stayed on.<br><br>2. How long wuld it take for the result of boarding to come. Im told by the medic it will take roughly 1-2 weeks.. but yet im told that some pple been waiting for mths.. so which is actually true?<br><br>3. So wad if the result comes? Wad will the result state? Will i be able to change vocation immediately? Any follow-ups be done?<br><br>Hope u all can give answers to my queries.. Thanx!</div>
