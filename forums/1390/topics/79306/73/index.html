              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Refering to my previous post about my Alpha Thal condition, i called them up and they said they knew about my condition when they did the blood test and still went ahead with the PES B status. It seems that they're still reluctant to review my status unless i have a specialist memo. So i guess i should just go ahead by getting a memo to review my status? Is it possible to have PES variations on pre enlistees with my condition?</p>
              <p><br>Thanks!</p>

              <p><br>You should double check with the person at the fax side. Jot his / her name down, in case anything happens.<br><br>Anyway FYI, usually for MC 3 days and less, there's no need for MO to endorse. Just submit to coy office / br office.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Actually I had contact NS hotline weeks back and HQ Guards only called me up last Friday morning. I told them my problems and concern and they were the one who told me just fax in will do after I mentioned I will let the doctor decide on my condition. So Yesterday morning I decided to go A&amp;E as I need clear statement from the hospital doctors and in actual I am really in pain till can't sleep the whole night. Today the S1 clerk called me up and I have told whats going on but later the clerk called up again and mention that the CO still wants me to book in to endorse... And he noted that whatever decision I made, he had done his job by informing me. I am already a C9L3 personnel and all these 3 yrs I have been visiting the docs. I am really vexed what to do next. I feel so painful in walking in any shoes or boots. Every night I need my wife to massage my leg so as to let my leg reduce the pain level for the next day activities. I decide not to heed CO demands and I do whats best in my interests to rest and nursing my leg. I hope I do not end up against the law. Am I?</p></div>

              <p>Actually I had contact NS hotline weeks back and HQ Guards only called me up last Friday morning. I told them my problems and concern and they were the one who told me just fax in will do after I mentioned I will let the doctor decide on my condition. So Yesterday morning I decided to go A&amp;E as I need clear statement from the hospital doctors and in actual I am really in pain till can't sleep the whole night. Today the S1 clerk called me up and I have told whats going on but later the clerk called up again and mention that the CO still wants me to book in to endorse... And he noted that whatever decision I made, he had done his job by informing me. I am already a C9L3 personnel and all these 3 yrs I have been visiting the docs. I am really vexed what to do next. I feel so painful in walking in any shoes or boots. Every night I need my wife to massage my leg so as to let my leg reduce the pain level for the next day activities. I decide not to heed CO demands and I do whats best in my interests to rest and nursing my leg. I hope I do not end up against the law. Am I?</p>

              <p><br>think u better book in with clutches and endorse at the medical centre, limp toward the chief clerk and the CO with the MC, and show the du lan "i came, i endorsed, and i want to fucking go home" face...<br><br>that reservist CO can just make u troublesome just by instructing the clerk to slap u with some charges like insubordination, refuse to obey simple instructions to get the MC endorsed... etc...</p>

              <p><br>since ur reservist unit is part of hq guards, mc endorsement is at either dieppe medical centre or bedok medical centre. and usually, its the camp doctor who do the mc endorsement, not the reservist doctor...</p>

              <p>Hi Kright,</p>
              <p>not sure if i can help much. but i share with u my experience.<br>I am from 21DS med under HQ guard and been to ICT few times. I deferred a few times too.</p>
              <p>1st, i got a fever n got 3 day MC for a LK. I went bck n the reservist MO(my S1) allows me to defer(they didn't ask me go camp MO). during the Makeup training, i defer again given by HQ guard ( Dieppe barrack MO) for excuse ICT and i informed the NSHRC immediately and they asked me not to go. On the actual day of makeup training, someone called me n i told them i am excuse ICT n they didn't bother me.</p>
              <p>FYI,reservist MO may work to ur advantage at time. I think u should belong to 1 of the medical unit n the reservist MO may be ur PC or OC or 2IC like mine. Since now the CO already asked u to go bck, it seems to be disobeying order if u don;t. maybe he wants to know ur situation and if he thinks u r really bad condition, he will still let u go as he wont' want to get into all sort of prob.</p>
              <p>Of coz, u can as what rednano mentioned, use cluthes, limp or watever to show the seriousness of your condition.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, it is still ur CO or OC who made the decision whether to have u back for your ICT. Frankly, the correct procedure to excuse ICT is to go visit dieppe barrack ( for your case ) , give MO all the MC, excuses, specialist letter before your ICT few days in advance. Normally dieppe barrack MO ( currently is CPT andrew ) will give u the excuses. I hope this can help u.</p>
              <p>If you need info on dieppe barrack medical centre, u can PM me.</p>

              <p>Patiepie &amp; Rednano,</p>
              <p>Thanks for the reply and sharing your experience and advice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To book a session at Dieppe barrack it will takes weeks to get one so currently this option doesn't seems to help at this time. Beside I having more unusual pain at different spots of my foot(middle of the 3rd &amp; 4th toe bone) now, the medicine is not working well for me as well. If I were to be charged, this is also no choice. Can u imagine a person with 2 heels in pain carrying a full pack with SBO+ 2 cluthes reporting to unit? Plus I need to wear boots due to I am not excuse in boots which is really out for me. I am not trying to Escape this ICT. But this is on going for so long for the injuries and I am always unable to sleep due to this pain. In my past I have been requesting jabs nearly every 2 days to keep my job and daily life going. So far the best jabs I received was opium(I heard him pronouse something like that) and it was real relieved and for once I feel normal back to old times again but then the doc remind me that this is addictive so can't use frequent and so far I only got it once. The effect only lasted 2 hrs.</p>
              <p>IN fact right now I feel I want to go back hospital, I am feeling crazy over the foot pain. It's probing every seconds with it.................. Ahhh..........</p>
              <p>I guess I have to tell the docs to give me something strong....</p>

              <p>Hi kright,</p>
              <p>u can directly call up NSHRC in HQ guard and they can give u a date like tomorrow or the day after next. so ur info is wrong. Coz i have been doing many times. i am as someone said in this forum, a freq flyer in dieppe med centre.</p>
              <p>Frankly, telling us how painful u r now is of no use as we can't help u. U hv to tell the MO. If u really think u r so serious, u can go and stay in hospital for a few days. Tell ur unit that you are hospitalise and can't go ICT. They can't do anything unless they come issue a AWOL charge again u. yes, they can do that.</p>
              <p>Anyway, i hope everythnig will be fine for u. I shall not hog this thread as it is meant for medical issue. If you need info on dieppe barrack, u can PM.</p>

              <p><br>Medical Board only approve the option of Revocation, actual assigned revocation depends on the S1 Branch.<br><br>Whatever it is, L code is there for a reason. Even if you are, say a storeman for example, asked to go deliver some stuff outfield on a tonner. Although strictly by right you cannot go outfield, sometimes just give and take, deliver the stuff on goodwill.</p>
