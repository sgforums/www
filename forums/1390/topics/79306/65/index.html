              <p>Hello everyone,</p>
              <p>I got a few questions which I hope to clear up. Thanks in advance for reading through and answering.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>This question is related to ORD date. When I got enlisted into Army, I am PES A and belong to enhance batch. Thus, I will be serving 1 Year 10 Months. However, as I OOC (Out Of Couse) from BMT due to jaw related surgery and might be downgraded to PES C, will my ORD date be extended , since I am no longer PES A ?</li>
              <li>As I have double elbow joint, or commonly known as hyper-mobility elbow, I feel pain whenever I am doing some upper limb related exercise, will this result me in being down-PESed?</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi i have a couple questions,</p>
              <p>1) I heard from a doctor from a hospital that when they give MC/Status to NSF/NSmen they will be required to answer for it later. Is it truth ?</p>
              <p><br>2) Secondly, would having tight hamstring be a possible cause for lower back pain? And it might even lead to slip disc ?</p>

              <p>Hi eac,</p>
              <p>I posted about my knee pain some months back and follow your 8 simple rules.</p>
              <p>The alexandra hospital specialist had written:</p>
              <p>' XXXXX has bilateral patetho faunal joint pain. Worsened by running, climbing &amp; lower limb exertion. Please renew his Pes &amp; Vocation accordingly.'</p>
              <p>Last week my ICT, i handed over this memo letter with my X-Ray CD to my unit MO.<br>However, he didn't board me for medical review. Instead, he excused me for 3 mths for lower limbs activities and IPPT.</p>
              <p>When i asked him how about the medical board review regarding the pes status, he mentioned he don't see the need for it.</p>
              <p>My questions are:</p>
              <p>1. Can the unit MO override the specialist memo request?<br>2. Should i get another specialist for another memo to strengthen my case?<br>3. If the unit MO still refuse to board me for medical review, what are the options or next call of action taken? Mindef hotline?</p>
              <p>Thanks for reading.</p>

              <p>The alexandra hospital specialist had written:</p>
              <p>' XXXXX has bilateral patetho faunal joint pain. Worsened by running, climbing &amp; lower limb exertion. Please renew his Pes &amp; Vocation accordingly.'</p>
              <p>Last week my ICT, i handed over this memo letter with my X-Ray CD to my unit MO.<br>However, he didn't board me for medical review. Instead, he excused me for 3 mths for lower limbs activities and IPPT.</p>
              <p>When i asked him how about the medical board review regarding the pes status, he mentioned he don't see the need for it.</p>
              <p>My questions are:</p>
              <p>1. Can the unit MO override the specialist memo request?<br>2. Should i get another specialist for another memo to strengthen my case?<br>3. If the unit MO still refuse to board me for medical review, what are the options or next call of action taken? Mindef hotline?</p>
              <p>Thanks for reading.</p>

              <p><br>1) camp MO have the right to do it. BUT don't disheartened, just try n try, get a stronger worded memo, and book for another medical review again with ur unit medical centre.<br>2) get from the same hospital specialist clinic again. but this time, request for a stronger worded memo, just be brief n explain abt ur problem with the reservist camp medical centre.<br>3) persist n insist for a KIV medical board pending for ur case statement. just queue, n just tell the camp MO u want to seek for the medical board chairman's opinion.</p>

                                      anything to my knees but just telling me to take painkiller while i
                                      wait for MRI and next appt. Since 2 months ago, i on clutches
                                      oready.</p>
              <p>Just two weeks ago, i went for appendectomy and today is my
                                      review, i ask for a downgrade letter, and she told me that she is a
                                      general surgeon so she cannot downgrade me.</p>
              <p>Since 2005 sept, i got depression and anxiety disorder, i did
                                      not go for any specialist as it is very expensive and i do not want
                                      my family to know. in army, it relapse, i hope to see a psychiatist
                                      but gov hospital appt is next year, by that time i killed myself
                                      oready. So i intend to see private specialist.</p>

                                      the MO since my Pes Status expired 1yr and 6 month ago, however, i still promoted to 3SG. Now i had ORD 2 month+, i was thinking of going see pte specialist for my condition, High Blood Pressure. Durring enlisment check-up, i did wear device took reading every half an hour thats During CMPB MO refer me to Government Specialist which i didn't go. Currently, i wan to see pte specialist ask them write stronger-word memo to prem downgrade but how? need to be refer by Family doctor or clinic doctor?</p>

              <p>I will try to do that on my next visit.<br>and i was really surprised MO can overide the specialist request.</p>
              <p>Is the camp MO more qualified that hospital specialist?<br>If MO can overide the specialist decision, what is the point of seeking a specialist expertise?</p>
              <p>I'm just puzzled how MINDEF conduct its medical review...almost feels like writing in<br>to the Straits Times to question. Who will hold the responsibilities/consequences if<br>anything happen to me. <br><br>Sigh.<br><br></p>
