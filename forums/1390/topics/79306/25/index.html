If you still have problems with your back you will need to see your own GP and if necessary, your specialist outside MINDEF. You can always request to see your MO for a medical review if anything of significance turns up in civilian life. Remember to bring along a medical report from your doctor to see the MO.<br></div>

Not knowing the exact medical condition, it is difficult to be specific. The MO will excuse a serviceman from certain activities if the medical illness requires it. Just because someone is excused from range on account of hearing loss does not mean he should be excused from drawing weapons as well.<br><br>It is strange to have a quarter of a platoon given excused outfield, weapons and range. If a soldier has a medical condition that requires him to be excused from field training, weapons and range, then he should be downgraded.</div>

It swells up every now and then and I am on painkillers everyday. It was an old dislocation injury 5 yrs ago that caused my right wrist to be injury prone, and this is the 4th time i had injured it.<br><br>I was refered to a hand specialist at NUH by the MO and was told that it was most likely a torn ligament and inflammation around the wrist area. I was given a splint, 3 weeks of attend B and mid to long term hand therapy.<br><br>The qns is how can i complete my BMT with the injury, it hurts even before the injury when i tried to do chin ups and push ups or even lifting up the duffel bag. I sounded it to the MO at cmbp during my medical checkup but the MO didn't really bother and just asked a few qns.<br><br>I have difficulty adapting the use of my left hand to have my meals, area cleaning and other simple tasks. And everyday im at the sideline with other guys on status watching them train, which is pretty depressing.<br><br>Will I be OOC cos i really don't wanna keep retaking BMT my whole 2 years. Any advice?<br><br>Furthermore i'll be continuing my studies after NS and my course requires a fully working pair of hands. I'm afraid further injury or strain might eventually result in disablilty. I feel so down and out</div></blockquote>Previous ligamentous injury to the wrist joint may make it easier to sprain the joint again. If confirmed by your MO and specialist, you can be boarded and given temporary downgrading. Physiotherapy to strengthen the muscles around the joint may help prevent future sprains. OOC is a decision your MO will have to make. You may be able to complete your course with excuse from certain activities and stations in IPPT.</div>

Depending on the specialist's assessment, your MO may decide whether or not to board you. If he disagrees with the specialist recommendation, he will most likely refer you to a SAF orthopaedic surgeon for a second opinion.</div>

There is a familial association, linke to the HLA B27 genotype. First, the diagnosis must be confirmed by the rheumatologist. This condition is not that common and strict criteria have to be followed to confirm the diagnosis. If you do have the disease, then the specialist will have to assess the severity and the damage so far. That will decide how it may affect your training and PES grading.</div>

But that really should be at the far bottom of the list, and I probably shouldn't have even mentioned it.<br><br>I think you should see your GP or polyclinic doctor to get things checked out.  They'll refer you on if needed.</div>

The last outbreak was 8 years ago and I was treated at kkh. 2 weeks ago, I had another attack but I did not seek any medical attention. Could I get the army to 'draw' my medical records from 8 years ago from kkh themselves to prove a history of epilepsy? Thanks.</div></blockquote>If you alert your MO, he can write to KKH for a medical report.  On the other hand, KKH may already have destroyed your old records since you haven't been seen for 8 years!<br><br>In any case, it may be good to be kiasu and get checked out by a doctor anyway. Although most likely due to your old epilepsy, it may be necessary to exclude more sinister causes of fits after such a long disease free interval.</div>
