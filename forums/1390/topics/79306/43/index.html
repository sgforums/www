            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I recently POCed from BMT with PES Status C2L1. The reason being my knee injury. From my specialist letter, he says that my I have traumatic chondromalacia of my right knee and Patella Maltracking. He says that it's due to my high arched feet, most shock will be transferred to my knee and lower back instead of the soles and it cannot be treated. According to the letter, clinical examination reveal positive Patella Grind test as well as Patella Tendonitis of my right knee, with wasting of Quadriceps muscle.<br><br>During BMT, I experienced pain just below my right knee, at the tendon region. But it was controllable as we did not really do much physical activities. But now I'm posted to signal and I did the 5 bx etc and my knee acted up and the pain came back and its worse. When I shift weight onto it, it hurts.<br><br>Prior to NS, I was a national schools badminton player for my school, and my injury arose from there. I understand that signallers are required to carry lines, lay them and run on uneven ground. I'm very worried that my knee will be permanently injured. I've undergone physiotherapy but it doesn't seem to help.<br><br>I'm currently having the pain and I was wondering if I should go to a and e to get a check then book back in and visit the MO because I can't walk properly now.

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks eac, I think I shall head down to the a&amp;e tomorrow and book an appointment with their specialist and get them to assess my situation and write a more to the point letter.

(as stated in the directive GOM...)<br><br>the mo can prescribe u sleeping pills, but most medical centre dont have, so he will issue u a doctor prescription form, then u go to hospital/polyclinic pharmacy to get them. just show the form and 11b.</div>

Try to find things to do that will enable your body and mind to relax when its close to bedtime so it will be easier for you to go to sleep.</div>
