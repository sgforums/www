I prescribe these to my respiratory patients and they find the most relief with this.<br>* some people are worried about steroid use, but my answer is that nasal steroids have much less side-effects than oral steroids, and the effect is mainly local - at the nose. Better than going around looking like Rudolf the red-nosed reindeer every single morning!</div>

My uric acid is normal. However, the blood test shows that my red blood cell is  low. I wonder what i can do next. On one hand, if I have gout, i should avoid meat, liver etc. On the other hand, if I have Anemia, i should eat more meat and food rich in iron. Very expected outcome.<br><br>Now my question has changed from Gout to is Anemia downgradable? My recent sign was that after my ippt test run, i vomit 2 times and find myself too tired to stand or walk, feeling that i am going to faint anytime. I never have such feeling before. So i ended up in the medical center and rest for some time. After which, i feel well again after an hour to drive home. Luckily i pass the test.<br><br>Happy Labour Day, which also my 33 birthday!</div></blockquote>happy Labour Day to you too!<br>some help here-how low was your haemoglobin ?<br>and you can take iron Supplements (i.e. tablets) without eating meat - but must agree life will be quite miserable. By the way, the recent Symptoms you experienced after your 2.4 run may not be directly due to anemia - almost everyone is quite fatigued after the run.<br>PTI, commandos, SOF etc exempted, of course. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> [/quote][/b]</div>

Generally, at your age, your spine will be stable (in the sense that the curve will not get worse anymore). But because of the unnatural loading stresses on your backbone, you can develop severe pain, numbness/weakness etc if you're undergoing training.<br>I'm sorry I cannot do more but reassure you over this forum - if you want to speed it up and if you can afford it, consider going to a private specialist (you can opt for private consultation in SGH also). He can also write your camp MO the memo, at least to confirm the temp downgrade until the rest of the investigations are complete.<br>The option of surgery is absolutely YOUR choice, and nobody else's. SAF CANNOT force you to go for surgery to correct the spinal curve. Hence, the onus is on them to ensure that you don't come to harm.<br>Sorry I cannot help you very much more except to reassure you over this forum...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

Unless your gout is persistent, I think you can safely withhold meds once the pain stops.</div>

But if it hasn't bothered you in a long time then I think you'll be okay.<br>But remember -  NS training will be quite Xiong so be prepared!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
