              <p>They will only subsidize if its a injury due to service. Black stools might mean blood in stools which are cause by factors that you are unlikely able to link to NS.</p>

              <p>All medical conditions diagnose in NS should be kept private and not release to the unis unless you choose to declare. If your condition is under control then its fine but if you are still seeking treatment etc, i personally would say its your responsibility to inform the uni so that they can make appointment for you to visit the sch counsellors etc if required.</p>

              <p>Deferment is to delay your studies.</p>
              <p>Disruption is to take 'leave' from NS to persue your uni degree ONLY IF you ORD in sept when uni starts in Aug.</p>
              <p>You refering to deferment or disruption?</p>

              <p>if you need immediate treatment, go to polyclinic with your 11B and ask for referral to a speacialist. go see an opthalmologist (eye specialist) for opinion and treatment.</p>

              <p>Key Point No. 6<br><strong>6)</strong> Make a trip down to the respective unit camp medical centre. Give the MO whatever supporting documents you have in hand. E.g. <em><strong>Specialist memo/report <span style="color: #0000ff;">(most usually the case and highly recommended),</span></strong></em> x-ray films, CT/MRI scan report, blood investigation lab report... etc.</p>

              <p>Dear all, I have the following medical problems and I would really
              appreciate some advice on whether/how I should sound them off.</p>
              <p>1.
              I experience chest tightness, shortness of breath and feel light headed
              during intense physical activities. I have fainted twice when I was
              young and my granny died recently of heart problems. I have seen a
              specialist and he suspected me of mvp, thick heart walls, extra sound
              and leaking valves through ECG and preliminary observation. However,
              the an echo test showed no problems with the heart structure. I'm
              genuinely worried that something might happen to be if I were to keep
              exerting myself.</p>
              <p>2. I sneeze excessively and frequently
              experience blocked nose and frontal headache under dusty environments.
              My (maternal) aunt and uncle have lost their sense of smell after
              similar problems. A doctor did a skin-prick test and concluded that I
              have allergic rhnitis and that I'm allergic to dust. Another doctor
              concluded that I have "deviated nasal septum, turbinate hypertrophy and
              nasal neuralgic headache". All the sprays and medication that they gave
              did not seem to work.</p>
              <p>3. I injured my left wrist after repeated
              strains and a fall during a bike course. Then I realised my wrist is
              visibly not aligned witih my palm so I'm not sure f this is a natural
              deformity that makes me prone to wrist injuries or if it's a result of
              the fall/strains. My wrist and arm hurts alot with lateral movement,
              even during simple movements like pushing the door. I'm still observing
              my conditions to see if it will get better or worse. </p>
              <p><br>Thanks so much!!</p>
              <p>p.s. I'm pes A btw.</p>

              <p>It's within PES C range.<br><br>Duration of Temporary or Permanent is very dependable on a specialist memo after a review appointment with the hospital. Usually, there will be one follow up review with the specialist after the operation. So, at that review appointment, please just get the doctor to write you a medical memo to the camp MO. </p>

              <p>Can I say that you have already submit a service injury report since u mentioned it is due to Parachute? My personal feeling is that, service injury has a "higher weightage" where downgrade is concern. As the injury is due to service, they may consider to downgrade u further rather than as what is written in the pink book.</p>
              <p>No matter what, I believe you will be downgraded. Most probably permanent. Anything from C2L9 to E1L9.</p>
