            <div class='col-md body'>hi MO,<br><br>I was hospitalised when i was 5 years old becoz of fits due to my high fever.  However when i went for my medical checkup at cmpb, i did not declare that i had fits before as tt was such a long time ago and i haf loss all records about my fits. I was thus given PES A. However, since enlisting into national service, i suffered frequent fevers which reach up to 40 degrees; therefore, i am worried that i might suffer another fit.<br><br>I would like to know if my condition warrants a non-combat PES and that is it possible to request to the hospital for my medical records then?</div>
