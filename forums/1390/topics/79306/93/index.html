              <p>hi guys,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i just wanna ask, if i have a medium to high allergic reaction
              to grass what pes range would i be in? The specialist has already
              asked the MO to give me an open date excuse outfield. So i know its
              most probably a L3 or L9, but what i'm curious about is since i'm
              still fit ( can do IPPT no EX UL/LL) will it be a C1L3/9 or issit
              C3L3/9 coz normally i hear ppl talk its like C3L9 or C9L9 so is
              there also a C1L9? If so, whats the difference between the
              vocations i'm eligible for between these classifications?
              Thanks</p>
              </div>

              <p>Got C3 de meh? Most of the time hear C1 C2 C9 only or maybe just i forgotten...</p>
              <p>C1L9 exist i think but whether you can get it is a different matter.</p>
              <p>You should be eligible for all CSS vocations and the only combat vocation should be signallers which takes in up to C2 as far as i remember.</p>

              <p>There are still base level duties that are done in camp. In fact i've seen L3 and L9 go outfield at times when there is a lack of manpower but quite rarely and normally what they do also less siong compared to the rest since they mostly stay with HQ.</p>

              <p>Better for you to ask after you know what unit you are posted to since different vocations have different types of training etc and not everything will cause you to OOC.</p>

              <p>HI,</p>
              <p>I have a list of skin conditions and have been diagnosed by various doctors to have seb derm, rosacea as well as acne vulgaris. a couple of months ago, my specialist suggested that i try isotretenoin which gave me a temp downpes to E9L9 for 6 mths. my problem now is that, during my subsequent visits, my condition got better and my specialist persuaded me to continue using my oral antibiotics instead of going for the isotretenoin. he also suggested that i not inform my MO about it unless asked directly incase my temp downgrade gets cancelled. my question now is whether its a chargeable offence for not letting my MO know that im not on iso even though my downgrade is because of the medication?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in addition, ive  been trying to get a permanent downgrade because my skin condition will continue to bother me for life and im not able to go outfield of get exposed to sunlight. my specialist has written letters to the MO but the MO informed me that he cant do anything untill my temp downpes expires, and that it'd be hard for me to downgrade since my conditions of rosacea and seb derm are not listed in the medical directive given to MOs. In addition, my acne vulgaris has quietened down since my temp downpes as ive not been undergoing training, exposing my self to outfield conditions and sunlight and im thus not able to downgrade via acne as well. My question now is whether there is any way i can get a permanent downgrade for my persistant skin conditions which are not listed in the directive??</p>

              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>My PES status was E9L9 because of pneumothorax during BMT.</p>
              <p>The pes status expired recently and I was upgraded to PES B.</p>
              <p>The MO didn't do a thorough check, he just uses his sethoscope to listen hear and there, and upgraded me, even when i told him
              that my chest still feels pain at times and i feel giddy easily.</p>
              <p>I feel that he should at least give me an xray to confirm that everything is fine before upgrading. Isn't there any procedures to follow to upgrade a pes?</p>
              <p>Anyway i went to see a TCM doc and he found out that i have low blood pressure, 100/70,  which explains the giddiness, can i downgrade because of this?</p>

              <p>HI,</p>
              <p>I have a list of skin conditions and have been diagnosed by various doctors to have seb derm, rosacea as well as acne vulgaris. a couple of months ago, my specialist suggested that i try isotretenoin which gave me a temp downpes to E9L9 for 6 mths. my problem now is that, during my subsequent visits, my condition got better and my specialist persuaded me to continue using my oral antibiotics instead of going for the isotretenoin. <strong>he also suggested that i not inform my MO about it unless asked directly incase my temp downgrade gets cancelled. my question now is whether its a chargeable offence for not letting my MO know that im not on iso even though my downgrade is because of the medication?</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in addition, ive  been trying to get a permanent downgrade because my skin condition will continue to bother me for life and im not able to go outfield of get exposed to sunlight. my specialist has written letters to the MO but the MO informed me that he cant do anything untill my temp downpes expires, and that it'd be hard for me to downgrade since my conditions of rosacea and seb derm are not listed in the medical directive given to MOs. In addition, my acne vulgaris has quietened down since my temp downpes as ive not been undergoing training, exposing my self to outfield conditions and sunlight and im thus not able to downgrade via acne as well. My question now is whether there is any way i can get a permanent downgrade for my persistant skin conditions which are not listed in the directive??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thanks in advance!</p>

              <p>Deepnds on your camp, some camps PES C still do guard duty, some PES C does duty clerk etc. It depends on whether there is enough manpower from the PES A/B to fill the guards role if not i've seen PES C do guard duty often as well.</p>

              <p>Lasik is not allowed during NS. you can be charged for that. if you want to do lasik, you will have to do it before or after NS. then u will be subjected to 6months PES D after ur surgery. (that is if you go for lasik before NS)</p>
              <p>how bad is bad? 1000 degree and above is C1L3. most likely end up as storeman.</p>

              <p>Hi Saab,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have a question here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Im currently having this condition. It is caused by a virus, i
              think? which many people got no idea what it is, even my MO or some
              other GP outside. In chinese we call it SNAKE.I have this in
              my sec sch days, and i got it treated by a chinese sinseh at that
              time and it got better. now the pain is back again. So
              what normally happen to me is whenever the sun is hot and strike on
              my back, or my body temp rises, or i do upper limb and heavy load
              activity, it will start to ache and i can concentrate at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The thing here now is a lot doctor/ MO dont know what it is and
              what they merely do was just give me a few days of excuse UL and
              HL. but afterwhich my pain persist. when i told my commanders about
              my condition, they do not know what is it either and think that i
              am geng-ing. and im currently with a specilist in SGH.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would like to know what are the approriate steps i could
              take</p>
              <p>IF my MO still don't know what to do (because they dont know
              what snake is),</p>
              <p>IF my specilist do not take any action for me at all apart from
              physio.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What should I do in this case?</p>

              <p>short-sightedness can be easy corrected by spectacles, without affected your service.</p>
              <p>Since there is already a cheaper and more efficient remedy, saf logic is that you thus do not require a much more expensive, riskier and invasive surgery to correct your problem.</p>
              <p>short sightedness does not affect ur physical ability. you can still chiong sua, do ippt etc, wearing glasses.</p>
              <p>but if you go for lasik, since lasik technically cuts a permanent flap in your cornea, you will not be able to carry on with physical activities, lest the cornea flaps come loose again.</p>
              <p>since these problems can be avoided by non-surgical means, to do lasik in NS means you purposely want to keng, therefore is a chargeable offense.</p>
