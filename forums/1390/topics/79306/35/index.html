            <div class='col-md body'>I am fine with the first job, with the company for about 2 years, was thinking its time for me to move on, so I bring forward the resignation so as to find a new job and use new employment as a reason to skip the ICT in May. But even though I am quite happy during my time with the 1st company, I still feel down and out whenever I received the SAF100.<br><br>The 2nd one was more of a rush decision, it came about 2 weeks before the start of the May ICT, so I just take it and try out how the job is like, but mainly to skip the ICT. I started the new job on the same day the May ICT started, but I quit after 2 weeks. Not because the ICT is over, but because I find the job not suitable for me.<br><br>I didn't know the the SAF100 for the MUT would come so fast, came 2 weeks after the ICT ended. I was initially looking for new job after I quitted the 2nd one, but totally lost the mood to do so after receiving the SAF100.<br><br>Prior to this ICT, I also feel very reluctance to go for the past ICT, which I think this is normal like everyone else. But as every year the SAF100 come, I feel more and more reluctance, and this time round, to the extend of quitting my job early without even trying to find a new job first. That is akin to sacrificing my career just to skip reservist. I am a degree holder by the way. I really do not know what I will do next.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Sir,<br><br>I enlisted 2 months ago as a pes A soldier in enhanced BMT. During the last 2 weeks of BMT there's this stinging pain that I always feel on the interior side of my thigh area whenever I run and my left hip bone feels a little disjointed as well. I am quite sure it's not a muscle problem as it doesn't heal at all and never fails to come back whenever I run. The pain gets worse under increasing intensity/pace of running such as the case after my 2.4 run where I was limping back after my run. I'm quite sure that I have injured it in someway or another during the last phase of BMT because this has never bothered me during my first 7 weeks in BMT. Right now this problem has persisted even till today and it's been around a month or so since the pain started. I did not report to the MO in fear that I would get some status and would be excused from POPing, which I do not wish to be excused from having cleared the whole of BMT.<br><br>As I cleared my IPPT and expressed interest, I was called up for FFI and I declared this problem in fearing that it would hinder my training in SISPEC, should I get posted to there, because this problem doesn't seem to cure on its own even after a week or so of resting (as the last 2 weeks of BMT didn't really comprise of much intensive physical activity), and hence I failed my FFI and was certified unfit for command school. I thought that in this way, I'd be posted to a service unit since it clearly states on my FFI that I experience "pain while running", but the problem now lies that I've been posted to my new unit as a pioneer in Combat Engineer, and under the intensive training of running everyday (today is my first book out), my problem comes back again and I'm pretty much limping after every run.<br><br>I've already sounded off to my commanders but no action has been taken so far. Furthermore, I never had a thorough checkup on my leg before and I cannot say for sure what the problem is. So I would like to seek the advice of the MO here on what should my next step be. I hope to find out more of my problem and if it can be aggravated through progressing running, I hope to be excused and posted from these training as I don't want to risk further injuring my leg. Currently, I'm contemplating visiting a polyclinic tomorrow morning to get a specialist referral for some kind of a checkup so that I wouldn't have to report sick inside camp as it's a tiresome process.<br><br>Would this be a reasonable approach or am I taking matters into my own hands? Please advise ASAP and thank you for your time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> YES, a medical condition is needed to be checked asap! Your intented actions tmr is very reasonable.<br><br>Proceed to get the hospital specialist referral thru the polyclinic early tmr morning. </strong><br><br>Also try to get a memo letter from the polyclinic to show your unit medical centre MO for his review to temporary excuse you from any lower limbs activities for a few days/weeks, should be granted till the date of hospital specialist appointment.<br><br>Thereafter, when you see the hospital specialist, request for a MRI scan to thoroughtly scan your pelvis bone and thigh area. You might have rupture some nerves and tissues around the area. Do you feel some tinging sensation and slight numbness? If so, most probably you had injured the nerves there. There is a major lower limb Sciatic nerve that runs thru the pelvis bone down thru your both legs. Seriously major medical problem if so.<br><br>Even if you OOC from your pioneer course, fret not. Just take it as it is.<br><br>Your commanders are not medically trained like doctors, they just always thought, "Chay.... this guy just feel more lethargic/fatigue than others after excerising la... rest for a while can liao la...".</div>
