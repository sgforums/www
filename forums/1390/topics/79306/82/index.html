              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hi, I am currently an NSF serving ns in the saf bands. I am pes
              B and am an A level holder but will be doing an mbbs in a reputable
              uni in london after I ord. I'm ording in a couple of months and I
              would like to ask a few questions regarding my reservist/rt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. After doing some research on google, is it true that when i
              come back after graduating with an mbbs, i will have a choice of
              opting for either reservist MOCC or to do reservist as a combatant?
              Saf bands currently do not have any reservist vocation but they are
              thinking of setting up a reservist band, but requirements for entry
              into that are different (they need a music grade which i do not
              have).</p>
              <p>2. During my 5-6 year mbbs course, will i still be called up for
              reservist/rt if i fail my yearly ippt? Or can i ask them to defer
              it all until after i graduate? Cause having to do reservist
              (wherever i get posted to) or rt while still in the course is
              detrimental to my studies. I mean, even though I have summer and
              christmas breaks, might they still call me back during this
              period?</p>
              <p><br> 3. Will the "no reservist for people who earn alot" rule apply to
              me if i opt NOT to do reservist MOCC and get posted to be a
              combatant? I mean, the graduate pay of doctors is around 4k+, but
              does it mean that after say 5-8 years of working, IF say I start
              earning a salary of like 10k or something, will they stop calling
              me back for reservist?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Do i still have to pass my ippt every year without fail even
              during my period of studies? Im pes b but im one of those who can
              pass every station (some even with gold standard) but who always
              fail to pass the 2.4, hence resulting in me having to take the
              whole test again. Plus, training for the 2.4 for me will require at
              least 4 weeks of 3 times a week running before the ippt test, so i
              fear it might again be detrimental to my studies even during my
              holidays. (Im not the kind of person who runs comsistently)</p>

              <p>Local grads used to be able to take IPPT and do not have to serve RT if they fail but that has changed and now RT is required even though they still studying.</p>
              <p>Reservist call ups are still possible during the uni holidays. I've friends who are having ICT starting tml and they are 1st yr local undergrads.</p>
              <p>I am not sure about overseas students but i've a friend who works overseas but because he still travels back to sg at times, he is required to return to clear his annual IPPT and take leave for ICT.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Overseas studied student, need to apply for disruption. But once you completed your study and come home, you are requred to clear your IPPT and be called up for ICT. As for WIwg since you are doing your mbbs overseas, it depends on whether are you going to declare your degree or not?  If you declare, your 1st ICT will most likely be reservist MOCC, if not then most likely you'll do what you do before you ORDed. But do note that I do know people get called back to MOCC once Mindef found out that you hold a MBBS, anyway reservist MOs, most of the time go back medical centre see patients only.</p></div>

Do i have to do like soc and route marches, weapon training and field camps? Or will they just keep asking me to run and do push ups and have some training on how to be a leader and how to be an mo in the army? Also, how long will the reservist mocc last?</p>

              <p>I think you still would. I am unsure whats the limit before they won't call you back if theres really 1 since i heard often that doctors, lawyers etc still go for ICTs.</p>

              <p>Hey actually, ive been thinking. What if say i have a friend with an a level cert who has done ocs, and graduated to become a, say, engineering officer during his nsf years. He then goes overseas after ording to london to study his mbbs and comes back to singapore as a doctor.</p>
              <p>What will happen to his reservice?   Will they ask him to stay as an engineering officer throughout his reservice cycle? Or might they ask him to take the reservice mocc course for 4-months to be an mo? Or will they just ask him to take some short (maybe 2-weeks to 1 or 2 months) conversion course to be an mo?</p>

              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Hi seniors, I have some doubts and I wish you guys can clarify for me. I am a Pre-</span><strong><span style='font-weight: normal; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; '>Enlistees</span></strong><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>, I went for a checkup during Jan 2009. I had a motorbike accident April 2009. On that night, I went to a nearest clinic and the doctor apply stitches on my chin and clean the wound on my knee. After a month, although the wound from my knee has healed, but I still feel the pain on my knee. Therefore I went to the polyclinic for consultation. The doctor refers me to the Changi General Hospital for an Orthopedic and he told me most likely they will do a MRI for me. The hospital referral letter is at 21th of July which falls after my enlist date which is July 13th. The doctor therefore wrote a memo for the army to excuse me for lower limb exercise for 2 months.</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>After reading the instructions from this website, I went down to cmpb to submit the memo. The MO in the cmpb put me in pes D and told me to come back for another pes review on September. </span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>After coming out of the MO office, I was asked to sign a confirmation letter to downgrade to pes D. As I was signing, the people at the counter told me that if I am doing my checkup over at a government hospital, the army will help me cover all the expenses cost for the checkup. But if let’s say I am doing it on a private specialist, I have to pay the fees myself.</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The doubt I am having is will the army really cover the cost of my checkup? Or the guy over at the counter is giving my wrong information. If the guy was right, how or what I should to do in order to get my medical fees covered. I heard from my friends that consulting an Orthopedic and doing MRI maybe quite expensive. I am currently just a fresh graduate from polytechnics and I am not working so therefore I am worry that the medical fees will be a little too much for me to pay. </span></p>
