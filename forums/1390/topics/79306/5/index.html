            <div class='col-md body'>i was given PES A when I went for the medical checkup before I enlist. I always experience pain on my right foot whenever I walk, run, march, or all lower limb activities. After a long time (about 8 weeks), the MO finally referred me to a specialist (podiatrist). The podiatrist gave me insoles to use, but it has little/no help at all. I am worried that my foot will give me more problems if I continue.the problem is that always experience pain whenever i walk, run, march, or all lower limb activities even when i insert the insoles to the boots/shoes i am wearing. May i know what should i do now? Pls advise. Thanks!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I need a MO's(no offence, but I don't think the rest will be of much help here) advice on some matters pertaining to BMT Recourse.<br><br>As anyone would know, someone who gets OOC(or OOT as it's known these days) from BMT/BMT Recourse are liable to be called back for a recourse that fits a personnel's PES status.

Subsequently, when I went for my second FFI 3 months later, another MO just said "I'll pass your FFI for BMT" without even bothering to ask if I'm fit, have any ailments, specialist reports. So in essence, it seems that MO's conducting the FFI's are duty-bound to pass one's FFI(I wonder if this is the case or is that so because MO's are lazy to board someone to see if he should be exempted from BMT permanently).<br><br>On the other side of the coin, when I went back to Tekong for my first recourse, the MO there decided to put me OOC after he saw a medical report in my docket(given by my specialist previously) and asked me how was it my camp MO could even have passed my FFI in the first place and allowed me to go for my recourse. It seems that on the two occasions I was put OOC(first time during enlistment, second time on my recourse) by the Tekong MO's, they seem to take a I-don't-want-any-responsibility-for-your-health attitude and decide to play safe so as to cover their ass.<br><br>The bottomline is, if unit MO's insist on passing one's FFI and those MO's in Tekong wouldn't hesitate to put you OOC when they check out the gravity/severity of the medical reports in your docket - then the BMT issue would essentially never be solved since everytime I get OOC, I'll simply be summoned back later on. Any expert opinion from MO's out there how to resolve this issue(besides advising me not to report sick in Tekong)?

            <div class='col-md body'>Doctor,<br><br>I passed out from BMTC as a Pes A soldier, after that I was downgraded by MMI specialist to C1L2 perm for scoliosis. And excused carrying heavy load, sit-ups and shuttle run perm. But 1 year later, I suffered a fracture on my toe and was further downgraded to C2L1 temp for 6 mts. I would like to know what happens when my temp status ends? Will it automatically go back to C1L2 perm and excused carrying heavy load, sit ups and shuttle run perm, or do I need to go to medical board again? I have heard from my friends that even though you may have C1L2 perm in the past doesn't mean that Medical Board cannot upgrade you back to PES B or A. Is this true? Thanks</div>

My temp pes status have ended mid last year (2003). But a few days ago, I received a letter from my unit asking me to go back for medical review next month.<br><br>Do I need to bring any specialist letters? or I go back empty handed since they already have my record of perm downgrade in the medical docket? I was seen by the MMI specialist for scoliosis during nsf, now I am a currently a NSman therefore could I still go back to MMI to see the specialist again if needed to get a letter?<br><br>Do I also need to see again the other specialist at a local government hospital for my fractured toe or is considered healed by the SAF since the temp status have expired and it is also quite a long time ago.<br><br>Pls advice.

            <div class='col-md body'>Your Perm downgrade should stay as it is. The records are in the docket and in the computer. Very few(and I mean very few) ppl get their perm downgraded upgraded.<br><br>MMI usually for the active nsf, regulars and perhaps actuve NS servicing their reservice. You could request a letter from the MO to get your self reassessed there if necessary.<br><br>Yes you should always have an updated report of your medical condition when you go for board. If not, it would be likely they would reschedule you for another date. Such a waste of time!<br><br>Saabster</div>
