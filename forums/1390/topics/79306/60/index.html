              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>I got enlisted into BMT about 3 weeks ago and will like to enquire more information on the usage of the 11-B.</p>
              <p>1) Although I am PES A now, my knees and heels start to feel pain after the confinement period due to the training.  I wanted to do a full-body check up at a Government Hospital, can it be subsidised with 11B? If possible, how do I go about doing it? (I am a little 'kiasu', doing a full body check-up just for lower limbs pain, but it is better to be safe than sorry, in case I got any other hidden medical conditions.)</p>
              <p>2) Anyone know if National Dental Center and National Skin Center accept 11B as well?</p>
              <p>By the way, out of curiosity, why is the card named 11B? I don't see any 11B written on it.</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi eac,</p>
              <p>I was recently diagnosed with chronic radial palsy of the left hand and the MO gave me a temp downgrade for 6 months to E1L9. I would like to know what the medical board procedure will be like after the end of 6 months, ie how the medical board will decide whether to convert it to a permanent status or to upgrade, given that my condition will take up to 3 years to fully recover(if it does) and that surgery remains an option now. Also during this period of 6 months can I approach the MO to review my pes status again if there is any change to my condition?</p>
              <p>Thanks for the time.</p>

              <p>I called National Dental Center and they tell me that as NDC is partially private, I cannot use 11B to pay for my dental procedures there, even for basic treatment like tooth filling or cleaning. I was like, HUH?</p>
              <p>Next, today when I go to the gym for some light exercise with my friend, who is now a Officer in the Army.

              <p>Dear MO,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was diagnosed with Prolapsed disc 10 years ago and was downgraded to PES C2.  Recently I received in camp notice for combat duties, I was surprised.  I called them up and they tell me if I want to get excuse, I must still report for ICT and the OC will decide.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do they have a right to do that?  Should I go back to my specialist to get another letter on my condition?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many thanks for your advice.</p>

              <p>Hello guys,</p>
              <p>i am new here. I would like to ask anyone who can help me on my questions before.</p>
              <p>I am currently NSMEN. I got downgraded to C9L2 perm with excuse in
                  lower limb, RMJ and prolonged sitting due to grossly disc degeneration,slipped disc &amp; anterolisthesis.</p>
              <p>I have taken 2 MRI and X-rays during the past 1.5 years. Initially, it is just disc degeneration and then early feb, i took MRI and X-ray again and found that it has become slipped disc and gotten anterolisthesis ( Written in the report on X-ray ). As my spec ( from SGH ) has been seeing me for the past 2 years, i have gone thru all the physio (6mths) and other suggested exercise but to no avail. His advise is to ask me to go for surgery. As the condition has deteriorated quite fast, i am worry abt my reservist. Therefore, my spec requested to MO to revocate from my driver vocation but it seems that the Medical board is unwilling to. I spoke to the MO before the board and initially, he was unwilling to board me as he said that C9L2 is the most he can give me. I argue back and tell him i have numbness on my leg and prolong sitting as a driver will make it worst. he agreed and tell me that he will recommend strongly to the MB for me. But ask me no need to be present ( I requested to be present ).<br> <br> I would like to ask</p>
              <p>1 ) what does prolonged sitting refers to ? Isn't a driver requested to drive for long time in a sitting position?<br>2 ) Does excuse lower limb also mean excuse driving? Coz lower limb means anything from hip to bottom. Since driving needs to use our feet, shouldnt driving be excused ?<br> 2 ) Any people with anterolisthesis too? If yes, what should the pes status be for such a condition ?<br> 3 ) To revocate from driver vocation to another vocation, does it means
                  that the MB has to downgrade me further before they can do so ? From my
                  talk with the MO, it seems that slipped disc is at most C9L2 and that's
                  the lowest they can grade me according to their guidebook.<br> 4 ) If I am to seek a 2nd opinion from a well-known specialist, will it help in my case ? I would like to hear from this spec what is his opinion of my condition and can I continue to be a driver in my reservist.</p>
              <p>5 ) For MB, does a well known doc in his field actually helps to have a better chance of downgrading ?<br> <br>pls kindly give me your advise. thank you.</p>
