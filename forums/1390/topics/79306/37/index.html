I think it means slipped disc though the A&amp;E MO could not confirmed it from the x-rays taken. She then referred me for a specialist doctor appointment and a M.R.I scan may need to be done. Question I need to ask;<br><br>a) Since I ORDed from NS (actually about 2 years back), I know I will not be subsidised in terms of cost of such MRI scan, thus, may I know the cost of a MRI scan will be like? Can pay from Medisave?<br><br>b) What would be a possible remedy for a slipped disc patient? Will he need to go through an operation etc? Is there any degenerative condition which will occur in the future?<br><br>c) Lastly, my next reservist date is unknown for 2008. If possible, I try not to downgrade coz I serving the same reserve unit as my NS buddies so, the idea of joining another unit is kindda demoralising. Can I stay active (PES A) given my condition?<br><br>Thank you.</div></blockquote>1) $300-500 for lumbar region MRI scan, depenable on hospital. yes can claim from medisave.<br><br>2) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_disc_herniation" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_disc_herniation</a><br><br>3) slipped disc is normally downgraded to pes c2l2 minimum. serious one go to pes c9. u can still remain pes a lor... but be extra cautious of combat heavy loads and carry of heavy objects.</div>
