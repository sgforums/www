Any problems you have should be hightlighted during this consultation. An examination is "suppose" to be done as well but is usually very abbreviated <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> .<br><br>Some test are performed. The test vary with different age gps and I cannot remember which test are done for which ages. There is usually a table to refer to. Occasionally some bloods are taken and a stress ECG is performed to ensure that your heart is OK!<br><br>FFI is usually performed for the IPPT.

Especially if he complains that he is still having difficulties with exercise.

            <div class='col-md body'>MO Sir!<br><br>May i ask one question?<br><br>In my last reservist, prior to reporting in, i had this major outbreak of Psoriasis on my back and arms and legs. Fucking itchy as u know and i reported sick. Not to get any MC or what but to get some creams / steriod pills for me to endure abit before i can book out to see my specialist.<br><br>The MO given me attend C-Home immediately and ask me to go home and see doctor without giving me any medicine of course, maybe you guys dun have it at medical centre?<br><br>Anyway i continued to finish the balance about 1 week in camp and i gotten my woman to drive in and pass some medicine to me liao.<br>You know our reservist guards battalion is so badly shrinked liao with so few men and i just dun feel right leaving the guys in the lurch if i just leave like that. I am a Platoon Sgt / 1st Sgt for my reservist but only 3rd for NS.<br><br>Reservist OC is quite siao-on, and i got abit worried then. My question is this......if a soldier gets a order like Attend B or C but he continues to chiong sua on his own accord, is this a chargable offense?<br><br>Thank you, Sir!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
