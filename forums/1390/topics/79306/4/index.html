It is really important to know exactly what the patient presented to the doctor for. IF there were signs of stroke like weakness and numbness, well then more should have been done besides issuing a 1 day MC. However if the presentation was a simple headache and a raised BP, then a day's MC is not unreasonable. Usually advise would be given to visit you establishments own Drs for followup.<br><br>I don;t think I have answered your question adequately but like I said before it is difficult to comment without knowing all the facts<br><br>Saabster</div>

PTMC is a big medical centre, so it is a good place to put new OCTs, where they can be supervised. It is also a good place to put MOs who need more supervision than others (feel free to read between the lines).<br><br>So, sorry, this means that some Tekong MOs are really great, and a few are "special cases" that can't be placed in solo medical centres!<br><br>BTW, we also place these special cases in SCDF and Police... be grateful!</div>
