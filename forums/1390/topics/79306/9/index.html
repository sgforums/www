            <div class='col-md body'>How to downgrade after you ORD. Ok, let me tell you what I know. After you ORD you will be assigned a reservist unit which will definately have a medical center assigned to the unit. So what will happen is that you will probably be called back sometime to do ICT or reservist duties or whatever, and that is the time you should book an appt with you medical center to arrange for downgrading. Be sure that you have all you medical files in order at this point.<br>You can book your appt via your unit manpower officer/office or if it is up already, there is this thing on the miw web page called E-health which allows you to book an appointment via the internet.<br>For your downgrade, a specialist letter recommending downgrade would be useful.. there is one ortho consultant if he recommends downgrading it is 100% ga-ren-tee that you will downgraded stat!</div>
