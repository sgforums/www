            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by 01024G:</div><div class="quote_body">Is there anyway the curved spine problem can be solved? I went to the see the chinese doctor after going to SHS for a few checkups with nothing to tell me how I can prevent my condition from worsening. The chinese doctor tell me that if my body relax more then the muscles won't be so tight and cause the spine to be curve a litte.</div></blockquote>This curved spine is unfortunately permanent. I have this condition too and read more about it from a library book on scoliosis. The most (apart from surgery or wearing back braces) you can do is only to monitor to see if it is worsening. I sort of forgot the exact details but there are 4 different types of curves. Generally, the curve has a higher chance to worsen during the growth stage (puberty years) than when one's growth is already developed. My condition is mild (about 10 degrees) and I have seen the MO regarding back pains that seem to be related to scoliosis and he referred me for physiotherapy to assess my situation, which I am currrently undergoing. Once my physiotherapy gym session ends, I'll be given a review to see how my back is and then if need be, get me referred to a specialist.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Why NS man had to undergo review by armed forces MO<br></strong><br>Mindef replies to case of serviceman who got MC from external doctor<br><br><strong>Tuesday Â• May 25, 2004<br></strong><br>I refer to the letter, "Mindef urged to review system" by Mr Jeffrey Tang (Today, May 15).<br><br>The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) has a well-established system to refer personnel for specialist medical attention whenever required, as in Mr Tang's case.<br><br>A serviceman who is issued with a medical certificate of more than three days by an external medical practitioner has to undergo a review by an SAF Medical Officer (MO). The MO will then decide on the appropriate type of medical leave, taking into consideration the serviceman's type of training or work.<br><br>SAF training may broadly be divided into two categories: physically demanding training Â— as in field training Â— and non-physically demanding training Â— such as classroom lessons.<br><br>The SAF medical leave system makes a distinction between the two. "Attend B" medical leave means that the serviceman can undergo non-physically demanding training activities or perform light duties.<br><br>"Attend C" medical leave means that the serviceman needs complete rest, either at home or in the barracks.<br><br>Medical leave recommended by external medical practitioners does not usually make this distinction, hence the requirement for a review by an SAF MO.<br><br>In Mr Tang's case, it was probably a difference in professional opinion between two doctors on the type of medical leave that was appropriate. <strong>SAF MOs do not unilaterally change the medical leave recommendations of other doctors.<br><br>They do two things before they consider making any change Â— they examine the serviceman to confirm the status of his health and recovery; and they discuss the case with the doctor who issued the medical certificate.<br></strong><br>Although Headquarters Medical Corps (HQMC) periodically sends out reminders to all MOs on the need to follow this procedure, <strong>it is possible that there may have been instances where this procedure was not fully carried out.</strong><br><br>HQMC will be taking immediate measures to remind all MOs on the importance of adhering to this procedure.<br><strong><br>There is also a process in place for servicemen to appeal if they feel that the revised medical leave is not in order, as provided for in Section 204 of the SAF Act (Chapter 295).</strong><br><br>--excerpt from TODAY</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am not sure where to post this but there are some doctors who become SAF officers through the NS MOCC scheme, which is different from the regular MOCC scheme.<br><br>This applies to those doctors who had served their NSF in other vocations/ranks and did not manage to disrupt for their medical course either in NUS or overseas.<br><br>This was a scheme launched by HQMC back in 95-96 I think. The first batch of NSMOCC commissioned officers graduated in 97/98.<br><br>The way this works is like this: Mindef and MOH share their data on the list of registered male medical doctors in Singapore. They narrow down those who did not get their SAF MO commissions during their NSF. These people could be rifleman, storeman, signallers, infantry officers etc. They can even be clerks and be PES E. It doesn't matter. HQMC then arranged to have these people transferred from whatever NS units to under their charge for the NS MOCC.<br><br>NSMOCC consists of two phrases spread out over two years, since ICT is limited to two weeks I believe. At least that was the case back in the late 90s. These guys would then be sent to SMM for their NS MOCC course.<br><br>They would then be commissioned as SAF MOs, and be given the rank of LTA (DR) (NS) for those medically unfit (ie PES C and below), and CPT (DR) (NS) for those PES A/B. Of course the most xiong part these fit guys have to endure is the IPPT. They don't need to take SOC.<br><br>You might think that it is a good deal, but truth is, many of these reservists don't like to go through the NS MOCC. If nothing else, it lengthens their NS cycle and the age limit from 40 to 50 years of age. They would also be given higher appointments to serve in their NS units. And many of them would rather spend their time outside than to be called back to camp for ICTs and what nots. And imagine being a cadet in your reservist time! Yes, even those LTA (NS) officers have to go through the NSMOCC, if their officer vocation before was not MO. They go through with the others who are SGTs, CPLs etc.<br><br>Many are pissed, and some have even asked HQMC if it is possible to 'fail' the course and not get their commission. One guy in the first batch did.<br><br>So for those of you studying in NUS medicine now, you may be a enlisted man/spec in your NSF, but there's no guarantee that you will not be called up for NS MOCC later in your reservist.<br><br>My 2 cents, speaking as someone who served in HQMC before.<br><br>-- <span style="font-style: italic;">posted by theonion at another thread</span></div>

LOL.<br><br>So, there's only 1 IPPT to clear? Any at the end of triservice? SOC? how does a Pes C MOCC differ from a Pes A MOCC?</div>

I have this condition too and read more about it from a library book on scoliosis. The most (apart from surgery or wearing back braces) you can do is only to monitor to see if it is worsening. I sort of forgot the exact details but there are 4 different types of curves. Generally, the curve has a higher chance to worsen during the growth stage (puberty years) than when one's growth is already developed. My condition is mild (about 10 degrees) and I have seen the MO regarding back pains that seem to be related to scoliosis and he referred me for physiotherapy to assess my situation, which I am currrently undergoing. Once my physiotherapy gym session ends, I'll be given a review to see how my back is and then if need be, get me referred to a specialist. </div></blockquote>Thanks. I'm now discharged from SHS liao, which means I no need to go SGH for any more checkups liao because the doctor say my curve is mild now. Not like last time above 10 degrees.</div>
