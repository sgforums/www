              <p>Sometimes things can be done by left instead of officially e.g. only left max 3 years before reaching age of 40 limit, sometimes your reservist unit agree to assign do relax job unofficially (e.g. mess boy) instead of official appointment. This is a possible solution if the medical board results come back unfavourable or try to avoid additional paperwork in the first place. The IPPT part you can always request the M.O. to give excuse until the IPPT year ends as you have the specialist letter.</p>

              <p>Not to show off, but i have no problems passing my napfa too.</p>
              <p>I been to the Skin Center before and the doc asked me to come back to him to obtain a letter or memo once my medical checkup date is near. Im wondering what will i be excused from???  Im not those chao keng type, though is weird but my wish is that i dont wan to be excused frm those tough exercises, i would rather go under the sun than stay in aircon. I dunno shld i declare this problem of mine anot? im confused... all the while i been active in sports and can exercise by taking the medicine.. but if out of a sudden, the doc labelled me as someone who is sick and cannot exercise.. i really dunno what to do.. please help me out...thanks!</p>

              <p>hi everyone,</p>
              <p>can i ask? if i am due to ORD soon, and already given a vocation in the release order, will it be changed because my temporary PES has expired since last year, and I am due to go for a ORD FFI?will it be changed after the ORD FFI? what happens during the ORD FFI for temp PES that has expired cases? for additional info, the downgrade was not due to injuries or stuff like that.</p>
              <p>appreciate all replies. thanks alot.</p>
              </div>

              <p><br>It usually will remain unchanged, unless u get a further permanent downgrade to a lower PES.<br><br>If u still want to seek a PES review, quite possible that the medical centre have an admin lapse for your temp PES case, go ahead.</p>

              <p>Hi MO, 2 quick questions regarding IPPT for nsmen.</p>
              <p>I read this from ns.sg - "<span style="font-family: Arial;">However, you can only be exempted from the annual IPPT if you have a 6 months consecutive or 9 months cumulative of valid medical excuse within the same IPPT qualifying window." <span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px; font-family: arial;">In this case, who should i contact if i want to request to be exempted from annual IPPT?</span></span></p>
              <p>Also, i understand that "<span style="font-family: Arial;">You are advised to contact your NS Unit to request for a medical review if you have more than 3 months of medical excuse for a particular injury that prevents you from taking your IPPT."</span></p>
              <p>I have 6 months of cumulative medical excuse and have been to a medical review at my ns unit in august. The MO has requested for a medical board for me (in absence). However it has been almost 2 months and i have not received any call or letter. When i called the unit, the person said that the medical board might take 3-5 months to process and that it is not in their procedure to inform nsmen of when the medical board will take place, only that we will receive a letter after the board has convened.</p>
              <p>Is this correct?</p>
              <p>The reason i ask this is because my specialist recommended to excuse me from IPPT for 9 months, and when i went for the review, the MO said he will give me "3 months first" and sent me for medical board. What if the medical board comes back unfavourable, can i appeal?</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>go to the ippt centre and show all ur MCs, the ippt clerk there will input ur 'temp excuse exemption' into the ippt system.<br><br>yes, of course u can appeal. just book another review, sort of renewing the temp 3 months again with the same specialist memo and fasten the progress / follow up on ur medical board date. since they want to play taiji with u, then taiji with them too.</p>

              <p>After considering <a href="http://sgcafe.com/showthread.php?p=4037781">http://sgcafe.com/showthread.php?p=4037781</a> (Reproduced below) and Rednano's comments above</p>
              <p>today's (June 15th 2008) paper about that guy who has Scoliosis being graded just Pes C by the CMPB MO made me angry. What the f**k was that MO thinking? You think a person with that condition can jump, run, sit up? He'd break his spine, its only after much pressure, panicking and money out of his own parent's pockets (for specialist checks and letters) that they finally graded him E9L9.</p>
              <p>That is just proof of their attitudes really, its like they're trying to grade as many males fit for combat as much as possible to meet some hidden quota.</p>
              <p>I tell this to you MINDEF. Wake up your f**king idea! <br>__________________</p>
              <p><br>I decided to refile again for medical board to get PES E perm. Current my leaning tower of pisa body is officially PES C2L2 and surgery is strongly recommended for me. I will be going for surgery within next 3 months.</p>

              Hi Noah,
              
              Yes, MO can excuse you ICT and unit will have to respect it. I have given excuse ICT before as I was undergoing physio during that time.
