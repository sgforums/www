              <p>I do not think your camp in charge will go against the MO unless you can really convince him otherwiese since he would have to be answerable if anything happen to you when the MO already forbid you from attending the ICT.</p>

              eye problems GP cant do much. go ask for referral to see an eye specialist in public hospitals lar. GP is like jack of all trades, master of none.

              there are 3 type of specialists. associate consultant, consultant and senior consultants. most of these specialists, worked in public hospitals, then venture out to private practise. skills, experience and knowledge wise, how can MO compare to them right.
              
              SAF have their own trainee doctors undergoing specialist training and also specialists employed by SAF.

              To see those private specialists costs a lot of money, usually 200-300.
              
              if you are not in a hurry, go to polyclinic and ask for referral to see a public hospital specialists, under subsidized payment ie pay by your CPF medicare account, about less than 100, about 80-90.

              no. the decision lies with the SAF. but if you have a genuine case for downgrade, they will downgrade you dun worry. but if you are trying to keng to downgrade and they dun see a case for it, then they wont downgrade you lor.
