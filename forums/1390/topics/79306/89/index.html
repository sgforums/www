              <p>hi guys, an nsf here.</p>
              <p>been suffering from lower back pains the past 3 months. couldnt
              take it one day as i had trouble walking and the pain, which
              radiates down my right leg, is quite unbearable at times.</p>
              <p>went to consult a private specialist and did x-rays and mri
              scan. diagnosis was facet degeneration at l2/3, l3/4, l4/5 and
              l5/s1 levels, and facet overload. the spec wrote me a memo which
              states "kindly allow change of vocation and kiv downgrade"</p>
              <p>now my case is being sent to the board. mo told me likely to be
              temp downgrade. any idea how long and to what level?</p>
              <p>thanks in advance.</p>

              <p>C2L2 or C9L2 with excuse heavy load. If given a temp 6mth, before expire, i will suggest going back to the spec or another spec to get a perm status.</p>

              <p>Hi, sorry to trouble the kind mods here with my question.</p>
              <p>I'm a NSman, went for my first ict last year and went for my medical board review last year also after my ict. Mine is a backpain problem and a previous case of depression, a doc from CGH already wrote a memo to request for a downgrade which i submitted for the medical board review.</p>
              <p>I was given a (temp?) pes status of C9L3 for one year until end of october this year. Excused from fire arms but no excuse from heavy loads (which i'm not sure why since I was given excuse from heavy loads last year plus it's carrying heavy loads that will affect me).</p>
              <p>Right now my question is, what should I do after my C9L3 status expires later this october? My back condition isn't something that's going to get better and it will be draining on my job if I have to go visit all the doctors again to get more letters.</p>
              <p>Any help would be deeply appreciated.</p>

              <p>Hi Sir,</p>
              <p>Thank you for the advice. I like to enquire on where I can get help regarding the following issue. I was a PES C9L2 clerk until I ORD on 13th Dec 2001. However when I called the NSmen hotline, the personnel on the other side of the phone said I was upgraded on the 14th Dec 2001. I would like to know why would a person be upgraded only 1 day after his ORD and not being informed?</p>
              <p>Now I have to waste precious time and money to make medical appointments and to endorse my PES status again. Can I just send an email to MINDEF or simply look for of those MPs to help me regarding this issue? Thank you.</p>

              <p><br>Nope, you simply have to follow the SOP of booking the appointment with your reservist unit's assigned medical centre and submit the specialist memo in person to the camp MO, hence you will be to take a couple of hours' time off from your job.</p>

              <p><br>You can either wait for the NSHRC clerks to schedule your medical centre appointment near the expiry date of the MC or give them a call to schedule one on your own.<br><br>But do take note that if NSHRC schedule the appointment on their own initiative, you will get paid for the trip to the camp. However, if you call them up and ask for the medical review on your own, you will not get paid since it's self-initiated.</p>

              <p>Hmm, much thanks for the helpful replies rednano and eac.</p>
              <p>Ok so the procedure is that there will be a medical review (be it self-initiated or by NSHRC) when my pes status is about to expire. Am I just seeing a MO and informing him that my situation is still the same? if so, what will happen next? They just going to extend the temp pes again? Is it necessary to provide more medical documents from the doctors to show that my situation has not improved before i go for this appointment?</p>

              <p>Dear Sir, i have a lump on my groin for about 1 year. This lump comes and goes and it usually comes after some workout and heavy meal. This lump hurts alot and I have to either sit down or rest my body for as long as 1 hr for it to go away. At 1st I thought i might have contracted prostate cancer or some kind of tumour. I feel kind of embarass to seek medical advice.</p>
              <p>It's only till recently that I have been charge for defaulting RT that I went to see a specialist. he told me that my symptoms is hernia(a hole in the stomach wall) and I have to undergo a minor surgery. The surgery is at my private area and I hope I can wait until I have children before i go for the sugery(in case somethings goes wrong). During these period, will i be able to exempt from IPPT/RT/ICT??</p>
              <p>Will this be a valid excuse to explain to the officer in CMPB about my condition. And after the surgery, usually how long will I be excuse from heavy duties. because the nature of my current job require me to carry heavy loads.</p>

              <p>Dear Sir, i have a lump on my groin for about 1 year. This lump comes and goes and it usually comes after some workout and heavy meal. This lump hurts alot and I have to either sit down or rest my body for as long as 1 hr for it to go away. At 1st I thought i might have contracted prostate cancer or some kind of tumour. I feel kind of embarass to seek medical advice.</p>
              <p>It's only till recently that I have been charge for defaulting RT that I went to see a specialist. he told me that my symptoms is hernia(a hole in the stomach wall) and I have to undergo a minor surgery. The surgery is at my private area and I hope I can wait until I have children before i go for the sugery(in case somethings goes wrong). During these period, will i be able to exempt from IPPT/RT/ICT??</p>
              <p>Will this be a valid excuse to explain to the officer in CMPB about my condition. And after the surgery, usually how long will I be excuse from heavy duties. because the nature of my current job require me to carry heavy loads.</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>MO will have a very simple solution for you, chop off your testicles and freeze them in liquid nitro. Want children? Take sperm sample from frozen testicles. Then your hernia surgery can be performed any time.</p>
