              <p>If so, why are you posting here and not directly talking to your superiors when they told you that you are required to stayin?</p>
              <p>For my friends, they were mostly excuse stayin due to serious asthma, excuse dust etc so when they were required to stayin, they just request to stay in the office and accompany the COS since an aircon room is generally fine for them to stay overnight.</p>

              <p>Your superiors should already know you are excused stayin if your unit is a stayin unit and you are the only stayout personnel.</p>
              <p>If its a stayout unit then you can produce some sort of proof to see whether it can work.</p>
              <p>Its not uncommon for people with excuse stayin/outfield etc to still be required to stayin or go outfield when manpower is too low or your vocation requires of it. A decent number of regulars i know will just tell you that 1 day won't die etc etc unless of course its a major health risk.</p>
              <p>Actual directives whether they are allowed etc i dunno but i would say alot of times many people will just ignore the directives at times and demand their men to do certain stuff.</p>

              <p>If I decide to stayin this once,my superior will demand me to stay-in more often,because I know they will say things like why I never tell them my medical condition in the first place when my MC already states EXCUSE STAYIN.Does it make a difference if I elaborate on my medical problem and say I die die cannot stay-in?It is medical-in-confidence though.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I have been experiencing pain in my low back since Dec 08. The pain will be aggravated during exertion, prolonged activity and whenever i lie flat on my back.</p>
              <p>I've just did a MRI scan and the conclusion is as follows:</p>
              <p>L1/2 disc slightly dessicated.</p>
              <p>At L4/5, there is disc bulge, together with mild facet joint hypertrophy, results in mild narrowing of the lateral recesses.</p>
              <p>At L5/S1, there is a right L5 and S1 conjoined nerve root.</p>
              <p>1) May I know if i'll be downgraded permanently and which PES i might be downgraded to?</p>
              <p>2) Is a back sprain the likely cause of my current condition? I sprain my back while trying to fireman lift a guy and the pain lasted for 1-2 weeks. It hurts whenever i walk and had to limp throughout the period to reduce the pain.</p>
              <p>thanks</p>

              <p>Try to get your specialist to write a more strongly worded memo and also check with him regarding your new problem. If the MO still rejects the letter, make sure hes willing to be answerable for any problems that might occur to you in future due to his decision not to accept the specialist's recommendation</p>

              <p>i had a orif left ankle 3mths ago and had implants. 2 of the screws were on the ankle joint so as such, i'm having limited movement at the ankle joint.</p>
              <p>as such, as it translates to a pernament downpes? coz the screws will be displaced if i were to sprain/twist my ankle. my current pes status is just a temporary downpes.</p>
              <p>and in addition, will i be able to remove the implants during NS? i mean will the mo approve of such an operation.</p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As I read along this thread, Im starting to worry. I have seen people describing unreasonable MO or garang commanders.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I m being posted to a chiong vocation. And my current situation is im being excuse heavy load and upper limb for 3mths, all the way till somewhere in Dec. Because my problem is pretty complicated as such im still under studies by the specialist. I will be having 3 specilist appointment (of 3 different department) ahead in the next 3mths so as to find out what is the exact problem Im having. Is some back problem thats all i know.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First of all i would like to know, in case the MO reject my excuse issued to me by my specialist. Is he liable to do that? And should he do that, what are the possible things I could do to help myself? Do i continue with training and tahan the pain until i see my specialist again?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, I know that it is very irritating for me to book out on weekdays for specialist appointment. Hence I worry that my commanders would not allow me to go. But I really feel that I need to go. Is the commanders liable to do that? And should they do that, what should I do to protect myself again?</p>
