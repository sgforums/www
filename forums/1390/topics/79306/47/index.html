              <p>Hi Mo,</p>
              <p>It has been 6 years since I've ORD. My vocation is a TPT SUPVR (MT 3SG), I'm currently serving my first ICT and we'll be going outfield this Monday. My current PES is C2L2 perm. I was downgraded due to a freak accident while riding a bicycle which resulted in the my ACL being severed (80%), I underwent a open knee surgery 8 years ago. I have do not want to be outprocessed after already spending a week preparing, so I'll go through the outfield so that there's at least 1 high key in the books.</p>
              <p>I am planning to downgrade to a L3 status so that I do not have to climb up and down the massive 5 tonner trucks as well as perform various fire-movements. I'm pretty sure I'll be able to get this status and possibly have my vocation revoked (since I can't drive these trucks). My question is I'm hoping to get a C9L3 but I'm not sure what warrents this status?</p>
              <p>Could you help explain?</p>
              <p>Thank you so very much.</p>

              <p><br>pls seek a govt/private hospital specialist consultation review 1st, and get a specialist letter/memo/report b4 booking a medical review with ur designated reservist medical centre via the ehealth module in <a href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a> under the NSman tab.</p>
              <p>u will be considered for further downgrade only if ur lower limbs reflex movements (measured in degrees and angles, and "power" strength scale) is decreased further more after the last reflex records in the medical docket kept by medical centre. similiarly, u only need to get a new deeper degree specs, when ur vision degrees further deteriorate, right?</p>

              <p>Hi MO,</p>
              <p>             I OOCed from BSLC SISPEC in APR 07 due to Pneumonia. I got my 6 months temp PES E9L9 status in MAY 07 and subsequently got posted out to another unit as a clerk. I have been doing well in my new unit and my performance is valued by my superiors.</p>
              <p>               However, the problem is that my temp PES E9L9 status had long expired in NOV 07. As I was also not called up for any PES status review, my superiors advised me not to go to any medical reviews as they do not want to risk losing manpower during this busy period and the unit is already short of hands. Thus, I forsee that a greater problem will arise when i ORD in NOV this year. I think I will be most probably upgraded back to PES A or B(usually for pneumonia cases from what i heard, is that true?)  when i go for my FFI before ORD. If that's the case, I will be most probably be posted to a combat unit for my ICTs. My concern is that I cannot assimilate with the new combat unit as I had only been through combat training for a mere 3 months of my NSF life. I am worried that I will be a liability due to the lack of combat skills and experience.</p>
              <p>               Please advise on what should I do, and is there such thing as remaining as a clerk vocation after being upgraded to PES A or B? Sorry for the lengthy post and hope you can enlighten me on the matter. Thank you very much.</p>
              <p>~Cheers and Regards~</p>

              <p>u can still continue ur clerk vocation until ord, as ur superiors urged u too.

              <p>Hi all</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've got a question here. I've just been diagnosed as having 'excessive lateral pressure syndrome'. However I still have to go back for my annual reservist training. Nonetheless, the specialist has written me a memo to be submitted to the MO.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Question here. What will be the next course of action by the MO? Any similar experience to share?</p>

              a initial pes D grade, indicating the lab test result pending.
              after which, a few weeks later, u will be informed of ur final

              <p>I've got a question here. I've just been diagnosed as having 'excessive lateral pressure syndrome'. However I still have to go back for my annual reservist training. Nonetheless, the specialist has written me a memo to be submitted to the MO.</p>

              <p>My friend also have this condition. But his psoriasis happen throughout his body and it's really painful and itchy for him. He's given a pes within the C range. If your psoriasis is really serious, you should consult higher medical advice like consult a specialist. If the specialist suggest downpes, most likely the MO will put you up for medical board and the medical board will then decide. </p>
              <p>Just sound out if you're feeling uncomfortable and then request to see the MO if necessary. You cannot be refuse medical treatment no matter what. That's what my MP friend and MO friend said.</p>
