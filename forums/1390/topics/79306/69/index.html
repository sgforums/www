              <p>Hello all,</p>
              <p>I have a long lasting history of nausea and cough while nervous (couple of years in fact). Recently I have begun experiencing chest pains/discomfort so I went to get that checked out at a clinic.</p>
              <p>I was told that basically I had a psychogenic cough that leads to shortness of breath and nausea, caused when I get stressed, pressured or anxious.</p>
              <p>While at the clinic, the doctor further told me that I had quite a bad case of Allergic Rhinitis, nasal passage blocked/tissue inflammatation, something along those lines. Since I was 8 or so, one of my nostrils kind of stopped functioning (can't inhale or exhale air) but I never thought it was this bad till the doctor stated so.</p>
              <p>He wrote a memo for me stating that I have a significant history of Allergic Rhinitis and a history of shortness of breath and cough under stress.</p>
              <p>I'd like to know what PES level I'm possibly looking at.</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>

              <p><br>if ur parents want to save money, go to a polyclinic, and then request for a referral to a govt hospital specialist appointment.<br><br>book the specialist appt 1st, factoring in the scheduled appt waiting time.<br><br>if the appt is later than the cmpb checkup, no worry. u can always fax the specialist memo over to cmpb, even after ur checkup day, as a further supporting document should the GP memo is not enough.</p>

So let's just say he's not keng-ing, what should he do in this case? He doesn't want it to be on record because he buys insurance outside and this would hinder his policies or something.

              <p><br>i don't think so for the earlier date, u can call the specialist appt call centre to ask, but no guarantee.<br><br>for camp status, u should just go report sick as n when needed.</p>

              <p><br>there r little u can do right now.</p>
              <p>just enlist, n during the Platoon Officer 1-to-1 interview, voice out ur concerns.<br><br>whenever it occurs during training, voice out, <strong>sound out to fall out.</strong></p>
              <p>if it persists n u can't take it, report sick, don't be afraid.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I have a few questions to ask people who have medical knowledge (Hopefully MO from NS) and know the NS PES classification. Recently, I have been experiencing the following:</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span><span>(1)<span>  </span></span></span> <span><span>I have been experiencing pain, usually sharp pain, around my chest and heart area. The pain: is usually sharp and accompany with shortness of breath, needles poking feeling and I can not move about when the pain come, and it occur suddenly without any signs, dizziness, vision become either blur or seeing double image of the same object (the pain is similar to people who have sudden heart attack). The pain is experienced in both chest and heart area. May I know what are the possible medical problem that I may be facing (no other sickness like cough) ?</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span><span>(2)<span>  </span></span></span> <span><span>Also, I have been experiencing pain in my leg, both legs. The pain occur around the knee areas. The pain is: like your leg has been knock against the wall, the pain will occur when I stand and climb stairs (will occur even if I stand for a while and climbing a few stairs) and feeling that my bone are been compressed. The pain will occur throughout the day but my painfully when I climb stair. I did not injury the area before. Also, because of the pain, I will fall down frequently (like your legs is weak and cannot support my weight).</span></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">And whether these conditions will affect my NS life? If yes, should I declare it to the MO at the MCC to get them refer you for medical checking at government hospital or visit the polyclinic to get refeeral letter? Is this medical conditions downgradable? If yes, what are the possible PES, e.g. within PES C or E range? (kindly answer for both questions)</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>

              <p>- Without a proper certified medical exam/report by a specialist, there is no way to deduce a proper medical clinical diagnosis.<br><br><strong>I strongly urged you to get the hospital referral from a polyclinic ASAP.</strong></p>
              <p>- It will definitely affect ur NSF life, since it's even affecting ur daily civilian life now.</p>
              <p>- Yes, please declare honestly and in full to the cmpb MO.</p>
              <p>- Yes, cerfitied with a specialist memo/report, it's at least a minimum within PES C range. Depending on what and how the specialist write, it <em>may</em> be further down to PES E range.</p>

              <p>Even with the referral letter from the polyclinic, it take about 2 months before i can see the specialists regarding my conditions. But, the problem i now face is that i am due for enlistement and i have no time to wait 2 months for the hospital appointment. What should i do?</p>
              <p>Tell the MO at CMPB first so that they can refer me to hospital for checking or go to polyclinic to get it done? Which is faster?</p>
