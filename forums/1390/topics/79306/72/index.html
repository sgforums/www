              <p>Hi Sir,</p>
              <p>Didn't know there was such a forum, otherwise I'd have joined sooner. I'm probably be going for NS MO checkup soon, need some advice.</p>
              <p>I have pretty severe exercise induced asthma, had it since young, hasn't left me yet. I regularly fail NAPFA and my 2.4 cause of it (early BMT  here I come...). Currently on steriods and inhaler daily.</p>
              <p>So what pes will I probably go into and how will that affect my career, I've heard that a lower pes will adversely affect your job and stuff.</p>
              <p>Thanks</p>

              <p>oops, just realized they don't answer pes status here, nevermind, I'll find out about it when the checkup comes I guess.</p>
              <p>Just wanted to ask, how about medical records for the checkup. I understand that for asthmatics theres the treadmill test, followed by a lung function. I've already done that last year, so do I get those records, or do I just repeat the test during the checkup.</p>
              <p>Also, how do I approach by docs (whom I visit every 3 months) for medical records or writing statements (and what should I ask them to write?). Everytime I mention it, they glare at me like I want to keng, which irritates me like hell.</p>
              <p>Forgot to mention, I'm also allergic to quite alot of drugs (practically almost all antibiotics. And I got short stature, as in damn short, like 1.5m short.</p>

              <p><br>1) You are C2L2 6 months now. But once this expires, then you are on C1L9 for the remaining duration of that 1 year in the PES letter.<br>You can request for a PES review, provided with a recent specialist/psychatrist memo.<br><br>2) Your own willpower. With support from your psychatrist and the camp MO. Also, you can opt to speak to your Chief Clerk and S1 Manpower officer.<br><br>3) Besides medicines and family support, recovery is on your own willpower and self determination. </p>

              <p>Hi MO,</p>
              <p>I have an issue which I need to seek enquiry. Currently I am Pes C9L3 which downgraded recently due to my weight and heel injury. I am having bilateral tendon issue which have been giving pain everyday &amp; Orthopedic have declared uncurable last year. This injury had been with me for 3 years and have tried everything. It just got worst and now the doctor advice me to use cluthes at home. Cut down strenous activities. My recent visit to A&amp;E at CGH, the Doctor give me a memo with the excuse NO walking in work place but I just can't use the excuse in my work as you know economy is bad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now my in camp is coming in 2 weeks time. I am a guardsman and pending my situation, is it possible to highlight to them that I am unable to take part? This is consider the last few high key as we were having A tech exercise. Any advice on what's the proper way? Shall I see A&amp;E at CGH to get excuse from in camp or contact my reservice unit? They haven't really appoint me out of my role. I am worried. Please help...</p>

              <p><br>Don't see the need to see the specialist again.<br>Just bring along that recent memo + the supporting documents that you had submitted for the medical board to the ICT.<br><br>Since it's 2 weeks left before the ICT, you should call the Guards NS HRC / reservist unit clerk ASAP, and see how can they help you.<br><br>1st thing during office hours today, you should call and ask them for the fax no. to fax over the latest official Medical Board PES MC.</p>

              Hi, during my medical check up i was given a temp pes D for 1 month due to pending medical review on my blood (i declared that i have Alpha Thalassaemia). The funny thing was, i had my official medical report from the National Thalassaemia Registry at KK, but the MO said they don't need it as they would do their own blood test. 
              
              So now, i just received the updated medical summary and they gave me Pes B L1, from what i know some of the Alpha Thal enlistees were given Pes C before, is there some kind of discrepancy between Alpha Thal enlistees? In the summary, i was told that my pes status may be reviewed again or i may be called up again. 
              
              What i would like to clarify is, first why didn't the MO during my check up didn't even bother to look at my official medical report, and what are the chances of my pes status remaining at Pes B? 
              
              Thanks!
