But SAF cannot make this their business.<br><br>You're right -  x-rays cannot show disc problems and an MRI is the investigation of choice in this case.  The Cobb's angle was originally defined based on x-rays but the so-called 'scout' scan of the spine includes images that are very Similar to the routine x-rays. Which means the angle can be estimated on the Scan. What could the pain be due to?  Well, muscular strain is Still the most common, but Sometimes it Could be something more Serious.<br>For example, A pSoas abscess, tumour, Spinal cord or nerve root compression etc... But don't worry too much - and by the way MRI can pick all these other nasties out!</div>

If it really is DI, there's medication.<br>As for the other causes of polyuria, some are definitely treatable. We can't let someone go on passing such large quantities of urine, this will have long-term complications if left alone.</div>
