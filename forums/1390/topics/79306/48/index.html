              <p>even if in ur mind u want a downgrade, dun blatantly ask for a downgrade letter to be given to the saf mo... be discreet in ur words to the specialist... e.g. condition worsen due to saf work environment... etc.</p>
              <p>tell him/her that u need a memo/letter/report to show the saf camp mo... and the doctor will noe what to do... u will get a memo/letter to be given to the camp mo when u go to medical centre to endorse specialist memo.</p>

              <p><br>since u r pre-enlistee who already reported at cmpb. u r advised to call up 1800-3676767 for a request to re-appt another cmpb checkup to submit additional supporting medical documents.<br><br>generally, even if got chance to re-appt, use mouth say only carry no values since u r a 'pre-enlistee' status. its better to get hold of concrete proof. e.g. hospital discharge summary, specialist letter/memo.</p>
              <p>else, just wait till u get ur enlistment letter and show the documents to the medical centre there.</p>
              <p>just sound out to ur instructors, sergeants and officer in charge if they ask...</p>

              <p>Hi eac, i need to ask a quick question. I am an nsmen.</p>
              <p>Couple of months ago i asked you for some advice. What happened was i sprained my left thumb very badly last Dec. Subsequently i went to see a govt specialist and in February this year, my reservist unit gave me an excuse ippt for 3 months. Reason was because i failed my ippt for last year so needed an excuse letter to defer my RT.</p>
              <p>So my reservist unit took my excuse letter into consideration, and have booked me for RT in August.</p>
              <p>The thing is my thumb is still extremely weak, i think because i've sprained it many times since i was a kid. I'm planning to see a private specialist that i used to go to in the past to access the situation. Question is, if the specialist decides to gives me a temporary downgrade, let's say 6 months, will the memo "override" the RT schedule and my RT liabilities for this year? I'm asking this because i need to acknowledge and send back the letter within 7 days. </p>
              <p>Thanks for your advice.</p>

              <p><br>the private specialist will at best, issue u a recommendation letter addressed to the saf mo for medical board pending downgrade. he can't downgrade u at his own authority.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if successful downgrade, or most likely an extension of the excuse ippt for another few more months plus the current 3 months excuse, u will have to submit a copy of the mc to ur reservist unit to defer the rt for ur current window.</p>

              <p><br>simple, on ur next appt with the hospital specialist / podiatrist, ask him to write a memo to the saf camp mo to explain ur condition... then its up to the camp mo to decide...eg. whether to excuse boots for a couple of weeks or to submit a case statement for a KIV pending medical board meet.</p>

              <p>Hello MO,</p>
              <p>I would like to ask for advise regarding issues on my health problems. I have breathing difficulty for more than one year. And Im an NSF who have been already serving for a few months. Im a PES A. I did not voice out this problem during the medical checkup.</p>
              <p>Recently, my breathing problem got worst and i started to see a govt specialist. I do not know the root problem of my breathing difficulty and the doctor i see told me that it may be due to psychological disorders, which caused my body to feel hungry for oxygen.</p>
              <p>My problem of breathing difficulty affects my training as it cause me to feel panicky at times when i am gasping for air. At night, i will also feel breathless when i lie down and hence have difficulty sleeping. At times, i may just wake up feeling that i have not enough air. I also have difficulty during and after pt and also even when im sitting down doing nothing.</p>
              <p>I would like to ask for advise:<br>1) whether this is a physical or mental problem?<br>2) whether i should stop seeing my specialist and see a psycharist instead?<br>3) what can i do to help ease my anxiety of being unable to breathe?<br>4) will i be down-ed PES due to this medical problem?<br>5) what can i do if this problem continue to persist?</p>
              <p>Thank you MO. Im very worried about my health. This problem occured suddenly about 1 year ago and have not subsided since only worsen. Iam troubled and feel very irritated and fatigue about this. Please help me.</p>
