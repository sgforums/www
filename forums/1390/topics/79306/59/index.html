              <p>To cut the story short, i went a hospital and see a doctor and did a MRI scan on my lower back.</p>
              <p>However, (dun know to be happy or sad here), the MRI scan shows nothing wrong with my back. The doctor upon seeing the MRI scan then basically tell me to bugger off, saying that he cannot do anything for me.</p>

              <p><br>if ur case statement is submitted for medical board review, means got chance to downgrade lah...<br><br>pes-wise: since already KIV downgrade at medical board meet, just wait for results within these couple of months.<br><br>vocation-wise: range of vocations available in the vocations directory for the new assigned pes. but it's most likely to be under the same BDE if possible (internal transfer), if not then will be under transfer within the DIV, depending on the vacancies in the estab. quota.</p>

              <p><br>any eye specialist at any hospital will do...<br><br>hospital doctors will just write memo, then u go for medical review and pass the memo to MO, then MO will read the memo and review pes if needed.</p>

              <p>i defer the "troublesome" problem part...getting the memo is far more useful than <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #808000;">all the waiting game</span></span></strong> for cmpb to raise a memo RMR request, then post it out by snail mail, then wait for specialist to type and reply by snail mail...</p>
              <p>for the case of a typical medical centre, when the MO raise a RMR* from a hospital, the MOPA will type it out, print, then snail mail out the request letter to hospital. next the hospital will revert back to HQ MC at nee soon camp 1st, the MR clerk will then photocopied/ scan into PACES2 for reference 1st, then snail mail out to the respective medical centre.</p>

              <p>RMR from CMPB MCC is faxed, not mailed. and hospitals reply direct to CMPB MCC if i'm not mistaken. i guess we're talking about different things here (my side is for <strong>pre enlistees</strong> but you are referring to medical centres for <strong>nsfs or nsmen</strong>).</p>
              <p>i don't deny that having a memo is useful, but the doctor may still RMR in the end as the memo is still not detailed enough. my MOs are the ones who give pes grading at MCC and i release them after that -- i have seen many who bring memos, and end up having RMR. of course not all, but still quite a handful.</p>
              <p>to get a memo will require an appointment, and as one who books appointments, i understand that there is also a waiting time (which in some cases, like NHC, the earliest appt is a few months later) which ends up even longer than the RMR.</p>

              <p><br>it all depends. some of the cases have an underlying cause that are quite serious and can get a downgrade. some of the cases are mild and if it doesn't affect, it doesn't get you a downgrade. there are cases so serious that they can't even see the biggest A on the chart. it all depends on the severity and any underlying causes. in short, conditions like severe myopia and lazy eye can have a huge range all the way from pes B all the way to pes E.</p>

              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>I got enlisted into BMT about 3 weeks ago and will like to enquire more information on the usage of the 11-B.</p>
              <p>1) Although I am PES A now, my knees and heels start to feel pain after the confinement period due to the training.  I wanted to do a full-body check up at a Government Hospital, can it be subsidised with 11B? If possible, how do I go about doing it? (I am a little 'kiasu', doing a full body check-up just for lower limbs pain, but it is better to be safe than sorry, in case I got any other hidden medical conditions.)</p>
              <p>2) Anyone know if National Dental Center and National Skin Center accept 11B as well?</p>
              <p>By the way, out of curiosity, why is the card named 11B? I don't see any 11B written on it.</p>

              <p><br>1) use 11b as register in polyclinic/hospital a&amp;e. get hospital referral thru polyclinc/a&amp;e for the full subsidy. if direct go see specialist, 1st consult is private patient, no subsidy. 2nd consult onwards, then under subsidy.<br><br>2) yes. all govt. hospitals/polyclinics can.<br><br>3) 11b for there r 11 basic persional information listed.</p>
