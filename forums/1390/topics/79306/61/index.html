              <p>Hello guys,</p>
              <p>i am new here. I would like to ask anyone who can help me on my questions before.</p>
              <p>I am currently NSMEN. I got downgraded to C9L2 perm with excuse in lower limb, RMJ and prolonged sitting due to grossly disc degeneration,slipped disc &amp; anterolisthesis.</p>
              <p>I have taken 2 MRI and X-rays during the past 1.5 years. Initially, it is just disc degeneration and then early feb, i took MRI and X-ray again and found that it has become slipped disc and gotten anterolisthesis ( Written in the report on X-ray ). As my spec ( from SGH ) has been seeing me for the past 2 years, i have gone thru all the physio (6mths) and other suggested exercise but to no avail. His advise is to ask me to go for surgery. As the condition has deteriorated quite fast, i am worry abt my reservist. Therefore, my spec requested to MO to revocate from my driver vocation but it seems that the Medical board is unwilling to. I spoke to the MO before the board and initially, he was unwilling to board me as he said that C9L2 is the most he can give me. I argue back and tell him i have numbness on my leg and prolong sitting as a driver will make it worst. he agreed and tell me that he will recommend strongly to the MB for me. But ask me no need to be present ( I requested to be present ).<br><br>I would like to ask</p>
              <p>1 ) what does prolonged sitting refers to ? Isn't a driver requested to drive for long time in a sitting position?<br>2 ) Does excuse lower limb also mean excuse driving? Coz lower limb means anything from hip to bottom. Since driving needs to use our feet, shouldnt driving be excused ?<br>2 ) Any people with anterolisthesis too? If yes, what should the pes status be for such a condition ?<br>3 ) To revocate from driver vocation to another vocation, does it means that the MB has to downgrade me further before they can do so ? From my talk with the MO, it seems that slipped disc is at most C9L2 and that's the lowest they can grade me according to their guidebook.<br>4 ) If I am to seek a 2nd opinion from a well-known specialist, will it help in my case ? I would like to hear from this spec what is his opinion of my condition and can I continue to be a driver in my reservist.</p>
              <p>5 ) For MB, does a well known doc in his field actually helps to have a better chance of downgrading ?<br><br>pls kindly give me your advise. thank you.</p>
              </div>

              <p> 1) prolonged sitting means like sitting on the office chair working all day long <span style="text-decoration: underline;">without</span> any simple back stretching exercises.</p>
              <p>2) excuse lower limb activities is usually refers to physical exercise-wise. to be excuse driving or any other specific valid reasons, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>make sure the specific word use is there in the MC</strong></span> of the MB.</p>

              <p>4) pes status <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">may remain the same, but</span></strong> like the case of being excuse anything valid, there is a "please revocate serviceman accordingly" option in the list of excuses in the MB's software.</p>

              <p><br><strong>source: </strong><a href="http://www.ns.sg"><strong>www.ns.sg</strong></a>,<strong> under the FAQ of Book IPPT section<br><br></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Medical Excuse and Examination</span></span></strong> <br> <br><strong>Q1 What if I am injured or medically unfit to take my non-ICT IPPT during my qualifying window? <br></strong>It is important that you seek medical treatment on your own should you be injured or is medically unfit. The medical certificate that your doctor issued to you is recognised as valid medical excuse. However, you can only be exempted from the annual IPPT if you have a 6 months consecutive or 9 months cumulative of valid medical excuse within the same IPPT qualifying window. You are advised to contact your NS Unit to request for a medical review if you have more than 3 months of medical excuse for a particular injury that prevents you from taking your IPPT.</p>
              <p><strong>Q2 What if my 6 months consecutive or 9 months cumulative medical excuse straddle across two IPPT qualifying windows?<br></strong>You would be dealt with as an 'IPPT Defaulter' in the 1st qualifying window. Hence it is strongly encouraged that you should book your IPPT immediately after your qualifying window has started.</p>
              <p><strong>Q3 Do I need to inform my NS unit as and when I am awarded medical excuse from IPPT? <br></strong>As the onus of taking IPPT is with the individual, you should be able to determine whether your medical excuse for your injury will last beyond your current qualifying window and whether you have accumulated enough medical excuse to be exempted from the IPPT. You will need to keep records of all your medical excuses and submit to your NS Unit within 1 month of the close of your qualifying window to appeal against being dealt with as an 'IPPT Defaulter'.</p>
              <p>If you have more than 3 months of medical excuse for a particular injury that prevents you from taking your IPPT, you are advised to contact your NS Unit to request for a medical review.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Q4 I have reached 35 years old and was informed that I need to do an FFI. What is an FFI?<br></span></span></strong><span style="color: #008000;">An FFI is a medical screening phase which NSmen will have to go through to be certified fit for IPPT. NSmen will need to undergo FFI when he reaches the age of 35, 37, 39, 40 and every year after 40. The FFI certificate issued will only be valid till your next medical screening age. Once again, the validity of the FFI is referenced from the date that you are issued with the FFI Certificate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;">You should contact your NS Unit to arrange for a FFI medical screening once you have reached 35 yrs or older. As FFI is a healthcare screening to ensure you are fit to participate in the IPPT, failure to pass your medical screening will disqualify you from taking the IPPT after you reached the age of 35 and beyond.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;">The example below best illustrates this FFI policy:<br>LTA (NS) Tan is 39 years old. He was born on 5 Jan 1965. He was overseas in early 2004 and only attended a FFI on Sep 2004 and obtained a 'fit for IPPT' FFI certificate from the camp MO. His FFI cert is only valid till 4 Jan 2005 (4 months) till he turns 40 years old. He is required to take another FFI after 5 Jan 2005 as FFI needs to be taken annually once a NSman reaches 39 years old and beyond.</span></p>
              <p><strong>Q5 Can I book for non-ICT IPPT even when I am not FFI cleared?<br></strong><span style="color: #339966;">As you can book a non-ICT IPPT session 3 months in advance, the booking system will accept your booking even if you are not FFI cleared. However, upon detecting that your FFI result is not available, the booking system will inform you that you have to complete your FFI (i.e. 'fit for IPPT') before the scheduled test date. If you have not cleared your FFI before the scheduled test date, you will be barred from the test session.</span></p>

              <p>thanks for the prompt response.</p>
              <p>i got a x-ray before already but it was back in 2007.</p>
              <p>than the last visit to the MO to request perm excuse RMJ was unsuccessful due to the outdated x-ray?</p>
              <p>while the doctors (females) are more observate in the way my spine isn't perfectly straight and the difference between standing and sitting posture..how can i request for a specialist to give me an MRI since the MO from my camp doesn't recognise X Ray as a final dignosis of degeneration of spine?</p>
              <p>while it can only get worse..since i tried doing physiotherapy but not much has changed in my body..</p>
              <p>since i personally felt that those doctors consulting patients that are being subsidized do sterotype that NSF are trying to keng their way through thus i was happy when i went to AH with all the times being consulted by female doctors who are very much into details to ask questions unlike most of the Medical Officers in hospitals who only listen to us speak and didn't ask questions.</p>
              <p>sigh...today was unlucky since it was a MO who i was referred to..by like i was supposed to get perm downgrade and status of rmj but end up being a MO than sian..need to find more specialist waste my time..</p>
              <p>so if i were to walk into a private specialist..roughly how much would it cost me thus saving me precious time to do other things.</p>
