            <div class='col-md body'>I had quite an uneventful ORD day. My farewells were said a week before that, when I came back to the office for a day or two.I still remember that morning when I wore my no.4 back to camp for the very last time. The office and workshop was quite empty, for some reason I can't really remember. My boss, (Branch Head &amp; CSM) was in though, and I was thinking that I would be lazing around more or less. However, he came up to me and said that he and two of my fellow colleagues would be going to ALB to collect something. Having came back from STK the day before, I didn't mind going out on another trip. After all, it certainly beat sitting around in the oil-smelling office.<br><br>Only when I was in the tonner that I found out what were collecting. Matadors.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>That was my last "duty" in uniform as far as I can remember. Volunteering to be the armed escort for the convoy. It's one of those rare events where you have 1 MSG and 3 3SGs doing transportation and armed escort duty.The tonner was fully loaded with Matador training kits and we went back to base lying on the top of the crates, not after heading to STK to settle another issue. I still remember the ice-cold refreshing chin chow sold at the STK canteen, and how I mistakenly ordered vegetarian the first time I went there.<br><br>Me and the other 3 chaps in the back ended up talking about life after NS, and it's quite sobering to think that while we were moving along to university, lots of the other guys would ORD to uncertainty, fear of unemployment and expensive part-time courses. You've got to be grateful for what you have I guess..<br><br>I went back to collect my NRIC on a Friday. No one was in, except my RSM and a few clerks in HQ. I had a good talk with him, and he was basically saying that <span style="font-style: italic;"> "All you A-level guys, don't waste your Uni life. Do something worthwhile with it"</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>He was a good RSM, leading by example and not hesitating to back up his Specialists when issues of professionalism cropped up. So after that, I basically went back to my workshop office and chatted a bit with another friend who was on branch duty and left. The sentry and RP at the gate gave me a high-port as I left.<br><br>I don't deny that there were a lot of moments in NS that left me pissed off and seriously questioning the intelligence of the higher-ups, but when me and the mates gather around for a kopi, my NS life was a breeze compared to what the rest had experienced, and I was grateful for the exposure I enjoyed. Being in the know helps, because you see more than the average soldier and you can see the justification for certain ideas/systems. That's all I can say.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I ord on a Sunday. But got my IC on Friday. That particular week I purposely didnt take any leave or off. Because I know, no one will disturb me. And secondly, I know I will miss the place. So that particular week, I can just appear and vanish anytime I want. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>So the friday came, and sadness really fills my heart. I am looking forward to ORD(who wouldnt) but the other part of me was like, Damn I am gonna miss my army life!<br><br>Commander PA blanja me at officer mess. Had sandwich.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Then my CSM also blanja me food at canteen.<br><br>And my Nsf workmates also blanja me food for lunch. Basically the day was just about food la.<br><br>After lunch, I went up to G1 branch to collect my IC. Wow. I was like amaze to see my IC. Like some holy thing like that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Sign some forms here and there and got some ord souvenirs. A division mug. Division photo holder and cert of appreciation signed by COS. NB!! Why Div Comd never sign!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Anyway, I hang around in bunk and canteen. I did not want to leave the place honestly saying. I was extremely sad. The division was like a home for me. I can walk wherever I want without any headdress. Go in and out of camp without being search or asked by RPs.<br><br>I finally left around 730pm. Hoped on into my warrant's car and he send me back home...<br><br>Nothing eventful... but the day was a sad moment for me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
