              My army story was with 6SIR at Selarang camp. Went in early for weekend duty on a particularly dark, gloomy weather morning. All of my bunkmates have already ORDed except 1 regular guy so the bunk was empty at that time. The layout of my bunk was such that directly opposite my bunk is my RSMâ€™s bunk. So its very much dimmer then other bunks since any sunlight can only pass through the bunk from one side while being blocked on the other side by RSMâ€™s bunk. The dark weather made it worse. It was not my shift to take over yet so hopped onto bed to take a nap.
               
              Slept for awhile and got woken up by very loud banging noises. I thought my bunkmate (that regular guy) were back too so woke up to see. Totally frozen solid by what greeted me. As i sat on my bed, i could see the empty metal cupboards door being flung open and then slam shut again with a loud bang. And this phenomenon went on from one cupboard to anotherâ€¦ one by one right infront of my eyes. Managed to shake the shock and fear off me, jumped down from my 2nd level bed and ran out of the bunk. I only returned much later to retrieve my No.4 and boots to change for my duty after that. 
              
              Thats where i now truely believeâ€¦

              I passed out from army few years ago, had few encounters during my army days with the supernatural. Just to share.
               
              1) We were training in Brunei, sleeping on metal double-deck beds and I was sleeping on top. One night, I woke up somehow and got the shock of my life! I saw a being right beside my bed. could only see its head with eyes staring at me. I was totally chilled up. It was definitely not someone that I knew. Just close my eyes and prayed. Never dared to open my eyes till I fell back to sleep after a long time.
               
              2) I was on guard duty and sleeping in the duty room together with another guy. I remember I unbuckled my belt and unbuttoned all buttons on my army pants to â€˜airâ€™. When I woke up in the morning, my pants was all buttoned up and belt buckled.
               
              3) It was a navigating exercise in Taiwan. I and 3 other buddies spent 3 days in the forest and out at the villages. While we were looking for a place to rest the 1st night, down a particular path, I was very sure I saw a lady waving at me to go over. I told my friends gladly that someone was calling for us and probably offering us a place to rest. But we turned and saw no one. It was quite an open space. I knew I couldnâ€™t be wrong, but I tried not to insist at that moment.
