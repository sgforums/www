              <p>LANCE Corporal Budiman Mohamad Som,
                      23, needed a job to help support his single mother - a sales assistant
                      - and his two younger brothers.</p>
              <p>Having just completed his national service (NS) in December, he was not hopeful of getting a job immediately.</p>
              <p>But thanks to a new enhanced certificate of service (COS) for
                      full-time national servicemen (NSF) who have just completed NS, he
                      managed to secure a job within a month.</p>
              <p>Associate Professor Koo Tsai Kee, the Minister of State for
                      Defence, yesterday announced the introduction of the new certificate,
                      which gives a more detailed description of a serviceman's contributions
                      and achievements during NS.</p>
              <p>Those who performed exceptionally well or who assumed positions of
                      responsibility will also get personal testimonials from their unit's
                      commanders.</p>
              <p>NSmen can use this certificate to apply for jobs, scholarships or places in tertiary institutions.</p>
              <p>Previously, the certificate would only state whether the
                      performance was 'good' or 'outstanding'. It did not describe what a
                      person did - whether he was a team player or if he had good
                      organisational skills.</p>
              <p>The first Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) unit to get the COS was the 1st Battalion Singapore Guards in November 2007.</p>
              <p>LCP Budiman was a light anti-tank weapon sharpshooter in the unit.
                      In his COS, he was commended for having good organisational skills.</p>
              <p>He organised company activities, took part in singing competitions
                      to boost morale, and was praised for being a team player who carried
                      out duties efficiently.</p>
              <p>His performance and conduct were listed as 'outstanding'.</p>
              <p>Using his COS, he applied for a job at Aetos, the auxiliary police
                      force, two weeks after completing his NS on 8 Dec. He got the job
                      during the interview and started work last month. He is now based at
                      the Woodlands Checkpoint, earning $1,000 a month.</p>
              <p><strong>MORE CREDIBILITY</strong></p>
              <p>LCP Budiman said the COS helped him during the interview. He said:
                      'The certificate is from the Government, so it has more credibility and
                      is recognised.</p>
              <p>'If I were the boss of a company, why would I not want to hire
                      someone who performed well in the army during stressful situations?</p>
              <p>'It will motivate NSFs to work harder during NS.'</p>
              <p>LCP Budiman's younger brothers are aged 19 and 13. An older sister,
                      24, who is married without kids, also lives in the family's four-room
                      flat in Teban Gardens.</p>
              <p>Aetos' commanding officer (land checkpoints), Deputy Superintendent
                      (Auxiliary Police Force) Roland Wee, 47, is in charge of the Woodlands
                      and Tuas checkpoints. He interviewed LCP Budiman for the job.</p>
              <p>He said previous certificates did not contain enough details of
                      what an NSF did. The COS gives employers a better idea of whether job
                      applicants were suitable.</p>
              <p>He added that</p>
              <p>LCP Budiman's COS contributed to the decision to employ him.</p>
              <p>He said: 'The COS was a good one, as it reflected his contributions
                      to the SAF. It has been accurate in describing his character and
                      abilities.'</p>

              <p><span>MINDEF has enhanced the
              Certificate of Service (COS) that is given to each full-time national
              serviceman (NSF) when he completes full-time NS. MINDEF has redesigned
              the COS so that it contains more information which could be relevant in
              the job market. NSFs who have completed their full-time NS from Nov 07
              onwards would receive the enhanced COS.<br><br>When they complete
              full-time NS, each serviceman will receive a transcript and a
              certificate of completion. The transcript lists the NSF's
              contributions, achievements and courses attended during NS as well as a
              short description of the skills he has acquired during NS and personal
              attributes he has displayed. The certificate is awarded to recognize
              the successful completion of full-time NS. <br><br>In addition, NSFs
              who performed exceptionally well and those who shoulder leadership
              responsibilities would be given a testimonial in recognition of their
              contributions. </span></p>

              <p>Well, i think the enhanced COS is a good thing.</p>
              <p>But have they ENHANCED the system of appraising soldiers that is the basis of the COS?</p>
              <p>My friend and I Enlisted together and ORD'ed together. Same rank &amp; Vocation, only different company.</p>
              <p>I would say we do what we did to get our jobs done, none of us did more or less.</p>
              <p>Both of us got attached out to another unit for 8 months and we returned to our parent unit after that just to see our new OCs for 2-3 weeks and we go for our leave and ORD.</p>
              <p>His new OC told him, "to be fair, I called your OC in your attached unit and he put in good words for you. I am putting Outstanding in your conduct and writing a testimonial for you."</p>
              <p>My new OC told me, "to be fair to your friends in this company, i cannot assess you since you are away the past 8 months, and to be fair to you, i will just grade you "Very Good" (the default).</p>
              <p>So much about enhancing the look, but the system?</p>
