              <p>Dear NSFs, I have been following topic threads on SAF counsellors and psychiatrists. I decided to share my story on my experience.</p>
              <p>If you would like to see a  counsellor or psychiatrist, you will and must need a recommendation/ referral letter from a MO.</p>
              <p>The MO would ask you questions such as why you would like to see a counsellor, so that he can pen a referral letter for you to make an appointment. It would take about 4 weeks to get an appointment slot. Getting a counsellor appointment is better than with a SAF psychiatrist.</p>
              <p>If you would like to see a psychiatrist, the MO will and must need to pen a referral letter too. The SAF psychiatrist would look through your report sick medical records to determine if he really need to see you or not. If granted, you will get an appointment also in about 4 weeks (dependable on the urgency of case) since he has many cases to follow up. If not, he will refer you back to the SAF counselling centre as a step-down care to follow-up.</p>
              <p>At SAF counselling centre, a counsellor will be assigned to take care and concern on you. The 1st initial session will be to get to know more about you and the problems you are facing. A counsellor, who is an advisor, is there to advise you on how to face and tackle the problems but not solve all your problems at once. Please do not ask for PES review, leaves/ offs...etc. The counsellor, facilitates as a bridge between your supervisor and you. Not many supervisors are willing to listen since they will thought that you are simply malingering your way out of NS. That's where a counsellor step in to readily help. He will monitor your progress till you feel confidence enough that you can be able to handle the situation/ reality on your own. The advising sessions last usually for half an hour to an hour. The first few initial sessions might take longer to understand the situation. The frequency you meet would really depend on your case. Usually, it is once a month.</p>
              <p>The visit to a SAF psychiatrist would be more or less similar to a counsellor. The big difference is that a psychiatrist would be able to give you oral medicines to "smoothe your senses", but a counsellor cannot for advising/ guidance. The psychiatrist is a medical doctor specialising in psychiatry. Do not expect him to treat you "nice" like the counsellors did. He usually spent less time than your counsellors did with you, and the frequency you see him may be once per quarter (every 3 months or so). He, qualified with a doctor's licence, has the discretion to grant you excuse stay-in or whatever he deemed fit and so. He is likely to twist and turn the way he asks questions so as to weed/ sieve out malingering kengsters, so please be careful to think before you speak.</p>
              <p>REMEMBER, it is not a "buffet" to help youself to get excuses/ PES review. <br>You will/ must justify why you really need it, and how can it help you solve problems.</p>
              <p>My final advice is,</p>
              <p>Prepare  what you need to say to your counsellor or psychiatrist.</p>
              <p>The only way to help yourself is your own self, since no one can help you except you.</p>
              <p><strong>Please do not abuse these services if you are depriving these for others really in need. </strong><em>If you misuse, you can be charged for abuse/ misuse.</em><strong><br></strong></p>

              <p>I believe this artcle would help fellow NSF who are facing problems, to seek help. I have been through the whole process, i knew how it feels when you are seeing the counsellor for the first time. Then again, I would like to emphazise to all that, <strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #333333;">Please do not abuse these services as  you are depriving these services for others really in need.</strong><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </span></p>
              <p>It could be a life/death, SOL/DB or weekend stay in/book out. They really need help.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do feel free to contact me, if you have any questions. </p>
              <p>I would like to thank sgforum and the moderators for publishing my article. </p>
