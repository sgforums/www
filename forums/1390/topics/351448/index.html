              <p>Lazerlord, I am responding merely to teraexa. There is no classified secret. You see, he truimphantly said that my estimate of an upper echelon of annual income of $8k++ a month at 26 is not possible which to him, then makes him part of the upper echelon that he is NOT, as he will earn less than half of that at an older age.No security breach. its not widely published but neither is it classified.  I have proven that he is really a frog in the well. My estimation was so right so I must gloat. It surprised me that someone like him who claims is not a frog in the well, could be ignorant of life around him. I was correct abt my theory. Which of cos just proves my label of him as a frog in the well, rings true. Can you not lock my threads to him and change my subject title to something irrelevant? thanks</p>
              <p>teraexa, how can someone mildly educated not know that same rank different pay? Of all places, SAF you think you can calculate someone's pay based on rank and upgrade only haha? Do you know that CDO are paid more than INF? And do you know that INF are paid more than Logistics? Are you under a rock? Or your de-education has kicked in prematurely? There are Majors who are paid less than CPT1. There are LTC paid less than a MAJ1, you clearly know way less than the average NSF. Please don't talk so much and malu yourself so often. Everyone's pay increases with rank and upgrade you moron, but different people are on different scales. They have AO top up.</p>
              <p>stellazio: nope, they are the non pilots. They are in army and navy. all formations get on same scale, same pay, regardless of pilot or CDO or armour or infantary or navy.</p>
              <p>skythewood: nope, I don't and can't worship people in my vicinity. It defies logic.</p>

              <p>I'm not spammer. I m just telling teraexa in glee that my estimation of him being a frog has rung true through and through. He is ignorant of common knowledge that everyone knows. He is the perfect embodiment of what I describe of frogs who are de-educated to become confused than before they went to university.</p>
              <p>You are confused. Read what I said. I said I can't worship people in my vicinity. I did not say I can't worship myself. Vicinity does not mean status. It may mean physical vicinity, especially if I am a pai ka pai chew clerk in mindef. You can't worship things you know very well. Thats why you wank to Britney Spears and Ayumi and not Lynn Poh next door. You fuck your wife, but can you worship your wife that you fuck all the time? Go figure.</p>

              <p>More like than not, you are wrong that i am wrong. but who cares
              when neither of us knows? When did i laugh at poor people? Never!
              Don't be so sensitive! Basically i'm saying by odds your comment
              about my financial vicinity would look very silly when we are in
              real life.</p>
