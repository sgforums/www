              <p>Yo, Uncle, i believe that there must be a supreme commander who
              control the 3 parties, you need someone to control and make the 3
              in 1 coffee successful mah. No doubt, there are sugar (airforce),
              milk (navy) and the coffee/tea (army), these 3 portions make the up
              the Arm forces of Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But on the contrary, if wars come to singapore, i think the

              <p>The last thing Singapore needs is ungrateful ladies.Try wearing
              the uniform under the sun, and charge through the jungle, and see

              <p>You are not helping your pubs by being so nasty to the guys
              serving NS now.</p>
              <p>When I served my NS, I had been to Taiwan and Thailand. There,
              their army is well respected, unlike ours. There, the boys feel
              proud being part of the army. I believe its a case of appreciation
              coming from the public. Being nasty will only cause more
              unhappiness to those in NS now.</p>
              <p>The Supreme Commander is called Chief of Defence Force. He's not
              called the Army Chief. For each of the 3 armed forces, each has
              their own top general, namely Chief of Navy, Chief of Army, and
              Chief of Air Force. Therefore, I am just helping to clarify your
              understanding. Calling the Armed Forces as Army is incorrect,
              because army is only but one of the three and does not represent
              all three.</p>

              <p>angel7030 is a 21 year old means she is the later Gen Y.. But i am shocked that she shares those 1960s and 70s feminist ideals. They cry for equal rights, want equal opportunitites, and everything desirable but when come to certain things undesirable, they turn back and say, "oh this is man's stuff, this is so ungentlemanly, ect ect"..</p>
              <p>Listen up females, If u think NS duty is a man's job and its a male duty to protect u,  when in times of war, u are still vulnerable to rape and murder. If u dont have these skills, how are u going to protect yr children. We men will be fighting at the war front and u will be hiding, u do also need to protect yourself while hiding if discovered by the enemy.</p>
              <p>Our enemies think twice about attacking our country is because of the sacrifices thousands of young men made in serving the nation. Some have died, some lived. They should not be taken for granted and deserve the outmost respect, regardless they are top performers or not. They make up for the numbers which our enemies take note.</p>
              <p>S'pore females are ungrateful lot. They love to suck ang moh d^cks who never have the same expereince as we do. sissy males who take  $$$ from their government to spend on women here.</p>

              <p>I respect those who are fit for NS and have done their duty regardless of their pes status.(Yes, even the Pes Es who have done their duty despite all their handicap.) Angel7030 is an idiot and should be regarded as such.</p>

              <p><br>So? what are you saying? Have you been following my tread? My tread is in response to angie7030, not to you or anyone else. <br><br>In it, she "bet a fellow forumite carried Teo's bag during NS". Is it possible for army personnel (and that person is an Army Officer) to carry a Navy Officer's bag? <br><br>Don't anyhow response to forumite posting for the sake of posting without following the content or the tread. </p>
