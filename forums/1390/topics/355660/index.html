              <p>Saw this post on omy’s forum by a person called æˆ‘çš„å¤© who claimed that local job search portal, JobsDB added a “reservist” option in their selection fields under “Personal Details =&gt; National Service”.<br><br>Please see screen captures as below:</p>
              <p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2278/2360306716_50b2b8d3d1_o.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="317"> </p>

              <p>This is a very touchy issue as it concerns all Singapore male CITIZENS who have served National Service. Does the additional field implies it may be used as a screening criteria for potential employers?<br><br>I have heard rumours that some companies have discriminatory hiring practices with regards to males with reservist liabilities, but chose to dismiss them as unfounded. I hope this is not happening as it will be extremely unfair to Singapore born males like me who have this extra burden saddled upon us.</p>

              <p>That is why i said, some of them are the odd ones, and you are one of them, instead of trained to control damage , you are causing more damage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do u understand that guys at the age of 17 to 21yo are most vulunerable to gangsters, pimps, drugs, fights, sex, and other anti vice activities, by getting them into the army provide that discipline buffer so that sg guys can come out and apply their leadership and discipline learnt in NS into work, most will be mature enuf, even we gals also like guys who had completed their NS, they also look for stronger and muscular, able to take the hardship of life. And you, i guess you must be carrying Admiral Teo's bag during your NS time, so free, no wonder learned nothing.</p>

              <p>I can't tell u too much on the net.<br><br>But our Navy, Air Force and Army commands are separate. Within each of these forces, they have their own unit, battlelion, ship etc on rotating standby for immediate war.<br><br>In operation or mission etc, we have co-ordinated, joint inter-forces in command.<br></p>

              <p><br>i believe the line is secured and confidential, unless there is a breach of confidentiality, then i would said, u can go ahead and sue them, all employers including me needs to know whether he had served NS or not, we dun want to recruit someone who later have to serve NS, today, NS can be deferred as long as few years, he can be 21yo, but still yet to serve NS, there is nothing to be discriminate abt here, just be true to yourself.</p>

              <p>Those that does are the stupid ones. Just as well not to work for them. Therefore if you don't have NS liabilities and work for such employers, good luck to you. </p>
              <p>But discrimination also work both ways, exployers can also screen out those who are exempted from NS, on the presumption that there must be something physically wrong with the Singaporean male to be exempted from NS.</p>
              <p>Asking for NS status is no different from asking for your marital status or any other reasonable personal detail.</p>

              <p>This is a very touchy issue as it concerns all Singapore male CITIZENS who have served National Service. Does the additional field implies it may be used as a screening criteria for potential employers?<br><br>I have heard rumours that some companies have discriminatory hiring practices with regards to males with reservist liabilities, but chose to dismiss them as unfounded. I hope this is not happening as it will be extremely unfair to Singapore born males like me who have this extra burden saddled upon us.</p>

              <p><br>In some sense yes. Recentlly I just discussed this with my friend who just have a new job. I ask him to deferr because it is ridiciulous to tell the boss that, "heh! I am going to go reservist for 2 weeks." on the first day of work.</p>
              <p><br>I hate Reservist as work would just have to piled up for 2 weeks for me to clear. Email still kept coming and things still have to settle. Clients would not give excuse for me going to reservist. Poor me! In fact reservist is extra work. Still have to work extra hours to cover my civilian job scope. Should have just sign on.   </p>
