              <p>I have heard my US boss ever lament why Singaporean males need to serve NS. Especially when someone goes on a 3 week reservist stint, she would question why such a small country like Singapore needs their reservists to go back for training for so long.</p>
              <p>I am just attesting to ACTUAL FACTS that there are employers that do not like Singaporeans going for reservist, ESPECIALLY when the job scope is very important to the company.</p>
              <p>On the contrary to your claims, it's a big deal. 2 weeks or 3 weeks reservist means losing a personnel for 10 to 15 working days. Adding the NS liability to the annual leave = almost double the actual annual leave (usually 14 - 18 days for most people these days)</p>
              <p>So instead of a personnel that you give him 14-18 days leave, you now have a personnel that has 24 - 33 days leave. That's a WHOLE LOT of difference</p>
              <p>I do not know if it's a coincidence, but I noticed my org employing more females (esp those who already have given birth) when male employees leave the org.</p>

              <p>Currently with he availability of cheap foreign labour, Reservist duties are causing more harm than before. Because employers now have another segment to choose from - THOSE WITHOUT RESERVIST LAIBILITIES ( foreign workers).</p>
              <p>CoMPANIES DONT CARE ABOUT RESERVIST. THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT PROFITS AND EXPENSE.</p>

              <p>I have heard my US boss ever lament why Singaporean males need
              to serve NS. Especially when someone goes on a 3 week reservist
              stint, she would question why such a small country like Singapore
              needs their reservists to go back for training for so long.</p>
              <p>I am just attesting to ACTUAL FACTS that there are employers
              that do not like Singaporeans going for reservist, ESPECIALLY when
              the job scope is very important to the company.</p>
              <p>On the contrary to your claims, it's a big deal. 2 weeks or 3
              weeks reservist means losing a personnel for 10 to 15 working days.
              Adding the NS liability to the annual leave = almost double the
              actual annual leave (usually 14 - 18 days for most people these
              days)</p>
              <p>So instead of a personnel that you give him 14-18 days leave,
              you now have a personnel that has 24 - 33 days leave. That's a
              WHOLE LOT of difference</p>
              <p>I do not know if it's a coincidence, but I noticed my org
              employing more females (esp those who already have given birth)
              when male employees leave the org.</p>

              <p>Yo, Uncle, i believe that there must be a supreme commander who control the 3 parties, you need someone to control and make the 3 in 1 coffee successful mah. No doubt, there are sugar (airforce), milk (navy) and the coffee/tea (army), these 3 portions make the up the Arm forces of Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But on the contrary, if wars come to singapore, i think the supreme commander run first....followed by me...cannot depend on a weak legs sg guys to protect us, sure die one. Me scare become sex slave.</p>

              <p>The last thing Singapore needs is ungrateful ladies.Try wearing the uniform under the sun, and charge through the jungle, and see if you still smell good. You can spray all the perfume you want, but it's useless.</p>
              <p>You are not helping your pubs by being so nasty to the guys serving NS now.</p>
              <p>When I served my NS, I had been to Taiwan and Thailand. There, their army is well respected, unlike ours. There, the boys feel proud being part of the army. I believe its a case of appreciation coming from the public. Being nasty will only cause more unhappiness to those in NS now.</p>
              <p>The Supreme Commander is called Chief of Defence Force. He's not called the Army Chief. For each of the 3 armed forces, each has their own top general, namely Chief of Navy, Chief of Army, and Chief of Air Force. Therefore, I am just helping to clarify your understanding. Calling the Armed Forces as Army is incorrect, because army is only but one of the three and does not represent all three.</p>
