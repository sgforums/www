              <p>Hi im a 3sg medic, recently ive had like tons of family probs plus gf stuff n crappy things all along the way n my timing in my unit really screws me up coz i live like in msia n stuff so i dun go home unless on weekends n stuff n i can only see my family during those times n even that i also have stuff on weekends... as such i reported i was stress to my camp MO who is also one of my superiors n he referred me to PCC n SCC. Apparently im also supposed to go for n overseas cover but im excuse overseas from my psychiatrist since he said im too stressed up by my own probs, but my own other superiors are not happy about it....they then raised the issue above again and now the higher up wants to take action against me saying tat as a 3sg ive not  performed to the best of my ability or excel or what not further crap and lead man and stuff...but i have no man under me in the first place......and im like thinking to myself..."DUDE i reported wayyy early they i am not in the right mind now coz im really bummed by alot of things...whats with this sudden take actions stuff..." i was goin nuts n was like scared id break down n do stomethin stupid when i talked to my psych who then told me to just talk it out with my MO the same thing...then when raised higher up this guy then said tat was an implied threat against superior as well n wanna take action against that...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>You can honestly communicate with your family on your timing, and they would understand. In this manner, you can concentrate on your medic routine in camp. Oversea may be good alternative for you as it  temporarily suspend you from family and social gathering on weekend, since these creates much stress for you. Once you are having peace mind while away for oversea, you may realize you mistake and get yourself into good shape of harmony. Hope that his suggestion would be of usefulness to you.</p></div>

              <p>This really sucks, but the only advice I can give you is to suck thumb.</p>
              <p>There are so many superiors against you one person, 99.9% you sure lose and kenna some sort of crap if you continue to try to push a way for yourself. </p>

              <p>put it this way, some problems are really beyond control.. not enough time for the family.. fine, but if there are really issues which will eat into work and affect the quality, they have to be discussed and worked out. stress should only be the final resort if proven to be beyond control by your doctors/higher-up medics =/ cos after all, they somehow will feel the heat.</p>

              <p>ok not so easy... only appointment holders [including WO] have the rights to charge/issue extra. and they usually do so only when a powerful figure gives his/her feedback. [eg, hair too long for guys and the CCWO saw it during an official function]</p>
              <p>the rest who are above SSG/ME2 can on paper officially recommend charge/extras... like a NSF MO who has an additional bar as compared to some OCs in tekong, at most can only shoot an email over to the concerned OC if one of his recs is medically proven to be malingering and the MO's 'job' is handed over to the OC to deal with him.</p>
              <p>btw nowadays is much more reasonable and negotaible/explainable, and if some1 wants to play punk, whoever concerned will pay him/them back.</p>
