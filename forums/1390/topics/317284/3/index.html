              <p>signing on during BMT is one of the worst **** decisions you can ever make in your life.</p>
              <p>i know of this 3SG guy in my camp last time.....he's very garang, very enthu...to the point he made a rash decision and want to sign on, but luckily some regulars dissuade him. Otherwise.....well....</p>
              <p>I can seriously say when you go back to civilian life, and you think back of the regimentalness in military life,.....you would get shivers down your spine.</p>
              <p>i ORD 3 years ago, now working in office with a lot of young chicks.....and when i think back of my army days.....ugh.</p>
              <p>just serve and fark off....that's the motto you should have.</p>
              <p>the only people who should sign-on as regulars are those who dream about SAF every night, they get orgasms when they see guns and No.4 uniforms etc...if you're not this kind of people, pls don't.</p>
