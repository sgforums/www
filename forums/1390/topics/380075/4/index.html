              <p>i guess you're stuck in a pretty shitty predicament. OC's not helping you, MO is helping your OC to stop you from getting help.. seriously, time to escalate the issue. talk to your CO and highlight to him the seriousness of the problem.</p>
              <p>if you have your psychiatrist's memo to show that you are truly distressed, even better.</p>

              <p>I understand your point and i respect that.</p>
              <p>Why i feel theres a need to point that out because my PS once
              said it to me that, ' You are from jc but you fucking under me, i
              from ITE but i fucking over you. JC so what? Study so much for? You
              still on status, then you just wait.. sure get it from me, play
              stunt extend status, off and leave dont look for me.'</p>
              <p>It may sound normal, but its a big shit to me, he finds it fun
              to take it on me, because he knows i don't have gangs or powerful
              support outside of camp. He jokes and sometimes even put himself
              down in front of other platoon mates just because he think they
              have 'connections' outside. Well, you decide, is his leadership
              questionable.</p>
              <p>He signed on from a man(trooper) to become a spec, so his
              attitude is really like my platoon mates. But who am i to judge,
              when my OC, who has hons degree, cannot even speak a complete and
              proper english sentence, what more can i expect from my
              company?</p>

              <p>You cannot control how others treat you but you can control how you behave and accept such treatment.</p>
              <p>Regardless whether his leadership is questionable, that is not something you can decide. In fact, a large number of regulars are staying in service not because they have good leadership but because they have the skills/knowledge that is required.</p>
              <p>Its very common for ur OC to side with ur PS cos they would have worked together for alot longer and are definitely closer than he would be to you. Siding with each other is something common and happens everywhere, even outside army.</p>
              <p>When i complained about my SSG to my WO, all my WO said was also things like thats how he behaves la, u do ur work well he won't give u trouble etc etc. Ultimately the answer he gave me was to just bear with it also. Obviously the SSG hated me even more but i didn't care and just avoided him whenever i can. It was only in the later months where i mastered the knowledge of the logistic system that he had to change his attitude towards me becos he needed my help.</p>

              <p>Have you ever spoken to your CO etc about it? As <a href="../../../users/260666">weymas</a> has mentioned, since your OC already knows about it, u are not really skipping chain of command by talking to your CO especially with your psychiatrist memo etc to back up your condition.</p>

              <p>Your situation is already bad. Yes theres obviously a risk that things might turn out worse but theres also a possibility that things might improve. You have to decide whether you want to continue things as they currently are or do you wanna take a risk and hope for improvement.</p>
              <p>For the 3rd time today that i'm repeating this...</p>
              <p>Every action/decision will have certain consequences you have to bear regardless good or bad. By makig that decision, you have to be prepared to answer whatever is thrown at you and not start regretting only after things are done/undone.</p>

              <p>Now now, your tone is getting increasingly agitated with every post, littered with more and more assumptions. Haha, that's interesting. :D</p>
              <p>You preached me, "don't assume that
              help must always be the soft approach". This is so hilarious. Since when have I said anything of the lines that "help must always be the soft approach"? <strong>( Assumption #5 )</strong> Kindly don't stuff words into my mouth, thank you, for it only reflects how objective you are. Help cannot always be given by the soft approach. Yes, recalcitrant people have to be dealt with harshly. But surely dealing with someone who is genuinely seeking for help in a harsh manner inapt?</p>
              <p>Thanks for enlightening my day with yet another epic line of yours - Who was the 1 who came in and insult others 1st? Am I supposed to say it's me? LOL. Isn't it clealy that it's those who unnecessarily blasted at the TS the people who came in and insult others first? Did you just admit you're one of those? Sure, you can counter back, but I do really feel pitiful for you because you're <em>countering back for the sake of countering back. </em>Similarly, I can also be free to point out any gross misintepretations/ assumptions on your part, right?</p>
              <p>Having many kengsters here doesn't mean that everyone over here who is seeking for help is a kengster. <strong>( Assumption #6 )</strong> And no, I didn't say that you said I was motivating kengsters! <strong>( Assumption #7 )</strong> It just surprised me, because you mentioned "motivating quitters and kengsters" out of the blue, when there was nothing in TS's statement  that suggested, to me at least, that he was quitting or kenging. I didn't say that you said I was motivating kengsters, my dear friend. Allow me to use your own words to counter you:- PLEASE LEARN TO READ
                                      WHAT I SAID. lol.</p>
              <p>There's no point in pointing out education, but does pointing out education necessarily means he's discriminating one's leadership abilities based on educational level. Can you kindly reread my point in my previous posts before you start rattling off mindlessly like some machine gun here?</p>
              <p>And can you kindly quote where I said you didn't care about people? I didn't say you didn't care about people, and you assumed it to be so. <strong>( Assumption #8 )</strong> I'm saying, based on the circumstances of TS, I don't think it's nice to chide him without knowing whether his case is genuine or not. Don't worry about you blasting at me.

              <p>Now now, your tone is getting increasingly agitated with every
                  post, littered with more and more assumptions. Haha, that's
                  interesting. :D</p>
              <p>You preached me, "don't assume that help must always be the soft
                  approach". This is so hilarious. Since when have I said anything of
                  the lines that "help must always be the soft approach"? <strong>(
                  Assumption #5 )</strong> Kindly don't stuff words into my mouth,
                  thank you, for it only reflects how objective you are. Help cannot
                  always be given by the soft approach. Yes, recalcitrant people have
                  to be dealt with harshly. But surely dealing with someone who is
                  genuinely seeking for help in a harsh manner inapt?</p>
              <p>Thanks for enlightening my day with yet another epic line of
                  yours - Who was the 1 who came in and insult others 1st? Am I
                  supposed to say it's me? LOL. Isn't it clealy that it's those who
                  unnecessarily blasted at the TS the people who came in and insult
                  others first? Did you just admit you're one of those? Sure, you can
                  counter back, but I do really feel pitiful for you because you're
                  <em>countering back for the sake of countering back.</em> Similarly, I can also be free to point out any gross
                  misintepretations/ assumptions on your part, right?</p>
              <p>Having many kengsters here doesn't mean that everyone over here
                  who is seeking for help is a kengster. <strong>( Assumption #6
                  )</strong> And no, I didn't say that you said I was motivating
                  kengsters! <strong>( Assumption #7 )</strong> It just surprised me,
                  because you mentioned "motivating quitters and kengsters" out of
                  the blue, when there was nothing in TS's statement  that
                  suggested, to me at least, that he was quitting or kenging. I
                  didn't say that you said I was motivating kengsters, my dear
                  friend. Allow me to use your own words to counter you:- PLEASE
                  LEARN TO READ WHAT I SAID. lol.</p>
              <p>There's no point in pointing out education, but does pointing
                  out education necessarily means he's discriminating one's
                  leadership abilities based on educational level. Can you kindly
                  reread my point in my previous posts before you start rattling off
                  mindlessly like some machine gun here?</p>
              <p>And can you kindly quote where I said you didn't care about
                  people? I didn't say you didn't care about people, and you assumed
                  it to be so. <strong>( Assumption #8 )</strong> I'm saying, based
                  on the circumstances of TS, I don't think it's nice to chide him
                  without knowing whether his case is genuine or not. Don't worry
                  about you blasting at me. I jolly well know why you're doing so,
                  though you might be extremely reluctant to admit, because (quoted

Yes, I was addressing that 1st post at those who had a fun time blasting at TS. And hey, you responded, and a tad angrily at that, to my post! Hoho. If you aren't one of those who had a fun time blasting at TS, why did you react strongly by making inflammatory replies? Guilty conscience? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> So you had unwittingly revealed your intention of blasting at TS! Unconvinced or had selective memory loss? Read your very first post to TS and touch your heart. Your first sentence is already so harsh: "I don't see whats the point of comparing and highlighting the
                                          educational level of u and ur PS etc. If u think that makes u any

So you see, I really don't know if I should cry or laugh at you, because you keep shooting yourself down with your own words. hahaha!</p>
              <p>Showcase your cases with vivid details and elaborate on your heroic pursuit of the truth then!

I wasn't here to invite trouble <strong>( Assumption #11 )</strong> - my, you really lurrve making assumptions! - I was here to give a piece of my mind.

              <p>Hi schi_zo, I am back. How are you feeling? Are the treatments and medications helping? I hope you are feeling much better. As you can see, even though it seems bleak, there are people out there willing to help you out. Continue on with your treatments and appointments, they should help. Most probably your psychiatrist would ask you the same questions and probably have diagnosed you.</p>
              <p>There is a very strong stigma and common misconception on mental illnesses. Yes some employers might prefer to employ those without any mental history but there are also those who will employ. Since you are already seeing a psychiatrist, you already have a "mental history" which might affect your future when it comes to finding job. I am not trying to scare you but it also depends on how severe your condition is. Whether your future employer will know regarding your medical and mental history actually is up to you whether you would like to declare when they ask. By right, all medical notes are kept in tight confidentiality and can only be passed on from one medical institute to another provided you are in direct care under both institutes. For example, your psychiatrist and SAF MO or medical staff can share and discuss regarding your condition if they are both treating you. So by right again, it should not be leaked, but sometimes unwanted things happen. The important thing is it is plain stupid to keng with a mental illness but it is not when you are seeking treatment if you are genuinely mentally unwell. Same goes to physical illnesses.</p>
              <p>I will not lie to you. The journey to recovery is not easy. It is going to be tough, probably even tougher than what you are going through. There might be relapses or maybe flashbacks or periods of wanting-to-give-up. Do not lose hope. You are still sensible and mature enough to ask for help and withstand all these, you can do it. There will be those who will just bring you down or are just plainly not helping. Bottomline, you have got to help yourself.</p>
              <p>You might want to consider talking to other counsellors, meaning those outside SAF, as it seems like they are not really helping much or you can talk to a close friend that you have outside NS or just talk to someone in your family. You might want to consider spiritual healing too.</p>
              <p>For your platoon mates, someone mentioned something about they might have interesting stories to share. It is true. It might be intimidating but you can try talking to them but if you choose not to, like someone mentioned, there is surely someone nice enough to actually talk to you. It can actually be anyone, not necessarily your bunk mates.</p>
              <p>Remember your primary goal now is to get well, do not put too much energy on other things or worries. Be strong and do not lose hope. In time, you will recover and "what does not kill you only makes you stronger". You will emerge a healthier, better and stronger man. I wish you all the best and do keep me posted of your situation. :)</p>

              I read the whole long stream of posting, obviously TS is giving lots of problem to the platoon. 
              
              Why you do need to cancel your status? If you are unwell, you just tell your boss that you are unwell and need to be post out, cose you cannot help out much also in the team also. 
              
              Medic is a special post. Usually, the bosses will give special treatment to the medic and they treat us extra nice. It is the only post whereby a CPL can eat lunch at the same table with COL. I dont know why they dare to screw your relationship up, because you are the one person that they relied on when they fall sick or injured. They will have to give trust to you because your are going to IV them. It is really a special post that is very important for them. In the outfield, "one life saved vs one man dead" depends you, and you cannot screw up.
              
              In the outfield, especially for platoon, the casualties rate is very high during training. Do you know that usually those who have very good outfield skills will be posted to Unit. Because he cannot screw up the first line of fist aid and he is alone doing all the stuff. 
              
              Medic is usually a JC guy and they will get attached posted to the platoon. For the regulars, you are not the first JC guy that they encountered.So... the problem exists is within you. 
              
              You dont know how to socialize with the rest of the lower level. Even in the army, you have problem. I really dont know how you r going to survive in the outside world. Face that fact that you are going to be a uni grad engineer and that people under you are all from Poly, ITE and BTC, you got to upgrade your EQ and learn to work with them as a team. 
              
              YES to work with them you have to lower yourself, to mix with them.
              
              If I am your boss, I will be desperate to post you out, as you are not helping the team at all.

              <p>Do you know that you have 2 bosses in your camp? </p>
              <p>You are a medic, so you are a part of the medical corps, you are also one of us. I am sure that John Wong will not sit down there and let you get bullied by "Green algae" (lol, he got promoted) . Talk to your senior medic, or MO as administration issue. Do you know that we can pull your medical records by typing your NRIC, and we can email your whoever specialist. If the problem is within yourself then even John cannot help you out. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Medic vocation has special requirement, they are screened for metal stability and fitness at CMPB before they are posted for course. So downgrade as a mental issue is hard for you, because you have a strong mind and is not likely to have a mental breakdown. LOL. </p>

              addressing that 1st post at those who had a fun time blasting at
              TS. And hey, you responded, and a tad angrily at that, to my post!
              Hoho. If you aren't one of those who had a fun time blasting at TS,
              why did you react strongly by making inflammatory replies? Guilty
              conscience? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> So you had unwittingly revealed your intention of
              blasting at TS! Unconvinced or had selective memory loss? Read your
              very first post to TS and touch your heart. Your first sentence is
              already so harsh: "I don't see whats the point of comparing and
              highlighting the educational level of u and ur PS etc. If u think
              that makes u any cleverer, thats plain stupid and idiotic
              behavior." Wow. "plain stupid and idiotic behavior" If that isn't
              shooting I don't know what is. So you see, I really don't know if I
              should cry or laugh at you, because you keep shooting yourself down
              with your own words. hahaha!</p>
              <p>Showcase your cases with vivid details and elaborate on your
              heroic pursuit of the truth then! Of course, cases with elaborate
              and vivid details doesn't necessarily means it's the truth, but
              it's much more likely to be the truth as compared to other clear
              cases of whining/clones, dude!</p>
              <p>You've been repeatedly advocating that this is a free forum and
              yet you can still have the cheek to say "If you want to help TS,
              you can still pm WITHOUT posting and commenting ". Who are you to
              give such orders? haha. Yes, as expected, you will never admit your
              mistakes. I wasn't here to invite trouble <strong>( Assumption #11
              )</strong> - my, you really lurrve making assumptions! - I was here
              to give a piece of my mind. Giving a piece of my mind is not equals

              <p>Choosing to PM or post my advice here is a personal choice and
              is none of your nosey business. Orh, I know why you type that last

              assuming you are by looking things on the surface ( Since I didn't
              give advise to TS here = I cannot be giving TS to advise elsewhere)
              and right now you are trying to cast some doubt that I posted the
              PM, right? :D Sorry, but that doesn't work and you really pwned

              <p>Who cares about assumptions? Never made any assumptions in ur whole life? Life is full of assumptions and almost everything you do has some sort of assumptions in it. Unless you dare swear that you never made any assumptions in ur entire life, don't talk as though you don't.</p>
              <p>I will always blast anyone who might be kenging and theres no way to proof anything posted online. I have as much right to doubt anything TS post as you have to believe and each and everyone can have their own interpretation.</p>
              <p>If you think just because someone post something vivid, you think it must be true, you either seriously lacking experience in the online world or have been living a too lucky life with not enough deceptions to let u learn the truth behind ppl's motives/intentions. You should try to find more time to read all the vivid and look so real fakes thats been posted all over the internet since you seem so free to argue with me.</p>
              <p>Just as you assume ppl ONLY blast at TS, why should everyone else believe you are not just blasting at others? How many people may choose to blast someone and later PM them with something useful? Don't assume you are the only 1 who knows how to pm.</p>

              TS die die must fight for your rights. I think right now your commanders are doing their best to not let your problems leave the camp gates and reach higher authority. I used to have problems too but everybody thought i'm very strong, can handle it myself. Until one day something really happen then they all die cock stand. IMH, SAF Ward, PCC, i all go already. FYI i'm a recce trooper. SAF counselors mostly just provide an outlet for you to air your frustration and give you abit of advice. But since you think the problem doesn't lie with you then how? Can't beat them then join them lor. If not just do your own thing. When tasked to do something, just do it. 
              
              People who shoot you with unfair arrows/sai kang KNOW it's unfair...that's why they want you to do it. You give them one fucked-up face, they lagi shiok. So next time you can just reverse psycho with them....act like damn happy, like you enjoying yourself...they might not stop asking you to do it again, but at least they see you 'happy' they won't get any satisfaction. Don't bother reacting emotionally, coz that's what these bastards want. 
              
              Most importantly you must try to adapt...things don't always work according to what we want...in my unit there's a saying, adapt or die, so die die must adapt. I got over my shit already, even though in the process i lost a few friends, so be it...didn't really need them in the first place. But if your commanders are making it hard for you to adapt, by all means, screw them over the smart way...

              <p>Dude, if your online persona is the same as the one in real life, I can easily see why NOBODY likes you.</p>
              <p>And BTW, I know alot of combat medics in mono-intake.  Rarely heard cases of the entire company hating them, in fact, they received more welfare then the infantry dudes.  The only exception is this one dude who doesn't have alot of people talking to him.  But thats simply because he's just a naturally quiet guy and chooses to be introvert.<br><br>Medics are important people in the company.  Generally, people treat service support people nicely (I know you are combat medic, shut up) because they need them more then vice versa.  So you being treated badly is not a case of bad luck, it simply means theres something about you.  Maybe you are giving off an air of arrogance.  It's not those "lowly-educated" people fault.  You bring this same attitude to "highly-educated" people and they will treat you the same.<br><br>I was once told if there's something you don't like, try to change it.  If you can't change it, adapt yourself to it.  If you can't adapt yourself to it, then complain.</p>

                              <p>Most importantly you must try to adaptâ€¦things donâ€™t always work
              according to what we wantâ€¦in my unit thereâ€™s a saying, adapt or
              die, so die die must adapt. I got over my shit already, even though
              in the process i lost a few friends, so be itâ€¦didnâ€™t really need
              them in the first place. But if your commanders are making it hard
              for you to adapt, by all means, screw them over the smart wayâ€¦</p>

              If you are just being a NSF...I know you are smart and intelligent...why bother when you will be there only for 2 years?

              Agree...but there are times that complain also no point lor...things don't change you just have to live with it...that's life...
              
              ****BTW it doesn't matter whether you are better grade or not...I hate it when I see the CPTs like push their ranks around thinking they are smarter then some of the WOs when they are there a long time already and so call "stuck". who cares whether you have "toilet paper"? Can't they be humble and have some respect...****
