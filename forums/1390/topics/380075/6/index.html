              <p>hai i think in the end, it boils down to the mentality one wants
              to adopt.<strong> I m</strong><strong>ean he does have his probelms, being injured n all,
              but as we all know, its difficult for the commander to know whether
              he keng or not, i m sure all of us kena before the time that you
              were really injured n our instructors ask us to carry on with
              training</strong>. so lets give it to him thats hes unwell shldnt we? but
              then again, ts maybe u gotta review ur mindset. Being a JC student
              is nuthing in army, serious, i was frm JC too, posted to 35 sce,
              where all my guys were mono-intake. i mean since we are in there
              with all of them, den y care whetehr u read more books or what? be
              like them, u ll come to know that they are great people too, they
              are really no less than us, but only if you try to talk to them,
              talk their way, use ur hokkien or teochew or watever you know,
              seriously, just forget that u r frm JC and be one of tehm, u ll
              enjoy ur stay in army ! at least i did! so cummon, try to make the
              best of ur situatuion!</p>

              <p>My company has a down pes medic so he is always in charge of medical coverage for ALL activities. My OC and CSM warned us to not have 2 medics covering, reason being : no reason, they just dont like it. So if i am not covering, and im injured or on status, i tell my ps, i cannot participate. Reply from PS: FUCK YOU JOIN IN. I don't know about you Lokey but my unit needs status for every injury, no status no talk you know? If i tell my PS medic don't need status if i'm not well and can just fall out, he will tell me : MEDIC BIG FUCK? WHAT DON'T NEED STATUS, YOU WANT TO CK IS IT?</p>
              <p>I tried to offer to do the medical cover together with the down pes medic. CSM : FUCK YOU JOIN IN.</p>
              <p>My unit mentality is status = chao keng, no exceptions unless injury is visibly seen.</p>
              <p>My platoon mentality is that if i don't participate in ANY activity or any saikang i not around = chao keng. Dont say exercises or training, even when i have to do my medical centre duty, my platoon sneers at me saying im off to slack and chao keng.</p>
              <p>And Lokey, i am glad that your unit respect your vocation, you are a medic if i am not wrong. My unit doesn't, or at least my platoon tells me medics are slackers, fucking useless pieces of shit, and they dont need me to save them. Argue much?</p>
              <p>Complain? If you read my earlier posts, i already sought help from my MO and it did not work out. And the regulars in my company despise medics because they think we are the most slack vocation in the company and always push the saikang to us.</p>
              <p>And your thinking that anything gone wrong will result in a lawsuit, if thats really the case, the newspapers would be flooded with such. Ever heard of cover-up?</p>
              <p>Lastly, I am really happy that your unit places high importance in medics, I do hope that that respect would be recognised in every unit in the future.</p>

              <p>If you need to see specialists, see lah. Ask for refer letter, need to downgrade, and to post out.</p>
              <p>I seriously dont know what is your problem. </p>
              <p>If your company say he dont want a medic in the company, the top management can arrange whatever necessary. We will all be very happy.</p>
              <p>Ask whoever in charge of you to post you out. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think if the company does not think medic is necessary in the unit. Then we can always arrange for the PC and PS to go for medical course and let them double his role. There is a shortage in the manpower anyway. All the mo will be dammed happy if the medical corps get outsource to private medical healthcare group. </p>

              <p>Medic is an important person in the unit, and he has a task to peform. He is a actually additional support for the company/unit but he is not part of the unit. He is always the outsider, more like an attachment to the unit.</p>
              <p>If the company thinks a medic is not necessary, reflect this to the top managment, we can always withdrawn our manpower from the company, if it is viewed as reductancy.</p>

              Agree on "should really start learning how to get along with others" especially on "even though they might be very different from you", every where you go whether working or studying you will meet different people and you can't make everyone think like you do....
              
              However regarding "NS is a training ground for you to mature and grow up, as well
              as develop team-playing and team-leading abilities." ....even though I am a girl... and never been to NS, however due to my working environment I have worked with NS men to LTC etc then managers/executives....especially NS men...its true that having NS is a training ground that helps to toughen our guys...however there are some who have very bad attitudes and does not feel that doing NS is anything at all....Fact is after NS you will be out of the environment...whatever that happens during that time whether you have been trained an officer or not does not seem to make very much difference...I have 2 friends both are officer who went for OCS and then after NS they both end up in different league....one is a successful manager, the other one is still not up to being a leader in the office environment.....
              
              It all boils down to attitude I guess...how you view the situation...with great attitude, you will shine in where ever you go...why fight for something and die die must win? Sometimes its better to let others win, sit back, relax and enjoy the harmony....

              <p>My friend (fcuking regular) say:</p>
              <p>If u have any problem just reflect back to the officer, unlike BMT, they always put operation need in mind as first priority. Talk to your officer, he is trained to know what to, but don't order him to do things, advice. speak nicely. </p>
              <p>Ask for post out if you feel unfit for your vocation. You have medical record in the system and information can be easy traced. To post you out, it is dammed easy, especially with valid reason. </p>
              <p>If company already has one medic in hand and does not need another medic, it is understandable as they need a combat medic that is fit enough to chong with them at the front line. Actually they are more concern if the c.medic is tough enough, to stay at the front line (not about you as an individual).</p>
              <p>My friend think that c.medic is essential as they have their own responsibility in the outfield. Manpower issue can be arranged. </p>
              <p>As I have mentioned before, NS is just 2 years, health come in as number 1 priority. I will not bother about anything else as disabilities are the only thing that carry with you after you ORD. </p>
              <p>Everything in SAF can be arranged it is very flexible. There is always a fitting position somewhere, whether it is admin, hq or DB... hehehe</p>
              <p>All the top management are JC people and scholars, they can understand you better, and more likely to be intelligent enough to solve this problem, this is a minor issue. Trust them. Most of friends are very capable and they are know their stuff (At least they seems so.)</p>

              <p>To those who had a fun time blasting at TS:</p>
              <p>Clearly the TS is in distress, and yet you bastards here can do
              is to fire at TS with inflammatory and
              <strong>unconstructive</strong> remarks (ie. wimp, loser, pussy) to
              make him feel worse. That's extremely mean, and it speaks volume
              about how unsympathetic and loser-ish you're as a person, really.
              Come on, who are you to comment on how resilient he is, when you
              didn't even go through that crap he's going through? Even if you
              did, congratulations for being such a good thumb-sucker, but that
              doesn't put you on some higher moral grounds to lambast at others.
              TS didn't even say that because he is from JC, therefore he
              deserves better treatment than the others. He was merely stating
              facts, that he's from JC and the others aren't. You drew your own
              screwed-up conclusions (TS is from JC, hence he's proud, arrogant,
              etc) . Are you all envious that you can't enter JC in the first
              place? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Dear TS,</p>
              <p>I can understand your difficulty in your situation. After briefly browsing through all 6pages of your thread, I can jolly well say some are quite good suggestions for your problems. I am also from a mono-intake unit, armour too.</p>
              <p>Since I work in S1 Branch in my unit, I suggest that you can also refer your problem to your unit's S1, since they are supposed to be paracounsellors in the camp too. The reason why I suggested this is because at least he's a neutral party to understand the situation that you are in so that there won't be unfairness in helping you out.</p>
              <p>As for being listed as "chao-keng" or other bad names, I think that it's unavoidable in NS. What I mean is that people go through the training, but there you are, going out of camp but not because you want to, is because you need to. But they just don't understand it. They're just jealous. Put yourselves in their shoes; assuming that you're a stay-in personnel, you see your friend go out of camp, can see the world, the girls, etc. you wished that you also can get to go out.</p>
              <p>For a period of time, I myself also had some issue with this. I was responsible for the Battalion's newsletter. My S1 allowed me to 'work from home' as I needed to use Photoshop CS3. So there was some dissatisfaction within my signal platoon that I was going out quite often. But they don't know that what I'm doing is actually official work; not going out and have fun.</p>
              <p>After the newsletter was finalized, there was even more out-detail. I had to go back and forth to Pasir Laba Camp, to the SAF Printing Centre. It just got worse. But everything settled in when the newsletter came out officially.</p>
              <p>The next time you're forced to do training, take out your status slip. To me, I think it's like a Tramp Card. And even if your PS still insist just mention to him that 'you'll bear all the responsibilities if anything happens to me. I'll make sure that your career will be gone. It's not a threat, it's a promise.'</p>

              <p>Yeah I understand what you feel totally, although I've had the blessing not to have personally undergone it. Its very common. its called group bully and is further fuelled by their inferiority complex. note that such people normally have very fragile egos. They know that they're crappier in life than you, or at least feel that way, it hurts them and when a rare opportunity like this presents itself, that of a specimen that represents whom they resent, and the specimen suay suay is alone, then of cos they lynch and mob. this is human psychology at work.</p>
              <p>Someone i know who went to poly from a top secondary single-sex school also reported the same experience of being mobbed by the bengs and lians there LOL.</p>
              <p>Oh by the way which JC were you from? If from RJ or HC, yes confirmed it's a dire situation and they're out to lynch you, although what the bullies don't know is that 99% of those who go to RC or HCI will also end up as farmers like them! No different! Once they master this truth, maybe they will be less insecure. If you're from a school like Pioneer, Jurong or Serangoon JC then there really isn't much difference between you and them. Tell them to wake the F up and go F each other.</p>
              <p>Is your OC a farmer too? Most likely. You must be in 2SIR. There's an OC there who's dumber than a one-cell organism. He regularly gets lost in the jungle and is a regular butt of jokes and always gets mocked endlessly by his men. This farmer OC is so stupid that during missions, he always gets outsmarted by his men who would purposely lead him to make detours like a fucking fool when he's supposed to be the commander leading the boys. Each time after they make a fool of him, the boys would gleefully relate the tale to the CSM whom they're close to. If you had been one batch earlier, you would have counted yourself blessed under great leadership by the dumb shit's predecessor, a friend of mine, a SAFOS who posted out to go to policy office (DPO) in Mindef late last year, that after he posted out even his men and foot soldiers made proclamations in cyberspace and on his facebook that they miss him.</p>
              <p>But if you had gone to my friend, he would have empathised with you but made a leadership decision of toughening you up and not letting you take the easy out hahaha.</p>

              <p>Thanks for proving TS's point!!!! And for proving what everyone here knows and is fighting to deny because denial is more comfortable than acknowledging that you may be a toad. Please don't take this literally and think I'm calling you a toad. If you had half the brains of a JC student you may understand what I mean and how I may be quoting you but i'm not calling you a toad because the 'you' here does not mean literally you. Gettit?<br><br>You said your friends (BTC) don't like people who project themselves in a 'chim-lish' way and MAKE THEM LOOK STUPID!<br><br>And don't talk about education. And it's admittedly A SENSITIVE TOPIC TO THEM!!<br><br>*Clap Clap* thanks for proving what everyone here who's had the guts to face the truth knows deep inside and articulating so well. <br><br>In general these people feel inferior. And they generally don't get to vent this inferiority because in most cases, the much higher educated people such as the scholars are always always officers so rank-wise they can't do squat. I remember long ago there was one dumb toad who posted in sgforums asking why the government makes all the scholars officers, how about creating specialists safos? oh nevermind out of topic.</p>
              <p>Even slightly higher educated but still relatively dumb twits, like TS's farmer OC with "honours degree", presumably from a farmer (local) university,if chosen to go OCS or SISPEC are out of the claws and clutches of their inferiority complex due to rank. Even if they feel inferior they can't do squat.<br><br>Its when someone who represents whom they resent, oddly in a very rare instance presents himself to be the same rank as them in a mono intake, that gives them the perfect launchpad and opportunity to MOB. This mobbing is a manifestation of the inferiority complex you so directly and candidly put in words here.Shit is this chim-lish?! Help don't mob me.</p>

              <p>NS does have a role in integrating different classes of people

              <p>Corporate world mirrors the military in that sense, you're
                                          forced to work with diverse individuals and it's up to you to find
                                          a common ground where everyone can get along and thrive. </p>
              <p>In the military,<strong> constant harping about one's educational status
                                          i</strong>s a surefire way to lose friends and make enemies. Respect is
                                          garnered through how you can respect others and not let them down
                                          in a team environment. Don't nitpick on whether you are brainier

              <p>TS has made himself clear that he only stated he's a JC kid in this forum, and not in camp, because he was here soliciting for advice, because it is obvious to him, as it would be to anyone smarter than a one-cell organism, they are mobbing and singling him because of it. How do you expect him to tell his sorrowful tale in an accurate manner to get the best advice here, without telling it like it is? Does it mean he even mentioned he's from JC to the bozos all the time, in a boastful way or like it matters to him?

              <p>Actually I know what might be happening. Medic is really the no. 1 slacker job in the SAF.</p>
              <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The medic really doing nothing when they are on medical cover during training. Imagine, we are from the same company, we are in FBO, swearing like mad and being tekan like siao under the hot sun. Then when we raised our head in push up position. And the medic is lying on the stretcher, using his hartman solution as pillow, reading FHM, drinking coffee, fanning with the causalty card, listening to mp3, under the cool windy tree and have a higher pay!!!  Sianz. </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Actually... to the medic he is doing so many things at one time, really busy. Really busy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Even overnight medical centre duties, the medic watches TV in the air-conditioned room, eating pizza, play computer games, surfing internet and get off the next day, also very busy. While the men have to walk around the camp, sweating, on a 3 hours shift overnight. </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">No wonder the men hate the medic so much.   </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">But... even though the medic job is a no1 slacker job. It is the most real applicable useful vocation in the SAF. We are working, while slacking. And every1 wants the medic to be fat and white. Because when the medic is busy, it means that there is casualties and no one want casualties during training or in camp. </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Oh! usually the medics are stay out personnel, from 8 to 5.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">But there is a problem that came in when the medic is required to chong with the platoon. Too fat cannot run... lol</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">I remember there is a time when a regular commando who is attached to us during medical training. He is so shock!! First we are so rude, we dont respect his rank at all, then he say this is really picnic, not outfield training. We are like lol. Do you want some Maggi Noodles and banana? </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Medic is really one of the most despicable and slacker vocation. But it is very real, as I got real severe causalities before. I had seen death and blood before. </span></p>
              <p>But I am not as lobo as my brother who is a Pes B, Welfare Clerk in the S<strong>P</strong>F.  </p>

              usually if not on medical cover, I will help out in the medical center or in the office. And when book out, will offer to help the men (men and sg) to buy cigarettes and tip bits. ( i dont really consider myself part of the platoon and unit at all). when go canteen, will offer to buy the breakfast/teabreak and coffee for the officer and spec. most important thing is to advise the men how to downgrade ... hehehe. I also help in the office to sort out document, because my IT, planning and management skills are better than my medical skills.  I hang out with the officers more because we somehow click together. 
              
              To think about it, I have never greet or salute officer, SIR before, it is kind of rude... BUT I greet SGT, SGT? 
              
              I always tease my regular friend outside and greet or salute them, Sir, though.  
              
              One need to understand the need of individuals and provide them with the real help. Then the respect is given. Respect do not came in just like that. But most important thing is I can do at least 30 pull-up at one go. And I can do at least 6 set of 12 pull up in one PT sessions.

              <p>No one in this thread thinks that there's anything special to be from 'top sec schools and JC'. (refer to my post above about how 99% of NSFs from RJC and HCI become farmers in life and society anyway).JC, top or not, both are nothing. Its the university degree that dictates the life, not the freaking JC and 99% of students in top JC end up as farmers in NUS/NTU/SMU</p>
              <p>Its true that the military has different rules in effective socialisation. Many times, the discrepancy is bridged because the system assigns pretty standardised lots for different groups. Hence its near impossible for a group of men to pick on a spec who came from a supposedly better place for them.</p>
              <p>When you put one in a big group of those unlike him in the same appointment, it's the sole feeder fish in a tank of predators of sharks, regardless of how the lone ranger oils the machinery of socialisation.</p>
              <p>It is way easier for those in a certain place of authority (sergeant, officer) to talk about being 'nice', reaching out to the men and helping the boys in the course of their NS work-life to win over their trust slowly. NSF officers try that all the time, some succeed.</p>
              <p>It's easy to talk 'big' and sound self-righteous from a place of high-horse where you're protected by rank. That's because the rank puts you in a 'safe' place to even begin doing it. To claim that there is no protection from rank is just pure hypocrisy.</p>
