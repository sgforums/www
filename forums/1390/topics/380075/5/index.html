              <p>Who cares about assumptions? Never made any assumptions in ur
              whole life? Life is full of assumptions and almost everything you
              do has some sort of assumptions in it. Unless you dare swear that
              you never made any assumptions in ur entire life, don't talk as
              though you don't.</p>
              <p>I will always blast anyone who might be kenging and theres no
              way to proof anything posted online. I have as much right to doubt
              anything TS post as you have to believe and each and everyone can
              have their own interpretation.</p>
              <p>If you think just because someone post something vivid, you
              think it must be true, you either seriously lacking experience in
              the online world or have been living a too lucky life with not
              enough deceptions to let u learn the truth behind ppl's
              motives/intentions. You should try to find more time to read all
              the vivid and look so real fakes thats been posted all over the
              internet since you seem so free to argue with me.</p>
              <p>Just as you assume ppl ONLY blast at TS, why should everyone
              else believe you are not just blasting at others? How many people
              may choose to blast someone and later PM them with something
              useful? Don't assume you are the only 1 who knows how to pm.</p>

              <p>Haha! Read your own post again - it's full of over-inflated egoism, highly defensive and bigotry. Who cares about assumptions? Wow, that's another epic line from you again! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> You still can say such self-righteous statements so outrightly, which only shows you are indeed desperately trying to cover up your own blunders by saying other people also assuming!

Did you blast at TS, and upon my blasting, realised your mistake, and decided to PM him? If that's the case, I did TS some justice then!

              <p>I will agree with that.</p>
              <p>However are still a decent number of teenagers who thinks that such things only happens in NS where they are stuck but once they go out to work, they can quit anytime they are unhappy. However most do not consider that there are only that many times u can quit a job and no boss will hire a frequent quitter who cannot offer a good explaination about his reasons for job hoping so often.</p>

              <p>It might be argued that one's attitude in a military setting usually more or less reflects his work ethic (under similar pressure and impending deadlines) in his future corporate career. </p>

              <p>Alot of them do not understand the difficulties of getting a job and just think that they can switch anytime they want if they are unhappy without regards to contracts, terms and conditions they have to abide by when they are in a workplace.</p>

I mean he does have his probelms, being injured n all, but as we all know, its difficult for the commander to know whether he keng or not, i m sure all of us kena before the time that you were really injured n our instructors ask us to carry on with training. so lets give it to him thats hes unwell shldnt we? but then again, ts maybe u gotta review ur mindset. Being a JC student is nuthing in army, serious, i was frm JC too, posted to 35 sce, where all my guys were mono-intake. i mean since we are in there with all of them, den y care whetehr u read more books or what? be like them, u ll come to know that they are great people too, they are really no less than us, but only if you try to talk to them, talk their way, use ur hokkien or teochew or watever you know, seriously, just forget that u r frm JC and be one of tehm, u ll enjoy ur stay in army ! at least i did! so cummon, try to make the best of ur situatuion!</p></div>

              <p>yea true true. TS should really start learning how to get along with others. not only in NS, next time when you go to uni or into the workforce, you need to get along with your peers/colleagues, even though they might be very different from you.</p>
              <p>NS is a training ground for you to mature and grow up, as well as develop team-playing and team-leading abilities.</p>
