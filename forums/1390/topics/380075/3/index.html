              <p>As far as i know PP2 is for SSG and above. U take about 5 yrs or so to get 1SG. 2 yrs as 3SG, another 2-3yrs as 2SG before u get ur 1SG. Depends on how long ur contract is of cos since logistics contract is 10 yrs, die die will get 1SG whether they get PP2 or not.</p>

              <p>You're just shooting yourself in the foot, hard. *pain. By the same virtue, "if u don't like what I say, u do not have to read." You are saying that some forummers are <strong>"giving advices"</strong>. Are you sure? There is a huge difference between giving advice and hurling malicious words you know. You think those malicious words are called for/ productive? Yes, granted, there're people who really gave some form of advice to TS, but they shouldn't be affected by what I had said previously, because I was addressing to those who're sadistically pouring salt into the wound onto TS, who are gleefully making insulting, name-calling at TS, and making unconstructive remarks. I'm sure you can see that for yourself.</p>
              <p>Times have changed, so have people. Different generations have different mentalities and deal with things differently because of different upbringings. It's not fair to attribute the fault on the youngsters for not being as resilient as the older generation (take note that this is a generalisation in itself) on the youngsters themselves. And have you tried putting yourself in TS's shoes before voicing out vehemently? Are you in his vocation? Can you feel exactly what he is feeling? The acute psychological pain of ostracism, being a target for bullying, and the strong feel of injustice and helplessness as he had mentioned? If one hadn't experienced those harrowing experiences before, I suggest that they better refrain from shooting others, because they don't have the right to do so.</p>
              <p>And look at the bare facts. He stated he's from JC, and his commanders are ITE, etc. Did he say "oh, I'm from JC, so the ITE people suck!" ? He didn't. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You implied that yourself.</span> Since he didn't spell out explicitly, how come you can be on higher moral grounds and shoot TS down ah, just because you <strong>assumed</strong> he meant it in that way, when he mentioned about JC and ITE? oops.</p>
              <p>And well done, you said I shouldn't judge others because I've a different interpretation. Wow. Aren't you judging TS, along with others, because he has a different interpretation/impression/mode of dealing of NS with you in the first place? That's being ultra hypocritical of you.</p>

              <p>If you think only sympathy is advice, please note that this is SAF forum not aunt agony nor is this SAF counselling hotline. Noone here is required to come here to offer sympathy.</p>
              <p>What we offer is our views, experiences etc. This is a free forum and everyone has the right to post their own views. TS has to suffer any attacks he has recieve by choosing to post here. If you don't agree with our way, thats ur own problem. If you don't feel its advice, thats also ur problem. If you feel sympathy is all TS needs, u can give it all you like cos we are not going to. We are not here to motivate quitters, kengsters etc. Unless you choose to regularly post here and offer your 'advice', don't come and talk like some old experience regular who knows everyone well enough to judge any of us.</p>
              <p>How do u know i have never went through some of the things TS has mentioned? Do you know the stuff i went through in NS? You don't so don't assume i had an easy life slacking all day without doing anything. I didn't survive NS by being a whiner. You do not know what each and every forummer that post here has went through. Some might have went through worse some better and that is not for you to judge.</p>
              <p>There is no need to mention the education of anyone. In SAF your education means little since its your vocational knowledge and skills that is of more value. Leadership does not come with education. There is no assurance that a JC/poly student but surely be a good leader and a ITE student is surely a bad leader. I've seen many JC/poly students who are totaly weaklings as well as seen ITE students who show good leadership potential. By emphasising the education, its as good as saying ITE students are not fit to be commanders etc and that is an insult to alot of ppl out there.</p>
              <p> If you are not here to offer any constructive advice to TS, you should not even be here commenting on what the rest have to say since you are in no way anymore helpful than any spamer.</p>

              <p>Hi people, i've have read through the previous posts, and just want to clarify that, why i stated i am from jc and they are from ITE is because they treated me differently from where i study. I just dont wan to join them in their daily practices of smoking, playing psp etc. Im sorry but i dont really enjoy in doing all those.. What they always want to talk about is sex? clubbing? their gang out of camp? i mean it isnt in my interest at all. My lack of concern for their interests seems to start their bad attitudes towards me. There are worse and even higher degree of unfairness, but i do not want to spell it all out, i don't want to risk getting recognised...</p>
              <p><strong>Me being the only JC guy, and my difference in interests, gets me bullied. So here is the question, you guys keep saying I am arrogant and snobbish because im from jc. So should i change my personality to adapt to their interests? Should i degrade myself and pretending to be someone, to please them? </strong></p>
              <p>About my PS, he is obviously against me, i can see his attitude against me and the others are like heaven and hell. I reiterate again, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he dislike me because I am on status for injury and i am a stayout when im posted into this unit. </span>I dont know why but i think he feels that i am just a lowly man i should not deserve priviledges like stay out like him as he is a regular. I even heard from the pes c admin people, that in the office he even <span style="text-decoration: underline;">called me a dog</span>, when i cancelled my status because i wanted to keep a low profile, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he said the dog is very ä¹–.</span> Of course i confront him also useless, he can just deny it, the witness also wont stand by my side to oppose the PS.</p>
              <p>Worse thing is my PS even spoke bad things about me behind my back. How i know? Everytime i am walking alone to anywhere and i see a commander, he will point at me and whisper to his friend. I walk closer and i hear ' he come already, he come already, don't say liao later he hear.'</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Can understand how i live my life at camp everyday? </span></p>
              <p>Of course i already said, they even try to make use of me, as im a medic, they thought i could play the system by 'giving' them a 'fever' on the report sick slip. If i don't? well you can guess what they do.</p>
              <p>Well, im just sick and tired of NS. Sorry for being weak..or pussy-like.</p>
              <p>What i did till now was see a private specialist/psychiatrist for this and I feel better now after consultation and medication. Now, because i endorsed my mc to my MO, he told my OC straight away, and my OC thinks i am trying to chao keng by kenging mad. He wants to send me to MMI and hopefully send me to IMH, and last, hopefully get a record for having P case which will hinder my job opportunities in the future.</p>
              <p>Wonderful thing is my MO is a NSF and is giving out his 100% to help my OC, really unbelievable stuff. Can't believe the relationship between a medic and MO really is that small and insignificant..</p>

              <p>well, if you are truly troubled by the things in camp, you HAVE the rights to contact a SAF counsellor (the SAF counselling centre is in CMPB). nobody can stop you from seeking help if you truly have problems. like in some of the previous posts, if your OC knows of your problems but refuse to help you, escalate it and bring it up to your CO. you will not be accused of skipping the chain of command because your OC already has knowledge of your issue and refused to help you.</p>
              <p>you won't go to IMH so easily. the SAF psychiatrists (also CPT and above MOs) will determine your condition, and if you are just troubled, they WILL refer you to the SAF counselling centre for counselling.</p>
              <p>i understand that you are feeling troubled, and i can sense that you have a genuine problem. not everybody can have a good time in NS, but we have no choice. </p>
              <p>if you have a genuine case, fight all the way and bring it all the way up to relevant authorities.</p>

              <p>What they made u do is seriously wrong. Reporting would get u in trouble with them obviously but not reporting it will be a more serious offence for you if its found out. It might make life tough but personally i would rather have informed the OC etc about it and should they do any actions, report it up again. Some might say thats being a telltaler but to me i will do whats right and to protect myself from trouble from the top.</p>
              <p>All medical records are strictly confidential and should never be revealed to external parties so it will not be able to affect your future if that is your cause of concern. They are just threatening u so that you would not give them trouble. Unless you are given a PES F grade which is highly impossible, there is no way any future employer will know what happens to u during NS.</p>

              <p>As i mentioned before, leadership etc does not come with education and whether they are from ITE, poly, JC etc, there are always fucked up ppl as well as friendly ppl around. For ur peers thats fine but by specifically pointing out ur sgt is an ITE student, that seems more like u are saying ITE students shld not be a spec etc which is not of any use to me since regardless of his education, a spec is a spec and nothing changes that fact.</p>
              <p>Some ppl chooses to blend in with their environment, changing themselves to fit in, some chooses to stayaway and find their own clique of people with their own interest. Neither is really right or wrong but just different coping methods ppl use. Degrade is a rather strong word to use i would say and i would prefer the word blending in. Pretences happens all the time and from everyone. How many ppl u meet are really genuine and not putting on a 'mask' in front of you?</p>

              <p>Hello TS,</p>
              <p>It sounds like you are indeed unlucky being stuck in such a predicament. And I can probably think what made you felt so alone and helpless.</p>
              <p>Supposed you have been posted to a non-mono inake unit, but yet the same predicament befalls you, what is the experience going to be like for you? What would tou do to confront the new occurrence</p>
              <p>I am not here to judge, neither would I want to trumpet myself to tell some insidestory. But I wanted to help you, so consider how you would answer the two simple questions above, and maybe we could discuss further</p>

              <p>don't worry about it. as long as you have reported to your OC, it means he already has knowledge about it. if he refuses to help you, and you find that you are still stuck in the same situation, you can bring it up to your CO. Tell your CO that you have already brought it to the attention of your OC, but nothing has changed.</p>
              <p>don't give up. if your platoon gives you a harder time, even better. because it will make you even more stressed and you might really break down, prompting your superiors to take notice. </p>

              <p>If you think only sympathy is advice, please note that this is
              SAF forum not aunt agony nor is this SAF counselling hotline. Noone
              here is required to come here to offer sympathy.</p>
              <p>What we offer is our views, experiences etc. This is a free
              forum and everyone has the right to post their own views. TS has to
              suffer any attacks he has recieve by choosing to post here. If you
              don't agree with our way, thats ur own problem. If you don't feel
              its advice, thats also ur problem. If you feel sympathy is all TS
              needs, u can give it all you like cos we are not going to. We are
              not here to motivate quitters, kengsters etc. Unless you choose to
              regularly post here and offer your 'advice', don't come and talk
              like some old experience regular who knows everyone well enough to
              judge any of us.</p>
              <p>How do u know i have never went through some of the things TS
              has mentioned? Do you know the stuff i went through in NS? You
              don't so don't assume i had an easy life slacking all day without
              doing anything. I didn't survive NS by being a whiner. You do not
              know what each and every forummer that post here has went through.
              Some might have went through worse some better and that is not for
              you to judge.</p>
              <p>There is no need to mention the education of anyone. In SAF your
              education means little since its your vocational knowledge and
              skills that is of more value. Leadership does not come with
              education. There is no assurance that a JC/poly student but surely
              be a good leader and a ITE student is surely a bad leader. I've
              seen many JC/poly students who are totaly weaklings as well as seen
              ITE students who show good leadership potential. By emphasising the
              education, its as good as saying ITE students are not fit to be
              commanders etc and that is an insult to alot of ppl out there.</p>

              <p>I didn't say only sympathy is advice. In fact, I think sympathy isn't advice! <strong>( Assumption #1 )</strong> Aunt Agony or not, none of you are obliged to offer sympathies to him. Constructive and concrete steps offered are advice. But I don't think there's a need to rain insults and contempt over someone who isn't doing well either, it just shows that you are being plain nasty.</p>
              <p>Yes, yes, you've repeated again and again that this is a free forum. But yet, you've again, shamelessly shown how hypocritical you are, by telling me "don't come and talk
                                      like some old experience regular who knows everyone well enough to
                                      judge any of us.". LOL. If I don't agree with your way, it's my problem, but surely I can voice it out right! Why are you prompting me not " to come and talk like some old experience regular" ? Where is the freedom in the free forum that you're purporting if you are prompting me to restrain myself? Hypocrite. Why, scared I expose how weak your statements are is it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I'm not here to motivate quitters and kengsters too. Which part of what TS posted suggested that he's trying to quit or keng? He's just voicing out the turbulences he faced. Oh dear, you assumed again. <strong>( Assumption #2 )</strong></p>
              <p>Besides, I didn't state conclusively that you didn't have a hard life in NS. I asked if you had, but I didn't say you hadn't. So, unlike what you had assumed <strong>( Assumption #3 )</strong>, I wasn't assuming, like what you've always been doing. Good for you that you survived NS, and without whining! Ok, so? Other people may not be as resilient as you, and why can't you try to lend him a helping hand, <strong>and encourage him to take concrete actions to deal with NS positively</strong>, instead of happily è�½äº•ä¸‹çŸ³?</p>
              <p>Yes, there isn't an established relationship between education and leadership skills. However, you've yet to, again, see the difference between mentioning and harping on JC/ITE. TS merely <em>mentioned</em> that he's from JC and the others aren't, so communication is more difficult. What's wrong with that? Let me reiterate, you assumed <strong>( Assumption #4 )</strong> that by saying he's from JC and the others aren't, TS is saying that other people - who aren't from JC - can't lead. Thereafter, you still expounded on your own baseless assumptions and gave 1 whole paragraph on that.</p>
              <p>As we can well see, your overassuming nature is really blinding. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"> Of course, you'll try furiously to cover your backside by producing another long fury piece of tenuous arguments which is heavily based on nothing but assumptions. <strong>If you so desire the need to blast at people who are in need of help</strong>, by all means go ahead, but be prepared to be blasted by others for your uncaring nature! It's the same logic.</p>

              <p>Ts..stories like this have been told countless times. Before I go about shooting away at u.. The main points from your situation seems to be.</p>
              <p>1. Unable to adapt to environment.</p>
              <p>2. Have an injury and is told to carry out tasks beyond your means.</p>
              <p>3. Sick and tired of NS...</p>
              <p>4. Giving superiors the impression that you are breaking down and unstable.</p>
              <p>Ok let's be objective. Cases like this are no uncommon. Your superiors have seen countless cases like you and should ( notice I use should) be able to handle your problem. Regardless of whether they understand your problem, this is my take. The first problem is up to you to overcome. I'm very sure there are people whom you can relate to, be it 1 person or the whole platoon. You do not need to socialise with everyone, gotta figure that our yourself. i'm not gonna comment on 3 as it pains me to do so.</p>
              <p>The last point could be against your favour. Showing that you are breaking down after failing to adapt to NS life sends a very clear signal that you are either ill or that you could be faking you way out. Both demands drastic actions and I reckon it would be detrimental to you especially so if you are clearly not ill. My advice is not to fake it if you are really not.</p>
              <p>Lastly the 3rd point which warrants attention if it's a genuine case. If you are really unable to carry out the tasks assigned, go to your commanders..Your ps,pc.oc..Tell them clearly what you can or can't do. If all fails request for a meeting with you co or simply dial saf hotline. But before you do so..Please make sure you have a case and stop thinking that everyone is against you. I hope you are a genuine case if not db awaits you, i assure you.</p>

              saying I am arrogant and snobbish because im from jc. So should i
              change my personality to adapt to their interests? Should i degrade
              myself and pretending to be someone, to please them?</strong></p>
              <p>As i mentioned before, leadership etc does not come with
              education and whether they are from ITE, poly, JC etc, there are
              always fucked up ppl as well as friendly ppl around. For ur peers
              thats fine but by specifically pointing out ur sgt is an ITE
              student, that seems more like u are saying ITE students shld not be
              a spec etc which is not of any use to me since regardless of his
              education, a spec is a spec and nothing changes that fact.</p>
              <p>Some ppl chooses to blend in with their environment, changing
              themselves to fit in, some chooses to stayaway and find their own
              clique of people with their own interest. Neither is really right
              or wrong but just different coping methods ppl use. Degrade is a
              rather strong word to use i would say and i would prefer the word
              blending in. Pretences happens all the time and from everyone. How
              many ppl u meet are really genuine and not putting on a 'mask' in
              front of you?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I understand your point and i respect that.</p>
              <p>Why i feel theres a need to point that out because my PS once said it to me that, ' You are from jc but you fucking under me, i from ITE but i fucking over you. JC so what? Study so much for? You still on status, then you just wait.. sure get it from me, play stunt extend status, off and leave dont look for me.'</p>
              <p>It may sound normal, but its a big shit to me, he finds it fun to take it on me, because he knows i don't have gangs or powerful support outside of camp. He jokes and sometimes even put himself down in front of other platoon mates just because he think they have 'connections' outside. Well, you decide, is his leadership questionable.</p>
              <p>He signed on from a man(trooper) to become a spec, so his attitude is really like my platoon mates. But who am i to judge, when my OC, who has hons degree, cannot even speak a complete and proper english sentence, what more can i expect from my company?</p>

              forum. But yet, you've again, shamelessly shown how hypocritical
              you are, by telling me "don't come and talk like some old
              experience regular who knows everyone well enough to judge any of
              us.". LOL. If I don't agree with your way, it's my problem, but
              surely I can voice it out right! Why are you prompting me not " to
              come and talk like some old experience regular" ? Where is the
              freedom in the free forum that you're purporting if you are
              prompting me to restrain myself? Hypocrite. Why, scared I expose
              how weak your statements are is it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I'm not here to motivate quitters and kengsters too. Which part
              of what TS posted suggested that he's trying to quit or keng? He's
              just voicing out the turbulences he faced. Oh dear, you assumed
              again. <strong>( Assumption #2 )</strong></p>
              <p>Besides, I didn't state conclusively that you didn't have a hard
              life in NS. I asked if you had, but I didn't say you hadn't. So,
              unlike what you had assumed <strong>( Assumption #3 )</strong>, I
              wasn't assuming, like what you've always been doing. Good for you
              that you survived NS, and without whining! Ok, so? Other people may
              not be as resilient as you, and why can't you try to lend him a
              helping hand, <strong>and encourage him to take concrete actions to
              deal with NS positively</strong>, instead of happily è�½äº•ä¸‹çŸ³?</p>
              <p>Yes, there isn't an established relationship between education
              and leadership skills. However, you've yet to, again, see the
              difference between mentioning and harping on JC/ITE. TS merely
              <em>mentioned</em> that he's from JC and the others aren't, so
              communication is more difficult. What's wrong with that? Let me
              reiterate, you assumed <strong>( Assumption #4 )</strong> that by
              saying he's from JC and the others aren't, TS is saying that other
              people - who aren't from JC - can't lead. Thereafter, you still
              expounded on your own baseless assumptions and gave 1 whole
              paragraph on that.</p>
              <p>As we can well see, your overassuming nature is really blinding.
              <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"> Of course, you'll try furiously to cover your
              backside by producing another long fury piece of tenuous arguments
              which is heavily based on nothing but assumptions. <strong>If you
              so desire the need to blast at people who are in need of
              help</strong>, by all means go ahead, but be prepared to be blasted
              by others for your uncaring nature! It's the same logic.</p>

              <p>Some people just needs to be fucked to wakeup their idea. Not all cases are genuine. There are some who woke up after being fucked by people here and they have changed so don't assume that help must always be the soft approach.</p>
              <p>Who was the 1 who came in and insult others 1st? Since you can insult us, why can't i counter back? As i say its a free forum so i'm free to counter any of your statements that i'm not happy with. How long have you been following this forum? How many kengsters have you seen to know how often we have kengsters in the forum?</p>
              <p>Did i say you came to motivate kengsters? PLEASE LEARN TO READ WHAT I SAID. I SAID WE DON'T AND NOT YOU DO.</p>
              <p>Anyone can lead so why is there a need to point out education? Do you go around everyone and point out the education level of everyone around you? What is the purpose of mentioning the education level of your superior?</p>
              <p>I'm been here for many yrs. I've blasted many and been blasted but here i still am and people who i've interacted with knows me well enough to know my stand on certain issues. Now YOU ARE ASSUMING i don't care about people. If you have the time, go read through all my post before you ASSUME that i only blast people or do i only blast people like you.</p>
