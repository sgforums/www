              <p><strong>Those who require exit permit of 2 years or longer will

              Guarantee must be furnished. The amount of the security bond is
              S$75,000 or 50% of the combined gross annual income of both parents

              will be a fine of up to $2,000, with no custodial sentences. They

              applying for an exit permit would have committed an offence under
              the Enlistment Act. They will be liable upon conviction to a fine
              of up to $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years

              <p>Basically.. the laws regarding the ages is to prevent and discourage boys from being taken out of the country.</p>
              <p>&lt;12 years old = primary 5 or 6. Haven't done PSLE, so no "official" school results to base on for foreign schools. The job would be harder for parents to find a suitable school.</p>
              <p>&lt;16.5 years old = sec 4, haven't done O level. same story.</p>
              <p>for renouncing Citizenship... so long you have already entered 16.5 years old and liable for NS, you cannot renounce until you serve it.</p>
              <p>Fishbuff1's friends might be able to renounce the citizenship on virtue of dual citizenship (Singapore allows dual citizenship until 21 years old).</p>
              <p>For dual citizenship, it is unclear. Singapore does not have a very specific law on the repercussion if one is caught to have 2 citizenships. Singapore's policy is that Dual Citizenship is NOT recognised.</p>
              <p>meaning, should a US/Singapore Citizen is caught in singapore doing somethign criminal, the person is not entitled to the rights that a US citizen should get while caught in singapore (i.e. access to consular assistance, etc)</p>
              <p>In fact I have known people who are allowed to keep their Singapore citizenship when they want to renounce it for other citizenship.</p>
