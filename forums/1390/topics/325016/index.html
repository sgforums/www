              <p>About 1,000 Singaporeans give up their citizenship each year<br>Posted: 21 July 2008 2352 hrs</p>
              <p><br>SINGAPORE: In the last three years, an average of 1,000 Singaporeans gave up their citizenship each year.</p>
              <p>Deputy Prime Minister and Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng said their reasons for doing so vary, and these range from marriage to foreigners, to yearning for a different environment.</p>
              <p>Most of them took up new citizenship in countries in Southeast Asia, the United States and Australia.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong gave this update in reply to a written question from Non-Constituency MP Sylvia Lim.</p>
              <p>She had asked how many Singapore citizens emigrated from Singapore in the last three years, the countries they emigrated to and their reasons for doing so.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong said those who emigrate generally do not declare this to the Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority when they leave.</p>
              <p>So the only available data which gives an indication of the number of emigrants from Singapore is the number of Singaporeans who have given up their citizenship and left Singapore. - CNA/vm <br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/361829/1/.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/361829/1/.html</a></p>

              <p>It is that family's choice, and it takes far more guts to leave your comfort zone.</p>
              <p>However, his son will face problems when he needs to return to Singapore to give a speech/lecture/work in the future.</p>
              <p>Unless he still registers for NS at the age of 17. But, like I said, we should not judge the actions of others needlessly.</p>

              are getting fresh encouragement from a range of sources to take a
              break — a "gap year" — before plunging into college. But to be
              beneficial, it needs to involve more than rest and
              relaxation.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">This
              spring, high schools in seven metropolitan areas hosted their first
              gap-year fairs to acquaint students with options for spending a
              year away from the academic treadmill. Earlier in the year,
              Princeton University announced plans to formalize a "bridge year"
              program for admitted students to do service work abroad before
              enrolling.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Meanwhile,
              gap-year consultants have ramped up efforts to serve what they see
              as a market ripe for growth.</span></span></p>
