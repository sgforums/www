Unlike some of SAF medals for physical fitness cuz it is every fighting soldier responsibility to keep themselves fit and ready.I dont think the US Army have medals like <strong>Karate Black Belt or the I have been to the Himalayas to climb mountain badge.As for long service medals and ribbons,I think SAF should have a more appetizing fruit salad to be pinned on experience soldiers chests.</strong>[/quote][/i]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>now the US Army has medals for many of their overseas missions and even commendation medals for good staff work... it is a fact that the US Army is more '' highly decorated '' than the SAF.<br><br>We have our own unique badges... just like the US Army. They have the astronaut badge and some other badges like Heiborne Badge...<br><br>We have our own set of badges like those from the Engineers or even the Silent Precision Drill Badge from the MPs.<br><br>As a matter of fact, the US Army does have a badge for physical excellence. But it's a sew on/ iron on badge that is worn on their PT Attire.<br><br>Most armies/defence forces greatly appreciate fitness as a means to keep their forces battle ready... so having physical excellence badges are a norm.</div>
