            <div class='col-md body'>Is it possible to have a mature discussion on racial bias in the SAF? I sure hope so....<br><br>There are NO Malays in Armour. There are Indians and Chinese and ahem... "others"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  I was surprised that some Armour camps didnt even serve Muslim food at the cookhouse. Now if anything, THAT should be a big indicator that there is simply no need to cater for Muslims' (no matter the race) dietary prejudices, because if you're a DECLARED Chinese-Muslim or Indian-Muslim, you will NOT get sent to Armour. Or Military Intelligence. Or etc...<br><br>We really should not brush this issue under some rug. Most people are aware of the need for security, especially with respect to the largely Muslim population of the neighbouring countries. The possibility of the Muslims within the SAF turning into some sort of fifth column in the event of a conflict is one that most people, no matter the race, would scoff at. However, the racial restrictions still remain, and people should be aware of them. If you are a Muslim in the SAF, you will NOT be treated the same as others.<br><br>Is this really so bad though? Many countries practice negative discrimination based on security reasons, for entry into some branches of the security services. On the other hand, there is also the phenomenon of positive discrimination, so you see, for example, women getting favourable treatment and lower standards. Such things happen in many countries, not just Singapore.<br><br>One thing that many Muslims dont like to acknowledge is that Islam preaches a universality of brotherhood, so in theory, a Muslim in one country should not take up arms against another. In practice, the fairly recent phenomenon of nationalism has succeeded pretty well in making such a value one of theory alone. Of course, the more ancient ideology of tribalism did not prevent Muslims (and other adherents of universal type religions/ ideologies) from merrily hacking each other to death. But is this a risk national leaders would be willing to accept? That there would be those among their own armed forces that would be swayed more by religion than by nationalism? After all the Abrahamic religions, and many others besides, claim to supercede all other callings including nationalism.<br><br>Sorry for the hijack... but I just dont like it when some people act as if racial bias in the SAF either does not exist or should not be discussed.<br><br></div>

The only malay which i seen in my camp for my time there is the driver from an infantry camp.

I just hope that this will slowly change as time goes by. I mean take a look at the new immigrants such as the Blacks. One day they may wish to settle down and they and their children will serve NS, where do we place them then?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nope, no Malays in AI. The Armour camps I went to didn't even have Muslim food served at the cookhouse. Im surprised that the Sungei Gedong one even has a small section...<br><br>Oh and the concept of us all being green? Its nice... and commanders should definitely treat their men that way. But NO, on an army wide level, not to mention in the Armed Forces as a whole, there is no such thing. Malays and Muslims just have to accept that they will not be accepted to every single one of the services for the forseeable future. Maybe in time restrictions will be eased; some have already been, so there is hope yet.<br><br>Its quite amazing that there are so many Malays in Guards and ADF as it is. But even then, in Guards, there are no Malays in stuff like the ATGM platoons, or in Light Strike, or in BRC. Just the way it is.</div>
