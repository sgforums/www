            <div class='col-md body'>dear gals,<br><br>ever thought of signing on? ok see what it entails.....<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OFFICER</span><br><br><strong>minimum academic requirements</strong> are Diploma or A levels. a pretty basic pass would get u an interview and if ur a level grades are really good, u can consider the SMS (W) scholarships, ATA (O/L), LSA awards. but if u are not aiming for the above then its pretty much alright.<br><br><strong>health requirement.</strong> its Pes A or B. for air force vocation ur eyesight must not be more then i think 500 degrees. navy and army no such requirement.<br><br><strong>Vocation available.</strong> air force - (Air defence artillery or Weapon system officer). navy (naval offr u choose ur specialisation later). army (everything except commandos, there is even a guards female offr).<br><br><strong>Training</strong> there are 2 intakes a year jan and july BMT intake. training for BMT will take place in SAFTI MI at sierra wing instead of tekong. the BMT lasts for 10 weeks. u will have the same cirriculum as the guys. however it will be an all gal platoon that u will be in. fitness will be build up gradually similar to the guys fitness programme. IPPT stds are different much like the guy and girl NAFA test std difference. SOC will be conducted in clean fatigue and there will be some station u can skip. u need to pass IPPT to pass out from BMT. after that u go on to Tri service term (4weeks) this time the platoon will have some guys. u pretty much do the same thing as the guys (refer to OCS FAQ for more info). after tri service term, the gals will be split up into air force navy or army (of which u already know which service to enter) and then proceeding on to Service term 1, service term 2 and professional term. Navy and airforce cadets will be subject to different length of terms. (refer to OCS FAQ).<br><br><strong>OTHERS[b]</strong><br>Its not for the faint hearted. but we dont expect superwoman type either. it is a varied and interesting career and if u are up for the challenge u will love it. u either love it or hate it. u have a choice in coming to join the SAF. think before u commit. cos u are not going to get away with kenging or that sort of rubbish as u have volunteered to join. u are expected to train as hard as the guys and side by side with them. it includes field camps, route march fast march and so on. u carry the same load, u walk the same distance and do as much as the guys if not more just to keep up. there will be no such thing as ur 'aunty' visiting u to get out of exercise or field camps or marches. hygiene is something personal. u have to prepare ur so called 'extra supplies' of wet tissue and etc should ur 'aunty' choose to visit u during field camps. bear in mind that there are no facilities outfield or any special arrangements made for that time of month. instructors are impartial and will treat u as a guy. punishment includes the whole platoon and u will not be able to get away for the reason of ur being the fairer sex. the only exception is when u are medically excused. u will be under scrutiny wherever u go. in camp in ur formation in ur unit simply because u are a female. there is an expectation that u will be professional in ur job as u chose to be a soldier.<br><br>good luck and try it out if u really want to commit. can post any questions doubts or enquiries here. i will try my best to answer as best as i can.[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok 1st of all. there is nothing to say that u need a certain field of study to get to watever vocation u choose. but however, if there are many applicants  (in light of the economic conditions), they would prefer to choose the ppl with more relavant qualification ie. weapon system more likely they would want engineering or something like that. anyway in WSO if u are in the 'command, control and communication' branch it is significantly desk bound. it may not be as outdoor type as u would like.  u may be stuck in a certain place just doing classified work (communication) and u might not be too happy abt it. for a more outdoor and physically challenging job, air defence artillery would be a much better choice. bear in mind that air force is the most desk bound kinda job among the three services generally. you may want to consider the other 2 services. but seeing u are such an 'enthu' about air force that would be unlikely. your best bet is to go down to the recruitment centre or attend the career fair and make sure they notice u as an eager applicant. online application have a tendency to be backlogged. try a few more times but keep your options open. another option is to try signal officer in the army. if u really cant make up ur mind there is a tri service vocation called intelligence offr. what is it about? i really dont know. that is the whole thrill of it. medical check up is not that tough. as long as u dont have some serious medical condition then its ok. good luck trying.... some of my frens tried for a really long time before getting in.</div>

Someone to tell the fighter pilots where the enemy planes are and also to deconfilct which group of pilots to attack which group of enemys. Someone to tell the ADAs ppl where the enemy plane is coming?<br><br>What does ADA do?<br><br>Well, they are actually the little green men or so call army infanty but working under the name of air force. They cover aerial defence for air base and important installation, such as jurong island, SATCC, etc... They also provide air defence for the 3,6,9 army division. Seldom do u see these guys in blue uniform unless on staff tour.<br><br>What does UAV do?<br><br>Did u been to the Asian Aerospace? Its controlling a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, something like flying a remote controlled plane except that the size of this plane is bigger than the usual r/c plane. Flying a UAV plane requires 4 men to operate, the External Pilot controlled the plane by taking off and landing the plane, the Internal Pilot flies the plane by inputing flight route into the UAV main system. the Payload operator is the cameraman who will use the the camera onboard the UAV to take pictures on the Ground, etc. taking pictures on enemy troops. Lastly, its the WSO(UAV) who will ensures his/her team perform smoothly and deconficlt all neccessary air movenments.<br><br>Its true all female officers have to undergo their bmt and officer training at OCS. You do not have to cut like a tom boy, as long it tied up nicely and neat. But with heat and sweat, having long hair during training isn't a sensible choice<br><br>Hope these will answer yr queries!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the short hair is optional. u can keep long hair on the condition that u bun it up. imagine waking up at 5 every morning. barely enough sleep and stil having to bun ur hair would u want it?? then there is the outfield problem. u sweat like hell, dont get to bathe for a couple of days, would u want long hair??? i think all ur platoon mates will run from u. prob end up with lice in there. u think wearing a helmet under the hot sun running ard is easy with long hair?? think again. short hair is for ur own convenience and cleanliness. its really up to u. anyway after u commission as an offr u can keep longer hair. just whether u can be bothered to bun it up. most of us cant be bothered so we opt for short hair. its easier for everyone. esp ur platoon mates they will surely appreciate it. oh ya and those bathing timing can be really short. dont think u wanna have half washed hair or wet hair when u fall in. long hair takes damn long to dry. u wouldnt like walking ard with wet uniforms either.</div>

For navy, it's sign-on as naval offr first, b4 choosing specialsiation rite. What sort of specialisations are there?<br>Since my major is life sciences, will the navy accept me in the first place (coz it's not a very "technical" subject like engg), and also later when i wanna apply for intell work?<br><br>3. Usu gradn is in jun-aug period. is it a good idea to signon 1 sem b4, i.e. in Dec?<br><br>4. Does the SAF sponsor scholarships for future studies, eg. pursuit of masters degree?<br><br>5.

            <div class='col-md body'>actually w/o scholarship u will be disadvantaged. like the guys, normal degree vs scholar, as scholars the promotion rate is very much higher.<br><br>but i think u will be very much on the same footing as the local study award ppl. but ur promotion rate will be much faster then say a level or poly ppl.<br><br>u will commission as a LTA, within a year u will be a captain, then it takes about 4-6 years to get ur major. for degree holder without any award the norm is 5 or 6 years. good honours will only get u higher pay. other then that there is no marked improvement rate in promotion which is performance based. but if u got a second upper or 1st class then u qualify for the interview for this super high pay scheme - scheme C. its not automatic. must go interview. if successful ur promotion increases and ur pay by more then 500--800 dollar per month.<br><br>check out the navy website cos i not too sure what the navy has.<br><br>i think u should apply intell 1st then choose ur service and vocation. cos intel is a tri-service vocation.<br><br>i think u should sign on quite early if u are sure. cos the process can take quite long. but if u are really sure go ahead.<br><br>there are sponsership for masters, but they are usually quite unattainable. there must be strong recommendation by the boss and good performance. usually quite hard to get. also u go for 1 year local master bond another 4 year. u calculate whether its worth it or not. somehow the sums dont match la.<br><br>yup the pay scheme is the same for all 3 service... no diff i think.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think they do tell u what service u will be going into b4 u enter. not likely that they will switch u around. but ask many questions before u sign the contract. make sure u know who u spoke to and what is promised by them. double check what they promise with someone else. they tend to go back on what they say. check when ur course commence and sometimes if u have to wait, check again with the schools involve like when the course will be conducted. best if u know someone in navy who can assure u about the course start date.<br><br>army xiong. FBO xiong. but after a while u wont feel it. when u 1st carry FBO u feel like dying but later u will be use to it. navy life is xiong in a different way. more intellectual. but do note that u still have to go through BMT and TST. both have FBO exercise to do.<br><br>i am not sure what u mean by intel equipment. i think u are confused with the S2 branch of intelligence. which is the battalion intelligence. thes ppl are not intel offr. they are more like recee and such stuff. most intel offr i know work in air con office, manning their equipement.<br><br>army is not that bad. its a whole lot more fun then navy or airforce. but i think there is slightly more sex discrimination in the army. cos after all physical strength do count a lot.<br><br>i have nvr gone for intel interview so i wouldnt know if it is selective or not. but i can assure u that the only thing that might be a problem is if u fail security test. like if ur dad was some communist, or u have relative or spouse in foreign govt agency or something like that.<br><br>as far as i know there are only tests for pilots. no psychometric test. the joke is that if u can count to ten the army probably will take u.<br><br>WSO pilot criteria is very much like the pilot. most WSO are almost certain never to be a WSO pilot as the criteria is very stringent.<br><br>application procedure check out the website or go down to the recruitment centre yourself. online application seems to be very slow in soliciting a response.<br><br>actually if u are so afraid of it being xiong i advise u to think twice about signing on. unless its clear that u want to go to the air force or navy. but if u are doing it for a stable job and reasonable income then i think u might be in it for the wrong reasons.<br><br>oh ya and this i must add. it is not as glamorous as u think it looks. most of the time its pretty mundane. so u gotta like ur job.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Orh.. im not afraid of xiong-ness. more afraid of the typical deskjob where working hrs are 9-5. tried admin jobs, proj org_ns and, of course, lab research proj. Dont enjoy them, esp. research. So im thinking of working in an envt totally diff from other jobs. Am interested in working in unifomed orgns. I think there is a sense of pride whenever u put on the uniform. I was actually thinking of signing on with army if i kenna reject by navy =p</div>
