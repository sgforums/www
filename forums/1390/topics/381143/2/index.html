              <p>It is often considered the best vocation in the SAF. Until you

              <p>Honestly speaking it depends on camp to camp. Some camps (
              er...hem...Nee Soon ), the lifeguards have a very good life,
              whereas in some other camps, they are worked half to death (
              Toilets cleaning, field cutting, fixing of sports facilities ) and
              have other "privileges", such as double digit guard duty. </p>

              <p>I know, I have to tell you though, some camps got cleaners to do everything, and open only once a day, so if there is no unit training, the lifeguard book in at 8, watch tv/ exercise/ study/ sleep, open pool at around 12, close after 1 ~ one and a half hour, repeat above cycle, book out at 5.</p>

              <p>Thats interesting and that gives more people a reason to blame the clerks for cocking up their vocational posting only to OOC within the 1st week of posting to their new vocation due to medical issues that were already known yet ignored during posting.</p>

              <p>Well, clerks depend on the integrated information system employed by MINDEF. If the medical condtion of the serviceman is not updated in time for the posting or organisational requirement....thats too bad. At the most, OOT again and wait for a new posting.</p>

              <p>The SAF system is never perfect. Even the ES system the logistics use which i'm very familiar with is far from perfection and has too many limitations which cause problems for it users more than help. I can submit a recommendation for improvement to get a reply saying the system was intentionally done this way yet few months later i was told that what i suggested in the past was now a recognised problem and they are working on ways to change it and thats just 1 of the major problems, not all.</p>
              <p>However, what i'm surprise with is that people with clear medical problems that were identified already before enlistment could still be given vocations that were totally not suitable for their medical problems. This should not be a case of condition not being updated in time.</p>
