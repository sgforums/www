              <p>Well, never forget the imperative, "care for soldier"</p>
              <p>It is important that our soldiers know that water parade is part of SAF care and concern and is meant to save lives in more ways than one.</p>
              <p>Having said that, commanders should guard against abusing this system, intentionally or otherwise.</p>
              <p>making soldiers drink excessive amt of water, especially prior to strenous activities, without bothering to find out the risk, is basically toying with the soldiers' LIVES.</p>
              <p>Excessive water consumption prior and during strenous activities may lead to hyponatremia because too much water in the blood steam depletes the sodium content causing the body to go into shock. Fluid can also accumulate in the brain during hyponatremia. Past incidents have shown that it is potentially fatal.</p>
              <p>Another  point to make: Sissies or not, have we ever wonder why some of these people are posting complaints in the forum?</p>
              <p>Could it be because the "care for soldier" imperatives have left the unit a long time ago?</p>
              <p>I guess we could all just tell them to shut the fuck up and do as you are told.</p>
              <p>Wuldn't that be less bothersome...?</p>

              <p>When you see your friend suffer from heat injury next to you while you train or help them recover from it then we'll see whether you're more willing to take that 1L of water before the activity.</p>
              <p>Your body does get used to it after a while. You tend to stay healthier outside camp as well due to the fact that ure used to drinking water regularly.</p>

              <p>Of course, nobody is saying that adequate hydration is not important before a physical activity, especially since the temperature in Pulau Tekong can be hot as hell.</p>
              <p>But my point is, rather than making them drink one full bottle at one go before the physical activity and making them run around with a full bloated stomach, why not make them drink less amount of water more frequently at regular intervals?</p>
              <p>For example, give recruits a two minutes water break every half an hour. They can then drink like one-third full water bottle. Hydration is also ensured this way, and it'll be more comfortable for the recruits, needless to say, safer.</p>
              <p>And I've really seen people puke after drinking one full bottle of water. You can call us complaining sissies or anything, but each and everyone of our body is different. No doubt some guys can down two full bottles easily, but for others, even half full bottle is a challenge.</p>
              <p>But of course, if you are looking for a reason to fall out of that particular activity, go ahead and drink till you puke.</p>

              <p>my ocs mate was "kidnapped and tortured" by enemy (instructors) and made to drink a jerry can full of water, until his platoon came and rescued him. apparently he was enjoying himself, taking his own sweet time to drink because being kidnapped no need to dig foxhole.</p>

              <p>I  have seen...death in the SAF... from all sort of ways, throughout my career, more than you know Lex818. How many death/injury do we need to prove a point? Isn't one already enough?</p>
              <p>I empthatise with you and am sorry about your friend but that is why we directives for water parade and re-hydration plan - is to at least ensure that our soldiers are drinking enough and not too little or too much.</p>
              <p>My soldiers are problem free and none has suffered heat stroke thus far even though our physical activities can be strenuous. My soldiers have never been made to drink excessive amt (1Lt?), but we carry out proper and regular water parade and avocate self hydration in between.</p>

              <p>1 litre. Hey, its one bloody litre. I advocate everyone shut the fuck up when it is one litre. No one is asking for anything more. Unless the size of the SAF standard issue water bottle has grown, this topic is redundent.</p>
              <p>This topic was based on the 1 litre bottle. Try to remember that.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>one thing alot of recruits(ok, not only recruits. but soldiers of enlistee rank) like to do is to purposely drink as little water as possible(ie to the point of quenching thirst, which is freaking little if you know how to drink) so they can fallsick easily and get out of training.<br><br>another one is those IDIOTS that somehow think thirst is a form of endurance training and think the more thirsty they are the more work they are putting in. this are the arsholes that cause PTMC's body cooling unit to be use at least once every month.<br><br>lastly, WTH? 2MIN BREAK EVERY 1/2 HR? ur shitting me right?</p></div>
