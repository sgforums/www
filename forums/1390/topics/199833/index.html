            <div class='col-md body'>I think the one of the hottest news about SAF wastage is how the staff cars allocated to the top ranks are done. Yeah Mindef has given lots of replies regarding its use.<br><br>But what do you guys think? Is it ok for taxpayer's money to be spent on Mercedes or Audi's etc etc etc....<br><br><blockquote>Suggestion  	:  	I had read about Mindef's policy of not allowing Mindef personnel to drive home vehicles which were registerred under MID. However , I notice that some of the army officers are still driving these vehicles from home to office and back to home. I am of the view that these vehicle should remain in the camps or office for staff to use when required and not for use as personal vehicle by specific personnel. The public may form an undesireable opinion that MID is wasting public fund of providing vehicles to their staff.Please enlighten me on Mindef stand of the issue.<br><br>Date of Reply 	: 	17/05/2005<br><br>Reply 	: 	Dear Sir/Madam,<br><br>1. We thank you for your suggestion and appreciate this opportunity to clarify.<br><br>2. Staff cars are used for official duties and ceremonies and only senior SAF officers holding selected appointments are accorded the use of staff cars for official purposes.<br><br>3. However, to optimise the use of staff cars when they are not required for official purposes, SAF officers are allowed to use their allocated cars for private journeys, subject to payment of a monthly fee and purchase of car insurance. They will also be taxed for the benefits derived in using the cars for private journeys in line with IRAS? requirements.<br><br>Ms Jamie Foo<br>Staff Officer (Special Duties)<br>MINDEF HQ<br>Tel : 6768-4916<br>Email : MINDEF_Special_Duties@mindef.gov.sg </blockquote><blockquote>Suggestion  	:  	As part of an already lucrative package of top military personnel, luxury cars soon become the norm ie Mercedes.<br><br>Whilst cars are necessary to transport military officials to state functions and other important events, the public should only fund military cars up to 1600cc. Above this, perhaps the users of the cars ie the top ranks themselves should top up the difference and pay for the additional costs of procuring a luxury car. This saves costs, lessens the image that the military is a haven for top scholars only, and increases accountability of public funds used for a small elite number of people who are already well to do.<br><br>Date of Reply 	: 	03/02/2005<br><br>Reply 	: 	1. We thank you for your suggestion and appreciate this opportunity to clarify.<br><br>2. We would like to clarify that only Service Chiefs and above (i.e. Chief of Defence Force, and the Chiefs of Army, Navy and Air Force) are allocated a Mercedes Benz.<br><br>3. The use of `luxury cars? as staff cars is not the norm. The impression is created because in a tender in 2001, the Audi was chosen because the company, for its own marketing reasons, put in a bid that was cheaper than the bid for a common Japanese model. We agree with you that we need to be cost conscious in the choice of staff cars. That is why we depend on open tenders and we do not specify the level of luxury.<br><br>4. Only officers in selected appointment are entitled to staff cars. It is unreasonable to ask individuals to `top up the difference? for staff cars because the individual would not be entitled to the use of staff cars when they change appointments. However, to optimise the use of staff cars when they are not required for official purposes, SAF officers are allowed to use staff cars for private journeys. They are required to pay a monthly fee and purchase car insurance. They will also be taxed for the benefits derived in using the cars for private journeys.<br><br>Ms Jamie Foo<br>Staff Officer (Special Duties)<br>MINDEF HQ<br>Tel : 6768-4916<br>Email : MINDEF_Special_Duties@mindef.gov.sg </blockquote><blockquote>Suggestion  	:  	Hi,<br>I refer to the following<br>Category : Defence<br><br>Subject : Staff Cars for Senior Commanders<br><br>Suggestion : Many senior commanders in the SAF seem to be driving big luxury continential cars (MID plate), my Div Commander is personnally driving an Audi. Is it really necessary for them to have such expensive vehicles? While i'm not suggesting for them to drive a Proton instead, would not a Japanese-model like a Accord or Cefiro suffice at a lesser cost?<br><br>Date of Reply : 29/01/2004<br><br>Reply : We thank you for your suggestion and appreciate this opportunity to clarify.<br><br>The selection of the cars were made through competitive tender. The Audi was chosen as it had the lowest life-cycle cost (i.e. including maintenance) over its lifespan in that engine size category. Special attention was paid to ensure that the tender conditions did not rule out the common makes like Japanese cars, but the Audi was still the most competitive bid. Please note that the relative prices of tender bids for bulk purchases do not necessarily correspond to the relative prices in the retail market, as companies have different marketing strategies.<br><br>Name: Ms Shirley Tay<br>Title &amp; Designation: Executive Officer (Pride)/PS21 MINDEF<br>Organisation: MINDEF Systems Organisations<br>Telephone number: 6373-1969<br>Email address: tkahtian@starnet.gov.sg<br><br>Name: Ms Jean Gwee<br>Title &amp; Designation: Staff Officer (Special Duties)<br>Organisation: MINDEF HQ<br>Telephone number: 6768-4916<br>Email address: MINDEF_Special_Duties@mindef.gov.sg<br><br>I question the rationale why is staff car provided in the first place? Are there hundred of cars to be maintained and the cost (maintenance, heavier petrol consumption by luxury cars) will be million of dollars every year.<br><br>A co-payment scheme, or mileage claim mechanism will be more equitable. The funds saved can go to useful defense expenditure.<br><br>Date of Reply 	: 	05/03/2004<br><br>Reply 	: 	We thank you for your suggestion and appreciate this opportunity to clarify.<br><br>1. The SAF works on a chain of command. Soldiers, airmen and sailors look up to their commanders for inspiration and direction. SAF commanders need to lead, inspire, direct and discipline their men. Commanders need to move among their troops frequently and they have to be seen and heard by their troops. The commander?s presence must be felt by the troops. This command presence is an important element in a military chain of command. At all times, the SAF also require key commanders to be able to return to camp or to be present at the site of an emergency quickly.<br><br>For these reasons, less than 70 selected officers are given the use of staff cars, depending on rank and appointment. An easily identifiable car helps to communicate the commander?s presence. The presence of the car informs the troops that their commander is now with them even as their carry out their training and operational duties.<br><br>2. You have suggested implementing a co-payment scheme or mileage claim mechanism. For private journeys, the officers are already required to pay a monthly fee to use the cars. In addition, they have to purchase 3rd party insurance and pay tax to IRAS for the car benefits.<br><br>Ms Shirley Tay<br>Executive Officer (Pride)/PS21 MINDEF<br>MINDEF Systems Organisations<br>Tel : 6373-1969<br>Email : tkahtian@starnet.gov.sg<br><br>Ms Jean Gwee<br>Staff Officer (Special Duties)<br>MINDEF HQ<br>Tel : 6768-4916<br>Email : MINDEF_Special_Duties@mindef.gov.sg </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Out of curiousity, i have looked through the logbook of one of the MID ##(insert 2 digits here) staff car used by one of the division commander. Surprisingly, he was quite a down to earth guy and he updated the logbook regularly (or maybe he forced the NSF driver to do so <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> but it was signed under his name.)<br><br>Anyway, some of the details were for travelling to and fro home. But, a large number of details though were for travelling to posh hotels and restaurants in Scotts road (maybe SAF personnel gets discount there <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ) Those were for lunch meetings with :<br>1. SembCorp CEO<br>2. LTA CEO<br>3. NDP organisers<br>4. Mayors/PAPers<br>5. Foreign delegates<br><br>Details are usually from 11am to 3pm  (more or less lunch timing). Seemed to be mostly for work related matters so i don't really see him "abusing" the staff car usage.</div>
