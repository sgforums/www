            <div class='col-md body'>yeah, would rather serve in the army more, like if ur remaining half year will be quite fun cos u know u going to ORD so u try to make more out of the ns life, unlike now 2 years, after ur 3 months and if u go to command sch, left 1 year to do ur stuff and then finish ur liability. not like last time, after 1 yr pass out from command sch, get promoted then can relak abit..<br><br>but the good thing is that if u saved up during ur army can go overseas backpacking or something in the time before further studies. but 9 months abit too much yeah...<br><br>but oh well, everything have their pros and cons, guess some people would prefer 2 years.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After you got into unit life, you may like to approach your personnel dept, S1 and check to see if you can extend your service say another 6 months or so.  You will get a slightly higher pay for that contracted period till it expires and you are free to go.  Coz my unit had this thingie going on as a large batch of people had to ord during their operational period, so short of manpower loh.  Just go and ask if you feel it might suit you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   But most of your army pals would be thinking differently of course. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

(It certainly was during my time.) You can then opt to disrupt early for further IHL studies, upon submission of documentary evidence of enrollment.<br><br>Maximum disruptable period is generally 4 years, or for the duration of the degree/diploma course. No subsequent extension for postgrad courses.<br><br>Actually you can opt to serve out the service balance during your vacation break too, rather than resume only after completion of studies. The only SAF insistence is you must finish the remaining liability in one go, i.e. no "by installments" &amp; no more re-disruption.<br><br>Check with the proper authorities on the timing for both applications (early disruption &amp; service resumption). Usually 1-2 months beforehand, if I'm correct.<br></div>
