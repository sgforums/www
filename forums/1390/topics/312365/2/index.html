              <p>WOs converting to commisioned officers, can't really say is a

              la.. but with their years of experience, will do good to the
              commisioned officers league la... Just that.. Imagine commanding
              such a high salary as a WO, suddenly your pay drop to that of a
              junior commisioned officer, so seldom will have WO who will choose
              that path la..</p>

              <p>No choice in SG about the short training term for officers. It's the parents that are complaining waste of time in NS, plus our young men who do not see the importance of NS.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if I recalled correctly, it'll take 2 years in Officers' School (westpoint) in US to become officers. I think some armies in Europe required the cadets to have serve for at least 3-5 years before being recommended into Officer School, for another 2-3 years.</p>

              <p>Does anybody know of any living example or still in-service example of Officers who were WOs?</p>
              <p>There are so many rumours of Officers who were WOs but yet we dunno who they are.</p>
              <p>The confirmed cases I know are the pre-1992 era (when ranks were PTE &gt; CPL &gt; SGT &gt; SSG &gt; MSG &gt; WO.</p>
              <p>Back then WO ranks and responsibilities were different and SAF gotta implement the  CPL &gt; 3SG &gt; 2SG &gt; 1SG &gt; SSG &gt; MSG &gt; 2WO &gt; 1WO &gt; MWO &gt;SWO.</p>
              <p>The new rank system is more for recognising effort and seniority and easing payscale. During the transitions I guess WO are offered Officer ranks to be better recognised that having to go thru the 2WO &gt; 1WO &gt; MWO &gt; SWO rank structure.</p>
              <p>As of recent cases, rumours of WOs becoming officers are plenty. But upon some investigation, I found out that some cases, the WOs are given Officer Appointments but stil maintain WO ranks. Loosely, MWO &amp; SWO are usually given CPT &amp; MAJ appointments. Such are cases found in training schools, SIW especially where Course Commander is usually a MWO.</p>
              <p>Please do not be confused with SISPEC's (2/1WO = PC, 1/MWO = OC). This system was around since 90s.</p>
              <p>But what i was refering is in cases where they can't find an appropriate Officer to fill a "vacancy" they will use a WO to fill it up.</p>
