            <div class='col-md body'>well. in a relationship, u want to share your probs and achievements. how u expect special force guy to share his feelings and probs? so whatever probs the man has, he would keep it to himself. thus u can expect the guy to be abit cranky at times.<br>so the wife have to be super understanding to his job. she has to understand that he would be gone for missions for days or weeks at a time and he might not be around when she needs him.<br><br>just my 2 cents.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In TV dramas and detective fiction it's always the policeman who has the relationship problems. I don't recall actually watching any show or reading anything in which the soldier has such issues. In fact if the hero is the soldier he always gets the girl in the end, while if he's a detective he always loses her.

OUCH!</div></blockquote>Damn, Hellraiza-- I guess the old adage still applies: trust no one and assume nothing.  I've always wondered what it is about women and Army guys which turns them off.  It's like that in the U.S. too-- my hypothesis would be that perhaps men in the Army aren't in as "prestigious" jobs/roles as Navy or Airforce.  In the military's pecking order, I think Army would be considered the bottom of the totem pole, and Airforce would be at the top. Maybe the glory of flying planes is more appealing to the fairer sex.<br><br>The way I look at it, if a woman chooses to be with a military man, regardless of branch, but especially in Special Forces, then she should know the relationship which she will be getting involved in.  Don't complain when your man is called for a month long mission. But, having your girl cheat behind your back while smiling in your face is another ball game altogether.  That was a viscious thing to do, considering that you're putting your life on the line to protect the country and her as well.<br><br>Of the three branches (in the U.S. there's actually four military branches, because the Coast Guard is considered a military unit), personally for me (and yes, call me weird, but boot camp will do that to you), I have always liked the Army boys.  Special Ops men seem to have a "bad boy" attitude to them, which to me, is very attractive  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Hooyah!<br><br></div>
