            <div class='col-md body'>Which Golf OC you guys talking about? I was from 33rd BSLC @ Golf (just concluded). The new OC has been at this coy only for two batches so far. He was previously Foxtrot 2IC. What I can say about the CWO is that he is one hell of a nice guy... mostly. Very easy going and friendly; got sense of humour also. But when you catch him at the wrong time... hooo boy.<br><br>2IC Golf is who I respect the most in Golf. Really embodies the ideal of a "people's leader." He is the kind who takes leading by example to new heights. Shows genuine concern for his men almost to the extent of being a fatherly figure. At the same time very approachable and able to bring himself down to the level of his men so that they feel comfortable with him. You know, that kind lar! Really good guy. He used to be SSM of BMTC2.</div>

We were sure we were gonna suffer jia lat jia lat under him for the next three months. He had this damn fierce/strict look and he even threatened to confine one trainee on our first book out day just because he didn't answer together with the rest of the company when he was talking to us. So you can imagine the first impression we had of him.<br><br>But soon the weeks went by and I started to get to know him better. Espcially being an OOC, you're privy to alot more of the relaxed side of the instructors and warrants when they're not with the trainees. Really saw a drastically different side of my 2IC. Extremely big-hearted and genuinely concerned about trainees well-being. Damn hilarious guy also (always likes to call people the Tamil word for b*lls). He just has this aura that makes him very likable and approachable. Not to mentioned respected. Very, very respected by all the instructors and trainees. Very capable and meticulous planner and leader as well. And he's humble too. Really a leader's leader sort of guy. Man, am I fawning over the guy or what!? But seriously, you gotta know the man a little better to reach this conclusion about him. Cos' like I said, my first impression of the guy was that he was a tekan king. In retrospect though, I think it's kinda like SOP that the first couple of weeks, the warrants and instructors will be extra siong so as to keep the trainees on their toes and in the proper frame of mind to go through the though training (especially after block leave!).<br><br>Sorry for the longish un-paragraphed post. As you probably can tell, it's really one long gushing testimonial for a guy I really admire. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BTW, SingaporeTyranosaurus, which coy were you doing BSLC in?<br><br>For the most part, comparing tales of harrowing experiences from my friends from other coys, I think Golf has it easy. The top brass are generally fair to trainees. Did you read my long, gushing testimonial about your 2IC by any chance? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> The only people to look out for, in my opinion are PC3 and PC4. One is siao-on si-beh-garang kind and the other is don't care about trainees' welfare type (quite rude also). I'll let you guess which is which.<br><br>If you're in PL1, hopefully you get the female instructors; they're very nice. In fact, most of the instructors are pretty cool, save a few whom I suspect have already become notoriously prominent to you guys. But like I always say, everyone has a nice guy side and an a**hole side; the difference is how intense the a**hole side is when it rears its ugly behind.<br><br>Overall, I enjoyed my Golfing days as an OOC. Got posted out three weeks ago. Never thought it'd be possible to miss Tekong, but hell, I do! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> Thanks to the people I came to know at SISPEC Golf.</div>
