My boss who is a MAJ recommended me for CFC &amp; final decision lies with Unit CO (of course HD HR will filter out unsuitable names from the lists submitted from respective sub-units from the same unit) before you can be promoted. Not about sucking up to clerks or your boss but rather to maintain a cordial relationship with everyone &amp; show your boss that you can work lor.

              <p><br>y dun u check with the unit clerk in ur present unit?<br><br>IIRC... the enlistee promotion directive got state something like, "for lcp promotion, at least satisfy 2 criterias:<br>1) minimum 7 months from DOE,<br>2) satisfactory conduct in vocation performance and work."<br><br>for the most direct n updated answer, u better check with ur present s1 br... as different extra standard may be imposed for cpl promotion e.g.: in the directive, as long as minimum u pass ippt can liao, but some units purposedly want at least a silver standard then will submit ur name for promotion approval...</p>

              system. Give him ur nric no/full name to check, then
              he simply send an email to your immediate officer to give
              the go ahead = an in-principle approval via email 1st,
