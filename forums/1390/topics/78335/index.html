            <div class='col-md body'><strong>How is the IO vocation managed?</strong><br>The IO vocation comes directly under the privy of the Joint Intelligence Directorate (JID). As such, the career of all IOs will be manged directly by JID and Joint Manpower Personnel Department (JMPD).<br><br><strong>What kind of career can I expect as an IO?</strong><br>The IO scheme offers a challenging and rewarding military career in SAF Intelligence at the highest level. You will be trained and systematically groomed along a specialised route of advancement in the field of intelligence. At the heart of this route of advancement is a conviction to develop each IO to his/her fullest career potential.<br><br><strong>What is the rate of promotion?</strong><br>Promotion is based on performance and potential. The better you perform and the higher your potential, the faster you move up the ranks.<br><br><strong>Are the IO salary, welfare benefits and performance bonus different from other vocations?</strong><br>No. The IO vocation enjoys the same salary (see Salary Scale), welfare benefits (see Welfare and Benefits) and rate of promotion (see Career Advancement) as other combat vocations in the SAF.<br><br><strong>What if I am intending to further my studies?</strong><br>We encourage our Officers to complete their higher education as soon as possible. Officers who have secured scholarships such as LSA will be allowed to defer from service to further their studies upon commissioning or when the course's semester begins whichever is earlier.<br><br><strong>Am I constrained to any particular courses when I attend higher studies?</strong><br>No. Applicants are welcomed to pursue all disciplines approved by the SAF. But here in the Intelligence Corps, applicants are also advised to take up job relevant courses.<br><br><strong>Do I have to work for the SAF during my vacations while I am studying?</strong><br>Yes. Depending on the need for manpower, arrangements will be made for you to be attached within the SAF while you are on studies vacation. This is to keep you updated with the latest developments in the SAF. You will be paid while on studies vacation.<br><br>Source:<br><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/io/home.asp" rel="nofollow">SAF Intelligence Corps</a></div>

Another consideration for me if I decided to sign on. Sianz however have to survive BMT first and successful go to OCS first...Just heard from somewhere that the intake for OCS for Poly batch is much lower...Don know if thie is true or not.</div>
