              <p>wat u have described is ideal.</p>
              <p>however, the reality is often not as sweet. and again, much of it is due to complacency (if we dont bring in other factors like attitude or simply lack of interest).  u can have RPs who are really not interested in what u flash at them - be it credit cards or some other camp's pass.</p>
              <p>the other problem is in the variety of passes we have.  yes a vigilant RP will stop someone with an unfamiliar pass. but when that someone bears rank, chances are this may not happen.</p>
              <p>then there is the problem with outdated photos on the pass.  of cos, if the photos are visible or still complete in the first place.</p>

              <p>well.. loss of pass is serious la i would say.. the subjectivity in this case would not apply to the loss of pass, but to how many punishment your superior wanna give.. its the extra effort you put in to prevent the various types of conditions that you will lose your pass, but there are some environmental factors that we cant avoid and hence lose the pass. That, we call it <em>suay</em>..</p>

              <p><br>loss of pass should be punished but in TS case, 7 extras is absurd. sleeping during guard duty? all the guards take turns to do their duty. when they finish duty they have the right to sleep, rest or watch tv. unless it is sleeping when you are on duty. thats a different case.</p>

              <p>totally agreed. There is a reason for camp pass being a control item. Perhaps it is really easy to replace the pass physically, but what-if something happens, especially in this terriorist age context. Compare losing our passports, and have it falling into wrong hands. <em>Just replace only ma, right?</em></p>
