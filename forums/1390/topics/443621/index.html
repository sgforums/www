              <p>Hi Readers,</p>
              <p>Just to share some post that I came across from come private forum, please read and enjoy!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>From XXX Lim,</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">As I have ORD couple of years back and went into the society to work and earn for a leaving, I started to observe the growth of Singapore, regardless in financial, government, and cost of living and many other things and including growth of foreigners. Singapore is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">'fine'</span> country, so everything you do wrong, there will be fines.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What I have seen so far is, why do we need to serve the ARMY? to protect foreigners - the foreign talents? Do you look at the guys in ARMY, are they more willing to serve?</span></strong> Now, this is the problems I looking at! Many people may not be seeing these problems right now, but in the future, you will definitely sees it.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I agree that Singapore encourage in inviting 'foreign talents', as they will bring in growth into the country's economy (which Singapore is getting taxes from the organization, e.g. the 2 Integrated Resorts, or Keppel), it does help most of the Singaporean but not all; to get a jobs(most probably the lowest paid).</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">But, what is happening in the organization or the company? Does the government know?</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><strong>NO! They don’t know, because they are not involved!</strong></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Let’s get into the picture now!! We, Singaporean, get the lousiest and the lowest position in the company. Let me take an example, 1 of the Integrated Resort. It is true that they had created a lot of jobs opportunity and brought income to Singaporean, but most of us are in the lowest position! As we don’t mind if we are new to the industries (e.g. the casino). I agree that as beginners, we have to starts from scratch and starts picking up experiences. Singaporean starts being a Dealer from the beginning, but the supervisors, managers, directors, and the senior managements are from Malaysia, Philippines, China and many other countries. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">!!!!! What I hated the most here is Singapore Government doesn’t really control in giving them <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore PR</span></strong>. Most of the managers and above have already gotten their PRs, and what does this means? They will not leave for the time being (so when will they leave????) <strong>And the problem is here</strong>, since they don’t leave, many Singaporean are unable to get any job advancement as the foreigners will be in there for long time. Even if there are promotions or pay increment, does Singaporean get the priority? No, it’s still their foreigners. It’s because the company will increase their basic salary in order to hit the minimum income for them to get <strong>S-Pass or E-Pass</strong>, so that the following years, their foreigner's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">levy</span> that the company will be paying will be lesser!!</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">We, Singaporean will get the most little pay for many years and do you think that is enough to live in Singapore? The cost of living and the expenses here is too high. That is why so many Singaporeans choose to be QUITTERS and they choose to migrate. They will not treasure Singapore if the country does not treasure them!! </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">And what about the SPRs(e.g. Malaysian), they are drawing that high income, and they are spending in their own country! Do you think that is fair for us? Everything is so expensive in Singapore compare to their country. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">That’s not the way in inviting foreign talents if Singapore is forcing your own Citizen to leave!!</span></strong></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">This is where I like the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Worker's Party</strong></span>, I will vote for them whenever I can, it is because they understand how we feel and they really stand in our shoes to think. As we Singaporean are not in favor in Singapore, why do we still need to put in our times and efforts and serve ARMY? Why do we need to attend reservists, remedial training or any other stuff? And why is Singapore government giving us that much <strong>fines and charges</strong> if we don’t do those things? Why don’t they invite the foreign talent to serve the army for them? Why don’t they invites foreign talent to be in the selection of president/or selections of the MPs? And why only <strong>Singaporeans</strong> are the ones that are spending their <strong>precious time</strong> in serving the army which does not fully benefit to us in the future?</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Hey Guys, We are serving the Army not to protect for your families, relatives or local friends, but is to protect foreigners NOW!! Government always thinks that they are the one who help the most in their economy and growth of their country!! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Think about your future everyone, do you want to work in any place in Singapore and feels like you are in foreign country; because your bosses and superior mostly are foreigners.</span> Do you all have any integrity? Singapore population is almost 5 million but how much foreigners are there? 1.5million or even 2 million? and does this include PRs? </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">What can the Government do make us feels at home or make a better living for us? The answer is <strong>Nothing</strong>!! They won’t be involve as these doesn’t matters to them, they are drawing that <strong>high pay</strong>, staying in that <strong>expensive apartment or private property</strong>, driving very <strong>good cars</strong> and mostly importantly, they are having <strong>financial freedom</strong>!</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">These are the factors that they are forcing Singaporean to leave or migrate!! I do agrees that we are having a very nice environment, good security, but not a very good living standard or I should say, no secured-future!! Don’t you sees that what happen to most of the old people in Singapore? They live in old folks home, work in MacDonald, cleaning dishes in Kopitiam and much miserable life. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">One more things, for e.g., I have many Malaysia managers (ages from 25-35yrs old, THEY are earning such a high pay, so government for sure will give THEM the PR status. THEY doesn’t have any high education standard and just because THEY have experience and a very good ‘POR-fissional', knows how lick the balls of their superiors. And what happens here? They are able to buy a Condo here within 2 yrs. and had secured their careers, they are already enjoying their life here! In the future, they will be recommending their <strong>own people</strong> from their own country for the <strong>promotions or any pay rise</strong>!! </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">For Singaporeans, we will not only suffer, but are <strong>suffering in silence</strong>(as no local senior management, even have, they can’t do anything), and the only things we can do are to endure and carry on, as we need money for living. Many people may not be feeling this now, as you are secured with you jobs, or your families are in a good situation now. But please, you are just the minority, what about you children? your friends and all the other local citizens?</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">As for now, I hope the government can step in and help us, please <strong>stop giving so much PRs, S-pass or E-pass</strong>, categories them carefully and survey them properly before issuing, it doesn’t mean that they are really that <strong>skillful as you think</strong>, don’t let Singapore seems to be like a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">prostitute</span></strong>, people coming in and gain benefits for themselves, left the country and enjoy the rest of their lives back in their country. In the end, who suffer? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Is your citizen who is suffering!!</span> If this thing is clear to everyone or it had hit anyone's heart, no guys will want to protect Singapore anymore!!</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Singaporean got same paid compared to foreigners, but we are spending in Singapore, and they are spending in their country. E.g., We spend SGD$3 in Singapore, they are spending CYN 3 in china also.. Compare our income to them, SGD$2000 equal to CNY</span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: å®‹ä½“;      ">ï¿¥</span><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">10000. We bought a HDB here for SGD$300,000 , they bought a <strong>CONDO</strong> in china for CNY</span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: å®‹ä½“;      ">ï¿¥</span><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">300,000. Do you sees the different? We citizen is staying here forever, but they are not!! We will be having that miserable live when we are old, but they are enjoying back in their country!!</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So, if Singapore, this <strong>land is to share to foreigners</strong>, don’t you think they have to do their part to protect? Don’t think that they give more taxes so that we have to protect for them. If money can settle these problems, I would rather use this method to settle, and I think Singapore man will do this too!! Please, treat Singapore man as human, no a dog to guard your country. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Stop all the fines in army!!! Stop giving too much foreigners a better living than us!!! <strong>Make foreigners to serve army</strong> as to let us have more time freedom!!! <strong>Don’t taxes</strong> Singaporean too much!! <strong>Make our expenses lower and increases foreigners expense</strong>!!! And PLEASE gives us back our <strong>INTEGRITY</strong>!!</span></span></p>
