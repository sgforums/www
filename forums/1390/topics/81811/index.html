I heard they love to torture recruits by making you go through the whole thing and inform you that you OOC right before you POP.<br>3)What will i do if i OOC? I missed so much lessons, whats going to happen if i get posted to infantry/artillery etc.<br>4)Generally when will i go back for recourse? I know confirm need to go back unless you guys can suggest ways i can avoid recourse heheh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I really hope all my questions can be answered (if possible) because i feel really lost right now. Life seems so bleak, i cant even POP and fuck off Tekong which is everyone's wish (nearing POP date by only 3 weeks some more) The unknown leads to fear <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>I am not sure as to ur queries.... but i sure as hell luv ur signature<br><br>whahahhaha<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
