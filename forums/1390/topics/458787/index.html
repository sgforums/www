              <p>I walked away from a warrant officer who was making false accusations and was threatening to charge me. I then felt a sharp blow at the back of my knee. I was confused and distressed but left it just like that and moved on.</p>
              <p>The next day, that warrant officer was speaking to my warrant officer, saw me and then sarcastically remarked in front of my encik whether I enjoyed the kick he gave me and even mentioned that the boots he was wearing today has a larger sole and thus can deliver a heavier blow. </p>
              <p>After he left with a smirk, I brought up how I was kicked and asked my encik whether he can vouch for me after hearing that warrant officer boast about kicking me. But my encik claimed he never heard anything about it even when he was just seated next to where the warrant officer stood just a while ago. I believe that maybe he was too engrossed to his OA computer. My encik did tell me not to make that warrant officer angry as he has high blood pressure.</p>
              <p>I noticed a patch of blue-black behind my knee while showering and went to the Medical Officer the following day who documented the 9cm bruise. I told the incident to the Medical Officer, he did not really believe me and think that I'm making excuses after getting it from playing soccer.</p>
              <p>So i asked for all of your opinions, as just a LCP, and based on lack of evidence, can i only just suck thumb as it is just a small issue?</p>

              <p>one sided stoey. but if the encik really did that then you should consider yor own status first before reporting to SIB. youknow in the army is just like any other private employment - many politics. difference is you can easily resign pull out in the private sector - army no. you in the unit? stuck with this unit? how long to ORD?</p>
              <p>when ORD confirm will cum back this unit for ICT? although manpower get transfer in army bu i see lots of commissioned and specialist does so. warrant officers sometimes is die die in the smae unit 1.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>consider far before reporting to SIB or MP. becasue this means blowing matters up and if you do not succeed, you will have a hell lot of bad time with him later.</p>
              <p>don;t alert him first, another optiuon is to secretly settle outside, since police also cannot help. you get what i mean? in the army he may hold a rank and have control over you, but once he step out of the army camp, he is as good and soft as a sheep. you egt what i mean? what did the army teach you about defence and the offensive?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a soldier have to serve the nation, and protect himself and the country from his fellow countrymen against all enemies, foreign and domestic. he can do this to you, he can also do this to any other good soldier.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Military Justice System in the
                                          SAF</span></span></strong><br> <br> 1. Overview<br> The military justice system in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is
                                          expected to treat every service personnel fairly and equally,
                                          regardless of race, rank or vocation.</p>
              <p> <br> 2. Multi-levelled Approach</p>
              <p>The military justice system is based on the SAF Act, which was
                                          implemented in 1972. All servicemen are subjected to the SAF Act,
                                          SAF Regulations, and orders of whatever form issued pursuant to
                                          them.</p>
              <p>While discipline is paramount in the military, not all offences
                                          committed by SAF servicemen are dealt with by formal investigations
                                          and charges. Essentially, offenders can be dealt with either by way
                                          of informal or formal punishment systems.</p>
              <p> <br> 3. Informal Punishment System<br> Commanders are empowered to mete out informal punishments like
                                          push-ups and weekend confinement to servicemen who have committed
                                          disciplinary breaches, like being late, sluggish, or improperly
                                          dressed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Formal Punishment System<br> If the offence that a serviceman committed is of a more serious
                                          nature, he may be formally dealt with by his disciplinary officer
                                          by way of a summary trial, or brought before a subordinate military
                                          court (more commonly known as the General Court Martial or
                                          GCM).</p>
              <p>(a) Summary Trial</p>
              <p>The offences that can be dealt with by summary trial are
                                          essentially military offences, such as absence without leave
                                          (AWOL), non-compliance with lawful orders or insubordination.</p>
              <p>Depending on the rank of the serviceman in question, and the
                                          type of the disciplinary body hearing the case, the possible
                                          sentences that may be imposed can vary, and these can include fines
                                          or detention.</p>
              <p>The summary trial is carried out in accordance with relevant SAF
                                          regulations, and the records of the summary trial are sent to the
                                          office of the Director, Legal Services of the SAF.</p>
              <p>(b) General Court Martial</p>
              <p>The General Court Martial exists as a separate forum from that
                                          of the summary trial. Unlike the summary trial, the GCM can deal
                                          with a wider range of offences, and can impose a wider range of
                                          punishments including imprisonment and discharge, on top of
                                          sentences like detention and fines. The GCM is also a more public
                                          and open forum, and its proceedings are conducted using similar
                                          legal rules and procedures as those used in a civil criminal
                                          court.</p>
              <p>Generally, only serious offences investigated by the Military
                                          Police Command, and which are referred to the office of the
                                          Director of Legal Services, will result in the accused serviceman
                                          being charged in a GCM. In such a case, a military prosecutor will
                                          draw up a formal charge sheet and present it before the GCM.</p>
              <p>General Courts Martial can be further sub-divided into two
                                          categories, namely the Panel Courts Martial - consisting of a
                                          President and usually two other members, and Judge Courts Martial -
                                          consisting of a single President only.</p>
              <p>Currently, the practice is for military offences to be heard by
                                          Panel Courts Martial, while civil offences like misuse of drugs and
                                          penal code offences may be dealt with by a Judge Court Martial.</p>
              <p><br> The current policy is also for an NSman, who is or was a District
                                          Judge in the Subordinate Courts, to preside in a GCM. There are
                                          currently 10 NSmen who have been appointed by the Armed Forces
                                          Council to perform duty as President of a court martial. They are
                                          rostered by the Registrar of the Subordinate Military Court to hear
                                          cases during their in-camp training. In the case of a Panel Court
                                          Martial, the other two members are rostered from among some 155
                                          military officers appointed by the Chief of Defence Force.</p>
              <p> <br> 5. Ways to Seek Redress</p>
              <p>There are numerous safeguards and avenues set out in the
                                          military justice system for an SAF serviceman to seek redress if he
                                          is unhappy about the punishment imposed on him.</p>
              <p>Generally, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with an informal
                                          punishment meted out to him may request a higher level commander to
                                          review the punishment, or request for formal disciplinary
                                          dealing.</p>
              <p>In the case of a summary trial, a serviceman brought before the
                                          disciplinary officer may elect instead to be tried by a court
                                          martial. Alternatively, an aggrieved serviceman may request that
                                          his conviction or punishment imposed at the summary trial be
                                          reviewed by MINDEF's Director Manpower (a delegated authority of
                                          the Armed Forces Council).</p>
              <p>In the case of a GCM, a serviceman may choose to be represented
                                          by a lawyer or an SAF defending officer if his case will be heard
                                          by a court martial. The SAF has about 200 trained defending
                                          officers. While an SAF defending officer comes free to the
                                          serviceman, he has to bear the cost of engaging a lawyer. At the
                                          end of the trial, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with the
                                          decision of the court martial may petition the Reviewing Authority
                                          (the AFC or a committee of its members) for a review of his case.
                                          The serviceman can also appeal to the Military Court of Appeal
                                          (MCA) for a reconsideration of his conviction, or his sentence, or
                                          both.</p>
              <p>The MCA, when convened to hear an appeal, sits as a panel of
                                          five members. Heading the MCA is a President, who is appointed by
                                          the Chief Justice. By law, he must be a person qualified to be a
                                          Judge of the Supreme Court. The current President of the MCA is
                                          Justice Choo Han Teck. Four other members - two civilian members
                                          who are qualified legal practitioners with at least five years
                                          experience each, and two senior military officers - make up the
                                          rest of the MCA. The MCA is the highest court in the military
                                          justice system.</p>
              <p> <br> 6. Impartial Hearings<br> It is important to recognise that the GCM and the MCA are tribunals
                                          headed by presidents who are outside the SAF chain of command.</p>
              <p>Being an "outsider", the president of these forums will hear the
                                          case impartially like any other civil criminal case. The
                                          proceedings in the GCM and the MCA are also heard in a public
                                          forum, and these military courts adopt many of the same legal
                                          procedures and safeguards as that used in the civil criminal
                                          courts. All servicemen formally charged with an offence can bring
                                          their case to these forums.</p>

              <p>think the warrant officer is in the wrong.since no one in camp wants to get involved because they are merely collecting their monthly pay,i suggest u get help from SIB to remove these people who are not professionals but mere street hawkers in a stylo uniform.they domnt deserve anything as none of them want to get involved or use correct procdures which is unbecoming of any officer in the SAF.</p>
              <p>u might suffer for rest of camp,while they get demoted.i would say get SIB or collect witnesses and tape evidence so u can sue the skin off their ass when u ord.</p>

              <p>think you should ask your officer in charge instead of SIB.</p>
              <p>why?because therev would be less complications.officer in charge usually a lta or captain knows what is ok or not.just describe it on a paper what really happened .and why u were accused of by warrant dude.remeber to show proof as verbal is no good and the marks on leg will not do.unless there were witnesses to show.... u have no case.</p>
              <p>you marks on leg could be self inflicted as no proof was seen unless u were beaten until hospitalised.since no one believes u,it is importnt u get tape record of conversations to prove u were bullied and beaten.just check if a $25 mini tape recorder is allowed into camp.had u gitten a tape that had the warrant officer saying he had bigger boots to beat u up and the encik who told you to clam up n move on.i believe these 2 fellas would havve lost their jobs ina few years or even the next day even.</p>
              <p>just get the tape to protect yourself.</p>
