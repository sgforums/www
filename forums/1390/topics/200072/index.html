            <div class='col-md body'>Anyone has stories or memories to share??<br><br>I start off first. It was our COC Parade for my DivComd. I was given a TOP to delegate the parking and sitting arrangements for the visiting guests.<br><br>Anyway, there was this LTC who got out of his car and started to make noise to the ushers. I went up to him and asked whats wrong. Wah he shouted at me why his parking space so far. And he wants to park nearer to the Parade Square. I told him cannot as those are reserved. He kpkb so much.<br><br>Hey, who know who I am? I am bla bla bla, he said. I said, Sir, there are over 20 over Col's and Generals coming to grace this event. Not to mention guests from the various ministries as well. I am sorry, base on the TOP, your rank is nowhere near them. I said this nicely of cos. He turned and walked away.<br><br>Then as he climbed the stairs, he slipped from a step and felled.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  I was trying my very best trying not to laugh. Hahaha. In my mind, I was like serve you right for scolding me. But when I helped him up, he turned to me, reached out his hand and apologized to me over what happen earlier on. I was immediately touched.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Maybe the fall brought him back to his senses.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
