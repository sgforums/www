              i will try to answer all your questions
              1) you will be seen as a Botak recruit doing the same thing day to day as the rest of the Botak guys during your BMT
              2) this is not SIA and you won't get to wear a Kebaya,if you are not excused from wearing a uniform then you are stucked in a men's uniform
              3) there is no such thing as a female or normal unit but you will be posted somewhere suitable after your BMT
              4) there should be an interview before you get enlisted and you can tell the army doctor your problem
              5) you will be checked as guy and why is that? Because you are guy!
              6) Please don't fuck around in the SAF it's not your father's army and so if you and your Merry friends do get caught playing a game of ' Bangla twister ' in camp you could end up serving the army longer than the rest of your heterosexual buddies
