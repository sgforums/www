I personally choose air force or army. For Navy, dun choose vocations that u will end up sailing then u can kiss ur part-time study goodbye.<br><br>Realistically, if u want to apply what u have learned academically then SAF is definately not a place for you because most vocations dun really need to apply what u study in poly or unit.<br><br>Furthermore, during my NS time, Officers and Specs alike need more people skill compare to tech skills because u are most likely need to lead and manage a grp of ppl when u progress in SAF.<br><br>So u must know where ur skills and personality is before choosing SAF as an career option.<br><br>There is nothing wrong in choosing a military career but is the best job fit for u  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  Personally seen friends and people regret sign-on because they found out later that they are not really military people.<br><br>And lastly, job in SAF is not like ur outside job where u dun like liao or kena scold by the boss, can march into his office and shout "I F**KING QUIT"<br>NO SUCH THING IN SAF, if u want to quit, u must break the bond (that u sign-on), when breaking bond, there are penalties u must pay. So now u know why ppl regret liao still lan lan stay on and serve the rest of the bond.<br><br>So be wise, if u do want to sign-on, do it after ur BMT, get a taste of the army life, if u fit then go ahead, if not, just serve the 2 years.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if u really want to sign on, u must first ask yourself? do u understand what is it that u are singing up for? u haven't even enlisted how will u know how army life is like? whether or nor it will suit u?<br><br>my advice, go through BMT first. experience it first before making decisions. it's never too late. good luck.</div>
