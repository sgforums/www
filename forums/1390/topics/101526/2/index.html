Heard a similar situation abt the American built PVS NFEs.The Pentagon were rather touchy on other nations being able to purchase the latest GEN 3 equipment ( not too sure abt that validity though, read from Economist magazine, 2 yrs back, coupled by the fact some internet shops are claiming to sell the PVS system.
