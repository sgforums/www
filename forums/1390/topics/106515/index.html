Sometime even Company line policy also different (A coy personnels can stay out, B coy cannot, etc).<br><br>It also changes with change of CO or even RSM. I quote my experience, during my NSF days, there was a RSM change, "Xin Guan Shang Ren, 3 ba huo" the new RSM grounded all nights out and review all stayout personnel status.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Trust me, after sometime you will not want to stay out already, too troublesome, wake up eariler, rush to take public transport, rush to camp.

I can't figure out why so hard-up about staying out, unless your home is nearby &amp;/or you've got familial obligations.

            <div class='col-md body'>$1,200 a month isn't luxurious but should nevertheless be enough for familial expenses. I take it that the poster, with his prior part-time job status, didn't appear to be a significant income contributor either (though every penny set aside helped).<br><br>IMO It's best that he seriously evaluates his own money management. Even if it's legal, getting a part-time job can only be on an informal basis - like tuition - since most civilian employers would shy away from hiring military conscripts. There's also the travel expenses of regular booking in &amp; out to consider, unless he stays near his camp.<br><br>If he wants to continue contributing to the familial funds, there's the SAF Financial Assistance Scheme to consider:<br><br><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/dmg/des/psc/faq/financial_assist/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mindef.gov.sg/dmg/des/psc/faq/financial_assist/</a><br><br>The SCDF version, under the "Financial Assistance Scheme" sub-heading:<br><br><a href="http://www.scdf.gov.sg/html/info/inf02_nsf.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.scdf.gov.sg/html/info/inf02_nsf.html</a><br><br>I don't understand why application could be a hassle, like he insinuated.
