              proposed levying an additional income and property tax on Permanent 
              Residents (PRs) and foreigners living in Singapore.<br> <br>In a 
              Facebook posting on Wednesday, Mr Hri Kumar said the objective of the 
              National Defence Duty is to create sharper distinctions between 
              Singaporeans and others who live or do business here.<br><br>He noted that PRs and foreigners cannot contribute manpower to the Singapore Armed Forces and Home Team.<br><br>Thus,
               they should make a financial contribution for the protection and 
              preservation of their lives, families, jobs, investments and properties.<br><br>Mr Hri Kumar added that those who have sons who are liable for National Service (NS) will be exempted. <br><br>However,
               those who send their sons away before enlistment will have to pay 
              back-taxes and penalties, over and above the bond which is forfeited. <br><br>This would be the same for those who give up their PR status. <br><br>Mr
               Hri Kumar further proposed that the revenue earned be placed in a 
              National Service Trust to directly benefit National Servicemen.<br><br>The trust fund can be used to supplement the allowance of full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) from poor families. <br><br>In
               addition, it could be used to compensate NS men who have been injured 
              in the line of duty. It could even provide an income for a period of 
              time to families of NS men who have been killed. <br><br>Mr Hri Kumar believes the proposal will not cause PRs and foreigners to flee from Singapore.<br><br>He
               said that even with the tax increase for foreigners, it will still be 
              among the lowest of developed countries, and Singapore will still be one
               of the more attractive places to live and work in.</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span class="userContent">Time For A National Defence Duty<br> <br> In 
              my speech in the White Paper debate, I said that one of the things we 
              need to do going forward is to create sharper distinctions between 
              Singaporeans and others who live or do business here.   I had not 
              mentioned any specific proposals as I did not want them lost in the 
              wider debate.   I offer one now.<br> <br> The National Defence Duty<br> <br> I propose levying a National De<span class="text_exposed_show">fence
               Duty on PRs and foreigners living in Singapore.   I should make clear 
              that it is not my intention to add to any xenophobic hysteria.    As I 
              will explain, my proposal addresses a current imbalance.<br> <br> We 
              know the sacrifice all Singaporean males make, spending two years of 
              their lives doing National Service, and doing reservist training for 
              several years after that.  It is a sacrifice not just of blood, sweat 
              and tears.   There is also a significant economic cost we pay - two 
              years of our lives, at the time when we are about the join the 
              work-force or enter university; perpetually two years behind our female 
              peers in terms of pay, experience and job opportunities; two years 
              behind in the property ladder and therefore having to pay higher prices;
               less attractive to employers because of reservist commitments.  This 
              has more pronounced disadvantages for poorer families.  At the time when
               their sons reach a working age and ready to contribute to the families'
               finances, they spend two years earning a modest allowance.  They cannot
               even work part-time to supplement the family income.<br> <br> I believe
               the majority of us accept this as something we must do for the good of 
              Singapore.     And having a strong  armed forces, with a significant 
              reserve force, has no doubt contributed to the security and growth of 
              Singapore.   The same is true of having strong police and civil defence 
              forces.<br> <br> The thing is everyone living in Singapore benefits from
               this sacrifice - including PRs and foreigners.  We cannot expect equal 
              treatment as it is unrealistic and unworkable to have foreigners do 
              National Service.   And while we can impose National Service obligations
               on PRs, there is practically little we can do if they leave Singapore 
              before enlistment, never to return.<br> <br> My proposal is therefore a 
              simple one.   All PRs and foreigners must pay additional income and 
              property tax to be called a National Defence Duty.   In short, we do 
              duty, they pay a duty.<br> <br> The rationale  is simple - since PRs and
               foreigners cannot contribute manpower to our SAF and Home Team,   they 
              make a financial contribution to the protection and preservation of 
              their lives,  families, jobs, investments and properties.<br> <br> Those
               who have sons who are liable for NS will be exempted.   Those who send 
              their sons away before enlistment will have to pay back- taxes and 
              penalties, over and above the bond which is forfeited.   Likewise, those
               who give up their PR status.   This should take care of what I think is
               a current anomaly.   When  PR parents send their sons away before 
              enlistment, it is the son who is penalized in terms of not being able to
               return.   I think this is too small a price to pay.   More importantly,
                the decision would have been made by the parents.   They should pay a 
              cost for that decision.  Paying back-taxes and penalties is a fair 
              solution.  The PR parents may of course decide to leave Singapore for 
              good without paying.  But such a move would be a real cost to them as 
              well as that would mean ending their careers or businesses here.   They 
              are not likely to take that decision lightly.<br> <br> The National Service Trust<br> <br> However, the revenue earned should not simply go the general state 
              coffers.   There should be a real and direct benefit to National 
              Servicemen.<br> <br> I therefore propose that the revenue earned be 
              placed in a National Service Trust.   The trust funds can be used to 
              supplement the allowance of NSFs from poor families.   It should 
              compensate NS men who have been injured in the line of duty.  It can 
              even provide an income for a period of time to families of NS men who 
              have been killed.   That will never compensate for their loss, but it 
              may make a real and tangible difference to families who have been 
              deprived of their father's or son's contributions.   It will also give 
              confidence to our NS men that should anything happen to them in their 
              training, their families will be taken care of.   If there are 
              sufficient funds, we can even offer a grant to NS men towards their 
              first homes, and address the inequity I spoke of earlier of NS men 
              entering the market later than their peers.<br> <br> Will this proposal 
              cause PRs and foreigners to flee our shores?  I doubt it.  Even with an 
              increase, our tax rates will still be among the lowest of developed 
              countries, and we will still be one of the more attractive places to 
              live and work in.<br> <br> Taxation is not a fool-proof way of 
              addressing this thorny issue, but at the very least, it ensures that  
              everyone contributes to the defence and security of Singapore.   Beside,
               I believe that if foreigners and PRs see that their financial 
              contributions directly benefit NS men, they will view the duty as less 
              of a penalty, and more of an opportunity to make a meaningful 
              contribution towards the security they enjoy thanks to our NS men.  A 
              chance to do their duty, as it were.<br> <br> I intend to raise this 
              proposal in the coming Budget debates.   I would be grateful for your 
              views, and any suggestions you may have to improve it.</span></span></p>
              <p><span>
              </span></p><p>There were two main criticisms of my proposal: it is 
              xenophobic, and it “cheapens” National Service placing a monetary value 
              to its performance. Let me briefly deal with them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><strong>Xenophobia</strong></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some label the proposal xenophobic because it is “populist” and 
              “pandering”, and pits Singaporeans against others. The problem with this
               argument is that it makes the fundamental assumption that the situation
               we have now is already equitable and therefore any change can only be 
              for populist reasons.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think many will disagree with that. Indeed, the responses that have
               been posted debunk any suggestion of xenophobia – see my post “<strong>National Defence Duty – A Consolidation</strong>”.
               Most want a re-balancing, but in a principled way that will enable 
              better integration and that those who come to Singapore simply for 
              economic reasons should acknowledge that they are able to do so because 
              of others who do National Service. I do not see that as being 
              xenophobic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The question is therefore simple: is the current situation equitable?
               If yes, we leave things be. If not, how can we make it fairer? And to 
              answer this question, we need to have practical and effective solutions,
               otherwise the issue will not be resolved.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><em>Money</em></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Having spent 2.5 active and many reservist years in the infantry 
              myself, the last thing I want to do is to “cheapen” National Service.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Taxing foreigners to make up for their ineligibility to serve NS does
               not equate to putting a value on NS. Neither does giving monetary 
              rewards. But we do that anyway, such as giving reservists a modest tax 
              break every year. We all know it is symbolic and no one argues that it 
              puts a value to, or cheapens, reservist duties.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Indeed, placing an economic value on National Service is not a new 
              concept. As one commenter pointed out, in Switzerland, any person who 
              does not fulfil his military service obligation must pay an exemption 
              tax of 3% on his taxable income each year. It is not about valuing the 
              service or buying your way out. It is about giving recognition to those 
              who do their duty, and tax breaks, benefits and penalties are often used
               as a tool to facilitate that. We also do it for other causes too, like 
              parent relief for our income tax. No one argues that values or cheapens 
              the obligation of looking after loved ones.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I had in my first post talked about the real and significant economic
               cost which Singaporean men pay when they perform National Service. Most
               of us served because we believed in the cause, and we do not begrudge 
              that cost. That is however, a separate issue from getting those who do 
              not perform National Service, but benefit from it, to contribute like 
              the rest of us, albeit in a different way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As I said in my first post, it is not a perfect solution. But it will
               be difficult to find a practical and effective solution with universal 
              appeal, as the many different views I have received amply demonstrate.</p>
