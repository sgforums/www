              <p>Hi, I've already went through the interview and signed the "fake"(draft) contract for rsaf's senior tech vocation. Basically I'm given 7 days to withdraw after the signing of draft.</p>
              <p>If I don't like it or change my mind( more than 7 days as i've went thru the interview), can I still withdraw.</p>
              <p>Secondly,</p>
              <p>I want to know more about what senior tech do in rsaf and pros and cons.</p>

              <p>This is strictly my opinion.</p>
              <p>Unless you need the money, don't carry on with it.  I'm not sure what the new schemes are like these days, but if you have the opportunity to flexibly plan your career, switch around, you should value it.  Cos once you are contracted, you lose all that flexibility.  </p>
              <p>If you still cant decide what you wanna do in life, don't jump into a military contract just because of that.  Take a few more years to study and upgrade yourself while figuring that out.  Or just start off a job with whatever training qualifications you have first and take your time to think through.</p>
              <p>One of the biggest traps that people whom I know have signed on said they fell into was "time."  They didn't really weigh out the decision carefully until they had went through the interview and were on the verge of signing.  This period which you are in is when a lot of my friends just decided "f-ck it, the pay is good anyway" and penned a contract which they regretted. </p>
              <p>Like I said, unless you NEED the money, don't do it.</p>

              <p>and why does singapore with a vast amount of industries pay so low ?</p>
              <p>australia if u line up their factory and industries only sums up to 10% of spore industries.that is oz has 100 factories in low tech side,......spore has a 1000 factories.most of them are in high tech  superior side.but the pay of singaporeans have been sacrificed to the point of ridicule.while the foreigners can thrive anywhere  with the same spore pay.</p>

              <p>This is not the place for you to fight and you know very well the language you use.</p>
              <p>Kopisatu may have insulted you but he has posted proper reasons to while your posts are strictly personal insults with no other purpose.</p>
              <p>If you can't control ur temper, do not come to SAF forum and rant.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thead has been locked because of Hitman3 children behavior. Anyone with proper advice for TS can do so in pm.</p>
