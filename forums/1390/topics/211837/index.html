            <div class='col-md body'>My advice to u is that your health came 1st no matter what happened.<br>I think most likely u will get OOC if u continue to report sick and get attend B cause u should have miss a lot of training while under excuse.<br>Don't be afraid of BMT recourse,maybe u may felt sian as to be going to tekong again,but when u recourse,your status will be a trainee not a recruit anymore,it will be better if u have your CPL rank by then.And also u might not be going back to recourse if u get downgraded,u might only go back to Pes C recourse and i think it shouldn't be a problem loh.<br>Anyway your health is most impt,like what u say on your studies,really no point getting injured because of NS,the medical fees now is still cover by the SAF,but just think what happened after u ORD,do u think the SAF will care abt u anymore?don't get injured and affect your whole life,it not worth it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to my understanding, one will only be OOC if one is successfully downgraded or on long term MCs.<br><br>do not worry about retaking BMT as i believe as long your attendance is good, u will still POP with a "Attended BMT" score.<br><br>but do get your injury made known to your superiors and if necessary, apply for downgrade so that hopefully u will be posted to non-physical demanding vocation.<br><br>take care. good luck.<br><br>(pls correct me if any of my info above is wrong. thanks)</div>

After you OOC, you will still be post out (most likely) to another school to learn other trades. For me, I go OETI and become armourer aka gun repair man. If your hand consistently has problem, very likely you get posted to log school or other become clerk or PA.  After that, by right, eventually you will get posted back to BMT for recourse. But lots of people can skip the whole BMT thing or simply get OOC again for the same reason. For me, I got back to BMT because I wanted to and had volunteered for it. But lots of my peers never went back at all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, my advice is to go to ur specialist with ur parents/uncles aunties/ any adult above 40 also can (why? because with an adult, these specialist will not luan-luan lai, if u go alone, they will immediately put on their MO face and treat u as if u are there to keng.)<br><br>Then demand him to look into your case in more detail and ask him to make a conclusion if ur medical condition will reoccur if any physical activities is perform again and ask him to write a letter to ask for permeant downgrade. (Provided if u have a geniue injury that will reoccur, for kengsters need not apply)<br><br>Why? During my BMT, I have a platoon mate who is a 3SG who came back for recourse, during his frist BMT, he has back problems and was OOC. Then during the my time, which was his recourse, his old injury flared up and got worsen. And now he has to live with the pain for the rest of his life.<br><br>Although, I believe in serving NS for the greater good BUT I dun believe in allowing SAF to make u suffer the rest of your life. If u have an injury, treat it and make sure that it would not come back to haunt u again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What are grounds for OOC? Previously if you were excused or light duty for more than 2 weeks, you are considered OOC.<br><br>For your case, I thought it will be considered OOC already.<br><br>Injured ligament is tricky. It is very hard to determine whether is it really grounds for downgrade and it all depends on whether the MO gives you the benefit of the doubt. I've seen many different cases where some got downgraded and some didn't.<br><br>Even myself is suffering from damaged ligament at my left ankle. I previously saw a specialist and he didn't bother too much other than prescribed painkillers, but he did recommend me for temp downgrade. In any case I got downgraded for a bad fracture for my right index finger due to training accident, and all the more so this left foot injury was overlooked. It appears that sometimes leg injury you see SAF specialist is better than you see outside specialist.<br><br>Till today, I suffer great discomfort if I walk too long or stand with too much weight. I guess that is something many of us have to live with.</div>

It is better for him and do make sure he submits everything to the MO at BMTC.<br><br>Please also make sure the specialist at AH gives him a detailed diagnosis too. Sometimes they may forget. But as a private patient (which your son will be, without a referral letter), it is better because your son's specialist will be the same one throughout the case until your son's knee heals.<br><br>You can always come back here if you have any queries.

They can get you appointments way faster then the army can.The army takes about 3 weeks......I got my appt over 1 weekend after i went to see A&amp;E.Just say it's alot of pain and u cant slp cant do anything and demand an appt ASAP.And it's covered under 11b.You will pay nothing if you do this.Otherwise you have to pay 20% i think.</div>
