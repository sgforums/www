There was another topic on training issues and Gendaken had actively argued against the implentation of such a training method a year back.<br><br>Neither did they maintain the innocence of CPT Pandiaraj.  We all know he was neligent; we all know he might have ordered the dunking, but why did the charges stopped at that level of command.  God knows when dunking was introduced.  It was indeed wrongful as we could see now as safety was compromised in it.  But why didn't the higher echelons who had being in the forces for so long investigate or do anything about it.  They would have heard of the training even if they did not go through it themselves. So aren't they as guilty of negligence as CPT Pandiaraj.  That I think was what Gendaken was trying to bring across.<br><br>I guess there is a misunderstanding along the way during your debate with Gendaken.  Maybe the picture can be clearer if you can read the postings again.  Anyway I guess that particular topic is best summed up by meander.<br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>

He also said he had, on his own accord, walked over to another area to count the number of trainees who were yet to go through prisoner-of-war treatment, when another instructor told him time was running out. He then went for a walk before returning to the tub.<br><br>Questioned by the DPP, he said he did not speak to anyone in the holding area or on his walk. 'I find it a bit odd,' said the DPP. 'You know you need to hurry up. You then go on your jaunt to the holding area and you don't tell anybody to hurry up.'<br><br>Divanandhari said he wanted to take a break.<br><br>The DPP said: 'It's a remarkable coincidence that when Capt Ho was undergoing water treatment, you went off to the holding area to count the number of trainees, but did not tell anyone this information.'<br><br>Divanandhari replied: 'I didn't need to tell anybody. And it's not just once, but I left the water treatment area a lot of times.</strong><br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>More amazing coincidences involving Mr Divanandhari.......<br><br>Basically, the situation now is:<br><br>(1) The 5 witnesses were wrong in their previous testimony and that Mr Div was away on break and that he did not commit the dunking act.  Meaning he is the innocent party who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br><br>or<br><br>(2) The 5 witnesses were correct in their previous testimony and that Mr Div was not away on break and that he did commit the dunking act.  If so, this means that he is a coward who can lie in a court testimony in an attempt to save his ass.<br><br>or<br><br>(3) The 5 witnesses were correct in their previous testimony and that Mr Div was not away on break and that he did commit the dunking act.  However, Mr Div has a faulty memory and thus gave the wrong testimony (haha...).<br><br>Hmmm.......wonder which option is more likely.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't wanna comment too much while the legal proceedings are still ongoing, but one of these days I'm gonna summarize - at face value with the court testimonies - what everybody apparently DIDN'T do (from various staff commanders, CDO or otherwise, to the instructors on the ground), &amp; see if it doesn't sound so tragically comical overall.<br><br>Diva's playing politician. At least Jeff Ng hasn't disvowed being a participant; his own defence is about dunking techniques/wearing full gloves/not seeing his POWs collapsing. Diva's basically claiming to be a peripheral figure by contrast.<br><br>Pandiaraj &amp; Balakrishan will have their say, but one thing I've cued in on is not so much why the non-course appointees suka-suka join in the training - which I asked earlier - but how Ng &amp; Diva ended up with such a prominent tekaning role. Is it their force of personality, their lao-chiao experience? Granted, the trainee intake was large but why did the other instructors - esp. the appointed ones - defer control/authority?<br><br><blockquote>But why didn't the higher echelons who had being in the forces for so long investigate or do anything about it. </blockquote>Yes, I have plenty of beef with the institutional side too &amp;, given how certain training SOPs has been exposed as sloppy, I do hope the buck doesn't end with the 4 alleged lawbreakers. FYI Noel Cheah is a fellow SJI alumnus of mine, but unfortunately that won't earn my sympathy. The Commandos need to get their house in order, cuz they set a high standard &amp; is a vital part of the SAF.<br><br>But the CDOs aren't on trial; neither is their Training Wing or even the CST itself. Rather, it's those active participants deemed to have been culpable in hurting the 2 casualties, cuz it is now a criminal case. The CID was called in, a coroner's inquiry was convened &amp; the prosecution now conducted by the AGC. That's why the other instructors aren't charged either, though at times I find myself wondering "why not?" when these guys testified about holding down the trainees' legs (but didn't get to do the actual dunking).<br><br><blockquote>One more question - why civilian court at all? Why not court martial but open to the public? SAF no balls to do it the right way?</blockquote>See last paragraph; the military doesn't subjujate the judiciary in Singapore's system. I won't rule out court martial, or at least the DMG throwing the book at certain higher commanders for their (institutional) negligence. Note: When TCH debriefed Parliament earlier, he announced that FIVE instructors (4 officers, 1 senior NCO) were suspended &amp; TWO other training supervisors relieved of their duties - &amp; these were just the Training Wing personnel.<br><br>Here's hoping MINDEF won't just close shop after the conclusion of the trial.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, littlespotz - appreciate the enthusiasm but don't mock the legal proceedings itself, okay? If they hit you with contempt of court, you won't be able to plead ignorance or allude to what's seemingly "novelty" behavior to you.<br><br>This is not Justice Bao, full of melodrama &amp; stuff. Having attended Abbas Saad's trial, I'll even say the verbal parts are pretty business-like, fairly brief &amp; generally boring. But there's also a lot of underlying paperwork &amp; legal discussions which the public gallery won't be witness to.<br><br>The issue over a non-present safety officer, plus who's the appointed supervising officer itself, was covered in court earlier this month.

This officer is not to be involved in the training. His responsibility is to stop the course once safety regulations are breached.<br><br>In court yesterday, Lt Shashi Kumar said he had helped restrain trainees by straddling their bodies in the tub, a technique he said he learnt from watching other instructors.<br><br>In the middle of that day's training, the supervising officer, Captain Pandiaraj Mayandi, one of the accused, halted the course and said that he was going to the medical centre.<br><br>'While I was at the medical centre, I saw so many trainees there,' said Lt Shashi Kumar.<br><br>While at the medical centre, Pandiaraj asked him if he was the safety officer and when he said he was not, the captain asked Lieutenant Divanandhari Ambat Chandrasekharan, another of the accused, the same question. Divanandhari replied that he was not.<br><br>Lt Sashi Kumar said that Pandiaraj then told Divanandhari to assume the role first, and that things would be settled later. 'It only occurred to me then that there were no safety officers appointed throughout this course,' he said.<br><br>Mr Selva Naidu, Pandiaraj's lawyer, pointed out that Lieutenant Yap Kwong Weng, the original supervising officer, testified on Wednesday that he had assigned Lt Shashi Kumar as safety officer for the first three days.<br><br>He replied: 'I was not deployed as safety officer by anyone.'<br><br>OCT 7, 2004<br>Course papers changed: witness<br>`Names of attending officers changed after Hu died`<br>By Khushwant Singh<br><br>A DISTRICT court heard yesterday that although the course documents listed Lieutenant Yap Kwong Weng as the supervising officer, Captain Pandiaraj Mayandi (pictured), 33, had put his name down in that appointment hours after a trainee died.<br><br>Lt Yap testified that he had been the initial supervising officer of the combat survival training course on Pulau Tekong in which Second Sergeant Hu Enhuai, 19, died after being dunked.<br><br>But on Aug 21 last year, the day of 2nd Sgt Hu`s death, Lt Yap attended a full-day Work Improvement Teams (Wits) session in HDB Hub in Toa Payoh Central and Capt Pandiaraj assumed the role of supervising officer.<br><br>Lt Yap told the district court that he had gone home at 5.30pm after the Wits session and Capt Pandiaraj had called after 7pm to ask him to return to camp.<br><br>While driving to his camp in Changi, Capt Pandiaraj called again to say a trainee had died and new administration instructions had to be printed out. The supervising officer was changed from Lt Yap to Capt Pandiaraj, the safety officer was changed to Lieutenant Divanandhari Ambat Chandrasekharan, and the administration specialist changed to Staff Sgt Tan Tian Huat.<br><br>Asked by Deputy Public Prosecutor Christopher de Souza why the changes were made, Lt Yap said: Because Capt Pandiaraj was supervising officer on the ground that day, and secondly, the supervising officer had the authority to dictate the appointment holders. Lt Yap also told the court that he had helped Warrant Officer S Balakrishnan, 45, the course commander, in preparing the paperwork.<br><br>Warrant Officer Bala is a very experienced soldier who does not have a good knowledge of computer skills so therefore I assisted him to prepare most of the administration papers.<br><br>Later, another witness, Lt Kong Wai Kheong, a platoon commander, who went to watch over the seven men he sent for the course, said that he also helped in the dunking of trainees.<br><br>He had told Lt Divanandhari to stop dunking 2nd Sgt Hu, who collapsed when pulled out of the tub of water. Lt Kong had moved away after instructors attended to 2nd Sgt Hu, who started coughing and looked as if he was recovering.<br><br>The sergeant later died in hospital.<br><br>Charged with causing the death of 2nd Sgt Hu and endangering the life of another trainee, Capt Ho Wan Huo, 26, are Lt Jeff Ng Chin Fong, 27, and Lt Divanandhari, 28. Capt Pandiaraj is accused of instigating the offences while WO Balakrishnan is charged for failing to stop the two lieutenants.<br><br>The trial continues.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Eh ppl,read from the papers that Lt Divanandhari has a knee problem which effectively prevents him from squatting down.He was quoted as saying that if he has squatted down,his knee would have locked due to 2 staples which have been surgically implanted there.And he even volunteered to demostrate to the DPP in-front of everyone present that this is true,as such he could not have been squatting in the tub when the dunking took place.&lt;&gt;and if this is true,can anyone answer/comment why is someone with a medical problem allowed to be in a Combat unit,to be precise,an Elite,Front-line Combat Unit?<br><br>Next,the Genenva Convention states that any Prisoner-of-War can only be asked the BIG FOUR<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">ate of Birth,Name,Rank and (if i did not remember wrongly)Unit.Thus if the combat survival course is to teach the trainees the essence of combat survival much like the American S.E.R.R (Survival,Evasion,Resistance and Escape) is supposed to do to the trainee,I think they have clearly defeated the purpose of the entire exercise.Why?Simply because the Convention states that one can only expect the answers to the BIG FOUR,thus if the instructors had asked for their rank,it already defeats the purpose.As I am sure,all troops already know the Geneva Convention and have been properly briefed on what to say in the event of capture.Thus this exercises have clearly defeated the purpose of training the trainees as they weren't able to simulate the actual combat environments in the actual scenario.<br><br>To be real honest,it shatters me deeply that a young life has been lost not due to hs own recklessness,but due to the actions of neglience and sheer STUPIDITY of men whom the nation trusts and whom are supposed to be taking care of the welfare of their trainees.It was perhaps a competition amongst themselves to see who could extract the most info from the trainess in the shortest time possible.Btw,can anyone comment if CPT.HO and those who were admitted to the hospital for medical problems due to the dunking,would they be awarded compensation in any forms?<br><br>I hope that SAF reviews the way such courses are conducted.Perhaps they could introduce newer and better forms of instructions.Instead of it being a totally physical approach to the training,perhaps using a better form of interrogration would be using physcological warfare.Breaks the trainees' will but not touch them.<br><br>Please share your feedback.Thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The whole court case has been turned into a circus by the accused persons because they refuse to take responsibility for what they have done even after so much corroborating eyewitness accounts and testimonies from them.The AI was changed by CPT Pandiaraj because there was not even a safety officer appointed in the initial AI released for such a elective course.This is very unprofessional and the standards that is demanded of a elite soldier has clearly not been met.They just seem to be ignorant of the fact that one human being has died and do not show any of the emotions one would usually associate with remorse.Rather, they are bickering like the stereotypical cannot-make-it regulars we have all seen in the Army, always pushing the blame and deflecting responsibility.<br><br>If you look at the testimony about how many instructors were around the dunking area, you will realise that there was no control measure put in place to prevent non-appointment holders to join in the "fun".It merely reinforces the lack of seriousness and integrity of these trainers who are supposed to reflect the leadership and the professionalism of the SAF's elite corps.How can you let fellows walk in , dunk a person, leave him there and just walk away?This is an outrage.So much for having Best Unit again.It just tells me how much of slackness and rot has seeped into the foundation of these people.<br><br>We need a Military Oversight and Investigation committee, preferably formed by GSI to be a high-level roving safety and procedural team which cannot be pressured into covering up incidents.Since soldiers cannot readily tell the press what exactly happened in their camps and security prevents video cameras to be brought into camp, that will be the only way to assuage the concerns and fears of a citizenry who have brought up their sons to be useful members of society and wish to see them safely through NS.</div>
