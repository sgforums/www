            <div class='col-md body'>This case was a bad joke right from the start.  The inexperienced Defence minister said, "We will get to the bottom of this", turning this into a civil case instead of the military case it was supposed to be - Dr Tony Tan would never have done something so stupid.<br><br>If they'd charged the two LTAs, it would have been a fair call since they were directly involved in the dunking.  However, if you are going to charge the other two, logically, the responsibility would have led all the way up the chain of command.  If Pandiaraj was charged, why wasn't Teo Chee Hean?<br><br>In any case, it's all academic now.  Both Bala and Pandiaraj will file appeals that they will most likely lose, but there were tenuous grounds for charging them in the first place (unless youy wanted to charge everybody all the way up the line).  For all four, I expect that dishonourable discharge papers have already been issued, with perhaps two held pending appeal.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NS means the public have a right to know about what goes on in our armed forces.The public interest must be upheld for justice to be there.The sentences are too lenient for a case which has involved the death of a human being.Any appeal should result in harsher sentences.The moral beacon of the courts is being seen here, let's hope they can be exemplary in their conduct.</div>

After that, he was brought out of the water for about four to five seconds before his head was submerged again. During the time his head was lifted out of the water, the deceased was gasping for air."<br><br>Sergeant Yen continued: "He was breathing heavily when his head was lifted above the water. When the deceased completed the session, Lieutenant Jeff pulled the deceased out of the tub and the deceased fell to the ground.<br><br>"The deceased was motionless and I saw water coming out of his mouth. The deceased was vomiting water from his mouth."<br><br>As for the other trainee Captain Ho Wan Huo who survived but almost drowned, Sergent Yen said Lieutenant Divanand Hari had covered his mouth, nose and eyes and then pushed his head into underwater.<br><br>During the course of the evidence, the prosecution brought in a dummy blindfolded and hands tied behind the back for Sergeant Yen to demonstrate to the court how the dunking of Sergeant Hu and Captain Ho had been done.<br><br>However, the family members of Sergeant Hu were not in court to witness the demonstration.<br><br>Under cross-examination, Sergeant Yen said there were other instructors helping Lieutenant Diva during the water treatment component of the survival training.<br><br>Sergeant Yen added that another accused person, Captain Pandiaraj, was at the scene and he could have stopped the instructors from continuing the treatment. - CNA </div></blockquote><span style="color: red;">He said the Commando trainers treated these two trainees much more harshly than any of the other trainees.</span><br><br>more elaboration is needed on why and how the deceased was given harsher treatment. this will shed light on why he died while others survived</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gendaken: I'll have to disagree with you there. The fact that the trial has already been held in public means that those information are no longer confidential; they are already public domain. Further, they could always have a closed civil trial. Lastly, a per se rule against civil liability is surely too draconian; at the very least, the case can be considered on a case by case basis.<br><br>Another point is that the action filed may not neccessitate the release of any confidential information.<br><br>Hmmm..anyway this is moot - until someone does some reaserch and come up with some case law or legislation we'll never know if there is a policy against civil liability.<br><br>-------------<br><br>How come you guys keep complaining that those guys may appeal. Its their RIGHT to appeal. Come on, don't deny them that right. In fact, i have issues with the way the CJ handles appeal; by consistently (it would seem to be but i'm not sure) inscreasing the sentences of people who appeal, he is making a travesty of the judicial system and of the principle that one is innnocent until proven guilty.<br><br>-----------------<br><br>In my limited experience, they do single out ppl for harsher treatment. I think officiers and senior specialists are supposed to be subject to harsher treatment. Also, ppl who answer questions wrongly or who appear too compliant may be earmarked for such treatment too.<br><br>The rationale should be obvious.<br></div>

Com'on we cannot deny the fact that Cpt Pandiaraj was just at the wrong place at the wrong time. Any man in his position would have given the order for the dunking. It had being carried out for way too long that it had become sort of the "right" thing to do.<br><br>Take for example taupoking in pre-uni institutes. The students think it is okay to do it as it has being like a tradition. But the fact is that no accidents has happened yet. When an accident does really happen, who should be the one responsible for it? The predecessors who started it? The teachers who knew about this activity all along but did not prevent/stop it? Or the people responsible for the accident? I will say that morally speaking, the three groups of people I have mentioned are responsible for the accident.<br><br>In this dunking accident, I still feel that the people who should be charged are the two lieutenants that have carried out the act. Morally, why stop at the officer commanding if you are going to charge beyond the 2 officers directly involved. It is not about moral issues anymore. It is more about filling the blanks to bear the blame. And in my point of view, Cpt Pandiaraj is a scapegoat made to bear the blame for giving the orders. Read the New Paper on last Saturday and one will know the integrity of that man.</div>

Or the people who knew about it all along but didn't stop it? Should all the three groups be responsible? If that is the case, I think there should be more implications up the higher echelons rather than just stopping at the officer commanding.</div>
