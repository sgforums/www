Just shut the Fuck up. Getting sick of you, don't even know what the Fuck it is you're trying to show off. You obviously know nuts about the case so stop making candy-Assed smarty remarks like "justice is served". As a friend of 2SG Hu, I've been very patient with you where your stupid remarks are conceredn, BUT that last statement simply drives me right over the edge. SO YOU CAN PLEASE FUCK OFF NOW AND STOP COMMENTING ABOUT JUSTICE WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO JUSTICE SHOULD BE VISITED UPON.</div>
