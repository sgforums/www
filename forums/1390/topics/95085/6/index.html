He reacted differently when he was pulled out of the water. He was extremely weak. He tried to breathe hard and his lips had turned pale. He did not struggle as a normal person."<br><br>Lieutenant Kong, a Platoon Commander at Hendon Camp, had sent seven men from his Strike Reconnaissance Team to attend the combat survival training course.<br><br>He was at Pulau Tekong to observe their progress.<br><br>Although Lt Kong is not an official instructor for the CST course, he was there because his own men were attending the course.<br><br>In his own words, he was there to assist the other instructors from station to station.<br><br>During cross examination, Lt Kong admitted he had helped hold down the legs of some trainees as they were dunked.<br><br>When asked why, he said it was to prevent the trainees from getting injured as they thrashed around. - CNA<br><br></div>

So how can he be having anti-elite sentiments.<br></div>
