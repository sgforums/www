Read Goondu74's posting.<br><br>Of course they are not trying to kill anybody here. Who would want to?<br><br>Gunning? That's a HIGH chance of killing someone, and even in real scenerio u might not want to kill a POW if u are trying to extract information from him.<br><br>There should be a line drawn, to keep the trainees moderately safe. Where to draw the line is difficult to determine. Sadly, the line was crossed and resulted in a loss of a life.<br><br>Do you think that gunning or other methods of causing grevious hurt should be in the training? Any sane person would say no, since the trainee's life is at risk.<br><br>What other methods to simulate POW torture then, with considerably lower risk? If the training is too lax, do you think it will have any significance at all?<br><br>One of the ways to torture a POW is using water. Just like what kwlee has pointed out, dunking a trainee's head into the water might have been done many many times without any loss of life. This might have resulted in the particular form of 'simulated torture' to become a norm part of the training.<br><br>Please take note that I am not saying I support such harsh training.<br><br>Rather, I have doubts that these few trainers are the ONLY ones to do this. Too bad they are in the limelight now, and all fingers are pointing at them.<br><br>Ever watched a good movie titled 'A few Good Men'?

In fact, my sister's ex-colleague's son died in NS just days after this incident, but no such publicity. </blockquote>They needn't be. MINDEF has several tiers of formal investigative procedures; Teo Chee Hean mentioned them when he spoke in Parliament about the 3 SAF deaths last year.<br><br>The most basic is the SIB investigation &amp; internal Commission of Inquiry, which took place for the BMTC recruit who collapsed during IPPT. Next up is the Higher Board of Inquiry, which was convened for the Ranger-course attendee who collapsed during the 5km run.<br><br>There's also an independent Committee of Inquiry (chaired by a senior civil servant), which was done for the CST case. MINDEF is completely out of this jurisdiction, &amp; my own experience of it - with my unit's M113 explosion from 1986 - was that the press would have access to its report. Generally though, the full SIB &amp; COI details won't be made available to the public, beyond the announcement of its results &amp; whether any SOP has been breached.<br><br>The CST case is big news cuz MINDEF also followed up by conveneing a Higher Board of Inquiry plus a Coroner's Inquiry, as well as cooperating with the Police with their own CID investigation.<br><br><blockquote>some people actually believed that water torture (even in training) means spraying water  </blockquote>Here's what TCH said in Parliament (just like what I tried to point out to Gerdakan some time back):<br><br>"The Committee of Inquiry found that the trainers had not followed the approved lesson plan for this training exercise. <strong>According to the lesson plan, the trainees were only to be doused with water with the intent of showering them.</strong>  The lesson plan specifically prohibits physical contact and manhandling of trainees, and states categorically that instructors should never force water treatment into the body.  Submerging the head of a trainee into water was not authorized.<br><br>"However, instead of being doused with water, 2SG Hu had his head submerged in water four times. As a result he aspirated water, had breathing difficulties and collapsed. He was treated promptly by a medical orderly at the scene and evacuated to the Singapore General Hospital, but despite the medical treatment he died.<br><br><strong>Besides 2SG Hu, other trainees also had their heads submerged in water. As a result 6 aspirated water and required medical treatment.</strong> The Combat Survival Training had been conducted in an unauthorized way.<br><br>This is an extremely serious lapse in the conduct of the training. It should never have happened."<br><br>Hope this clarifies, as far as how extreme the specific drill was supposed to be.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wuming78,<br>I'll like you to keep this discussion active, if you don't mind; it's too much of a national talking point. Clamp down only if it leads to a string of new threads, or if we start getting into the libellous "conspiracy" arguments.<br><br>To the others: Hey, guys - calm down. It's going to be a month-long trial, with the likelihood of the public getting increasingly appalled by certain relevatory details &amp; also the attempts at rationalizations/justifications on the part of the defense.<br><br>Getting this off my chest: My hunch is this tragedy will also go down as the SAF's own Ribbon Creek parallel. [The latter was a 1956 incident when a 31-year-old two-war vet-cum-new DI marched a Marine rookie platoon into a marshy creek, causing 6 of them to drown in their FBO. Revisionist studies downplayed the "drunk" accusations, saying he did drink on the night but not enough to get tipsy.] Both are monumentals case of bad judgement that shook the entire armed forces to the core.<br><br>While the specific perpetrators must be punished for their abuse, I hope the Commandos, if not the bigger SAF itself, will profoundly rethink the attitude (not just the method) of its training. Yes, CST course should be rigorously realistic &amp; "welfare" tends to be such a dirty word within the military, but the current public backlash reflects a genuine concern for safety - &amp; dignity - of the trainees.<br><br>Does repeated dunking really simulates POW treatment "better" than spraying powerful waterjets, when heavily-panting trainees would've uncontrollably resisted swallowing water in either case? Your body would've violently struggled by instinct, so why the further debasement as long as the certain mental "lesson" - it's certainly not a physical skill - has gotten through?<br><br>It's simple: Beyond professionalism, Singapore also wants a SAF to be a reflection of our values &amp; ideals - rather than a private army's or some sort of mythical elite toughness. That's accordingly reflected in the SAF Core Values &amp;, relevant to certain people, the Officer's Creed. Apparently, the existing standards aren't enough to bring certain rouge elements into line.<br><br>Beyond the SOP revamp, the Marines also underwent 2 fundamental transformations: 1stly, a general positive reinforcement of the close-knit Brotherhood ethos ("taking care of its own", aka West Point) &amp; 2ndly, the more specific creation of the Drill Instructor's Creed. Perhaps we can similarly add something along these lines.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I speculate, as with the Nicholl Highway collapse, the litigation process will blunt out the emotional distress over time. Wish I could attend the trial - I took leave for Abbas Saad's in the mid-90's (out of curiosity). The next best thing would be following the daily revelations via the different newspapers, which can be cumbersome since they don't always report every detail.<br><br>Guys, I appreciate the postings but please don't anyhow hantum - okay? Read closely what the papers reported before commenting, since they already contain plenty of "WTF?" controversial statements by themselves. Like the COI admission that unauthorized dunkings had taken place since '98, became unwritten SOP since Y2K, then actually intensified from placing trainees' heads under running tap water to submerging them in a shallowed-filled washing bay to dunking in a one-metre tub to, in Hu's case, "stopping him from surfacing to breathe" (Today tabloid).<br><br>To correct a further misposting, the specific charges are "causing death by a rash act" (Hu Enhuai) &amp; "causing grevious hurt by a rash act that endangered a life" (Ho Wan Huo).<br><br>It's not murder, manslaughter or culpable homicide.<br><br>FYI The Singapore Statutes Online lists the following punishments for the said offences (the "grevious hurt" one is my attempt at approximation; there's a bundle of them):<br><br>"Causing death by rash or negligent act.<br>304A. Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with both."<br><br>"Causing grievous hurt by an act which endangers life or the personal safety of others.<br>338. Whoever causes grievous hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or the personal safety of others, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine which may extend to $1,000, or with both."<br><br>http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_getdata.pl?&amp;actno=1872-REVED-224&amp;date=latest&amp;method=part&amp;segid=888373002-001939#888373002-002165</div>
