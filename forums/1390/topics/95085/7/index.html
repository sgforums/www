K. Rajarh asked Dr Ong if he would have certified 2nd Sgt Hu fit for the course had he known trainees are required to be PES A.<br><br>From a medical point of view, he said, it was irrelevant whether 2nd Sgt Hu was PES A or B as long as he passed the FFI criteria, referring to Fitness For Instruction, a medical check-up procedure in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).<br><br>He also disagreed that a doctor must know the 'extent of the physical regime' that trainees undergo in a course before certifying a soldier fit for it.<br><br>'I disagree, because the purpose of the FFI is to exclude any medical condition that would prevent the soldier from participating in SAF combat training in general,' said Dr Ong.<br><br>Knowing the contents of the course would not have altered his assessment, he said.<br><br>The reason for 2nd Sgt Hu's PES B status - a 'less flexible' Achilles tendon in his left ankle - would not have affected his ability to go through the course, he added.<br><br>Another witness who testified was a commando, 2nd Sgt Lui Yong Fook, who was among the trainees hospitalised for breathing in salt water.<br><br>He said he had expected to be 'forcefully pushed down' in water, having seen it in 'the movies, it's normal POW training'.<br><br>The trial continues.</div>

There is little we can do to change or determine the outcome of this matter, however, we can show the courst and the SAF how serious many of us feel. I believe those of us that are able and willing should attend the court hearing as it continues, as a show of support to the fallen one and to those highly affected. We all want the ones responsible to pay dearly. Let's not let this incident be swept under the carpet by the authorities, and let's show SAF and the governing party, how serious we are about it.</div>
