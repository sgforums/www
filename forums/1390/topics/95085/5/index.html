            <div class='col-md body'>Dunking survivors testify in trial of commandos<br><br>SINGAPORE: Captain Ho Wan Huo has testified in the trial of the four commandos accused of nearly drowning the captain and causing the death of another trainee, Second Sergeant Hu Enhuai, during a combat survival course.<br>On day 8 of the trial, the court also heard dramatic accounts from three other trainees about what the commando trainers did to them.<br><br>Captain Ho said he was dunked more than six times in the water tub by the commando trainers.<br><br>He said he was held in a wheel-barrow position, his head and upper body in the water tub while the commandos held his legs up.<br><br>Testifying in court, Captain Ho used a dummy to demonstrate how his entire body slid into the tub up to his ankles as he struggled violently for air.<br><br>The course was to prepare the trainees for the treatment they might receive as prisoners of war.<br><br>The commando trainers had used the dunking to force the trainees to reveal secrets and other personal details like their rank.<br><br>Captain Ho told the court: "I could not take it anymore and decided to reveal my actual rank, that I was a Captain. I heard the instructors cheering and doing 'hi-fives'. I was left in the tub and I crawled out of the tub on my own."<br><br>Captain Ho was later sent to the Singapore General Hospital where he was warded for seven days for near drowning.<br><br>Two other trainees had even more chilling accounts of what happened.<br><br>3rd Sergeant Gary Han said he was dunked three times.<br><br>Twice he was held underwater for at least 20 seconds and ended up breathing in water through his nose.<br><br>"I felt the dip was very scary and death crossed my mind, at one point in time I felt I was going to die," 3rd Sergeant Han said.<br><br>Another trainee, 3rd Sergeant Tan Li Thong who was dunked 4 or 5 times, told the court: "I felt traumatized as I could hardly breathe and I was choking because I had inhaled water through my mouth and nose. After the water treatment, I was panting and weeping under my blindfold."<br><br>The trainees were asked if they knew they had the option to surrender and give up information in order to stop the water treatment.<br><br>They said they knew.<br><br>But they also believed if they broke down under interrogation, they would in effect fail the course and may have to repeat the course starting from day one. - CNA<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I have mixed feelings about this. As an instructor, I need to simulate as close to reality as possible. As a trainee, I am scared shitless if the same happens to me, even in a training scenario.<br><br>My guess is no one made any effort in doing additional research in measuring the average human reaction to dunking, from the pre-dunking psyche and how it affects behaviors under water, what are the various reactions during the time of submersion and from there list out clearly what are the dos and donts in handling trainees in this exercise.<br><br>The high-fives and pat-on-the-back can be perceived in 2 ways. Firstly, it is want will likely happen if the enemy breaks you, providing that extra psychological stress in the form of mockery and shame on the trainee's psyche. If this is the case, the instructors should not be penalised.<br><br>On the other hand, the exercise might have mutated and evolved into an internal competition among the instructors to see who can break the trainee faster OR whose "way" is the most effective. If it is the latter, so much for professionalism. In this context, they should be punished.<br><br>My suggestion to the SAF is to review the high risk lessons, conduct more primary research on them (real scientific observations and measurements rather than just gathering opinions from instructors and trainees) and develop a better script for the future. I am sure that if I am unsure of the what is described in the lesson plan, going to my superior for clarity will still yield me an ambiguous answer.<br><br>But the fundamental issue is, do we expect the same level of standards between conscripts and regulars? Yes, ideally we always say no compromise. But under this macro rule, some degree of wastage (pardon my language and all due respect to those who are hurt on both sides by this incident) will bound to happen. It is just a matter of probability.<br><br>In any case, if it is related to ambiguity of the doctrine, then SAF is to be blamed. If it has to come to this, lets face up to the blame as an organization instead of putting the instructors in a civil court and hope this will go away forever. It wont as long as the fundamentals remain flawed.<br><br>To be fair, this story is becoming to sound like a murder case in a civilian court, tried by civilians and reported by a civilian media.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I see that we have not moved on from this topic after all that was said in the earlier threads months ago.<br><br>I just have a few questions for HENG@ who is a friend of 2SG Hu.<br><br>1) Being a sniper-trained guardsman that 2SG Hu was, was he considered an elite soldier?<br><br>If the answer is yes, then I suppose that your post:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">i would love to see all them elite soldiers stuck in clerk jobs. see how they like it. no playing with guns, only paperwork. </div></blockquote>You are including the late 2SG whom you hold so dear.<br><br>2) As an outstanding student and individual that he was as you always like to point out, was he proud to be serving his country as a NSF 2SG sniper-trained guardsman? Did he believe in what he was doing, the vitality of him wearing green in the army and protecting his homeland?<br><br>Then your post:<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">HA! if its as cock up n screwed up as it is, then is its vitality for real? or is it MERELY A GODAMN ILLUSION? n u must have your head in the clouds if u think we're anything but dead if anyone around us decides to invade. Go se your alarm clock or something. U need to wake up.</div></blockquote>wouldn't you be mocking at what he had stood for?<br><br>My point is that while many understand where are you coming from and grief for the loss of an outstanding Singapore youth,  that doesn't mean that his death gave you the right to insult anyone's 2yrs+ contribution however "keng" or insignificant that you think it is.<br><br>I think previous posts pretty much covered what went wrong and while waiting for the court proceedings to reach on a verdict, harping on and on like what you did is definately not helping to honor the memory of the departed.</div>
