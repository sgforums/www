Morally, why stop at the officer commanding if you are going to charge beyond the 2 officers directly involved. It is not about moral issues anymore. It is more about filling the blanks to bear the blame. And in my point of view, Cpt Pandiaraj is a scapegoat made to bear the blame for giving the orders. Read the New Paper on last Saturday and one will know the integrity of that man. </div></blockquote>Agreed, duajia.  As you've said, by the logic of dragging Cpt Pandiaraj and WO Bala into the case, they've opened up a line of argument that ultimately leads to charging Teo Chee Hean for the death.  After all, as Defence Minister, wasn't he in a position to stop it?<br><br>If you think that proposal sounds ridiculous, it's just as ridiculous as charging men who were not directly and physically involved in the dunking because it runs along the exact same line of logic.<br><br>I've got no problems with the two LTAs being charged - those forumites here who have been around long enough will know that I was even accused by fellow Commandos of being a traitor for taking that stance.  However, that where I see the line being drawn - go any further and you may as well go all the way up the chain of command.  Stopping at Pandiaraj and Bala is scapegoating and a half-measure that screams hypocrisy.  Whoever is up in arms about the undoubtedly great loss of a fine young man, push for the inclusion of COA, CDF and the Defence Minister in the defendant's dock.<br><br>With regards to fudgester's statement about service records not counting, I ask that you consider the following.  This is a man who made good of the SAF's trust in him to run a <strong>peacekeeping </strong>operation.  Given that this man has demonstrated the good judgement that made his peacekeeping tour a success, isn't it out of character that he is the person responsible for this fiasco?  Something fails to add up here, and therein lies the relevance of the service record.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gentlemen, if I may say something......<br><br>I read in another thread somewhere in Speaker's Corner that one of the forummites (heng) was a friend of the victim. The thing is, he has already accepted the punishment meted out to the perps and would like everyone to stop talking about those four.<br><br>While I personally believe that those four should have been much more harshly charged and punished, perhaps the best idea is to follow heng's example. If he can accept the punishments and have closure, I suppose the rest of us can. As it is if the perps have any conscience (which I sincerely hope they do), they're going to be haunted with the memory of having killed a good man. I'm sure that is going to be punishment in itself, and no amount of further punishment meted out to the perps is going to bring the victim back to life.<br><br>Anyway, I'm sorry if some of my postings were harshly-worded.... they were made in the heat of the moment, and that's not what I'm usually like in real life. The logical and rational me would not stoop down so low.<br><br>I'm also sorry if there were any inacccuracies in my postings..... My information is only as good as the one that I receive (and recall), and my sources and my memory may not always be that reliable.<br><br>I just hope that the family can find some sort of closure and peace.....<br><br>And I hope that none of this would ever happen again in the SAF..... the enemy is out there, not our soldiers.<br><br></div>

I have no qualms with Pandiaraj's professional achievements - not even with his court testimonies, which were largely dignified compared to Diva's "took a dump &amp; went for long walk" spin. But Pandiaraj has to take responsibility cuz he was, plainly, supervising officer for the course &amp; he was there on the ground that day. Now, the court testimonies revealed his relatively inexperience: being posted in only less than 3 months, &amp; then overseeing one prior CST course (79th batch) before the tragedy happened.<br><br>But IMO he was nevertheless indirectly culpable cuz:<br><br>(a) he said he reviewed 50+ lesson plans but not the CST one,<br><br>(b) he tacitly approved the dunkings of the 79th batch, against better judgement, cuz he went through the same thing in Ranger training - as if the intensity levels of both courses are the same,<br><br>(c) he didn't stop the cowboy instructors, namely Jeff Ng &amp; Diva, who testified they weren't supposed to be there on the day, but who showed up impromptuly &amp; - according to other less-experiened instructors' testimonies - dominated the dunking drill.<br><br>(d) he tried some sort of covering up after the incident by altering the details of the cse document.<br><br>However, the most damning, as related to his charge (which was instigating the instructors rather than outright causing grievous hurt) was:<br><br>(e) he took on an active role on the day, by interrogating Hu himself &amp; also indicating Ho Wan Huo's rank to another instructor (instead of staying on the sidelines as his job dictates). Even Balakrishnan testified that "appointment holders like Captain Pandiaraj... should not have been involved in conducting the prisoner of war training. Instead, they should have focused on their appointed role."<br><br><blockquote>The bottom line is who really killed the good man? The lieutenants directly in charge of the dunking? The people who started the tradition of dunking? Or the people who knew about it all along but didn't stop it? Should all the three groups be responsible? If that is the case, I think there should be more implications up the higher echelons rather than just stopping at the officer commanding.</blockquote>This is a criminal proceedings, &amp; I approve of the guilty verdicts. Metaphorically, if this was a drink-driving charge it's not about blaming the car manufacturer or the pub that sold him the drinks or the girlfriend problems that made him togo in the first place. Yes, along the way the relevant SAF elements have been exposed for some very sloppy SOPs, &amp; that's not the court's business per se.<br><br>Thus far it appeared the disciplinary actions extended only to the CDO Formation, with its senior commanders taking the fall. It's everyone's perogative on whether to view the careers of Desmond Kuek &amp; Ng Yat Chung as tainted. But I think it's very lucky that the other CST course trainers weren't hauled to military court for their illegal actions, even as the civilian law didn't touch them for directly victimizing Hu &amp; Ho.</div>

They are nowhere near the court. And you really trust court proceedings too much. IF you are NOT in the know, you are NOT in the know. And do think about it. How do you instigate something that is part of the training program? Instigation implies the act of something that is not normally carried out, and a spur of the moment act. Unfortunately EVERYONE, including yourself I am sure, knows that dunking has been part of the program for years, although unofficial, and that it is very much planned as a part of the training. So pray tell me, how do you "instigate" a training program to happen? Do you seriously think you can say your BMT Plt Sgt instigated you to do SOC training or swimming lessons? DUH.</div>

Heng's a friend of Sgt Hu's, and I'm a friend of Pandiaraj's, and Moxie here has managed to get offside with both of us by putting his mouth in fifth while his brain's in neutral.<br><br>Let's hear it for Moxie and his talent for making an all-aspect ass of himself! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">then let me answer this. That is because 2SG Hu knows exactly who the ones who dunked him are. They are nowhere near the court. And you really trust court proceedings too much. IF you are NOT in the know, you are NOT in the know. And do think about it. How do you instigate something that is part of the training program? Instigation implies the act of something that is not normally carried out, and a spur of the moment act. Unfortunately EVERYONE, including yourself I am sure, knows that dunking has been part of the program for years, although unofficial, and that it is very much planned as a part of the training. So pray tell me, how do you "instigate" a training program to happen? Do you seriously think you can say your BMT Plt Sgt instigated you to do SOC training or swimming lessons? DUH.</div></blockquote>This is very interesting.So who are the ones who dunked 2SG Hu?And it is a very serious thing if scapegoats were named for any reason because it is a lie of the tallest order.</div>
