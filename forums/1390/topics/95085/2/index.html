POW training is meant to give the trainees an idea of what a real life POW situation is like, not for any of the instructors to abuse their powers. That they could get carried away showed how unprofessional they were about it.<br><br>A real pro would certainly conduct the training, for the sake of the trainees, but he would certainly abhorr it. Nontheless, as a professional, he'll carry out the training, but with an eye towards the trainees' wellbeing. like i said, in this case the instructors were clearly very unprofessional about their job. therein, lies the problem.</div>

What is the more probable training "simulation"?<br><br>I'm not saying that its right to dunk their heads in. But i'm just saying that blaming those instructors for the training: Do u think they invented this method of training (dunking)?
