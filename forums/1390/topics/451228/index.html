              <p>My cousin has epilepsy and is an NSF clerk. He scored 5 As for his A 
              Levels and enthusiastically handles the most intellectually challenging 
              tasks. However, several ITE gangsters from his unit discovered what 
              causes his fits and are intentionally triggering them. His epilepsy is 
              getting worse.<br><br>My classmate has an autistic brother who also did 
              well for his A Levels and was looking forward to being an NSF clerk, 
              believing the experience would prepare him for the real world. The poor 
              guy is being physically assaulted by ITE gangsters in his unit, to the 
              extent that he became suicidal and, from what I heard, even talked about
               getting a gun to shoot his tormentors.</p>
              <p>As a girl with a severe 
              physical disability, who never faced such horrible bullying while in JC,
               I am relieved that I need not serve NS. I will not disclose excessive 
              details, as I do not wish to get myself or cousin into trouble. 
              Nevertheless, I am very concerned for cousin and other NSFs with special
               needs who are bullied by ITE gangsters. Does anyone know of similar 
              cases?</p>
              <p>What are the proper channels for dealing with such 
              bullying cases? How can victims improve their chances of getting quality
               help through the proper channels, which may be difficult for people 
              with special needs? For example, conditions like autism cause 
              communication difficulties, while cousin is afraid that he may be 
              discharged and NUS would thus not accept him.</p>

              <p>Bullying cases do happen in military environment. I heard of several other cases through different forums too. It does not limit to ITE gangsters. There're also diploma and A levels graduates who does such things. People with special needs are often mistreated due to lack of awareness among superiors &amp; subordinates.</p>
              <p>I still feel that military environment are not meant for people with severe conditions. The military culture itself is different from the civilian world. They may survive as civilian clerk but not as military clerk. I know because I've very severe condition (prefer not disclose which condition) that made me disfunctional in military but able to study and functional in some other environments.</p>
              <p>About your autism friend's brother, tell him not to be afraid to be discharged if he is given the choice. Try to tell him not to force himself because it'll only worsen his state and chances of becoming extreme. Getting discharged or medically exempted won't affect the chances of enrolling into local uni. I know this because there're people exempted from either physical or mental reasons had already enrolled into local uni. People with autism are especially welcome in uni because aspergers have naturally high IQ. Fyi, Einstein has autism too.</p>
              <p>One thing about asperger syndrome is that they may become disfunctional / worsened in certain environments which have heavy peer pressure, controlled, bounded &amp; strict rules. Sometimes, it's better to gain experience in environments that suit his needs elsewhere if he wants to prepare for the real world. There're many paths. Military environment may not be meant for him.</p>

              <p>This sentence is true, but this can only be applied for healthy and normal people who have that function to actually do something for himself. Mental disorders/syndromes like mild autism have lower adaptivity level and higher sensitivity level than average humans. They have have less functions in relating to another. Thus, making them more vunerable towards these situations.</p>
              <p>Many bullies pick out people who're naturally different from them. Bullies tend to harm another in order to destress themselves. Some seek personal pleasure from causing harm to another. This is why I mentioned that it's the culture in the environment. These victims are different not because they chose to be. They're born to be one. It's their differences from people that made them easy targets for bullying. This is why people with special needs are prone to situations like these.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the helpful replies. I will forward

              <p>Two
               people with special needs are facing severe bullying. One wants to get a
               gun to shoot his tormentors (the opposite of being a wimp). Instead of 
              giving constructive advice, you are defending ITE students. Cousin said 
              his bullies are from ITE and as a clerk, he probably has access to their
               records.</p>

              <p>As for communication difficulties, he can ask a family member to help present his case. They'll understand because they know some ns guys have social impaired conditions like this.

              <p>you know what? you are doing the same thing as the bullies. stereotyping that all gansters comes from ITE and thinking your cousin is above them because of his results.</p>
              <p>yup, this is the real world. a harsher world. you are weak, you get push down by the strongest. there's no place for you in a highly competive society. </p>
              <p>Sucidal? Is he going to murder-sucide? Like a shooting everyone then killing himself? Nah, given his current case, I think he will go and die quietly.</p>

              <p>This is my previous topic. I was bullied by my classmates, all i know is that why am i so stupid and why excessively seeking acceptance from them. I don't need friends/classmates like them. i am in a much better envoirment now, and please, i was from the top 3 class then, smart doesn't mean the people don't bully/discriminate you.</p>

              <p>Cousin has reported the bullying to his superiors. They look strict, but they turned out to be very supportive, especially since he works hard and is the only clerk handling certain intellectually challenging tasks. His unit is investigating the case. He has been informed that he will not be discharged and that intentionally triggering epileptic fits could be considered assault or even attempted murder. Classmate has not updated me on her autistic brother.</p>
              <p>Thanks for much, OranDe, for the helpful advice. Eac too. To the rest, I guess most of you condone bullying and/or are prejudiced against people with physical disabilities and special needs. People who get over their prejudice and get to know my epileptic cousin and my classmate's autistic brother describe them as talented and hardworking, with amazing character. If they were not bullied and discriminated throughout their lives, they would have bright futures ahead of them. I was also assaulted by an ITE gangster when I was younger and faced discrimination when seeking a part-time job to finance my university education. Employers would prefer able-bodied local ITE students over me (I only applied for jobs that I would be able to do despite my disability). I finally found a job, emerged as a top performer and just got promoted. Just trying to raise awareness of physical disabilities and special needs, as well as bullying in NS.</p>
