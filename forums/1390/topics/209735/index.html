            <div class='col-md body'>a brief highlights on what they actually do in SOF. they run like no1's business along changi beach, they do physical training like no1's business in CDO camp.

On and off they will carry the rubber boat and run from in camp compounds to outside of the camp and usually wun come back for the next 2-3 hours. the SOFs i've seen are all bulky in size. they have a very very very very nice armskote which i dreamt of working in when i was in CDO camp. once u are an SOF member, ppl in CDO camp will see u as some1 much superior than they are.<br><br>i hardly see any lobo time for them except for meal times. and yes u have to be a regular to join them.<br><br>If u are realli interested to go for the selection and wana know how's the trial like.
