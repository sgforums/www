              <p>Hi all</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sorry to vent this here. Kinda pissed off with SAF. This is my 1st ICT call up after like 12 years?!?!?! Nevermind. I was subsequently downgraded to C2L9 and was excused from outfield. I was also told that I will be assigned aministrative duties. However, given my work committment, I rather stay at work and do my job! afterall whether I do admin work in camp or perform my work duties, I am still get the same pay! In fact, I am paying taxes of about S$8k a year so you can probably calculate my pay backwards. Isn't SAF wasting $ to get me back to perform admin duties when they can get 3 - 4 temp staff to do the same job??? I mean i have appealed 3 times but to no avail. anyone has same frustration?</p>
              <p>Sorry i dun mean to boast my pay here or wat and I understand the onus of every citizen to perform their NS obligations. but it just does not make sense to get someone back to do admin duties.</p>

              <p>Well I can only said too bad...u got called back after 12 years,  as for is there a cap ceiling some said yes some said no. I think it's just whether do they need you at the moment of time.  As for u paying $8K tax a year, I'm sure some of those doctors pay more that date also they go back work like a GP. I can only said some enjoy ICT as it's a break from work, some grumble all the way.....</p>

              <p>ah....the argument is security problem. Also what about those partners in big accounting firm or lawyers in some big law firm? Those also earn quite a lot of $$$, so stop grumbling and go do your ICT, take it as if you on holidays for couple of weeks.</p>

              <p>That why every1 is complaining. Some idiot on the top wants to make it fair to call every1 back to serve the nation. This is to be fair to every1. But SAF do not realise that SAF is wasting people's time and tax payers' money. </p>
              <p>The unit knows that they are wasting their money, to call the men back, to do nothing. Yet they still have to call his men back to waste time. The goverment is crazy. </p>

              <p>WE ARE PAYING TAX TO let SAF to do stupid things. A person like this will cost $4k for 2 weeks from the mindef budget. This person is just doing nothing for 2 weeks. The accounting is wrong.  </p>
              <p>We should cut the SAF budget by 80% to stop SAF from doing stupid things. Then we can have more Tax Relief. This makes it happlier for every1.</p>
              <p>There are many people who are being called up by the SAF every year. This is just to fufill their ICT requirements. They do nothing during that ICT period. Just for show. </p>
