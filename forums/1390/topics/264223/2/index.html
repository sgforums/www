He was my company 2I/C, and with absolutly no intent to slander the man (I'm still on speaking terms with him), I do see their point.<br><br>Phillip Lim is without a doubt an intelligent and diligent man, but I'd be hard pressed to call him a leader in the true sense of the word.  He endeavoured to institute an atmosphere of professionalism amongst the men (he was responsible for my company doing 25 rehearsals before exercises), but he failed to understand the social mechanism of the company - put simply, he had a talent for getting on people's nerves.  As a measure of his level of engagement with them men, by the time I ROD'd there were only a handful of men in the company who would talk to him when it was not absolutely necessary.<br><br>I have heard accounts of him failing missions during one of his courses, but I'll take pains to say that these accounts are unsubstantiated.  What I will say is that even in a unit that engenders high levels of individualism, he was an outsider.<br><br>To be candid, he a nice enough fellow, and sure enough he was earnest, but some days he simply wasn't very bright, and he did succumb to pressure.  Case in point:<br><br>We were on a BTEC exercise against a Guards unit, 1 Guards if I recall correctly.  Mind you, since we were the OPFOR, there wasn't even all that much pressure.  I was within earshot of the HQ team, and Phillip and the OC were stomping about, getting their knickers in a twist because they couldn't get our recce teams on the net.  I suggested that perhaps the Guards had managed to find the frequency we were using, and had kept the transmit key  on, so that the simplex system was jammed.  We switched freqs and got our teams back on line.  Now for God's sake, I was a demo man, not a signaller, and still they couldn't figure it out before I did - it's even worse considering that Phillip has a Master's in Engineering at Manchester University if I recall correctly.<br><br>Phillip's a scholar and attended Sandhurst.  He's gone for COCC and has done a rotation with the US  Special Forces.  That said, while I'm glad that we've finally gotten our first one-star, I can easily name quite a few other Commando officers who I would have preferred to have gotten there first.</div>
