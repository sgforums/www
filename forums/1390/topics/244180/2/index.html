            <div class='col-md body'>I agree. Don't sign on for the money, sign on only if you're passionate about it. This applies for any other aspects of your life. Far too many ppl sign on for the money only to regret it cause they find that the environment is not suitable for them. They quit before serving finish their contract, thus no lump sum. That's BAD. A waste of your fugging time.<br><br>SAF organisational and promotional structure sucks la... For instance, they don't give you enough time to see if you're officer material. Just after nine weeks, they condemn you to eternal non-officership. That's just retarded. nine weeks of BMT can't prove anything.<br><br>It's not a good place to work so pls don't sign on unless you really really really love the SAF. And if you really really really love the SAF stay away from Army nonetheless. Navy and Air Force is way better...<br><br>Now we shoudn't always listen to cabbies, on the other hand... They're cab talk is only for entertainment haha. Once a cab driver told me his epic love story and how its ok to rip apart a happy family if you love that girl. JUST GO GET HER MAN!

            <div class='col-md body'>Think about it this way.  If you don't sign on, u probably wont have to worry about regretting it.   If u sign on, you have to worry about regretting it.<br><br>Which one saves u trouble?<br><br>The most important question one should ask yourself is, "What do you see yourself doing 10 years down the road?" Or what do you WANT to see yourself doing 10 years down the road.<br><br>Still doing ground work?  Be in middle management? Or climb to higher management? Or sit at home earn passive income?  Does the SAF advancement structure, rewards and renumeration help you to realize these?<br><br>If not, why bother?<br><br>Uncle Cabbie is probably quite sad about what happened to him.  And rightly so.  However, what is to say he would not have encountered the same situation working in the private sector?  Would private sector companies not reduce his pension?<br><br>The only problem with what happened to him was that he came out of the SAF with LIMITED skills.  He was a naval diver, and now can only be a dRiver cos he didn't upgrade himself with more private sector relevant skills. "Self-acclaimed" management skills are a dime a dozen for those coming out of the force.  Even the employers are smart to realize that officers and specs leaving the force are not necessarily good managers to begin with in the first place. Why? Cos too many lousy ones have spoiled the market already.<br><br>So if you are regular, please take time to think of how to upgrade yourself.  Take certifications on networking or whatever u enjoy.  Be prepared for whatever unforeseen circumstances that may arise and jeopardise ur career in the SAF.  Besides, if SAF are indeed teaching right, you'd have already been cultured to think that way already.<br><br>My 2cts.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know during BMT they make signing on sound so good and everything sweet sugar and honey. Like its golden path to life. For my batch, we just took all those recruitment talk as sleeping session. The only ones who actually signed on were the ones who got the scholarships and I don't mean the lame LSE ones.<br><br>Think we all agree that unless you are under SAFMS, SAFOS or a pilot (still need a  uni degree), Don't even think about it.<br>If you are really patriotic and really really want to sign on, do so at least as an officer. (Heard you need to be a uni grad to sign on as an officer anyway).<br><br>To sign on as a spec is really a bad choice to say the least. If you don't give you PP2, then its you jobless at 28 without really decent qualifications and skills worth nothing.<br><br>When I see all those JPSDS scheme, I think what a scam it is. Those young guys haven't been through NS and they are being conned into signing something that they have only seen on TV.</div>
