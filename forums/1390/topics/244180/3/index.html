Like its golden path to life. For my batch, we just took all those recruitment talk as sleeping session. The only ones who actually signed on were the ones who got the scholarships and I don't mean the lame LSE ones.<br><br>Think we all agree that unless you are under SAFMS, SAFOS or a pilot (still need a  uni degree), Don't even think about it.<br>If you are really patriotic and really really want to sign on, do so at least as an officer. (Heard you need to be a uni grad to sign on as an officer anyway).<br><br>To sign on as a spec is really a bad choice to say the least. If you don't give you PP2, then its you jobless at 28 without really decent qualifications and skills worth nothing.<br><br>When I see all those JPSDS scheme, I think what a scam it is. Those young guys haven't been through NS and they are being conned into signing something that they have only seen on TV.</div></blockquote>a LSE on-campus degree is quite well sought after and recognised, just for info.<br>As to distance-learning degree under 'academic direction of LSE' that kind of degree needs more time to be developed. Till date it is still not highly recognised. Give it some time?<br><br>In any case, for those who sign on the schemes in poly or ITE... they might be very attracted to the 'monthly allowance and other goodies'... which could be at that point in time useful to finance their education. Some people actually sign on because it was a path for them as they are financially-disadvantaged.<br><br>However, I do caution against such narrow-minded thinking. It is true as a spec you don't get skills very relevant in the workforce should you wish to leave ( before or after PP2). With the current issue of 'too mant WOs, too little positions' it goes to show the SAF as a whole is still doing mass recruitment only to leave out some senior specs later in life. And these poor people, having served the force for some time ( some even 15 years or more) are told to pack their bags and perhaps given a gratuity of let's say 67K? Some even less than that. And seriously... I wonder does the SAF even think about these people's future. Idealistic i agree, but should the SAF only concern itself only with the SAFOS and SMS scholars? What about the backbone of the SAF.. the WOSPE Corps?<br><br>Detractors would argue that much has been done to elevate the staus of the WOSPEC or WOSA(Airforce). But with so much statistics to prove the SAF is 'dumping' it's middle managment... we really must think thrice before signing on your youth to the Armed Forces. Afterall, the Army is known as the decisive force.... decisive indeed.</div>

There are good advices and bad advices. The example that you gave, cabby ask you go die is a horrid example. People have common sense. Common sense tells you that your life is not something to be taken lightly.<br><br>However common sense does not tell you what the Army is actually like, the media portrays the army in a positive light, so the TS has a right to know the negative side of the army that is not portrayed in the media.<br><br>Once he knows both sides of the story will he be able to make an INFORMED decision.<br><br>A general needs intelligence too. He needs to know the IDENTITY, the POSITION, the COMPOSITION, the DEFENCES, the STRENGHT of his opponents. He who charges in blindly is the real fool.</div>
