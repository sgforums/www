              forced army atheletic remedial trainingson reservists are stupid.since u are werking in a factory that runs 365 days a year and 24hrs at 7 days a week and never ever shuts down!if soldiers i suggest the army go recruit soldiers n pay them to be fit soldiers.
              
              The south korean reservists who are still technically at war with north korea dont make their reservist pass their IPPT or remedial trainings every year.its voluntarily and no fines or discpline actions.
              
              the israel army that lives in a virtual war zone daily doesnt even need much reservist citizen soldiers who can pass their ippt and no army forced remedial trainings even!!!
              when the soldier fails his ippt his commander just simply says "u can do better."end of story!no remedial trainings and seems like forgotten even!
              
              so what is this army remedial atheletic fitness training doing in a civilian production line make american or japanese products?and where the civilian reservist is programming computers?do u really  need a dumb ippt or athletic trainings ?u need  mind and concentration to design n fix programs and run n blow yer mind off by running and jumping and goin to some army camp!!!!every minute counts..!like as if we are at war and we are living in warzones where ennemy soldiers are spotted across yer land everyday!

              the reservist shouldnt be subjected to remedial trainings for atheletes.not only is it inhuman its also unnecessary!
              
              let it be made voluntary for really fit people and not forced on all damn busy folks like me back in singapore!!!not everyone one is born an athelete and can grow muscles on head easily!
              
              i have my own busineess n future  to setup and i have to werk in spore too for big time highly advanced production lines!
              
              this oppressive tool called army remedial trainings kills people!the normal resservist training where u go back n dig a few foxholes and run up the hill is fine for 1 mth to me.
              
              however this remeidal training goes on every week till age of 40 or so!!!!every day is like hell in spore and i have to juggle it with work at factory,business setup,upgrading,family....etc etc.
              
              this remedial training by spore army gives me no time to even do a decent meditating.
              
              u tell me which country on this planet does a forced remedial trainings for their army fitness exams on civilians who have no military affiliations and  where they actually get fined heavily n sent to jail even!

              ditzy,
              
              i want ippt n remedial trainings to be removed for reservists only.
              
              that way civilian reservists yung n old can concentrate on skills upgrading,werking n meeting production figures every hour,inventions,patenting,designing machines,build companies and make more new companies n new products for spores global future.
              
              not squander time n limited resources on ipt,remedial trainings....ippt or goto jail kinda scenario!!!

              <p>I sense a certain self, and selfish interest in this guy's suggestion.</p>
              <p>Then when you go ICT, you can ride one man per APC, weight and space restrictions. lol</p>
              <p>Be serious, IPPT is probably the only exercise you get in working life. It sure is with mine. You're not the only one doing RT you know. You're just the only person whining about it and wanting to vote governments based on your exercise schedule.</p>
              <p>"spores global future"</p>
              <p>Fungal culture? :P</p>
              <p>On 2nd thought, this guy needs time off to go back to primary school to relearn spelling. And forum ethic. Bad spelling is a minor no-no.</p>
