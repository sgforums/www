Most of ppl in the camp dun like my fren and the other mess boys, cos they really slack.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well i never managed to find this news on strait times nor lian her zao bao.<br><br>Not all drivers are slack lah... i dun deny some are quite slack with simple jobs loh. Depends on unit lah. If its a operational one ... den mite have more things to do ... more drivings to be done loh... esp during exercise period.<br><br>Service drivers in comparsion should be more slack lah but some service drivers are siong also... for eg drivers in the navy... they arent slack wor... Though it is a stay out unit... most of the time drivers have to do various forms of duty and details which can stretch over the 5 pm secure time or even do till 10plus loh. Fetching vips...doing ammo details... going for range....exercise... transporting reservice personnel during in camp training... and many more lah.<br><br>If the unit's driver strength is considered healthy in comparsion with the number of details it handle on average... den drivers will be okie. If over healthy... meaning too many drivers.. den maybe slack loh but slacking isnt that good... cos ur 7000 mite not be able to reach wor. Everyone will be snatching details haha.. cos no 7000 no conversion loh. If the strength is unhealthy... den drivers have to suffer a bit more liao... workload distribution increases mah.<br><br>I think SAF should upgrade the driver image loh. And also give driver more welfare. INstalling radios and aircon arent gonna take SAF a huge sum of money loh. Replacing old vehicles as well cos SAF buy vehicles without tax and coe.. freaking cheap. I know some units are in the transition of changing new vehicles but what about the rest? Cant they just buy more and make the transtion faster? Drivers in the 21st century should not be seen as slackers lah or a vocation which can easily go DB. Drivers should be seen as professional, skillful, presentable, able to operate a whole range of vehicles.<br><br>Hrmm whether if a driver go DB aft an accident can be determine by many many factors... the most impt one is the unit and also his superior... be it his OC or MTO. If the accident arent too serious... and also his superior is able to justify and fight for him... less likely he will go DB most prob only end up getting a fine. Driver's overall performance and conduct also plays a part loh... if he's been all along a good driver.. no disciplinary probs ... his superior will be more den willing to fight the case for him to lower down his punishment. If he is sucky... everytime late.. give prob..den the superior is more den happy to see him go in and squat and be a better man aft he is released.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br>But still SAF should do something to the transport system and also the driver image.</div>
