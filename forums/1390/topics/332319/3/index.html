              <p>You sound drunk. Drinking in the day is not the answer when you are jobless and alone in SG away from your family in your M'sian slum. How about going home to your stupid country Malaysia where your politicians sodomise each other and your country is a piece of $hit haha. I know who you are.</p>
              <p>Errr what job? I do not need to work. Guys, this is the poor dumb Malaysian bitch who had to leave her family and deadbeat hometown to work cos there are no jobs there and the scant ones there pay her less than 1/2 of what she gets here even though she's just a blue collar, daily wage worker here.</p>
              <p>Worse, she then comes here proclaiming to be superior to Singapore males and "says no woman would date any person who spent any time in SAF". What a downtrodden sore loser. Typical of Msians! She indeed follows the lead of her sore loser leaders who are well known to be sore about Singapore outstripping their dumb country since the 80s! Dumb Msians! The worst run country in the world made of 100% retards and fools. And she calls herself "superior foreigners"...she who had to leave her stupid 3rd world slum to go to a foreign land to find work. Just like those PRCs prostitutes and study mamas here.</p>
              <p><strong>Stupid Malaysian </strong><strong>crackwhore </strong><strong>saying "we foreigners shaft you up the ass"..the gall and audacity and shamelessness!</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Haha not as if you're a foreigner from a <span style="color: #ff0000;">1st world country like us</span> like Japanese or American.. you're a 3rd world foreigner, just like the Bangla workers we look upon in disdain that Serangoon Garden residents refuse to live close to.

              <p>I'm not interested in politics or becoming a politician so I won't run for politics. I don't have to be a politician to hold the view that there are some deadbeats in this country that expect the govt to be their nanny and pimp.  One only needs to open his/her eyes haha!  In fact my views mean I don't care for the deadbeats which would be contrary to someone interested in political office.</p>
              <p>I just read in my morning paper today while taking my breakfast in leisure the letter of an Singaporean like me who's amused that there are people who blame the govt for their own investments gone wrong. It's so funny!</p>

              <p>Quote Mr Teo Eng Kiat who wrote to My Paper "I HAVE been amused by comments on forums about investors asking the Government for help with their failed investments."</p>
              <p>The people who run for political office and do their rounds and walkabouts mean they care about the deadbeats. What a waste of time.</p>
