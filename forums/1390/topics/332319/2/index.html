              <p>DBS is a commercial entity. Not a charity or govt organisation (though some dreamers are in dreamland and dream that GLCs are govt handouts). The ONLY reason DBS approved the HK thing is because the sums are much smaller to the point of negligible. It's nothing more than a commercial, business, calculated decision. The reason why these whiners can't accept it is because they still view DBS as their neighbourhood residents' committee centre and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">think DBS owes Singaporeans a living</span> beyond functioning as a commercial entity.</p>
              <p>Look, I took up a home loan NOT with DBS but with Maybank at first cos it gave me the best rates then. Why did I not support DBS even though it's a Singapore company and I am a Singaporean? Simply cos banks are now commercial entities and I'm aware of that and am at peace with it. Did DBS badger Singaporeans to support them over foreign banks?? They surely did not. My spouse stopped crediting salary into DBS account some time ago because we set up a Citibank account that gave us slightly higher saving interest. After my lock-in period ended for my home loan, I immediately shopped for a new one and found DBS to give me the most attractive rates in a promotion they had. Then we jumped to DBS from Maybank.</p>
              <p>Banks in Singapore, with the exception of POSB that is still positioning itself to be a national-interest bank, function as 100% commercial entities and made no bones about it. No Singapore bank has ever hidden that fact or tried to communicate otherwise.No Singapore bank including DBS has ever coerced, pressured or pointed a gun to any Singaporean's head to make them give DBS any business on the account of citizenship, patriotism or any sort. DBS, like UOB and OCBC are fully commercialised and DBS never portrayed itself in any other way. I'd like to tell me when DBS ever played the nationalism card on Singaporeans.They never did. Neither did any of the other local commercial banks or companies.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans I know around me all shop for banking services based on the best deal they find. if it's a foreign bank they dun care also. Yet when push comes to shove, as usual Singaporeans many of them being deadbeats and losers cry the nationalism card on DBS.</p>
              <p>Singaporean crybabies, whiners &amp; deadbeats should stop expecting everyone to nanny them. They should stop looking for elsewhere to blame when they get into fixes and when failing to find an immediate blame-target, they blame the government.</p>
              <p>I wonder what caused this weird syndrome in many Singaporeans and this reliance on the state and the tendency to blame others or be spoonfed or nannied. I have not seen it in any other citizens of any country in my interactions with others from many countries whenever I go overseas with my spouse for work. It is totally disgraceful.</p>
              <p> I hope any Singaporean still living in dreamland take the time to reflect on this. Look at yourself in the mirror first before thinking of blaming others. And when they find no one to blame, they blame the govt. So disgraceful.</p>
              <p>The most amusing thing is how so many of these losers say they want to leave the country. I'll be laughing my ass off cos I know the foreigners will be appalled and laughing at them when they resettle anywhere else in the world with their deadbeat and give-me-handouts-the-state-owes-a-living attitude.</p>
              <p>As a Singaporean, i fully support and encourage these Singapore deadwoods to leave Singapore for a better future for myself. Good riddance to rotten trash.</p>

                  handouts). The ONLY reason DBS approved the HK thing is because the
                  sums are much smaller to the point of negligible. It's nothing more
                  than a commercial, business, calculated decision. The reason why
                  these whiners can't accept it is because they still view DBS as
                  their neighbourhood residents' committee centre and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">think DBS owes Singaporeans a
                  living</span> beyond functioning as a commercial entity.</p>
              <p>Look, I took up a home loan NOT with DBS but with Maybank at
                  first cos it gave me the best rates then. Why did I not support DBS
                  even though it's a Singapore company and I am a Singaporean? Simply
                  cos banks are now commercial entities and I'm aware of that and am
                  at peace with it. Did DBS badger Singaporeans to support them over
                  foreign banks?? They surely did not. My spouse stopped crediting
                  salary into DBS account some time ago because we set up a Citibank
                  account that gave us slightly higher saving interest. After my
                  lock-in period ended for my home loan, I immediately shopped for a
                  new one and found DBS to give me the most attractive rates in a
                  promotion they had. Then we jumped to DBS from Maybank.</p>
              <p>Banks in Singapore, with the exception of POSB that is still
                  positioning itself to be a national-interest bank, function as 100%
                  commercial entities and made no bones about it. No Singapore bank
                  has ever hidden that fact or tried to communicate otherwise.No
                  Singapore bank including DBS has ever coerced, pressured or pointed
                  a gun to any Singaporean's head to make them give DBS any business
                  on the account of citizenship, patriotism or any sort. DBS, like
                  UOB and OCBC are fully commercialised and DBS never portrayed
                  itself in any other way. I'd like to tell me when DBS ever played
                  the nationalism card on Singaporeans.They never did. Neither did
                  any of the other local commercial banks or companies.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans I know around me all shop for banking services
                  based on the best deal they find. if it's a foreign bank they dun
                  care also. Yet when push comes to shove, as usual Singaporeans many
                  of them being deadbeats and losers cry the nationalism card on
                  DBS.</p>
              <p>Singaporean crybabies, whiners &amp; deadbeats should stop
                  expecting everyone to nanny them. They should stop looking for
                  elsewhere to blame when they get into fixes and when failing to
                  find an immediate blame-target, they blame the government.</p>
              <p>I wonder what caused this weird syndrome in many Singaporeans
                  and this reliance on the state and the tendency to blame others or
                  be spoonfed or nannied. I have not seen it in any other citizens of
                  any country in my interactions with others from many countries
                  whenever I go overseas with my spouse for work. It is totally
                  disgraceful.</p>
              <p> I hope any Singaporean still living in dreamland take the
                  time to reflect on this. Look at yourself in the mirror first
                  before thinking of blaming others. And when they find no one to
                  blame, they blame the govt. So disgraceful.</p>
              <p>The most amusing thing is how so many of these losers say they
                  want to leave the country. I'll be laughing my ass off cos I know
                  the foreigners will be appalled and laughing at them when they
                  resettle anywhere else in the world with their deadbeat and
                  give-me-handouts-the-state-owes-a-living attitude.</p>
              <p>As a Singaporean, i fully support and encourage these Singapore
                  deadwoods to leave Singapore for a better future for myself. Good
                  riddance to rotten trash.</p>

              <p>Wow, how much weed were you smoking? Did you ever realise that taking drugs is a punishable offence in Singapore? Have fun dreaming your delusions of grandeur in rehab.</p>
              <p>While you are happily wishing Singaporeans to leave the country to leave a better life for you, little do you realise that your job will vanish in less than 5 years, and the only way you can earn enough to support yourself is by prostituting yourself to the superior foreigners. If you're a male, you can about just commit suicide. Foreign chicks would rather drink acid than ever bang you lousy asian sinkies. You will never know that the reason for your failure is your supposedly 'better' genes. No woman worth her vagoo will ever date any loser who had ever spent any time in the SAF.</p>
