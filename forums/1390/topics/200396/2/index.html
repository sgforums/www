            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway your QM cannot charge you for obeying a higher command's orders and the last order received has precedence so there was no grounds to charge you in the first place. If he had charged and your S4 agreed to charge then surely kena slapped by Mindef Legal Services.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now listen to my long story,thanks...<br><br>I enlisted in Dec 98,I got OOC from BMT due to stress fracture of my shin.So I got posted to OETI as an weapon technician. After passing out,I was posted to a stay out reservist arty unit.Life was good. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>By the way,during this time,you needed to attend 2 courses at OETI to get your 3SG rank.The "25" course to get your CPL rank,the "45" course to get your 3SG rank-and this was usually held a few months before your ORD.<br><br>So I was in arty for around 11 months before I went for Enhanced BMT recourse(together with recruits) in Apr 2000.Well I didnt clear this BMT again because my old injury flared up.YES,I didnt clear BMT 2 times!So I got a new posting to a siong SIR unit.This was in mid June 2000.Once I got to SIR,I hung around for a few days then I started clearing leave liao.Coz in July,I would be disrupted to study in NUS.<br><br>So 4 years ogling at NUS Arts gals passed by very fast...Soon it was time to re-enlist in June 2004 with 11 months liability left. I was back to my SIR unit. At SIR,I was surplus to requirements coz there were already 3 guys there.So I did all kinds of sai kang lor...<br><br>Now the promotion system for weapon technicians has changed liao.You just need to attend 1 course to become 3SG.Remember I was from the old system.So I requested to attend the course again.The manpower side dilly dally,I also not very persistent la.Then I got got another BMT recourse posting! This course was scheduled for Jan 2005.<br><br>Once I heard of the BMT posting,I told myself no way am I going for that...Past few months,I had been having skin rashes so I decided to see a specialist at the Skin Centre.I got 1 month excuse from there and I showed the letter to my sibei guai lan camp MO.This was at the end of Nov 2005.<br><br>The medical board which downgraded me was on the Fri before the Dec OETI course was supposed to start.To make clearer...let me check the calender of 2004 again.<br><br>I got my medical board on 10 Dec 2004.The OETI course was scheduled to start on 13 Dec 2004. On 10 Dec afternoon,I was on a day off when a manpower clerk called me to say I had been downgraded in the morning,so the BMT recourse was off and I must go to OETI on Mon.I was surprised,but what a nice surprise. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>So I went for the course lor...then all the stuff which I mentioned in the opening post happened.<br><br></div>
