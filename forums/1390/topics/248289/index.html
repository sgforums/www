The fella who crafted this policy didn't take into account that tech specs play an important role in a battalion orbat, and they require their 3SG rank to carry out certain duties without being hindered.<br><br>I don't believe a CFC can sign for a weapon fit-for-firing cert.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
