              <p>hi</p>
              <p>just thinking, i'm suspicious that i have asthma - i went for a run yesterday and i felt like a congestion in my chest like i couldnt draw a full breath. Also my brother and father were both athsmatics. im really worried that i will be to. i went to the doctor but he is convinced i dont have it. i dont believe him. Im really worried as  if i have asthma in NS i'll be sidelined to like a desk job but i really want to try out for guards or commandos. im alright if im just not good enough to make the grade mentally but i'll be pissed if i can't even have a shot at making it JUST becuase of my medical.</p>
              <p>if i believe my doctor and i DONT have asthma, any tips on how not to get it as i have a big family history of asthma.</p>
              <p>Any thoughts/ advice?</p>
              <p>THanks</p>

              <p>Same advice that I give to ALL chiong sua wannabes:</p>
              <p>Personal health and wellbeing must always take precedence over personal glory.</p>
              <p>If your personal pride and glory is solely defined by the vocation that you are in, then you honestly do NOT belong to that vocation. The very fact that you're 'pissed' over the fact that your medical condition may dictate your vocation really says a lot. </p>
              <p>That said, like everyone else said here, if your doctor has already ruled out asthma, then that is most probably not the reason. Most probably you're just out of shape and your lungs just couldn't take the strain after your rushed things too soon.</p>

              <p>hey, who says its my fitness? oh yeh, the first post ask me is it too long no excersise? before i can answer, people are already CONFIRMNG it is my fitness. it is not. i reguarly excersise and im as fittier than i'll probably ever be. so i dont think its fitness.</p>
              <p>Fudgster, how the hell do you get the idea that all i want in the guards or something is just for glory?what if its just for myself i just want to do someting just a bit more in NS? to try out for the best? so you automatically assume that im just wanting to show off? so everybody who aspires for the special forces is just to show off?</p>
              <p>Anyway, why cant you take pride in your vocation? what if you are proud of what you do? doesnt that motivate you to a higher level? I think if you take pride in your vocation you DO belong there as it shows you care and are willing to do well.</p>
              <p>The very fact that im pissed over the fact my medical condition (if i have one really) if that says alot, why dont you tell me what it says? i'll explain my 'pissed' off to you. maybe pissed off is to harsh. i mean to say , well i hope to try get into special forces right? im alright if they dont want me cause im not good enough - thanks for trying. but i think it would really suck if im not good enough BEFORE i even get a chance to try out ei: a medical condition which DQ me. ok?</p>
              <p>Im not convinced about the doctor becuase when i asked him, he like paused for 2 seconds then was like "nah, you dont have asthma, no worries" and walks off.</p>

              <p>Okay, then.</p>
              <p>What I say still stands - push yourself, but within reasonable limits for health and wellness.</p>
              <p>Also, there is absolutely no reason to get pissed over a medical condition. Like you yourself said, whatever vocation it is that you get posted to, accept it, and do it to the best of your abilities. That is closer to glory. All I'm saying is, glory need not only be found in the guards and commandos formations. </p>
              <p>Also, the doctor's hesitation means nothing - all it may mean is that he was pondering over your symptoms and figuring out whether or not asthma could be the cause. Come on, do you really want him to make a snap judgement in less than two seconds only to be proven wrong later on?</p>
              <p>If you are still not convinced by the doctor's assessment, then get a second opinion.</p>
              <p>And please, give this second doctor more than two seconds to think.</p>

              <p>hi</p>
              <p>just thinking, i'm suspicious that i have asthma - i went for a run yesterday and i felt like a congestion in my chest like i couldnt draw a full breath. Also my brother and father were both athsmatics. im really worried that i will be to. i went to the doctor but he is convinced i dont have it. i dont believe him. Im really worried as  if i have asthma in NS i'll be sidelined to like a desk job but i really want to try out for guards or commandos. im alright if im just not good enough to make the grade mentally but i'll be pissed if i can't even have a shot at making it JUST becuase of my medical.</p>
              <p>if i believe my doctor and i DONT have asthma, any tips on how not to get it as i have a big family history of asthma.</p>
              <p>Any thoughts/ advice?</p>
              <p>THanks</p>

              <p>1) If you're out of breath when running, chances are that you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span> out of shape.  Either that or you're trying to sprint a 2.4.<br>2) Would you rather be out of shape or asthmatic?<br>3) If this is as fit as you're going to get, you're up the creek as far as maing it to the beret goes, aren't you?</p>

              <p>Just don't think too much about it and the pain will go away. If you constantly worry about the pain, wondering if you have heart problems and such,  the pain will be a psychological pain.. it will always be there.</p>
