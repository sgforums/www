              <p>Hi, I am currently doing my foundation term (aka BSLC) in SCS now and have only 2 weeks left before posting out to my vocational training. <br><br>But last week, I had an asthma attack (childhood asthma before this) after SOC and the MO wanted to OOC me and told me I need to temporary downgrade PES to C9L3 for 6 months, but I told him I am only left with 2 weeks before passing out and if it was possible to let me finish my foundation term first. <br><br>He then told me to ask me to get a hospital specialist memo to submit to him after that. I am having my specialist appointment on the last week of my foundation term and now I have some questions.</p>
              <p>1) Can the MO OOC me during the last week of my course even though I completed all the high key events and passed the veto factor of IPPT pass?</p>
              <p>2) How/ When will I know my vocational posting order? From PC/ OC/ Coy Office?</p>
              <p>3) If I OOC and down PES after foundation term, can I still be eligible to become a 3SG? Will my rank remain PTE? After BSLC, will my rank be CPL?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks!</p>

              <div><span>The Specialist Cadet School 
                  (SCS) trains selected soldiers with leadership potential from all 
                  formations in the Army to be commanders.<br><br>Although trainees enter 
                  SCS with very different expectations, they all agree on one thing when 
                  they graduate - training was tough but rewarding.   <br><br>Trainees at 
                  SCS first undergo the Foundation Term during which they are taught basic
                   infantry skills to command an infantry section. During the first week 
                  of the Foundation Term, trainees are also presented with the Specialist 
                  Cadet Rank.<br><br>After the Foundation Term, trainees are sent to the 
                  various formations for specialised training in their respective 
                  vocations during the Professional Term. Trainees who are selected for 
                  the  Infantry vocation will remain in SCS for their Professional Term.<br><br>Finally,
                   under the Combined Arms Term, all trainees will return to SCS to share 
                  with each other on the different experiences and skills that they have 
                  learnt during their Professional Term.</span></div>

              <div><span>At SCS, there is a strong 
                  focus on character and leadership development as well as imparting 
                  essential soldering skills. To achieve these goals, SCS trainers are 
                  organised into Command Teams and Faculty Teams.<br><br>Command Teams 
                  will stay with the same company of cadets throughout their term in SCS. 
                  This provides them the time and opportunities to fully understand and 
                  mould the cadets in their leadership and management skills. <br><br>The 
                  Faculty Teams help to strengthen the cadets' breadth and depth of 
                  understanding in their war fighting skills.  Each team consists of 
                  instructors with different areas of expertise such as weapon handling, 
                  navigation and signalling. With the Faculty Teams, the cadets are able 
                  to gain a full picture of our Army operations.</span></div>

              <p>The MO has all the power to say if you're fit/unfit. Because if he certifies you fit and something happens after that, he'll be responsible. Having that responsbility gives him the power (that's why he wears the CPT rank) to declare you unfit/OOC if necessary.</p>
              <p>You need to complete BSLC to get CPL. Otherwise you will leave SCS as a PTE.<br><br>You might get posted to become an admin supervisor or CQ, etc. which will still get you a 3SG in the end. or you might end up as a clerk, cameraman, whatever....<br><br>Postings are anybody's guess, its according to manpower requirements at the MINDEF level, wherever needs people, you're just a name they fit into the next vacancy.</p>
