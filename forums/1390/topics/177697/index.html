            <div class='col-md body'>Before i start typing down my thoughts and questions, i would like to salute all of the singaporean army regulars who use this forum and acknowledge their decision to work in the army with respect.<br><br>I am currently, a computer engineering diploma graduate with a PES grading of C1 L3. That means i am going through modified BMT but i would only be fit for operational duties at bases only and not for field duties or exercises.<br><br>After much deep thinking about National Service, i have come to conclude that it is not an easy obligatory National Duty to perform, yet i am a little keen on experiencing the lessons that the military world has to offer.<br><br>Right now, i would like to have a job in the army and one of my ambitions in the army is to become a sniper. I know by word that it is one of the toughest vocations in the army and that there is little room for error. I know that snipers have to be incredibly, responsibly decisive on the battlefield and to make the difference through accurate shooting and reconaissance to help out his buddies and commanding officers in warfare. I may not understand what do these men go through or feel in their training, but i only know that they are supremely professional.<br><br>What i want to know is, given my PES grading would it be difficult for me to get into some vocations that are challenging ? How do other recruits with the same PES grading like mine actually experience NS ? And finally, is it all worthwhile having to stay stalwart and to self scrutinize your every action that you do in NS, having to think of all the possible consequences for every action ?<br><br>Those are my questions and i would like to have answers as i might be going to the army soon. And who knows, i might want to join the army as a regular, because i believe it is a noble profession that is overlooked, perverted and misunderstood by many people in times like this. Thank you, for having to actually read my post and answer my questions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The world is indeed unfair. I am grateful to the SAF in givng me my first exposure to this cruel world. I have seen white horse, and their treatment are indeed better than us. Most of them landed themselves in vocation that does not require guard duties even if they are Pes B. I had my 6 days of my off taken away by an army regular because they say OFF is a prilveage and they can take it anytime they want. Then what is the point in earning OFFs. Even when i ORD, the army are so nice to me calling me TWO months after i ORD for two MOB sessions. I was doing a HOURLY Pay job at that time and my boss will not pay me back hourly and he said it is my fault i am a combatant with the army. LONG LIVE THE SAF, THANKS [/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yea army is good if everyone is professional in the work and attitude. Everyone in the NS is running things in order, the leadership are those who are really qualified. But in reality, things are far from it...<br><br>Often management are crap, things isn't professional. Most people is unwilling and uncommitted. Army is nothing come close to professional. Some people can be quite childish with a rank. I was thinking army is fun too before I went in and realised the real truth.  Admit there are good leadership too but not all are so in this peaceful island of Singapore. Things is different. Unlike the US army where eveyone is professional soldiers who are signed on. Therefore at least most people are commited and does it like a job, or Israel everyone does NS because the threats of national security are very real. Singapore everyone does it like slavery deferring our career oppotunities.</div>
