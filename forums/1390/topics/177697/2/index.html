            <div class='col-md body'>If you *strongly suggest* to your MO that you want to take the King's shilling, he would most probably back down just enough to grant you a temporary status of PES D. During this time, go to a civillian doctor and get yourself certified fit. For example, if the reason you PEC C now is cos u went for an operation last time, return to your surgeon and beg him to give you a clean bill of health.<br><br>The important thing is that from now on, you CANNOT report sick cos of problems related to that. For example, if you had say back surgery, and got your surgeon to certify you combat fit and are now PES B, if you report sick for back injury after an Airborne jump (which can happen to even PES A ppl...) it will be viewed as YOUR fault. So think VERY carefully.<br><br>Anyway, if you're really in it for the 'adventure' you can always sign on for the 3 years contract (Officer) or try for the Premium Plan for Spec. Something short-term where you still have *some* say about your vocation. People going for the adventure should try short-term careers so as to have some influence over their posting, yet not be stuck for too long in a career they are patently unsuited for but did not realize it before signing the dotted line. At least you can maintain *some* enthusiasm for the length of 3 years!</div>

In my own opinion i think after your bmt, you will not want to step out of the comfort zone of a non combat soldier. That is just my opinion, sorry if i offend you cause i am quite fed-up that you only salute the army regulars. The NSF and NS men deserves to be in the same league as the Army regulars.<br><br>Long Live SAF<br><br>Long Live the White Horse</div></blockquote>no offense taken at all. i believe there is too much i still dont understand and i do not know better.</div>

A solider needs a hell lot of committment to what his doing. Many a times the things u do in NS esp after ur training phase... is a lot of mundane routine work such as officer or spec duties. Overtime, it becomes tedious and dreadful. Initially those outfield may be fun, but after a while it becomes boring too. It kinda makes u appreciate ur civilian life more. I cannot imagine how tough life is for those soldiers stationing in Iraq.<br><br>You will see true colours of some ppl in NS. I dont want to elaborate too much, but I'm sure you will experience it. Try not to go in with any expectations. If you are combat fit, do ur best, but know ur limits too, dont over work ur body... if you are not combat fit... well... there's pros and cons depending on whatever post they assign you. If you are homo, you can join music and dance company... hahhaa.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In your current PES status, you will not be able to undergo Sniper training.<br>My advice is for you to undergo a few months of NSF first.<br><br>If you still feel like a combat vocation is your cup of tea then ask your PC or OC about the <strong>Service Fit Volunteer Scheme</strong>. When I enlisted last year, I read that under this scheme people with lower PES status can get a waiver and proceed on to BMTC and Command School (and combat vocations like Sniper) if they are deemed able to survive the specific rigours of training.<br><br>Now, this might be a bit dangerous and it's up to you to assess your own physical condition before you do anything. Also, depending on your physical condition, you might not even be accepted under the sceme. I'm only telling you that this scheme (as at early 2005) exists.<br><br>If you have further enquiries, you might want to direct them towards CMPB.</div>
