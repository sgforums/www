              <p>hey</p>
              <p>I'm 16 and enlisting in 2 years I think end of 2013 or early 2014. Because my bro enlisted in March and when he ORD'ed and came back to Australia to study the uni year had already started and it really messed with his start at a new uni, new area socially and acedemically as he had to make up for a missed month or so. Could anybody tell me which month I would be enlisting if my birthday is in May?  </p>
              <p>Also, whats the chance of talking to CMPB and changing/requesting my enlistment date to end of 2013 so when I ORD end of 2015 I will have good time to prepare for my uni semester at the start of 2016? All my cousins and bro (9 in all) have all finished NS. </p>
              <p>In terms of enlisment dates, could someone let me know when the JC batch and poly usually enlists as I was told but forgot - I think september?</p>
              <p>And is Guardsmen mono intake? my uncle who was in guards ages ago said something about your chance of going to GCC depends on when your enlistment is or something?</p>
              <p>Sorry for long post but very curious</p>
              <p>thanks</p>

              <p>1st, you cannot pick/ choose, it's they who choose when/ where you go for this is not your grandfather's army.</p>
              <p>2nd, the official NS enlist dates are only known and published latest @ <a href="http://iprep.ns.sg/enlistment-schedule.html">http://iprep.ns.sg/enlistment-schedule.html</a>. for any further dates in the future, you can only check in the future, not now.</p>
              <p>3rd, just focus on your studies 1st. you will eventually be enlisted for NS when the time comes.</p>

              <p>Mindef has replied to this complaint before. You can't request early enlistment but you can disrupt NS 1 (local studies) or 2 (overseas studies) weeks before the start of studies and attend university. You have to resume and complete NS after graduation, or if your remaining NS fits within a term break, you can apply for that.</p>
              <p>I would prefer the second option because it doesn't interfere with work. But the first option is good since any low life people are more likely to be gone.</p>

                                              the deferment<br> cut-off age criteria*. A first education bar is defined as GCE 'A'

              <p><br>You will have to do everything by the book, there is no calling CMPB and expecting them to make special arrangements for you so that you can pick and choose your date. SAF does not cater to every whim and fancy of enlistees and rightly so.</p>
              <p>For JC intake, the enlistment dates are January (PES E), or Febuary and May (Enchanced Leadership Batch) or December/March (PTP). All you can do is ace your NAPFA and pray hard that they dont send you to the May batch anyway.</p>
