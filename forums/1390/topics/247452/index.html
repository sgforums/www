            <div class='col-md body'>Proposed change in legal framework to empower SAF personnel<br>By Wong Siew Ying, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 09 April 2007 1846 hrs<br><br>SINGAPORE : Search, detain, and use reasonable force against terror suspects - that's what the Singapore Armed Forces will be empowered with, in a proposed amendment to the SAF Act tabled during Parliament.<br><br>The Defence Ministry (MINDEF) says this will provide selected legal powers and protection to SAF personnel working on security operations with other agencies.<br><br>Although operations such as intercepting threats at sea to counter terrorism and piracy are permitted under international law, they are not allowed under Singapore's domestic legal framework.<br><br>This is one area the proposed amendment aims to change.<br><br>The amendment will also apply to tackling suspicious aircrafts.<br><br>The Defence Ministry says the move will enhance Singapore's responsiveness to deal with threats and allow SAF personnel to take preventive action early.<br><br>For instance, since the September 11 attack, SAF has deployed troops to secure key installations like Jurong Island and Changi Airport.<br><br>However, it's only able to act independently within the gazetted area.<br><br>In other words, SAF personnel do not have the authority to search or detain suspects and suspicious vehicles outside the protected zone.<br><br>They will have to summon the police, and act only if the situation worsens.<br><br>But with the amendment, SAF troops will be authorised to respond to threats beyond the protected area.<br><br>Seized items or arrested persons will then be handed over to the police for investigations.<br><br>However, these additional powers are only limited to on-duty servicemen involved in the security operations.<br><br>In implementing the changes, MINDEF says it will work with the Home Affairs Ministry and police to train personnel deployed for security operations.<br><br>The SAF will also lay out guidelines on conducting peacetime security operations in line with provisions in the amended Act.<br><br>Another provision - the Defence Minister can order the SAF to assist in conducting land operations when required, in consultation with a committee appointed by the Prime Minister.<br><br>The minister will also be empowered to authorise relevant servicemen to exercise selected legal powers in the immediate vicinity of any SAF property, to protect the personnel and property within.<br><br>MINDEF says the changes do not point to a greater deployment of troops for security purposes, and it will continue to work with other agencies to safeguard Singapore. - CNA /ls<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/269333/1/.html" rel="nofollow">Link</a></div>

There should be limits on this. It is not a free-for-all, and secondly, it empowers the SAF to carry out it's constitutional role. Thirdly, it will help to boost the importance of guard duty amongst everyone, especially those on POI.<br><br>However, until I see the entire amendment,  I'm not entirely sure if that segment about land operations has any legal limits on the use of force on domestic soil while not on security detail, and during peacetime.<br><br>Whatever the case, we are a conscript force, and will probably never see Posse Comitatus enacted here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

However, they can't pursue the guy at that moment due to legal constraints. With this law, they can continue to work as a team, as long as the police is there.<br><br>That's how I personally understand it.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I also have similar fears.<br><br>However, I also think this might actually be due to the fact that we are deploying to Bamiyan in Afghanistan, and we need to ensure our troops have the legal protection under our own laws to be able to defend themselves in case they get into harm's way.</div>

There are no feasible weapons mounted on the PK to effectively fire at the boat's engines, let alone doing it at high speed out at sea at 9pm. The chances of gunfire hitting the passengers are high. Ramming the engines is likely to be far less dangerous than firing a HK-MP5 at the boat, although of couse this is from the perspective of the escaping crewmen, while the officers themselves are in greater risk. But the police, in typical fashion, would much rather explain an incident affecting its own men than one where the public would consider as exessive use of force.</div>
