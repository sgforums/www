              <p>RILED by a soldier's poor work attitude, three of his colleagues beat him up one evening, with one of them hitting him with a helmet, umbrella and broomstick until the 19-year-old lay on the floor, semi-conscious and vomiting.</p>
              <p>And when a medic later advised that the victim be taken to hospital immediately, two of the perpetrators loaded Mr Jagjeet Singh - who held the rank of recruit - onto a trolley, wheeled him to his bunk and dumped him on the floor.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday, the three assailants were sentenced by a military court for the Dec 17 beating, which was so severe that the victim is still in hospital over a month after the incident in Bedok Camp 2 at Upper East Coast Road.</p>

              <p><strong>All three pleaded guilty. The main culprit, Lance-Corporal Nur Hilman Kassim, 23, was jailed three years and ordered to be caned six times. He will serve time in a civilian prison. Corporal Muhammad Fahmi Ibrahim and Recruit Hong Zhi Sheng, both 22, were sent to the detention barracks for six and four months respectively.<br></strong><br>During the hearing at the Singapore Armed Forces' Court Martial Centre, the court heard that the three storemen had confronted their colleague at about 6.30pm on Dec 17, annoyed that his poor work attitude had landed them in trouble with their superiors.<br><br><em>The face-off was verbal at first, but it spiralled into violence when they became agitated by his blank stares and uninterested responses.</em></p>

              <p>Well, good riddance to that moron..... this is what happens when one thinks with his willy instead of his head.</p>
              <p>Three of the best years of his life gone kaput..... six long scars on his buttcheeks.... still have to finish off his NS liability....  family's name gone down the drain..... all for what? If the victim was the ultimate kengster, then he's just not worth beating up.</p>

              <p>of course he must have been quite a farker .... people don't whack another chap like this while in uniform for the fun of it .... everyone knows what's in store in DB ... and any infraction is doubly punished while you're in uniform ..... </p>
              <p>the chap's colleagues must have reached boiling point .......</p>
              <p>I question the method .... but I don't wonder if the farker deserved it or not .... </p>

              <p>RILED by a soldier's poor work attitude, three of his colleagues beat him up one evening, with one of them hitting him with a helmet, umbrella and broomstick until the 19-year-old lay on the floor, semi-conscious and vomiting.</p>
              <p>And when a medic later advised that the victim be taken to hospital immediately, two of the perpetrators loaded Mr Jagjeet Singh - who held the rank of recruit - onto a trolley, wheeled him to his bunk and dumped him on the floor.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday, the three assailants were sentenced by a military court for the Dec 17 beating, which was so severe that the victim is still in hospital over a month after the incident in Bedok Camp 2 at Upper East Coast Road.</p>

              <p>All three pleaded guilty. The main culprit, Lance-Corporal Nur Hilman Kassim, 23, was jailed three years and ordered to be caned six times. He will serve time in a civilian prison. Corporal Muhammad Fahmi Ibrahim and Recruit Hong Zhi Sheng, both 22, were sent to the detention barracks for six and four months respectively.<br><br>During the hearing at the Singapore Armed Forces' Court Martial Centre, the court heard that the three storemen had confronted their colleague at about 6.30pm on Dec 17, annoyed that his poor work attitude had landed them in trouble with their superiors.<br><br>The face-off was verbal at first, but it spiralled into violence when they became agitated by his blank stares and uninterested responses.</p>
