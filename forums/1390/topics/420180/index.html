              <p>Hi there, i've just enlisted one month ago into PTP batch. Things have not been very smooth since on the 2nd week i got hospitalised due to some foot injury and got weeks of mc. After that i took part in a weeks exercise and that weekend got high fever which lasted for 5 days. It only recovered today. Is it common to fall sick frequently or is there sth wrong with me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>NOw i missed almost all of the trainings will i be OOT or OOC...? What will happen to me? I think my platoon will hate me because they think i CK.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I had a similar thread and situation like you and in my theory, my answer is yes. Most of the training methods are fatally flawed, I ended up with a meniscus complex tear that so serious even the doctor was shocked. I reflected this up to my OC before but he said he also can't do anything, what I can suggest to you is to take care and avoid all forms of dangerous stuff.</div>

              <p>it is very common. most of us are not used to physical stress.so the body fail when put to stress.</p>
              <p>Anyway NS may be very impt part of your life now, but in fact if you look at it, it is nothing compare to 4 years of Uni life, 20 plus years of education. Relax and walk through it. If you are sick then take MC loh. Care less.</p>

              <p>Most likely they will OOC you. You will be posted to another unit then retake your BMT again some other time...You may wanna talk with your Sgt or PC and tell them you wanna continue your current BMT and request them not to OOC you....</p>

              <p>Frankly speaking, the training ain't very tough yet. As you know for PTP batch, they take a more progressive stance towards training. So far i haven't even participated in road march - just strength training , some running etc. Wow.. OOC so serious? They haven't even started any major activities yet.</p>
              <p>Oh and i haven't get to take any ippt test yet and im quite sure ill fail my ippt for this ptp batch because my bmt is starting in 2 week + and once it starts there won't be ample time to train up... Not to mention that i may fall sick again during some random trainings.</p>

              <p>It's pretty normal to be injured, fall sick or generally feel lousy when in BMT as your body has been pretty much been trained to sit down and stare at the screen for a major part of your life. The only physical training you have had till then are probably some leisure runs or carrying your school bags around. It is thus not realistic to expect your body to suddenly cope with the sudden change in lifestyle.</p>
              <p>Cheer up and buck up. You don't expect people to run before they learn how to walk right?</p>

              <p>During PTP, training is still considered not that tough. It gets tougher and tougher as the weeks go by.</p>
              <p>It's just that some people are not physically active prior to enlisting. As a result, their bodies cannot handle the strain of even (relatively) light PTP training.</p>
              <p>I wasn't physically active prior to NS, and as a result, my body took a beating in the first few weeks of BMT. I remember my joints being really stiff and creaky during the weekends at home.</p>
              <p>Eventually my body conditioned itself to the training, and I got fitter and fitter.</p>
              <p>Bottom line: no two people have the same body. Some bodies can handle the stress, others can't. Be glad if you're in the former, and don't be disheartened if you're in the latter category.</p>

              <p>During PTP, training is still considered not that tough. It gets
              tougher and tougher as the weeks go by.</p>
              <p>It's just that some people are not physically active prior to
              enlisting. As a result, their bodies cannot handle the strain of
              even (relatively) light PTP training.</p>
              <p>I wasn't physically active prior to NS, and as a result, my body
              took a beating in the first few weeks of BMT. I remember my joints
              being really stiff and creaky during the weekends at home.</p>
              <p>Eventually my body conditioned itself to the training, and I got
              fitter and fitter.</p>
              <p>Bottom line: no two people have the same body. Some bodies can
              handle the stress, others can't. Be glad if you're in the former,
              and don't be disheartened if you're in the latter category.</p>
