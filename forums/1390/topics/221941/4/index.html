Why can't the NSFs take a proactive approach, put their hands up to volunteer for such tasks and learn from the experience? (also, is a paper/certificate REALLY needed at the end of it all?) What irks me abt our (yes, me included) singaporean mentality is that any impetus for self-improvement should stem from the govt. (i.e. SAF).<br><br>By the way, NS is not a 2.5 years enrichment program for 18 yr olds to learn trade/mgmt skills. Its primary purpose is to train and develop an NSF into a citizen soldier to defend its own country when the need arises. So let's try and remember the need to develop warfighting skills and abilities over anything else.<br></div>
