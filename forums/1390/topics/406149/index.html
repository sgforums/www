              <p>Did the PC or SGT tell you personally that you have to attend this talk?Peer chat is not an order, and therefore not AWOL. You all work as platoon, how can every1 else has attended the talk and you are missed out. There must be some communication problem </p>
              <p>I think your CO or PC is trying their best to solve your problem then let them do their job. </p>
              <p>I dont know why and how is your family problem bothering you. </p>
              <p>The key is what is your family problem that you claimed to be bothering. If it is $$$ than you should seek for financial aid. MP and SAF hotline cannot help you much cannot help you much if it is not an military abuse. </p>

              Is only a so called "group" is required to attend the talk. i used to belong to that "group" but  they so called remove me from there. So is like group meeting/talk but i am not sure i belongs there anot. Also, there was a time that i had a private talk with my PC and he said i doesnt belong there already. Hence, i sms my PC to confirm and he didnt respond so thinking that possibility is low, i decide no and went off. SGT said he read out my name during a mass brief but i didnt heard/know it. All i know is the so called "group" is require to attend. Some friends told me i need and some said no which is why i sms my PC to confirm.
              
              Sorry if this sound confusing because "group" is a classified callsign which i cant reveal/discuss much here but hope you get the point.
              
              As to my family problem(not $$$), i am requesting admin duties (no stay-in) from PC and my OC is helping me out to CO and this chain of command dunnoe take how long.  i also have some duty problem and personal problem but those arent serious but they add up to bring me down.
              
              i am really unhappy and i dun know what to do and if i am getting depression soon. My state of mind is still clear but.i dunnoe how long i can still take it... if i get charge and my life is gone..i will load and ready OTOT fire!. 
              
              I just wonder if i could call SAF hotline for some advise and counselling. if see mo will the mo understand me?

              <p>SAF hotline &amp; MO will definitely help you, BUT, you need to prepare yourself if your superior decides to charge you. I'm not so sure about the procedue, you need to wait for more advices before you do anything.</p>
              <p>It's late, go sleep first or watch shows. Don't keep thinking about this first. No one is available at this time to give you good advices.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>7 days duty and 5 days stand-by...nt many vocation do that. Are you a sea soldier?  How i noe, cos im one too...it takes time to cope with the duty cycle. Bet u just join ur vocation not long ago thats y still cant cope. With regards to the talk that u were supposed to attend, i believe that should be a official notification to u stating that u should go - be it verbally from your superiors eg. PC, Plt Sgt. or through your unit Routine Orders. If u were not informed abt that thn just tell ur higher ups when they question you. Coming to the personal problems you face always remember the chain of command. If nothing seems to be improving at your platoon commander level, then take it a level up say OC level? Remember not to see your MP for such issues because at the end of the day, the problem will only be channeled back to mindef, then directed down to your commanders again. last but not least, SAF hotline is the only last resort that u might one to use and i personally dun recommend that. Hope the above helps..</p></div>

              <p>LOL. My immediate thoughts is he is from CDS or TDS. Anyway these units are quite ok. The irritating CO has already been posted out and I hope the new one is ok. It is a indian guy, right now, is it?</p>
              <p>I dont think that the "talk" is that important. </p>
              <p>I remember the PC and SGT are fine also, at least they used to be at my times. </p>
              <p>It depends on the family issue is what type of issue, if let say the family is broken, mother is not working, brother is at primary school. Then the boy become the breadwinner of the family and then how can a 500 dollars allowance support the whole family in this way?</p>

And my family problem is not financial problem.. is just someone in my family is sick and my parent require me to look after due to some circumstances. Already bring up to OC and hopefully he is helping me. I just feeling down when doing duty and sometimes feel like "load and ready" but i just carry on and hope the issue get solve soon.

              <p>yup i am from <span>CDS</span>,sea soldier. Guess that
              duty cycle give that away. Now <span>CDS</span> is unique
              in this way.<br> Anyway i really appreciate those help. i just have to wait and see
              ba. And my family problem is not financial problem.. is just
              someone in my family is sick and my parent require me to look after
              due to some circumstances. Already bring up to OC and hopefully he
              is helping me. I just feeling down when doing duty and sometimes
              feel like “load and ready” but i just carry on and hope the issue
              get solve soon.</p>
              <p>If they dun help me, few mths later you guys can see me in the
              newspaper <img title="Very Happy" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"> i’ll show them what is marksmanship.</p>

              <p>So you dont have a problem at all. Your family member is sick, ask some1 else to look after them.</p>
              <p>How can your parents ask you to take care of them? Seriously, even if you are a clerk will only get home earliest by 7 30 pm and I am staying at bedok. You meant your parents are not back by then, and then you have to wake up by 6 am and be ready to go to camp.Even if you are clerk it is impossible to take care of some1 else.</p>
              <p>Although you have to do 7 days duties but it is not continuous. It is not a 7 day outfield like 1SIR. Some units even go outfield for a month without a break. I am sure if you wear white no3 it will not get crumbled and dirty even at day 7.</p>
              <p>Although I must agree that CDS is a mentally retarded vocation.Basically, it is really boring but it is one of the best rifleman vocation around. At least you will not bring a giant centipede back home from Thailand in your field pack.</p>
              <p>I am wondering, even the canteen is below your bunk, are you all allowed to eat at the canteen on your own!?.</p>

              <p>If you want to just find some1 to speak to then speak to your buddies.</p>
              <p>But you cannot cope with the suituations and seek change or amendment, then the SAF "higher" authorities will have to rearrange and find out more about the problem and solve the problem.</p>

              <p>thanks guys, i talked to my PC and called SAF hotline today and seen a MO. Feels better now.</p>
              <p>The SAF counsellor allow me to keep my identity unknown. Basically told him all my problem..and ask if i need seek MO attention.</p>
              <p>The MO refer me to see a psychiatrist which i think is not needed. All i need is an excuse firearms by him to prevent me frm doing duty. Yeah..prevent me from doing duty..not because i want "chao keng" or what. Is that i am doing security and i dont want affect ppl around me/myself/ops coz i really cant concentrate on my duty. the duty is already fuckup . I scared i cant take it and do something stupid.</p>
              <p>Of course my mind is still clear of should/shouldnot when handling firearms.</p>
