              <p>Have underwent BMT 5 months for PES Bp Obese.</p>
              <p>In the POP week, I became depressed to have sucidal thoughts.</p>
              <p>I got history since young have already, BUT I never declare to CMPB MO on medical checkup day before NS in pre-enlistee since I thought I can handle NS well.</p>
              <p>Now I just posted to my NS unit.</p>
              <p>Stress due to new environment.</p>
              <p>We hande MG, SAR21, M16, AR15...etc.</p>
              <p>I report sick to MO in camp and was sent to A&amp;E IMH for immediate attention.</p>
              <p>MC 3 days + a hospital memo stating NS adjustment/ adaptation disorder with depression syndrome to submit to SAF MO for PES review.</p>
              <p>Getting out of my comfort zone, I need to learn how to handle the stress in NS because after ORD, working life is even more adventurous ups and downs.</p>
              <p>I need to sit down with PC/ OC/ CO to request for permission to OOC/ OOT me, give me a 8-5 vocation to rest and relax at home on my bed as this is my comfort zone. My preferred vocational choices are such as clerk/ storeman/ service medic/ driver...etc. </p>

              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Perhaps you should also talk to your family members and friends who have lived the NS experience. The more you discuss with others, the more comfortable and mentally prepared you’ll become.</span></p>
              <p><strong style="font: inherit; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Because NS life is different from civilian life before enlistment, there are many adjustments you need to make.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">A good way to cope is to get support from your buddy and fellow recruits. They are going through the same tough training as you, so talking to one another will help relieve some tension.</span></p>

              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Being in a uniformed organisation, you’ll have to obey orders from your superiors. Thus some of you may feel a sudden lack of freedom to do what you want and you may find yourself having difficulties accepting authority initially.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Regimentation and discipline build strong character and toughness, so that you’ll be tough enough to handle difficult combat, crime-fighting or rescue situations without giving up or breaking down.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">When you first enlist into NS, you may have concerns of being in a new territory, with new faces and new things to do. But don’t let this get to you. Just remember the saying that “when the going gets tough, the tough gets going”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><em style="font: inherit;">Following are some tips on what you can do to prepare yourself psychologically:</em></span></p>

              <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: initial;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Adopt a positive perception</span></li>

              <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: initial;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Adopt teamwork spirit</span></li>
              <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: initial;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Learn to be independent</span></li>

              </ul>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">You can also speak to your friends or family members who have been through NS. Ask them to share their stories. The sharing will help you reduce some of your fears, uncertainties and doubts.</span></p>
              <p><strong style="font: inherit; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">During NS you’ll be living with different people.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Because these people come from different backgrounds, they may not think like you do or react to situations like you would. Instead of trying to select your type of people, you should cherish the diversity. This is a chance for you to learn more about your fellow mates and their cultures.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">You’ll find that you have many opportunities to absorb the different cultures—during training, eating, chatting or just seeing and listening. Take these opportunities and learn from people around you, you’ll have a much better appreciation of Singapore’s cultural diversity.</span></p>

              <div>IMH’s tradition of care started in 1928. We were the first mental hospital in Singapore, starting with some 1,000 patients. Since then, many advances have been made in treatment, training, and research. Our treatment integrates evidence-based therapies, supported by the departments of clinical psychology, nursing, occupational therapy, and medical social work, to provide holistic care for our patients.

              <div>MOH to launch two new community-based mental health initiatives</div>
              <div>Posted: 12 November 2012 1930 hrs</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Minister of State for Health Dr Amy Khor announced in Parliament on Monday two new community-based mental health initiatives designed to improve Singaporeans' access to mental healthcare.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"We are developing Assessment and Shared Care Teams (ASCAT), which are specialist-led mental health teams based in the community, in order to improve access to mental health care. We are also developing Community Mental Health Intervention Teams (COMIT) to provide improved access to counselling and psychotherapy services in the community," said Dr Khor.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Dr Khor also said that the Institute of Mental Health's (IMH) occupancy rate for the past three years averaged at about 80 per cent and that the hospital has sufficient capacity for new patients.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>There are currently about 2,000 beds across public hospitals in Singapore dedicated to mental health patients, with the majority in IMH.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Responding to queries from Member of Parliament Mr Hri Kumar Nair on the criteria for admitting patients to IMH, Dr. Khor said those with conditions such as schizophrenia and depression may be admitted for closer monitoring. </div>

              <p>I requested MO to OOC me, but he denied my request. I cannot demand...</p>
              <p>Please wait for my pending Medical Board (PES review), and my SAF psychiatrist appointment in about a month's time.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE'S Institute of Mental Health (IMH) beat over 80 hospitals 
                  in Asia to snag the top accolade at the Asia Hospital Management Awards 
                  (AHMA) last night.</p>
              <p>The hospital won the inaugural Grand Award for the Hospital of the 
                  Year, because of its good showing in six out of nine other award 
                  categories.</p>
              <p>The awards were held as part of the Hospital Management Asia 2011 conference.</p>
              <table border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" width="300" align="right">
              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td><img style="position: absolute;" src="http://my.effectivemeasure.net/emnb_18_4564.gif?14473151" alt="" width="1" height="1"></td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>
              <p>Dr Ashok
                   Nath, chairman of Hospital Management Asia, said that the Grand Award 
                  was created to "encourage hospitals to excel in not just one award 
                  category, but to also strive for more wins".</p>
              <p>The AHMA, held yesterday at the Resorts World Convention Centre, is 
                  in its 10th year. The judges include representatives from Johns Hopkins 
                  Medicine International and the International Hospital Federation.</p>
              <p>Dr Chua Hong Choon, IMH's chief executive, said the hospital was 
                  honoured to win the Grand Award and that the win "gives us the 
                  affirmation that our programmes are evaluated by international 
                  consultants to be of best-practices standards".</p>
              <p>The hospital also won the Most Outstanding Project in the Service 
                  Improvement for Internal Customers Project category for its Case 
                  Management Service, a follow-up service for discharged patients.</p>
              <p>It was started in 2003 but was tweaked last year to include an 
                  information-technology system that supports the follow-up care process.</p>
              <p>Under the service, patients of IMH are assigned a case manager who 
                  makes sure that they continue to receive care after they are discharged.
                   Case managers also often double as confidants for their patients.</p>
              <p>Said Joe (not his real name), 34, an IMH patient who was diagnosed 
                  with bipolar disorder in 2003: "When I have a lot of problems on hand 
                  and no one to talk to, that tends to increase my stress levels. As my 
                  condition is easily aggravated by stress, that triggers a relapse, 
                  causing me to check in and out of the hospital."</p>
              <p>However, Joe's condition improved after he was assigned a case 
                  manager in December 2009. He spends time talking to her every time he 
                  goes for a medical checkup, and she counsels him on some of the problems
                   that he faces.</p>
              <p>Other patients were also found to have fewer relapses and re-admissions, after having a case manager assigned to them.</p>
              <p>Between January last year and May this year, IMH saw an improvement 
                  in patients' compliance with follow-up treatment, from 78 to 88 per 
                  cent, partly due to the improved Case Management Service.</p>
              <p>There was also a fall in re-admission rates and the number of patients not completing their treatment.</p>
              <p>IMH also received two excellence awards in the Operational Customer 
                  Service Project, and Marketing, PR or Promotional Project categories for
                   its Mental Health - General Practitioner Partnership Programme.</p>
              <p>The programme aims to improve access to mental- health care, 
                  especially in the heartland, by providing general practitioners with 
                  psychiatric knowledge.</p>

              </span></p><div class="caption">Burst the Silence is a social movement that 
                  highlights the danger of youths being silent about their problems. </div>
              <div class="caption"><br></div>
              <p>Justin (not his real name) was developing psychotic symptoms and began to have delusions. For a year, he felt confused and lost.</p>
              <p>His grades at school suffered. So did his social life.</p>
              <p>He was sent to the Community Health Assessment Team (Chat) at the 
                  Institute of Mental Health (IMH) and a youth counsellor convinced him to
                   seek treatment early and to share his symptoms with his family.</p>
              <p>With treatment and family support, Justin is now completing his final-year at a tertiary institution.</p>
              <p>IMH's latest campaign, Burst the Silence, hopes to encourage young 
                  people with mental issues not to suffer in silence and to seek help 
                  early.</p>
              <p>It is IMH's first such campaign following a suicide awareness 
                  campaign, One Last Breath, organised from October to December last year.</p>
              <p>Chat youth support worker Nur Khairunisa Ngaiman said young people 
                  who stay silent cannot access the many resources available to them, 
                  including friends, family, school counsellors and therapists.</p>
              <p>She said: "They may feel a sense of helplessness if the stressor gets
                   more and more overwhelming... He or she may then resort to 
                  self-destructive coping habits like self-harm and excessive drinking."</p>
              <p>Chat, set up in 2009, has assessment services for those between 16 and 30 years old.</p>
              <p>Between April 2009 and last December, it provided psychiatric 
                  assessment to 169 young people and about 30 per cent of them were 
                  referred for follow-up treatment in hospitals.</p>
              <p>Youth problems the team sees include adjustment issues in school or a
                   new environment and family matters that the young people can't cope 
                  with.</p>
              <p>Others have mental health issues like depression, anxiety and some 
                  psychotic symptoms, said Associate Professor Swapna Verma, Chat's 
                  project director.</p>
              <p>Prof Verma said: "Youth is the peak period for the onset of major 
                  mental health problems and such problems are often associated with high 
                  levels of disability."</p>
              <p>The Singapore Mental Health Survey last year found that most people 
                  with mental illness had their first onset of the illness when they were 
                  in their 20s.</p>
              <p>The survey found that in most mental illness cases, sufferers were not seeking professional help.</p>
              <p>Those suffering from alcohol abuse started at an average age of 23 and took an average of 13 years before they sought help.</p>
              <p>People with bipolar disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) 
                  waited nine years before seeking help. Their illnesses started at the 
                  average ages of 24 and 19 respectively.</p>
              <p>Common disorders</p>
              <p>According to the survey, major depressive disorder (MDD), alcohol 
                  abuse and OCD were the top three most common disorders in Singapore.</p>
              <p>It found that 6.3 per cent of Singapore's adult population have suffered from MDD at some point in their lives..</p>
              <p>To encourage sufferers to get help, IMH is organising an event at 
                  *Scape on March 17 from 6pm that will feature performances and graffiti 
                  artists.</p>
              <p>Last weekend, a performance outside Shaw Centre involved a "bubble" with a young person "trapped" in it.</p>
              <p>A passer-by, Mr Luther James Balat, 32, called the bubble an "attractive" metaphor.</p>
              <p>"It gets people to ask, 'What's the meaning behind this structure?'</p>
              <p>"Young people do need to talk to parents about their issues. Some 
                  might just tell their friends, but the latter might not give sound 
                  advice."</p>

              </p><p><span class="content_subtitle">Mon, Nov 21, 2011<br> The New Paper </span></p>
              <span class="bodytext">
              <p>Depression, alcohol abuse and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are the most common mental woes in Singapore.</p>
              <p>One in 16 people had depression while one in 29 people suffered from alcohol abuse in their lifetime.</p>
              <p>For OCD, the figure is one in 33 people.</p>
              <p>The findings emerged from the Singapore Mental Health Study, which 
              surveyed some 6,600 Singaporeans and permanent residents aged 18 and 
              above last year.</p>
              <p>Led by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), the $6.9 million study is the largest and most comprehensive of its kind here.</p>
              <p>The study also found that 12 per cent of people here will have some kind of mental disorder in their lifetime.</p>
              <p>For most, mental illness will hit by the time they are 29 years old.</p>
              <p>But there is a big gap between the onset of mental illness and the time a person seeks help.</p>
              <p>It took an average of four years for someone with depression to seek 
              help. For alcohol abuse, the treatment gap is some 13 years.</p>
              <p>Clinical Associate Professor Chong Siow Ann, senior consultant and 
              vice-chairman of Medical Board (Research) from the IMH gave three 
              reasons for the time lag - failure to identify the illness, stigma and 
              the lack of access to help.</p>
              <p>Dr Chua Hong Choon, CEO of IMH, said: "Anyone who has a mental health
               problem or thinks he has a health problem should speak to someone about
               it."</p>
              <p>Help could come from a doctor or a psychiatrist.</p>
              <p>Said Dr Chua: "Every doctor in Singapore has basic training as a 
              medical doctor to deal with mental health, but in the last few years, a 
              lot more effort has been put in to increase the capability of our GPs 
              (general practitioners) as part of the chronic disease management 
              programme."</p>
              <p>He added that there are 50 GPs trained to manage some mental illnesses.</p>
              <p>Among those who had a mental illness, 22.1 per cent had consulted a psychiatrist.</p>
              <p>Most sought help within the community - 21.6 per cent went to a 
              counsellor, 18 per cent to a GP, and 12 per cent went to a religious or 
              spiritual healer.</p>
              <p>Apart from the IMH, the other three parties involved in the study 
              were the Ministry of Health , the Nanyang Technological University (NTU)
               and Rand Corporation, an American non-profit research organisation.</p>
