              <span class="bodytext">
              <p>TWO strangers, worlds apart, but they both suffer from the same debilitating illness of depression.</p>
              <p>They say their struggle with depression is one that few can understand.</p>
              <p>And one of their biggest fears is that when their caregivers die, they will be alone.</p>
              <p>Janice (not her real name), 28, was diagnosed with depression two 
              years ago, while Dylan (not his real name), who is in his late 30s, was 
              diagnosed more than 15 years ago.</p>
              <p>Both found their present jobs through the Institute of Mental Health's (IMH) Job Club.</p>
              <p>Janice is a receptionist and Dylan is a shop assistant.</p>
              <p>Both their employers are aware of their conditions.</p>
              <p>In Parliament on March 4, Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said the 
              stigma surrounding mental illness needs to be reduced, "so that the 
              patients can be more confident to come forward for treatment and after 
              receiving treatment, to integrate back into the community".</p>
              <p>While Janice and Dylan try to integrate into the community, both say 
              it remains hard for them to hold onto their jobs because it's a constant
               battle juggling their mental illness and the demands of work.</p>
              <p>Janice was too shy to meet with this reporter, and agreed only to an interview over the phone.</p>
              <p>But she had a happy, girlish voice and chuckled often during the interview.</p>
              <p>Ten years ago, she was an "average teenager" studying at one of the "top six" junior colleges here, she said.</p>
              <p>She was introverted but had friends, and even a best friend.</p>
              <p>Most of her friends, including her best friend, went on to 
              polytechnics or worked after their A levels, so Janice went to 
              university alone.</p>
              <p>"I was very, very lonely and I had no friends. I constantly felt ostracised by my peers in university too," she recalled.</p>
              <p>She admitted that at that time, she was already prone to being "over-sensitive".</p>
              <p>She also had problems with her mother.</p>
              <p>"She's not the affectionate type and I could never get any verbal 
              affirmation from her. She never listened to how I felt," she said.</p>
              <p>"I decided that unless I did something drastic, she would not care about me. I decided to rebel."</p>
              <p><span class="bodytext">
              </span></p><p>A few weeks into university, she dropped out. That decision "forced" her mother to pay more attention to her.</p>
              <p>At her mother's insistence, she found an administrative job in a factory.</p>
              <p>But once again, things took a turn for the worse because she couldn't get along with her boss.</p>
              <p>She left the job after three weeks, cooped herself up at home for a year and "did nothing".</p>
              <p>Her temper also went from bad to worse, she added.</p>
              <p>"I not only threw tantrums, I threw things. I knew I needed help, but
               I was in denial. I felt that going to a psychiatrist meant something 
              was really wrong with me," she said.</p>
              <p>During this period, Janice also lost her best friend, who could not understand her mood swings.</p>
              <p>They have not spoken since.</p>
              <p>While she had consulted private psychiatrists before, at 26, Janice 
              decided to go to IMH, where she was diagnosed with depression.</p>
              <p>Since then, she has been on medication and sees her doctor at IMH once every month.</p>
              <p>Although she feels better these days, she said medication does not make her "self-esteem issue go away".</p>
              <p>Janice has had four jobs so far, but she leaves when she cannot cope with the stress.</p>
              <p>She has been in her current job for the past three months, but hopes to find a full-time job soon.</p>
              <p>She still finds it tough adapting to changes in her workplaces, but 
              said: "When I have a job, I feel I have purpose in life. Without one, I 
              feel inferior, useless, and have low self-esteem."</p>
              <p>That sentiment is also echoed by Dylan. When he's not working, negative thoughts surge into his mind.</p>
              <p>"I just keep thinking, 'Why, why, why. Why am I like that?' So I need to keep myself occupied," he said.</p>
              <p>Dylan said he has been suffering from low self-esteem since young, 
              but didn't know it was an issue as he did not have problems with his 
              studies.</p>
              <p>It was only during national service that something in him snapped.</p>
              <p>"I don't know why, but I just could not take the stress in the army," he said.</p>
              <p>His mother took him to a psychiatrist and he was diagnosed with depression.</p>
              <p>Even though he has a business degree, Dylan says work poses a huge challenge for him and stress would trigger his depression.</p>
              <p><span class="bodytext">
              </span></p><p>His condition became so bad that in 2006, he was warded briefly at IMH for having suicidal thoughts.</p>
              <p>He has since improved and sees his doctor at IMH once every two to 
              three months. But he is unsure whether he will ever fully recover.</p>
              <p>"I don't have that much hope. I've been dealing with this for so long. I've never really been happy before," he said.</p>
              <p>Dylan hardly goes anywhere else apart from work, preferring to stay at home to watch TV.</p>
              <p>But watching drama serials sometimes triggers his condition, especially if the show features "useless sons".</p>
              <p>"I feel like I'm a useless son. My mother implies that about me too," he said.</p>
              <p>His mother, who is in her 70s, works part-time in a funeral procession band. They live in a terrace house in the east.</p>
              <p>Dylan's father died when Dylan was 17 years old.</p>
              <p>Said Dylan: "When she goes, I'll be alone. I might even end up dying 
              without people realising until there's a bad smell in the house."</p>
              <p>In the meantime, he's trying to save up to buy a new computer, so he 
              can set up Facebook and Twitter accounts and make more friends.</p>
              <p>He hopes to find a girlfriend in the future, though he lamented: "I've no money, who would want me?"</p>
              <p>Agrees Janice: "It's hard to find someone who will accept me. But it would be nice have someone love me the way I am."</p>
              <p>For now, she's content going out with her mother and relatives.</p>
              <p>She said: "All these years, I have not socialised with anyone else. I'm not in touch with people I've met at work either."</p>
              <p>Janice wants to find a stable job so she can start giving back to her parents.</p>
              <p>"I don't want them to worry about me anymore. I want to rediscover myself.</p>
              <p>"For a long time, my mind has been a blank. I'm trying now to learn what it means to be me," she said.</p>

              <span class="bodytext">
              <p><strong>By Lee Hui Chieh</strong></p>
              <p>THE national mental health hospital is looking at how it can better 
              track and care for its outpatients, especially those more prone to 
              violence.</p>
              <p>The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) has set up a committee to study 
              this, after a former patient allegedly torched Member of Parliament Seng
               Han Thong.</p>
              <p>Questions about how IMH's more than 30,000 outpatients are monitored 
              surfaced after 70-year-old Ong Kah Chua, who has been in and out of the 
              hospital with a history of paranoid delusion, allegedly set the MP for 
              Yio Chu Kang on fire at a community event in January.</p>
              <p>Ong is now back in IMH, where he will remain until the Law Minister decides otherwise, based on doctors' reports.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times understands that one of the changes being 
              considered by IMH involves ensuring that patients at high risk of 
              hurting themselves or others, are followed up more closely if they miss 
              their appointments.</p>
              <p>All patients are sent reminder letters, but those with suicidal 
              tendencies, aggressive behaviour, or a history of violence, will be 
              visited at home by nurses if they remain no-shows despite the letters.</p>
              <p>This had been done previously, but less systematically.</p>
              <p>Doctors said that community care is the way to go, rather than institutionalisation.</p>
              <p>Dr Lee Cheng, the chief of IMH's department of community psychiatry, 
              said: 'The best indication of violence is a past history of it. If a 
              patient has no past history, is it justified to keep him 
              institutionalised forever?</p>
              <p>'If we admit him by force, it's too extreme. At the end of the day, 
              no one would dare seek treatment because by doing so, you would be 
              deemed dangerous.'</p>
              <p>To ensure chronic patients stick to treatment and prevent relapses, 
              IMH already runs two home-visit programmes, similar to those in 
              countries like the United States, Australia and Britain.</p>
              <p>Dr Joshua Kua, the chief of IMH's department of geriatric psychiatry 
              who heads the seniors' home-visit programme, noted: 'The concept of 
              having patients with mental illnesses going back to the community, 
              leading as normal a life as possible, is in line with the international 
              movement of psychiatry.'</p>
              <p>The programmes have shown good results - patients have been 
              re-admitted fewer times, and have stayed for shorter periods when 
              hospitalised.</p>
              <p>Retiree Amos Madina, 62, said of his father, who has dementia and is 
              on the seniors' home-visit scheme: 'He's so much better now. He smiles 
              at visitors, watches TV quietly, and doesn't spit and scream.'</p>
              <p>General practitioners (GPs) have been roped in for another programme 
              that lets stable patients get treated in their own neighbourhoods, 
              making it more convenient for them. It also reduces the stigma that some
               still attach to visiting IMH.</p>
              <p>The results so far show that GPs' care is 'not worse than specialist care', said the programme's director, Dr Nelson Lee.</p>
              <p>One GP, Dr Roy Ang, treats about 50 such patients, and has sent only two back to IMH since joining the scheme in 2006.</p>
              <p>'Most of them are very stable and compliant. In fact, they are more 
              compliant than my other patients with high blood pressure or high 
              cholesterol,' he said.</p>
              <p>A 31-year-old woman who refused to seek medical help for depression 
              for five years before her mother convinced her to go, has been well for 
              the last six years.</p>
              <p>She switched to seeing a GP in 2005 because she works and finds it more convenient to see the doctor during weekends.</p>
              <p>Her mother, who takes her to her monthly appointments, said: 'I also 
              make sure she takes her medication every day, as I don't want her 
              illness to come back.'</p>

              </p><p>Signs of psychological trouble</p>
              <p>WHAT are some of the signs that your child may be suffering from psychological problems? Psychiatrists point to some of the things that you could look out for:</p>
              <p>    Sleep or appetite problems</p>
              <p>    Behaviour and speech that seem out of character</p>
              <p>    Difficulty concentrating or a lack of motivation</p>
              <p>    A drop in academic performance</p>
              <p>    Becoming increasingly withdrawn from families and peers, preferring to keep to oneself at home</p>
              <p>    Becoming argumentative towards family and friends</p>
              <p>    Hallucinations, delusional beliefs, odd or impulsive behaviour and even suicidal tendencies.</p>
              <p>If there has been a recent crisis such as the loss of a loved one, a divorce or school stress, be sure to check on how the child is coping. Take note of how he is performing in school and how he is interacting with others. </p>

              <div>SINGAPORE - A certified lifeguard drowned in the Singapore River after celebrating the Christmas countdown at Clarke Quay last year. State Coroner Imran Abdul Hamid said on Monday that 21-year-old Jonathan Lim Chong Ping "had jumped into the river while drunk and accidentally drowned".</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Suicide and foul play were ruled out by police investigators, the inquiry into his death heard.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Mr Lim was doing his national service and had been in fine health, having completed a 42km marathon on Dec 2.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>However, he was severely myopic and also suffered from astigmatism or blurred vision.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>It is believed his contact lenses slipped out in the water, adding to his confusion when he got into difficulties.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Forensic pathologist Teo Eng Swee told investigators that Mr Lim's blood-alcohol level was 139mg.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>He said that, in general, a person with such a high level "would be expected to show signs of alcohol intoxication such as slurred speech, unsteady gait and nausea".</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Mr Lim had been drinking in the Grand Hollywood club at Clarke Quay with close friend Wah Wei Min, 22, and cousin Jason Koh Xian Wen.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>At about 5.30am, they were near the G-max Reverse Bungy where Mr Koh, 21, was then arguing with his girlfriend.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Mr Lim jumped into the river and swam towards some boats. When he got into difficulties, Mr Koh dived in to rescue him but Mr Lim had grown too weak and the cousin had to abort the rescue to save himself.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>A passer-by called the police and Singapore Civil Defence Force officers pulled Mr Lim out at about 6am on Christmas Day. Despite resuscitation efforts, he died at about 8am at the Singapore General Hospital.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Mr Lim's family told police that they believed he jumped into the river to distract his cousin and girlfriend from their argument but drowned because of his visual impairment and alcohol intoxication.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Mr Lim graduated with a diploma in optometry from Singapore Polytechnic in 2011.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>His father operates Everbest Optics in Choa Chu Kang Grove. His mother and younger sister are also opticians.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>All three family members attended the inquiry and told reporters that Mr Lim was "a very frugal and obedient son".</div>

              <div><strong>The New Paper</strong></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>SINGAPORE - He had a bright future ahead of him that was abruptly cut short.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Mr Jonathan Lim Chong Ping had planned to further his ophthalmology studies in Australia after completing national service (NS), his mother told The New Paper on Monday.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Tragically, the 21-year-old drowned in the Singapore River in the early hours of Christmas Day last year.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>State Coroner Imran Hamid found that Mr Lim, who was then serving his NS, had jumped into the river while he was drunk and accidentally drowned.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Speaking outside the Subordinate Courts, Mrs Lim said the oldest of her three children had always been a sensible child.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"He knew what he wanted in life. And about a month before the incident, he asked my husband if he could have $200,000 when he was done with NS.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"That's when we found out he had plans to complete his studies in an Australian university so he could come back and help with our (optical) business," she said in Mandarin.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Keeping her eyes hidden beneath large sunglasses, she went on to describe her late son as a thrifty person who tried to save every cent of his allowance.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Mrs Lim said: "Before NS, he had a part-time job and saved his salary to pay for his driving lessons. Almost $2,000. And he was looking forward to his driving test on the 28th (of December)."</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The family last had dinner together on Dec 23 at a shopping mall, but Mrs Lim said what happened after that made "(her) heart heavy".</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"We knew he smoked, but he never did it in front of us. Until that day. We were walking around the shopping centre and he walked outside quickly. When we followed him, we saw him holding a cigarette but he quickly threw it away.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"I never got to talk to him properly about it," she added.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Mr Lim's sister, Miss Jan Lim, 20, said the two were close and shared a room until his death. They have a younger brother who is 12.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Describing her older sibling as a sports fanatic, she said he spent most days at the gym and would play football with his friends on weekends.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"We knew he went out drinking about once a week, but he usually came back sober. Once, all his friends got drunk so he sent every last one home. In the end, he had to walk back home by himself," she recalled with a smile.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>On Christmas Eve last year, Mr Lim had gone out with his friends to celebrate the Christmas countdown at the Grand Hollywood Club in Clarke Quay.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>At about 2.30am, he ran into his cousin, Mr Jason Koh Xian Wen, 21, and his cousin's girlfriend, Miss Lynette Loo Jie Yi, 19.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>About two hours later, they left the club to catch a taxi. Near the reverse bungee by the Singapore River, Mr Koh said he needed some time alone with his girlfriend to sort things out.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Mr Lim walked away to give them space.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>As their argument got heated, Mr Koh made a threat about throwing Miss Loo into the river before pulling her out.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Before she could respond, Mr Lim was heard saying in Mandarin: "She doesn't have to jump, I will help her jump".</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>He then leapt over the barricade and jumped into the river.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Mr Koh saw his cousin swim to a nearby boat and hold on to it for a break before swimming further away from the bank. Sensing something was amiss, he jumped in.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>According to court documents, Mr Koh said his cousin was unresponsive when he grabbed onto his arms and tried swimming towards shore.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>After a while, he felt exhausted and his legs were cramping up.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Could not save him</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>He said: "I tried to push him (Mr Lim) up but I end(ed) up being submerged into the water, and out of survival, I realised I could not save him any more and I got no choice but to release my grip on his hand and I swam to the edge of the river."</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Mr Lim's body was eventually found by Singapore Civil Defence Force rescuers shortly after 6am.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Toxicology reports show that Mr Lim had 139mg/100ml of alcohol in his blood, nearly four times the legal limit.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Mr Lim also suffered from severe myopia and astigmatism and it is believed that his contact lenses had fallen out when he was in the water.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>Investigations revealed that Mr Lim had sought treatment at the Institute of Mental Health for adjustment disorder while serving NS. As such, suicide and foul play were ruled out.</strong></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The investigation report also showed that Mr Lim liked to "show off" in front of girls whenever he was out drinking.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>But the State Coroner dismissed suggestions that Mr Lim jumped into the water "because he wanted to show off".</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"If someone does something that is irrational, there has to be an explanation for his irrationality. In his case, he just had high levels of alcohol," he said, adding that police arrests for alcohol-related behaviour are much higher during the Christmas period.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Mrs Lim said: "None of us wanted this to happen. He really was a very good boy but that night, he must have got very drunk."</div>

The Creative Hub at Goodman Arts Centre, which promotes mental health recovery through expressive arts such as music and dance, attracted 1,558 people in 2012. The facility opened in October 2011. Some 460 youth and their families also benefited from the YouthReach Centre, a specialised community mental health service for children and youth, since it started in August 2006.</span></p>
