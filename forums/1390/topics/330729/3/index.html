U seems to be telling me that, between a rifleman and between a Gunner/Signaller, u will choose the rilfeman whom is not trained in Arty guns and poorly skilled with signal equipment. Luckily, u are not a regular ... .. Am I safe to say that? <br><br>I will take a gunner or signaller whom is 'not as well trained as' the rifleman in terms of firefight. I am no gunner or signaller. But i am pretty sure that for arty, are are certain tatics in defense ... and trust me, without my signaller, means i will go and fight with that darned signal set ??? My CO was so afraid that there weren't enuff signallers with him outfield. We had to even "T-loan" signallers. If u think signallers were suppsoedly so slack ... will such a situation occur? Combat support is vital. While Combat Support are supposedly "not as proficient" in gunfights, without it, any combat arms unit is crippled.<br><br>I think u have failed to see how combat support arms function in the 3 stages of pre-ops, ops phase and post-ops phase ... While in ops phase, Arty might seems more relaxed ... but both at post-ops and pre-ops ... there are much more stuff to be done. The same goes for signallers. I think u might not know that signallers go through a 40km route march in FBO with their signal sets and spare batteries ...<br><br>I am not sure if this applies to the other comabt arms as well. But there is saying that "When if is only left wiht the CO and the Pioneer Platoon, the CO has to protect the pioneer platoon"  ...</p></div>

              <p>Well and good.  So a CDO officer, if he's as clever as his contemporaries in the other units, can finish his CO tour, gain a wider view of the rest of the army through rotations in non commando units and down the track have as much of a shot at COA as an Armour, Infantry or Engineer officer who goes through other units to broaden his experience.  By your argument, take an officer with the right qualities (being clever in your grossly oversimplified paradigm), rotate him though other units after his CO tour as you already acknowledge takes place, and his being a CDO isn't a hinderance.</p>

              <p>So make up their mind - are they rotated through other units (thereby getting a wide view of the overall organisation), or do they stay in their own little CDO world and get "way too specialised"?  If a CDO officer completes tours in other units, by definition he can't be too specialised.</p>

              <p>I said being chief guards does not make you a COA contender because only 1 COA so far is from guards. the rest are from other combat arms, and 1 is even from combat support. the common denominator is that they are clever.<br><br>i said commando will decrease the chance of becoming a general because generals require helicopte view. commandoes are cloistered for as long as they remain as commando. it is not impossible, but it decreases the chances of someone as opposed to if he didn't go commando at all. Gettit?</p>
              <p>only commando is singled out because ONLY they are cloistered from the rest.That's why I said commandos do suffer a disadvantage, but that DOES NOT contradict how BESIDES commandoes (the only exception), the rest of the combat and combat support arms you see many scholars equally distributed. And you see COAs who have come from both combat and combat support arms. Except commando. Gettit?</p>
              <p>So besides commando, the rest of the arms pretty much equal chance and pretty much does not make a difference. Clever can liao. Thats wat I said. Want to die die go commando also can. Not impossible, just decrease his own chance against his non CDO SAFOS rivals all things being equal thats all.<br><br>I went on to say that for a SAFOS best career by sequence is combat, followed by combat support, followed by commando. Its simple. You have seen most COAs from combat arms, and 1 from combat support. None from Commando.<br><br>then i related to you what a combat scholar who did not go to commando said. he's speaking from his perspective as a SAFOS. who normally become CO in their early 30s, so for them even the ones who go CDO only have a different route from their counterparts for the first 5-8 yrs. But of cos you can say that still makes a difference. They may be perceived as having disadvantage compared to a SAFOS who was in armour or infantry all the way from age 23. <br><br>I was offering the view point of someone else. To me choosing commando will decrease chance for career advancement for a scholar. It will be harder for him if all things being equal he rival with another scholar who did not go commando. he will lose out. But it is not impossible for him to get 1 star.<br><br>I stood by my points and offered the viewpoint of someone else I heard. How is that contradicting? Do you read newspapers?<br><br>Or you are one of those who only read the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cyberlosers' essays</span> aka myopic, one-sided <span style="text-decoration: underline;">JOBLESS</span> socio-political bloggers (blogging losers) thus too used to one trick pony and one track propaganda style of writing?

              <p>It decreases because it is cloistered!!!! They dun even get to know what the rest of SAF operates. If cdo got all the way up to brigade/div level and CDOs stay in there all the way to DIVs, confirmed dunno anything else about SAF. be what general?? general worker more like it!!!!</p>
              <p>Are you so simple you can't understand ah? got study last time or not??</p>
              <p>if CDO is super smart IQ 160 president's scholar type vs someone very stupid in armour, then he is still ahead of the person.</p>
              <p>if CDO is super smart IQ 160 president's scholar type vs an armour/inf super smart IQ 160 president's scholar type for the COA post, he will be disadvantaged cos he was in CDO and that will be his loss of edge! gettit??</p>

              <p>No wonder you need crayons.. gosh. I swear some gifted 14 yr old kids in sec schools easily got ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL when it was told to them.</p>
