The new tonners comes with complex electronic system and compact parts, making them VERY difficult to repair.<br><br>For armourer, I guess its less complex, but they cannot lose any part of the weapon. I had many armourer friends who told me every pieces of the weapon must be taken care of thoroughly...or else. Losing a weapon part is a no no in SAF.<br><br>ORD liao <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>no im not a mechanic. i was more comparing a single driver and a normal rifleman.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>bloody hell then there are those who look down on clerks....<br>i can tell u for clerks, its not as rosy as it looks. its just like trying to survive in the real office world out there, like what some of u are going thru now, but with much stricter rules. Its not even just an exercise in boredom, its a total mental torture.... although it may not seem tough to shred papers, i assure u, try doing it 5 days in a row, from 8 to 5. I think thats how they drive people nuts. But nvm. try doing it BY HAND. And then there are always deadlines to meet. to submit ration indents. to submit training programs. to submit parade state. to submit training area clearances. to submit ammo indent. to submit duty lists. to submit duty specimen signature list. to collect this money or that. to do all the extra shit from officers who don't wanna do their own work. forever rushing to meet some deadline or another. it gets to the point i've become used to skipping lunch. and if anyone thinks i purposely choose to become a clerk, damn you to hell.</div>
