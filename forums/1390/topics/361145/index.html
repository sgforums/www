              AN ARMY recruit leaving Pulau Tekong on a ferry on Thursday night after booking out of camp became delirious during the journey to the mainland.
              
              After Mr Liam Kai Zheng, 19, got off the boat at the Singapore Armed Forces' ferry terminal in Changi, he was taken in an ambulance to the Changi General Hospital, where he died nine hours later on Friday morning.
              
              Paramedics had found him unconscious at the foyer of the terminal with an abnormally high pulse rate and temperature. The cause of death is still being determined.
              
              Mr Liam had recently completed a four-day field camp before checking out of the Basic Military Training Centre in Pulau Tekong on Thursday night.
              
              The junior college graduate, whom friends said enlisted last month, was said to be 'soft-spoken but very cheerful'. Said one of them: 'He...had a smile on, no matter what he was doing.'

              <p>Odds are they will move it to some other part of tekong, as they try to 'clean' up the parts which are infected.</p>
              <p>Personally, I don't think it is soil infection, if it is, why is he the only one infected?</p>
              <p>Maybe Rec Liam has Lung problems or something like that and breathe in something wrong, and that is why he ended up R.I.P. </p>
              <p>On the otherhand, I don't mean to sound mean, but I got this feeling that he already had the fever before he leave tekong, but he didn't want to end up staying in the medical center for a day more, so he kept quiet and book out with the rest.</p>
              <p>Also, his buddies probably didn't keep a good lookout for him, othewise they should have notice that something is wrong him.</p>
              <p>Anyway, rest in peace, Rec Liam.</p>

              Rest in peace, Rec. Liam.
              
              My condolences. The case surrounding it is abit of a mystery, especially after field camp. And the talk of being delirious and an abnormally high pulse rate and temperature. 
              Looks to me like infection or severe heat exhaustion, but do not know if he have excessive perspiration. 
              
              His parents must be very sad as Rec.Liam was a JC student, he has a bright future ahead of him and a seat in univ. His parents must have been very proud of him.

              <p>Due to their negligence they cause my cousin death. My cousin had shown the symptoms of heat stroke before his death, but they just take it very lightly. Before heat stroke happen, there is lots of sign of heat exhaustion. It don't comes suddenly. How can you expect a newly enlisted recruit, to voice out, if that incharge presented himself so tyrantly. The fear has subconsiously instilled into them.

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parents: It was our last resort</span></strong> <br><em>By Crystal Chan</em></p>
              <p>THEIR household income is just $2,000. So how, their friends asked them, can they take on the Government?</p>
              <p>You will lose, their friends said. And you will be worse off because of the costs.</p>
              <p>But Mr Tan Kian Lee, 50, and his wife, Madam Hor Hong Kiow, 47, refused to buckle under the enormity of the challenge.</p>
              <p>'It was a nerve-racking experience,' said Mr Tan, of taking on the Ministry of Defence.</p>
              <p>Their son, Chia Wee, had become an invalid after he was found unconscious while he was in National Service</p>
              <p>He was their hope. He was to have gone to university and supported them when he graduated.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan said in Mandarin: 'My son began NS as a healthy soldier but he came out a vegetable. He used to jog and do standing broad jumps every day. Now, he's like a baby.'</p>
              <p>When four years of talks with Mindef and the Attorney-General's Chambers came to naught, the couple sued Mindef for compensation - and took it all the way to High Court.</p>
              <p>On 16 Jan, the Tans' dogged determination paid off when the High Court ruled that Chia Wee, now 26, was entitled to compensation.</p>
              <p>'Many people have told us that we're very brave to sue the Government,' Madam Hor, a bank teller, said in Mandarin, 'especially when we're not rich. But I believe anyone in our position would have done the same.</p>
              <p>'Some people even told us we may lose the case as we were up against the Government and we'd have to pay costs if we lost.</p>
              <p>'We're not greedy. Going to court was really a last resort and we're really grateful to our lawyer. Till today, our lawyer has not charged us for his work.'</p>
              <p>Their lawyer, Dr Lau Teik Soon, is a former People's Action Party Member of Parliament for Serangoon Gardens.</p>
              <p>Looking at photos of Chia Wee in happier times, Mr Tan, who is unemployed, sighed: 'He had hoped to go to UniSIM to study business and support us after he graduated.</p>
              <p>'He was enthusiastic about NS despite being a storeman. He obeyed instructions without complaint and always smiled when he left for the camp.</p>
              <p>'Every day, we'd buy him supper so he could have his favourite burgers when he came home.'</p>
              <p>Chia Wee, a business diploma holder from Temasek Polytechnic, had told his parents he could do a variety of jobs with a business degree.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan said: 'Now, he can only stare at us when we visit him.</p>
              <p><strong>'We have accepted that he'll never be able to look after us. At least, we'll get some compensation so we can care for him.'</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The couple's ordeal began when the Singapore Armed Forces called with the bad news that Chia Wee was discovered unconscious at the foot of his three-storey barracks at Seletar East Camp.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>He was found at 6pm on 3 Aug 2005.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Tan recalled: 'I was so shocked that I could barely stand. My daughter, Chia Min, had to support me.'</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The tragedy affected Chia Min so much that she did badly for her O levels that year, scoring 29 points for her best five subjects.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>She re-sat for her O levels in 2006 and scored 15 points, qualifying for polytechnic courses.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Tan and Madam Hor sought an explanation from Mindef but details were sketchy as there were no witnesses.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>One of Mr Tan's friends, who lives in Pasir Ris, took him to a meet-the-people's session with Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean in November 2005.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Tan said: 'My friend spoke on my behalf and one of Mr Teo's assistants wrote a letter. Within 10 days, Mindef replied, saying it was investigating.'</strong></p>
              <p><strong>In April 2006, Mindef officials met Mr Tan, informing him they did not know what led to Chia Wee's tragedy as there were no witnesses. The ministry offered to give Mr Tan $500 a month for five years to help him care for Chia Wee at home.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mindef also said it would not provide additional compensation, claiming its checks showed Chia Wee was not hurt in the line of duty.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Not knowing what to do, Mr Tan delayed discharging his son, who remains in a step-down facility at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Why didn't he just accept the monthly compensation of $500?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Tan said: 'I wouldn't get anything after five years and my son needs lifelong care. I was also worried that if I accepted this offer, it would mean I couldn't pursue legal action against Mindef.'</strong></p>
              <p><strong>In March 2007, Mindef stopped paying for Chia Wee's hospitalisation after having paid more than $30,000 for his medical treatment.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Tan said: 'I took that to mean Mindef was absolving itself of any liability. That's unfair because my son got injured in camp, not while he was off-duty.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>'At that point, my wife and I considered legal action as it was the only chance we had of getting compensation.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>'It's not that we want to leave Chia Wee in TTSH permanently, but we can't afford to hire a nurse to care for him at home.'</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Madam Hor's colleague recommended Dr Lau to the couple and he, together with Ms Rajvant Kaur, represented them for free.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>In August 2007, the Tans had a meeting with the Attorney-General's Chambers to resolve the dispute, but to no avail.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Dr Lau told The New Paper: 'We were hoping to settle the issue of liability amicably but it wasn't a meeting of two minds.'</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Soon after that, the Tans sued.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Tan said: 'I spent two hours reading my 40-page affidavit every day. My English is limited and I was worried of slipping up while testifying.'</strong></p>
              <p><strong>After a four-day hearing last month, Justice Tay Yong Kwang ruled in the Tans' favour.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mindef has not appealed against the verdict.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Dr Lau told The New Paper that the next step is to assess the degree of Chia Wee's disability and, using Manpower Ministry guidelines, work out how much he should get.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Tan said: 'We would have had to pay the A-G's costs if we had lost. It was a risk we had to take. But if we didn't take this step, we wouldn't get any compensation.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>'Of course, we're happy to win. After such a long time, we finally got justice.'</strong></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> ====================================================</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>They need to buy $3,000 bed for son</strong></p>
              <p><strong>THE Tans have no proper bed of their own.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Now they will have to buy a motorised special bed costing $3,000 for their son.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The couple, who also have a daughter in polytechnic, live in a spartan three-room flat at Old Airport Road.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>It is a flat that indicates their modest income.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The family sleep on mattresses on the floor instead of on beds.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Their living room has a sofa and two armchairs, but no coffee table.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Instead of Chia Wee supporting them in their old age, Mr Tan and Madam Hor will now have to care for him for the rest of his life.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>They spend about $2,000 a year on their daughter's school fees.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>They intend to use the compensation, which the court will assess at a later date, to hire a nurse to care for Chia Wee at home.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>His vegetative state means he has to be fed through a tube and wear diapers all the time.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The Tans have decided against placing Chia Wee in a nursing home as it will cost between $1,200 and $1,800 a month.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Tan said: 'If our son stays in a home, we'd have to spend money on transport to see him every day.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>'I'm not working, so I can care for him at home. We hope to use the compensation money to buy diapers, milk and a proper bed for him.'</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bendemeer Medical Marketing &amp; Nursing Services, which provides training for home nursing, is willing to work out an affordable package for the Tans.</p>
              <p>Its head nurse, who asked to be known as Ms Angie, said: 'We can train Mr Tan to change the diapers, clean him and top up the feeding tube.'</p>
              <p>She added that Chia Wee's parents will need to acquire a nursing bed, the type used in hospitals, to prevent him from developing bedsores.</p>
              <p>She explained: 'The nursing beds are motorised and have ripple mattresses which have an alternating pressure pump and a special air-mattress. These will boost blood circulation and prevent bedsores.'</p>
              <p>Such beds cost around $3,000 but MsAngie said the company can source for donated beds from previous patients.</p>
