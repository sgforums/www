              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parents: It
              was our last resort</span></strong>Â <br>
              <em>By Crystal Chan</em></p>
              <p>THEIR household income is just $2,000. So how, their friends
              asked them, can they take on the Government?</p>
              <p>You will lose, their friends said. And you will be worse off
              because of the costs.</p>
              <p>But Mr Tan Kian Lee, 50, and his wife, Madam Hor Hong Kiow, 47,
              refused to buckle under the enormity of the challenge.</p>
              <p>'It was a nerve-racking experience,' said Mr Tan, of taking on
              the Ministry of Defence.</p>
              <p>Their son, Chia Wee, had become an invalid after he was found
              unconscious while he was in National Service</p>
              <p>He was their hope. He was to have gone to university and
              supported them when he graduated.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan said in Mandarin: 'My son began NS as a healthy soldier
              but he came out a vegetable. He used to jog and do standing broad
              jumps every day. Now, he's like a baby.'</p>
              <p>When four years of talks with Mindef and the Attorney-General's
              Chambers came to naught, the couple sued Mindef for compensation -
              and took it all the way to High Court.</p>
              <p>On 16 Jan, the Tans' dogged determination paid off when the High
              Court ruled that Chia Wee, now 26, was entitled to
              compensation.</p>
              <p>'Many people have told us that we're very brave to sue the
              Government,' Madam Hor, a bank teller, said in Mandarin,
              'especially when we're not rich. But I believe anyone in our
              position would have done the same.</p>
              <p>'Some people even told us we may lose the case as we were up
              against the Government and we'd have to pay costs if we lost.</p>
              <p>'We're not greedy. Going to court was really a last resort and
              we're really grateful to our lawyer. Till today, our lawyer has not
              charged us for his work.'</p>
              <p>Their lawyer, Dr Lau Teik Soon, is a former People's Action
              Party Member of Parliament for Serangoon Gardens.</p>
              <p>Looking at photos of Chia Wee in happier times, Mr Tan, who is
              unemployed, sighed: 'He had hoped to go to UniSIM to study business
              and support us after he graduated.</p>
              <p>'He was enthusiastic about NS despite being a storeman. He
              obeyed instructions without complaint and always smiled when he
              left for the camp.</p>
              <p>'Every day, we'd buy him supper so he could have his favourite
              burgers when he came home.'</p>
              <p>Chia Wee, a business diploma holder from Temasek Polytechnic,
              had told his parents he could do a variety of jobs with a business
              degree.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan said: 'Now, he can only stare at us when we visit
              him.</p>
              <p><strong>'We have accepted that he'll never be able to look after
              us. At least, we'll get some compensation so we can care for
              him.'</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The couple's ordeal began when the Singapore Armed
              Forces called with the bad news that Chia Wee was discovered
              unconscious at the foot of his three-storey barracks at Seletar
              East Camp.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>He was found at 6pm on 3 Aug 2005.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Tan recalled: 'I was so shocked that I could barely
              stand. My daughter, Chia Min, had to support me.'</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The tragedy affected Chia Min so much that she did badly
              for her O levels that year, scoring 29 points for her best five
              subjects.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>She re-sat for her O levels in 2006 and scored 15
              points, qualifying for polytechnic courses.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Tan and Madam Hor sought an explanation from Mindef
              but details were sketchy as there were no witnesses.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>One of Mr Tan's friends, who lives in Pasir Ris, took
              him to a meet-the-people's session with Defence Minister Teo Chee
              Hean in November 2005.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Tan said: 'My friend spoke on my behalf and one of Mr
              Teo's assistants wrote a letter. Within 10 days, Mindef replied,
              saying it was investigating.'</strong></p>
              <p><strong>In April 2006, Mindef officials met Mr Tan, informing
              him they did not know what led to Chia Wee's tragedy as there were
              no witnesses. The ministry offered to give Mr Tan $500 a month for
              five years to help him care for Chia Wee at home.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mindef also said it would not provide additional
              compensation, claiming its checks showed Chia Wee was not hurt in
              the line of duty.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Not knowing what to do, Mr Tan delayed discharging his
              son, who remains in a step-down facility at Tan Tock Seng Hospital
              (TTSH).</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Why didn't he just accept the monthly compensation of
              $500?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Tan said: 'I wouldn't get anything after five years
              and my son needs lifelong care. I was also worried that if I
              accepted this offer, it would mean I couldn't pursue legal action
              against Mindef.'</strong></p>
              <p><strong>In March 2007, Mindef stopped paying for Chia Wee's
              hospitalisation after having paid more than $30,000 for his medical
              treatment.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Tan said: 'I took that to mean Mindef was absolving
              itself of any liability. That's unfair because my son got injured
              in camp, not while he was off-duty.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>'At that point, my wife and I considered legal action as
              it was the only chance we had of getting compensation.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>'It's not that we want to leave Chia Wee in TTSH
              permanently, but we can't afford to hire a nurse to care for him at
              home.'</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Madam Hor's colleague recommended Dr Lau to the couple
              and he, together with Ms Rajvant Kaur, represented them for
              free.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>In August 2007, the Tans had a meeting with the
              Attorney-General's Chambers to resolve the dispute, but to no
              avail.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Dr Lau told The New Paper: 'We were hoping to settle the
              issue of liability amicably but it wasn't a meeting of two
              minds.'</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Soon after that, the Tans sued.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Tan said: 'I spent two hours reading my 40-page
              affidavit every day. My English is limited and I was worried of
              slipping up while testifying.'</strong></p>
              <p><strong>After a four-day hearing last month, Justice Tay Yong
              Kwang ruled in the Tans' favour.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mindef has not appealed against the
              verdict.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Dr Lau told The New Paper that the next step is to
              assess the degree of Chia Wee's disability and, using Manpower
              Ministry guidelines, work out how much he should get.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Tan said: 'We would have had to pay the A-G's costs
              if we had lost. It was a risk we had to take. But if we didn't take
              this step, we wouldn't get any compensation.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>'Of course, we're happy to win. After such a long time,
              we finally got justice.'</strong></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Â ====================================================</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>They need to buy $3,000 bed for son</strong></p>
              <p><strong>THE Tans have no proper bed of their own.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Now they will have to buy a motorised special bed
              costing $3,000 for their son.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The couple, who also have a daughter in polytechnic,
              live in a spartan three-room flat at Old Airport Road.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>It is a flat that indicates their modest
              income.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The family sleep on mattresses on the floor instead of
              on beds.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Their living room has a sofa and two armchairs, but no
              coffee table.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Instead of Chia Wee supporting them in their old age, Mr
              Tan and Madam Hor will now have to care for him for the rest of his
              life.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>They spend about $2,000 a year on their daughter's
              school fees.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>They intend to use the compensation, which the court
              will assess at a later date, to hire a nurse to care for Chia Wee
              at home.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>His vegetative state means he has to be fed through a
              tube and wear diapers all the time.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The Tans have decided against placing Chia Wee in a
              nursing home as it will cost between $1,200 and $1,800 a
              month.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Tan said: 'If our son stays in a home, we'd have to
              spend money on transport to see him every day.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>'I'm not working, so I can care for him at home. We hope
              to use the compensation money to buy diapers, milk and a proper bed
              for him.'</strong></p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Bendemeer Medical Marketing &amp; Nursing Services, which
              provides training for home nursing, is willing to work out an
              affordable package for the Tans.</p>
              <p>Its head nurse, who asked to be known as Ms Angie, said: 'We can
              train Mr Tan to change the diapers, clean him and top up the
              feeding tube.'</p>
              <p>She added that Chia Wee's parents will need to acquire a nursing
              bed, the type used in hospitals, to prevent him from developing
              bedsores.</p>
              <p>She explained: 'The nursing beds are motorised and have ripple
              mattresses which have an alternating pressure pump and a special
              air-mattress. These will boost blood circulation and prevent
              bedsores.'</p>
              <p>Such beds cost around $3,000 but MsAngie said the company can
              source for donated beds from previous patients.</p>

              What fcuk? What $500 per month because it is not in the line of duty??? Any NUS/NTU who study Law or even layman would know that AS LONG AS YOU GET INJURED INSIDE AN ARMY camp, it is the business of the SAF. 
              
              I ask, if a student is accidentally dead in a SCHOOL, so if the student is NOT studying, that the school or MOE dont need to bear responsibility?
              
              Who's this lawyer for MINDEF? Ridiculous!

              For the past 3 days they came down to gather feedback. So they actually requested my cousin's family to wait for 1 month and allow them to conduct and investigation. They will give them a detail report on what had happened.
              But according to this guy http://talkback.stomp.com.sg/forums/showthread.php?t=73167&amp;page=2 who post this, saying that death count in NS is just a figure to them. It seems to me that they are trying to play a psychological game.

              My deepest condolence to Recruit Liam's family especially his parent. Though I dont know them, I really cried when I looked at Recruit Liam's photograph, such a lovely cute guy.
              Dear Shayn, please do your best to find out the real cause of the death of your cousin.  SAF is totally responsible for it.
              
              
              Until today I must voiced out, all those medical records we gave to them they simply take it lightly. The MO should look into each recruit's history and health problem whenever a recruit see them.
              
              If they will to check on Recruit Laim's history stating that he has high blood, the MO should sent him for further checkup when he was running a fever and nose bleeds.  Nose bleeding is no joke.  What the hack!
              
              My friend's son has history of asthma and is coughing very badly and on inhaler since one month ago.  Because of this he has to fall out and could not take his IPPT, as a result he was asked to stay back on Friday night to do admin work.
              
              Do you know what admin work they gave him.... sweeping the floor when the recruit has a letter from a specialist to certified since young he has ENT problem and dust can trigger the asthma.
              
              I just wonder do they have a sense of responsibilities. By retaining the recruit, he could not even have a chance to get home to consult his family doctor for by the time he booked out and reach home, its past 1 pm and the clinic is closed on Saturday afternoon and the whole of Sunday.
              
              I really hope the family of Recruit Liam get a true and honest answer from them.
              
              During the field camp, they slept sitting down when the tents flooded during the thunderstorm in the early mornings.  They have to fend for themselves.... yet its never strike SAF that when there's lightning and thunderstorm, they should not let them sleep in the open.

              <p>Do you think a war will stop just because its raining and theres thunder and lightning? The conditions NSF are put through are definitely not easy but the purpose is to train them for war and battle ready should there ever be a need.</p>
              <p>If we treat all the soldiers like little babies and bring them back to bunk whenever it rains etc, we do not even need bother about serving NS as all that have been trained would be a bunch of sissies that will not even be able to handle anything nature throws at them so lets not even say an enermy.</p>

              How much they compensate the Liam's family cannot bring back the boy's life.
              
              We want is our young guys safety...after studying so much for the past 18 years and then to get "locked up" for about two years before they could continue to study again.
              
              MO of SAF, please be more responsible and dont doubts these young recruits when they report sick, a person is sick means sick! If you doubt them, then get another doctor to examine them.
              
              I believe most guys if they can perform the task they will do it, SAF must trust our young guys.
              
              Please dont take it lightly anymore.  All parents now who have sons in the Army are living each day in fear.  
              
              Dont wait till mishap happened and then start to regret!

              <p>this is the failure of SAF to take proper care of the soilder ..
              when I was a recruit I had high fever for entire week but was put
              in a sick bay but the medic in charge of the sick bay was trying to
              Â slack by under declared my temperature so he has less work
              and I was discharged with Attend B, despite my high temperature I
              continued with my training , I do not know about the system now ,
              when you were sick and went to see MO you are somtime treated like
              a criminal , the fact is I really hate going to the medical centre
              and I do not have a choice I still remember my SGT during BMT
              ordered me to report sick because he touch my forehead and feel I
              had a high temp, I went to to medical centre again and once again
              got discharged due to the magic the medic performed. these MO and
              medic are just mortal who are trying to chang keng do less work and
              in the end it is the really sick that suffers and this is SAF</p>

              <p>Then those MOs finish their NS and go kill more patients while working in public hospitals. It's no secret that the SG doctors in hospitals are so lousy and often misdiagnose or give bad medicine, causing patients to die. I think there should be a relook into the medical school here and the poor standards of teaching that is causing these incompetent MOs to roam free in Singapore causing the deaths of people in camps and in public hospitals.</p>
              <p>I know at least 4 cases of people whose relatives have died because of incompetent local trained doctors in public hospitals.</p>

              wtf... where have you substantiated your fucking remarks from? poorly trained doctors? lousy? 
              
              for your info dude, the Singapore medical system is ranked 6th by WHO, so don't go around with your unsubstantiated, inflammatory statements about poor doctors.
              
              they work around the clock, some are bound to make mistakes. unfortunately, with doctors their mistakes lead to injury or death. no one is perfect, not me nor you. 
              
              so don't go around judging the doctors, after all, they are better trained than you, are more highly educated than you.
              
              poor standards? try living in malaysia and you come here see whether poor standard or not.

              <p>I didn't criticise the Singapore medical system. I said the local trained MOs who serve in public hospitals are incompetent nutjobs. I hope you have the intelligence to discern the difference. The lousy MOs are just a small component of the larger medical system, which has merits elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Unsubstantiated? I have known of countless cases of people here who were misdiagnosed by our poorly trained doctors, given unsuitable medication that aggravated their condition. They say the patient is fine and can go, and then the patients leaves the hospital and turned out he hadn't been fine at all and because of late detection, his condition became hopeless.</p>
              <p>Or how about my former PC's father, who was given dubious medicine from the LOCAL TRAINED LOUSY DOCTORS, the lousy doc even got the face to admit the medicine is actually still on trial use only, and after taking, the patient who was totally lucid and could talk and laugh to ppl, became delirious and the strong meds weakened his body so much, that he later DIED. Old ppl have very weak immune systems, any bacteria infection when their bodies are weakened can result in fatality. Which was happened to my PC's father, who died cos he had a bacteria infection while in the delirious state after the strong medication that was prescribed for ordinary geriatric (care for the aged) ailments!!!! Later the doctors say the medicine too strong for him and they didn't know! my own relatives, and i know tons of other cases in which the local trained doctors in public hospitals show that they do not know what they are doing and are totally unfit for duty. I have heard so many cases of people saying dun go to a hospital here, go in high chance will not come out, even if not sick go in already will end up dead. Just pay higher premium go private hospital, most of the UK trained docs are there.</p>
              <p>And who doesn't know the local doctor keith goh who keep on performing separation surgery on conjoined twins to show off when all the ones he performed on ALL DIE?! He performed on the Nepalese twins and they barely survived, so he wanted to show off and performed on the Iranians who died. And god knows how many more he performed after to show off which the media didn't cover anymore due to loss of interest and he just keeps on doing it that even the Health Minister had to tell him to SHUT UP AND SIT DOWN as he was affecting Singapore's image adversely. And of cos we all know what happened to the original nepalese twins. One dead. One dying.</p>
              <p>More highly educated than me? Wow I didn't know you have ESP or something! You're ET? How come you know who you're talking to over this interface? How do you not know I'm THE President's Scholar??! Or a Nobel Prize winner? Just a freaking MO. local medical school what a fucking joke it is!</p>
