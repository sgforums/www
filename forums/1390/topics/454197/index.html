              <p>While you can <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>try</strong></span></em> to defer again, just be prepared to either let your colleague take over your business trip plan or postpone your own business trip plan.<br><br>As they already said that work commitment is a no excuse reason when even self-employed such as taxi drivers also need to go for ICTs even though knowing that their work is literally translated from Chinese language as "hands stop, mouth stop".</p>

              ICT Notification
              
              As an NSman, you may be called up for NS activities of not more than 4 hours during the first 6 months after you completed full-time NS. Every NS work year, you may be called up to a maximum of 40 days of Operationally Ready National Service (ORNS). You may also be called up for more than 40 days in one work year. However, you and your employer must first agree to the extended service and sign an undertaking to indicate your acceptance of the arrangement.
              
              The duration of your call-up may be shorter than 7 days [low-key (LK) training] or 7 days and longer [high-key(HK) training].
              
              Before your NS training begins, an advance notification will be sent to you as follows:
              
              a. 6 months in advance for HK training (i.e. 7 days and longer)
              
              b. 3 months in advance for Make-Up training (MUT) as well as LK training (i.e between 2 to 6 days)
              
              c. 2 months in advance for call-up activities of 1 day or less
              
              Such advance notification is given before every call-up to minimise disruption and inconvenience
              to your schedule.
              
              If you do not attend your scheduled NS training, you will be tagged as being Absent Without Official Leave (AWOL) from your place of duty and subject to disciplinary action.

              I thought my argument is strong, since the directive itself says must be 3mths in advance notice liao,
              Anyway, my tickets were booked before my call-up, the booking date on the e-ticket can be used as proof
              Moreover, my trip is to set up a new overseas branch office, not something that can easily be postponed
              
              Is it too late to apply exit-permit? but my company actually intend to send me there 3mths first, so i am not sure, i think exit-permit is more 6mths stay and above?

              <p>Exit permit automatically granted. But it is not permission to skip ICT if ICT scheduled. Still have to defer your ICT.</p>
