              <p>Firstly, Tekan got no G.</p>
              <p>Secondly, how long do you have until your POP? If it's like 2-3 weeks, would you rather go for the achievement of POP or get tekaned with all the new recruits at field camp, live firing, etc.. in a recourse again?</p>
              <p>Thirdly I think you should let your parents talk to your OC as he might have a better understanding of the system, most officers aren't childish and won't tekan you just because your parents call him. If you feel you are mistreated or handled unfairly at any point there are (not always transparent) channels for you to bring this up to higher authorities.</p>

              <p>Explain to your parents that your OC is helping you. If you OOT now, you need to go for a BMT Recourse.</p>
              <p>No matter what, you will still be down PES because of your injury. So your posting would not be affected anyway.</p>
              <p>As long as you have completed 2 out of the 3 requirements for BMT, you will pass. Passing IPPT is NOT a requirement for passing BMT.</p>

              <p>Route march not so crucial lah....the main thing is if u can pass BMT then go unit then downgrade ok lor. So u no need to go recourse. But of cos the OC cannot overwrite the MO. Maybe you can speak to the OC and ask if u participate in all the events if possible and he can let u pass. Then ok lor.</p>

              <p>U see, BMT result totally depending on your coy, I noe people who fail everything yet pass BMT. But of cos, if u wanna go OCS or SFS, you need to pass IPPT is required. Btw those who failed everything yet pass BMT, those mainly sure improvement especially for IPPT and SOC so the OC noe you'll pass them in unit for sure.</p>

              <p>Just my two cents:</p>
              <p>There are 2 routes to this:-</p>
              <p>1. If you follow what your OC said, there are 2 possible outcomes,<br> -&gt; You pass your BMT and POP. Like what someone who had highlighted, 
              there were instances whereby a recruit POP even though he failed all FC,
               IPPT and SOC. In fact I know a few. And the OC really play a large role
               in determining whether you POP or not.<br> -&gt; You fail your BMT and you need to recourse.</p>
              <p>2. If you OOT, you will surely need to recourse.</p>
              <p>Now,
               for the recourse cases in both routes, if you do not have a PES 
              downgrade, you will need to retake the whole BMT again. If you have a 
              downgrade, then there is a chance that you take a modified BMT, or maybe
               you do not need to take it at all.</p>
              <p>Looking at the 2 routes, a 50% chance of retaking BMT is definitely better than 100% chance of retaking it. So unless you want to pia OCS and Spec, I would think it is better that you take route 1.</p>

              <p>Hi all, I recently got OOT by the MO because of a Back
              Injury but because I managed to pass my IPPT(Tahan all the way
              :) ), my OC say he want me to POP so he block my OOT
              status and instead now I'm on long excuse.</p>
              <p>The thing is that now, my parent knows about it and wasn't
              to happy about it. They wanted to call and talk to my OC but I stop
              them, since I scare later the OC Tekang me...</p>
              <p>So now I confuse if should I just OOT, I'm not joining in
              exercise anymore so no telling if I can pass the last
              IPPT, then again, if my injury is not serious enough to get a
              downpes, i still have to go BMT again...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any advice? </p>

              <p>Similar case to me. I only got IPPT silver on the first week, then later I never march with the platoon most of the time. But I still POP, in a strange way. Anyway my story aside.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your OC is in fact a good one.  If you have passed all the test requirement, you can block the rest with excuse and MC all the way. Then you will still POP.</p>
              <p>It is better to POP then having recourse, since you have already "done" with the minimum requirement.</p>
              <p>Your problem is temp. when you recover you can chong again. else you downgrade later you still have to recourse.</p>
              <p>My PC is a WO so he will try to do his best to make best of every1.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dont know how bad is your problem, but mine is a complicated one and eventually I am downgraded later. But I have to warn you that back injury is of no joke. Some people can get paralysed from waist downwards perm, if he is not careful enough.</p>

              <p>I remember I only attended 4 days out of 6 days. 2 day one day break, 2 day one break, I recalled that time my stuff is already packed nicely for me to pick up by my buddy. thank buddy. I remember sit test I only stay over night for 2 day?.</p>
              <p>But if I got to take BMT again I will OOC immediately. Because in order to compensate movement limited by the backache, the ankles, knees and other muscles will compensate, in turn they get injured too. So now because of my flat feet, my left ankle, right knee, left hip and lower back is bad. It is quite troublesome later in life. </p>
