              <p>Anyway, as your friend said, he should talk to the unit S1.</p>
              <p>But from what you have said, I think it's quite tough. The OC tour is usually where they start to funnel people into combat or staff appointments. There's a lot of competition for S3 appointments.</p>

              <p>Air-force, navy and army and 3 different Services. Support arms in army means artillery, signals, logistics,engineers etc in support of moving troops. They are also combat appointments just in their own arms. They are eligible for advancement courses e.g. CTC, BTC, SCSC, same as moving vocations i.e. commandos, guards, infantry.</p>
              <p>CTC is to prepare for OC appt and BTC is to prepare for Bn S3 appt. Anything higher is to go through the SCSC (Singapore Command and Staff College). This course is also open to Singapore Police Force officers.</p>
              <p>Youe mentioned earlier that "He did his OC tour in a support arm (one of those navy blue berets arm). Don't tell me officers from support arm cannot do BTC ah?"</p>
              <p>I guessed he cleared his OC tour as OC of FDS (Field Defence Squardron) meaning to provide the land defence of the naval camps. My friend was a PC there. For this issue, I really suggest he check with his S1 regarding his ROA (Route of advancement).</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>wah you sound very sure leh! What is SO1/SO2? What is CSSCOM?</p>
              <p>And are you positive that all OC tours within Mindef are transferable? I really question this.</p>
              <p>for eg an OC tour in navy or joint would be totally different than an OC tour in army, eg no. of people you lead, operational intricacies. how can all the OC tours under Mindef be transferable? an OC in army leads over 100 men, an OC in navy is like 1/3 of that, airforce is even fewer leh. I think joint is also about 1/3 of that.Then like that, you will find officers crossing from army, navy, air force, joint, etc etc freely, which is not the case.</p>
