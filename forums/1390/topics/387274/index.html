              <p>You can still sign on to navy in army BMT and still get into Navy after that so no harm getting into the SAF, learn about how they work before choosing to sign.</p>
              <p>There are many who break their bonds because they dislike the work after signing on too early so its best not to make a hasty decision.</p>

              <p>I was from navy. Most ppl i know who signed up the saf-poly

              <p>Furthermore, sea life is really different. Many ppl cannot take
              the routine n sea-sickness despite them being very healthy and fit.

              <p>You need advice from someone who you can trust and has
              experienced navy. The few yrs of bond associated with such
              education scheme can really dragged u down later after you work

              <p>I am saying the treatment for Navy BMT and Army BMT is different. Army BMT is like shit; whereas Navy BMT, the officer respect the recruits, and the jobs are more technical based, a lot of seamen terminology, skills, so it is more like school, training seamen.

              <p>Of course you need not reBMT. One can always sign on later ... but why bother when one have already decided and they dont need to experience undesirable Army BMT. For what?  </p>

              <p>We don't talk about just experiencing BMT. Entering the SAF gives you a chance to see how they work and learn more about some of the regimental stuff etc which is still relatively common between all 3 service. If a person has experience it and decides that the regimental lifestyle is not to his liking, he does not have to sign on.</p>
              <p>Don't tell me RSN or RSAF slacker etc. If you can't take the toughest and worse treatment, you should not bother considering signing on since there is no assurnace of things being easy in any of the services.</p>

              <p>Anyway... Goilpo and I think the more important thing "sign on" Navy is SEASICKNESS and Routined work. </p>
              <p>The ship goes out to sea for frigate and LST, can be simple patrol at South China Sea to all the way to Atlantic Sea for 2 weeks to 8 months or even a year or two. "Watch" is like 8 hours shift divided into 3 teams for seamen?. Officers are 12 hours shift? &lt;-- lol Watching and operating the ship around the clock. There is no day, no night. Sailing life is different. But back to Singapore where will  be docking rest. Men go HOME. Officer stay in base for operation report and next mission planning. </p>
              <p>Sign on blah!! Sign !!! My friend commented that he need more manpower in his ship.  </p>
