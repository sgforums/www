              <p>In Air Force, only the pilot got some mental stress. I'd say not even the WSO has any. And neither do the people on the ground. You probably don't know this. I've got tons of pilot friends, and I know for a fact that their flying time is limited to a number of hours per week. How spoilt is that? no one is saying that there's no mental stress. But its clearly exaggerated in perception and highly moderated operationally.</p>
              <p>What "mental stress" does Navy have, sitting and sunning on the little boat all day?</p>
              <p>Do you happen to know that mental strength is used to overcome physical stress? If you've been through OCS, you'd know. Your segregation of mental and physical stress for the three services is thus moot. Which leads us to conclude that all three services require a level of mental strength to overcome all kinds of stresses.</p>
              <p>The only difference is the guys in air force and navy can be fat and unfit.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The point I'm trying to make is that every job has it's own
                                          difficulty. More often than not, you will only hear complains from
                                          people about how hard their job is. In every organization, military
                                          or private, there is pressure to perform that increases
                                          exponentially as your rank increases. However, mainly due to the
                                          emphasis on safety, mistakes carry with it more repercussions (in
                                          the military) and this is true amongst the 3 forces.</p>
              <p>I'm not trying to convince you that Navy and Air Force
                                          personnels have monopoly on mental stress and Army, physical. I'm
                                          just generalizing.</p>
              <p>Maybe your friends have failed to mention this.. But do you
                                          honestly think that after spending millions to train them, the
                                          government would let them just idle away in the lounge room when
                                          they aren't on alert? You've been through Army life, you should
                                          know better than that.</p>
              <p>Also, you may categorize people in the Navy/Air wings as fat but
                                          you cannot call them unfit. Every in-service personnel is required
                                          to pass their IPPT every year or risk having their
                                          salary/promotions reduced/delayed.</p>
              <p>But if you're dead set on the sterotype of 'Officers/regulars
                                          are useless', 'Army &gt; Navy/Air force', 'Navy/Air force
                                          personnels are weak, fat, unfit, and useless', then by all means,
                                          don't let what I've said change your mind. After all, I'm only a
                                          dumb regular :&gt;</p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S: If military was so easy, everyone would have chosen it for
                                          a career.</p>

              <p>I knew you were generalizing. That was what I said actually, that you were generalizing. Mental strength is used to overcome physical stress, and in high levels of physical stresses in some Army vocations, the same mental strength used to combat the mental stresses in Air Force and Navy is at play.</p>
              <p>I didn't say that they are idling on the ground when not flying. I said that the mental strength attached to piloting is highly exaggerated given that I'm aware of the genuine operating conditions and how they're spoilt and coddled cos they're flying oh-so-expensive planes, and need to be treated like VIPs while both regular and NSF army officers like us are doing "braindead" things in the field? I know this is BS. Of course they're kept busy when not flying, but is the work on the ground done by non pilots and whatever non flying work of pilots the mental stress attached to the air force in popular perception? Hell no. People attach the flying of the pilot to the so called "mental stress" of the Air Force and what's the truth I know? With the exception of Air Defence Artillery which is tough and which so many people consider operationally more suited as a member of Army, what else do you think people think is so mentally stressful about the Air Force? I agree that the navy divers do a very tough job. <em> </em></p>
              <p>Despite IPPT standards many Air Force and Navy officers are rotund, because it doesn't require tip top fitness to just pass it.</p>
              <p>You must be kidding. I have nothing against NS/regular officers/specialists in all three services, and have many friends in the force who've made it their careers. I am an officer myself, though not considering a career in the armed forces because unless i'm a SAFOS I won't sign on and of course I'm not that good. In fact, I always defend NS/regular officers/specialists of all types. In this thread I already did so a few times.</p>
              <p>I think it's this resident retard you're talking about, Lokey. That dumb farmer in CVs who think he's such a "high flier" just because he's in CVs and didn't make it to OCS in his NS days. He never fails to remind us of how he's doing fabulously in his post ORD days and loves to regale us with stories of how he's holding a higher rank in the CV world than people who lord over him in reservist. A class act loser.</p>

              <p>You see, we are talking about signing on Navy being wise or not. </p>
              <p>I say if you sign on "Naval diver" is good, because the careerpath is from Naval diver (5 years) -&gt; commerial diver (10 years)/diving instructor is doable. </p>
              <p>If you sign on as a Naval engineer(be it officer/specialist) you can eventually be a Maritime Engineer or work in ship yard or sailor after one ORD. </p>
              <p>If you sign on as Naval gunner, you have not many place to go after ORD. </p>
              <p>If you sign on as Air force pilot/Engineer, SIA is a good place after ORD. </p>
              <p>If you sign on in Army (for certain vocations ) you can still end up in DSTA, DXO, ST engineering. </p>
              <p>Who care about the "mental stress" between vocations, there are not significant at all.  </p>

              <p>Ah, my appologies then.</p>
              <p>I just think that every job in life is tough and we should respect the people doing it. That's why they call it a job and not a hobby or something. Makes no sense to be comparing one to another.</p>
              <p>Well, it's ok to compare one job to another to point out the difference, as long as it's done objectively. But when it degenerates into arguments and name calling, I believe it's time to take a step back.</p>
              <p>Different people have different callings and it's not up to us to put them down. We should be supportive and share our own experience so that others might benefit from it instead. Having an online deathmatch in a forum doesn't exactly inspire confidence.</p>
