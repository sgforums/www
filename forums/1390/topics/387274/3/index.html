              (NS) Geroge Yeo is from the air force. I read that in times of
              conflict, the air force will be the first to be mobilized if I have
              not remeber wrongly. I have left the service a long time n I have
              not been called back for any duty. I read that army n navy food
              have become nicer. No idea regarding training, last time in tekong,
              there is fogging to kill the mosquitoes n recuruits kena forced to
              take malaria pills. Speaking about the food in the army, they said
              can also bring cooked food to field camp which I also experienced
              during my service. Even during a mission, there is also the cooked
              food brought to the field. I forgot that Mr Lim Hng Kiang is an LTC
              when he went to join the ministry.</p>

              <p>Lim Hng Kiang, George Yeo are all Army SAFOS. In fact, everyone knows that George Yeo was in Signals, around the same time as with Lee Hsien Yang. </p>
              <p>As for Peter Ho, I always thought he was an Army chap but looking at his big (unfit) size, I could be mistaken. He could be from Navy. </p>
              <p>None of the three is from Air Force. In fact, no air force SAFOS ever made minister. Maybe Ng Chee Khern will be the first.</p>

              <p>When you posted insulting comments, this will reflect badly on your image. Learn to look at yourself in the mirror before you say some1's English is bad.

              <p>I've always believed that the only person who is qualified to talk about a job is the person doing it.</p>
              <p>It's always easy to compare what you are doing with others and whine about how hard life is treating you. However, remember that life isn't kind to the other person as well. We are talking about a military organization here, there are NO easy appointment.</p>
              <p>I can only comment about Navy since I'm from that service. Sea sickness is something everyone will experience in varying degrees. If you're posted on LSTs (or Frigates for that matter) you probably won't to be sailing around Singapore. Waters out in open sea will still literally rock your boat. In Navy, sleep is really not the priority. Neither is holiday.</p>
              <p>I believe Navy and Air Force personnels deal with greater amounts of mental stress and our Army counterparts, physical. We each have a role to play, so why quarrel over whose role is tougher? Just be proud of what you are doing and respect others, imo. Makes us look less silly.</p>
              <p>Oh and that "Sun, sand, and sea" phrase? Try "Sun burns, sandflies, and seasick"</p>

              <p>I also got told by a regular that most of the jobs they got is property agent n real estate agent. There is a case of a former regular asking for a salary when he applied for a sales executive post although this former regular did not got any sales experience. In the end, the company decided not to shortlist any regular for the position. I really felt sorry for the regular esp those officer who became poperty agent, they got to face tough customers.</p>

              <p>In Air Force, only the pilot got some mental stress. I'd say not even the WSO has any. And neither do the people on the ground. You probably don't know this. I've got tons of pilot friends, and I know for a fact that their flying time is limited to a number of hours per week. How spoilt is that? no one is saying that there's no mental stress. But its clearly exaggerated in perception and highly moderated operationally.</p>
              <p>What "mental stress" does Navy have, sitting and sunning on the little boat all day?</p>
              <p>Do you happen to know that mental strength is used to overcome physical stress? If you've been through OCS, you'd know. Your segregation of mental and physical stress for the three services is thus moot. Which leads us to conclude that all three services require a level of mental strength to overcome all kinds of stresses.</p>
              <p>The only difference is the guys in air force and navy can be fat and unfit.</p>

              <p>The point I'm trying to make is that every job has it's own difficulty. More often than not, you will only hear complains from people about how hard their job is. In every organization, military or private, there is pressure to perform that increases exponentially as your rank increases. However, mainly due to the emphasis on safety, mistakes carry with it more repercussions (in the military) and this is true amongst the 3 forces.</p>
              <p>I'm not trying to convince you that Navy and Air Force personnels have monopoly on mental stress and Army, physical. I'm just generalizing.</p>
              <p>Maybe your friends have failed to mention this.. But do you honestly think that after spending millions to train them, the government would let them just idle away in the lounge room when they aren't on alert? You've been through Army life, you should know better than that.</p>
              <p>Also, you may categorize people in the Navy/Air wings as fat but you cannot call them unfit. Every in-service personnel is required to pass their IPPT every year or risk having their salary/promotions reduced/delayed.</p>
              <p>But if you're dead set on the sterotype of 'Officers/regulars are useless', 'Army &gt; Navy/Air force', 'Navy/Air force personnels are weak, fat, unfit, and useless', then by all means, don't let what I've said change your mind. After all, I'm only a dumb regular :&gt;</p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S: If military was so easy, everyone would have chosen it for a career.</p>

              <p>tl;dr</p>
              <p>I've always believed that the only person who is qualified to talk about a job is the person doing it.</p>
              <p>It's always easy to compare what you are doing with others and whine about how hard life is treating you. However, remember that life isn't kind to the other person as well. We are talking about a military organization here, there are NO easy appointment.</p>
              <p>I can only comment about Navy since I'm from that service. Sea sickness is something everyone will experience in varying degrees. If you're posted on LSTs (or Frigates for that matter) you probably won't to be sailing around Singapore. Waters out in open sea will still literally rock your boat. In Navy, sleep is really not the priority. Neither is holiday.</p>
              <p>I believe Navy and Air Force personnels deal with greater amounts of mental stress and our Army counterparts, physical. We each have a role to play, so why quarrel over whose role is tougher? Just be proud of what you are doing and respect others, imo. Makes us look less silly.</p>
              <p>Oh and that "Sun, sand, and sea" phrase? Try "Sun burns, sandflies, and seasick"</p>

              <p>I read that the diver training is tougher n furthermore, the deputy commander of the SOTF is from naval diver. The present defence minister is from navy n I think soon, he is going to be PM already. Regarding air force</p>
              <p>I thiught there LG Bey who is the first Air Force chief to be DDF also.</p>
