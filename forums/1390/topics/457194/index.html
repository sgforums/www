               If an NS-liable ITE pre-enlistee does not meet the deferment cut-off 
              age of 21 years old but is accepted into polytechnic, will deferment be 
              granted?</strong><br><br>A2: Deferment may be granted on a case-by-case 
              basis.  The pre-enlistee may approach the Central Manpower Base (CMPB) 
              to apply for deferment.  <br><br><strong>Q3. If an NSF with ITE 
              qualifications met the deferment cut-off age of 21 years old as at 1 Jan
               of the course commencement year and was accepted into a polytechnic 
              before enlistment, but chose to proceed with NS first, will disruption 
              be granted to him?</strong><br><br>A3: No. This is because he had an 
              opportunity to defer for polytechnic studies, but had turned it down to 
              proceed with NS first.    <br><br><strong>Q4. If an NSF with ITE 
              qualifications did not apply for admission to the polytechnics before 
              enlistment, will disruption be granted to him?</strong> <br><br>A4: No. This is because he had already been given the opportunity to defer for studies, but chose not to take it.<br><br><strong>Q5. How does an NSF with ITE qualifications apply for disruption to pursue polytechnic studies?</strong><br><br>A5:
               NSFs who are eligible for disruption may approach their respective unit
               Manpower Officers to apply for disruption. Disruption will be granted 
              in their 2nd year of NS. <br><br><strong>Q6. When will the revised deferment and disruption policies be implemented?</strong><br><br>A6: The revised policies will be implemented for all NS-liable ITE students graduating from Dec 2011 onwards.<br><br><strong>Q7.
               Do the revised deferment and disruption policies apply to ITE students 
              who are accepted into MOE-funded diplomas courses (i.e. Nanyang Academy 
              of Fine Arts (NAFA) and La Salle) and the ITE Technical Engineer 
              Diploma?</strong> <br><br>A7: Yes. <br><br><strong>Q8. Can a pre-enlistee who 
              already has a first education bar qualification be granted deferment or 
              disruption to pursue polytechnic studies?</strong> <br><br>A8: No. MINDEF 
              exercises flexibility by granting deferment from full-time NS to enable 
              pre-enlistees to attain up to first education bar before enlistment.  
              Hence, for those who have attained a first education bar qualification, 
              deferment and disruption will not be granted to pursue  polytechnic 
              studies.<br><br><strong>Q9. Can disruption be granted for NSFs to pursue private diplomas?</strong><br><br>A9:
               No. MINDEF provides added opportunity only for ITE NSFs to pursue local
               polytechnic studies, which is the mainstream educational pathway.   <br><br><strong>Q10. Can disruption be granted for GCE 'N'/'O' level NSFs to pursue polytechnic studies?</strong><br><br>A10:
               No. The current deferment cut-off age of 19 years old (for Sec 4 
              students) and 20 years old (for Sec 5 students) as at 1 Jan of the 
              course commencement year, would have provided sufficient opportunities 
              for them to pursue polytechnic studies before enlistment. <br><br><strong>Q11.
               If an NSF's polytechnic admission application was rejected prior to his
               enlistment, must he apply for the same institution during full-time NS,
               so as to be eligible for disruption?</strong><br><br>A11: No. The pre-enlistee can apply for different institutions before enlistment and during full-time NS.<br></span></td>

              <p>i would certainly pursue studies first then NS later...if time could turn back..</p>

              <p>our response to our govt should be this:- if you want greater fertility rates and increase their marriageability, put your men and sons in better competitve advantage in civil life than to waste their time in the forests , which in worse cases, expose them to high risks and accidents at age 18 or 20...</p>
