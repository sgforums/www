              <p>Hello forum ,</p>
              <p>So my enlistment date is on the 9th of Sept and i was wondering if there is anything i can do/join beforehand to better prepare myself. I'll be going for PTP as imo , since im a borderline - silver case , its best i enter PTP to further prepare myself before the real NS begins. I dont want to 'skip' 2 months and end up "dying".</p>
              <p>If the forum has any ideas whether there are such things as "Gym classes" or anything that can "force" u to go on a workout , please do let me know :)</p>
              <p>I found out im not the kind who can do all these exercises ALONE , i get bored REALLY quick. My close friends have all entered and without being forced / motivated , i have pretty much stopped exercising.. Im not one of those super fit guys and i dont wish to continue slacking up till the 9th.</p>
              <p>I have enjoyed enough and im ready to take on NS with a positive mind but i would not like to enter PTP as one of the 'weaklings' or so.</p>
              <p>With that , thanks forum :)</p>

              <p>First i will advice you to get silver for nafa. Its still early. Trust me, the 2 months reduction will be a relief. Maybe you will say its only 2 months ma but, You will realise when you enlist.</p>
              <p>Maybe more information on what stations are you weak in. For pull ups, just go to the gym and pump muscle and do pull ups numerous times a day. you will improve for sure.</p>

              <p>Okay , i have been running / exercising but it seems like its not 
                      working. I can barely meet the silver timing , and i can only do 4 - 5 
                      pull ups if i do not do a full one , i.e. i dont extend my arms fully.</p>
              <p>I
                       usually run from my home near the west mall to the gombak gym/stadium. 
                      What are the stations that you people use to fully utilise the gym ? 
                      Also , im pretty sure push-ups and sit-ups will be very common in NS. To
                       get used to the NS standard , how much should i be doing everyday / 
                      every 'session' ?</p>
              <p>PS : I have been getting very bad advices from 
                      my friends , since they have already entered the extra 2months for NS. 
                      And im really confused about all the 'methods' for exercising.</p>
              <p>EDIT : How is the extra 2 months like in NS ? I dont mind it being what some people would say -hell-<br>When does the "real" NS start ? Is the 2 months purely on getting ur strength/stamina up ? I seem to have no motivation to exercise alone. I feel that i should just wait and leave it to the 2 months and do my best there. Though at times , i feel that i should prepare so that i will not suffer during the 2 months.</p>
              <p>Question : Will i be fine if i leave it to the 2 months in NS to train me up ? Somehow i need someone to be there to force me into doing such stuffs , else id be slacking away...</p>

              <p>Up to you. When i did NS, i did the extra 2 months (PTP was it called?) because i couldn't pass the pull-up station only. There were people at PTP for all kinds of reasons; my 'buddy' could do close to 30 pull ups, but was there because he sucked at SBJ at that time.</p>
              <p>Whether or not you end up doing the extra 2 months or not, I still think its a good idea to try to get yourself into shape first. Its like tuition (sort of), you can not do tuition and just learn what you do off the classroom. People get tuition because they want to be better prepared, or get ahead. Up to you hey?!</p>
              <p>I think the best specific training for pull-ups is to do pull-ups. U can be super muscle'y or thin like a stick, but that doesn't necessarily determine your ability to do pull-ups well. Do the max you can then take 2-3 minute rest, then repeat. Do that 2 times everyday if u can and i think it will help.</p>
              <p>As for running, i dunnoo....just run like forest, run!</p>

              <p>Okay ,<br><br>I really like Loor's reply. That was my exact same mindset , to get into the 2months PTP just so i can make sure they train me till im ready. Sort of tuition.</p>
              <p>The links regarding workouts and fitness always confuse me. I guess my best bet would be to personally ask someone at the gym ( instructor? ) on how to work out. Else id still be looking at random answers online.</p>
              <p>No. of Push ups a day ? Sit ups a day ? Pull ups a day ? Etc. Etc.</p>

              <p>Sorry about that , i didnt mean looking/paying for a personal

              <p>A friend sent me a link http://hundredpushups.com/index.html<br> That was what i was talking about and im sure that there are many different techniques online. Is <strong>that</strong> viable ? I understand from many that push-ups does not help pull-ups 
              but , it does help a certain part of your body(not sure where/which).<br> Also , I have been looking around for methods for pull ups , running , sit-ups and such. Mainly on those that are tested for IPPT / NAPFA</p>

              <p>Actually I think best way of doing chin up still do everyday. Btw if u not improving everyday, then I think PTP will help for sure. I was running something like 12.40min in 2.4km back then after PTP I was running like 10.15min....I didn't expect I could run that fast.</p>
              <p>Same about 2.4 as for SBJ it's just technique....</p>
