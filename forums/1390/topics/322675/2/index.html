              <p>haha i did forget paiseh...</p>
              <p>Anyway i thought its normally the clerks that go over your side, i didn't know my S1 also goes over personnally. Shes quite 'motherly', alot better than the current S1 who is really CMI. The only thing the clerks like about him is he 5.30 sharp byebye, besides that don't know how to work at all.</p>
              <p>Slight correction, my HQ is same camp with you but i am attached out to semb camp and only goes back there for CO parade only :p</p>

              <p>I know her well cos she was the 1 talked to regarding my disruption application. Spoke to her during 1 of our batt events. We just met that time but after that, the times i go down to camp and see her, she still remembers me and will update me on the situation etc even though it was the docu clerk that was working with me on it.</p>
              <p>Really dunno how he got his MWO but heard he was a previous RSM or something and before that he was always doing ground work. This is his first time in more administrative work and he is totally not suited to it from what all the clerks say. SWO Mary was alot more efficient than this MWO.</p>
              <p>I have only joined 1 live activty at your camp as far as i remember, the 1 where the former Comm 9DIV/INF was there and i think it involved the entire camp personnel so never ever see her on live runs.</p>
