              <p>godnoes's point is that the gay guy is a farmer, like the Ong Chun Kiat molester who has been reported in ST, yet he has the shame to call Ong a disgrace and thought Ong is a 'scholar' when they have both done the same crimes and are both farmers, see the triple whammy irony?? just that one got reported in the news while the other got away. what is dumb and common to both farmers is that u have morons in both cases believing that they r high fliers when they are immoral and perverted farmers. funny that the gay dude can't spell "high flier" and dreams he's one.</p>

              <p>As the world is trying to be more liberal in letting the gay community be able to blend in with everyone else, i do not think we should be specifically pointing them out and ruining their future unless they have perform any act that affects their own future.</p>
              <p>Gay, lesbian, straight, they are all human and no different from anyone else so i do not believe in letting sexual orientation become such a huge issue to cause them unequal treatment unless they themselves choose the ruin the chance given to them.</p>

              <p>What you said here is totally and completely inapplicable to this case, where the sexual predator ATA farmer (I did not list his name, rank or handle here ok?) who most likely victimised TS or his friends, not only did NOT declare to SAF his gay status, he purposely and consciously with painstaking efforts sought to ensure they can't do anything about it. The gay farmer's post history included a topic he started just to ask forumers how he can evade consequences from SAF for being gay.</p>

And what made me totally puke out was that he said Ong was "such a disgrace".. isn't that totally hypocritical?? i was just so disgusted by the hypocriticality i puked at my computer in disgust. No wonder his title for the Ong thread was "army scholar". Ong is a LSA farmer just like he is a farmer but he also think he himself is a high flier and called himself one..one of his threads was "what are teh consequences for gay if you are high flyer officer", u are right he can't even spell high flier when praising himself..dumber than a toad to spell high flier as high flyer, he think its like singapore flyer... oh my god he high flier LMAO who does he think he is? i think he is not even good enough to be compared with the faeces of Chan Chun Sing when BG Chan has diarrhaea..</p>

              <p>second, u said that enlisted boys are older than school girls. by only a bit. 18 for the boy, vs as old as 16 for a girl in sec 4. not to mention, girls mature faster than boys, this is proven by psychologists and apply generally, so dun try to dispute. so really, the so called 'older' thing u say, doesn't fly. do u know nowadays there r many school girls in sec school or upper primary conning older men in their 20s of their $..girls nowadays are not the same as girls in your grandma's era.</p>
              <p>your speech about discrimination agsinst a group of people is very touching but also doesn't fly. even if a homosexual doesn't supposely commit sexual crimes, what he does on a daily basis is already against the laws of the state, as well as the laws of nature. i guess if u try to deny this, u muz think that its natural to do that. it is not. the backdoor was created for removing waste (thats why both genders including animals have that for waste removal). thats why god or evolution depending on your taste, created proper channels for procreation as well as pleasure in a woman. if that was natural, then the woman would also only have the backdoor and nothing else. the homo gene is recessive because they cannot procreate. if the whole world became homo, the world ends. in any case, even if they dun molest others, they are going to hell anyway so thats fine.</p>

              not to mention, girls mature faster than boys, this is proven by
              psychologists and apply generally, so dun try to dispute. so
              really, the so called 'older' thing u say, doesn't fly. do u know
              nowadays there r many school girls in sec school or upper primary
              conning older men in their 20s of their $..girls nowadays are not
              the same as girls in your grandma's era.</p>
              <p>your speech about discrimination agsinst a group of people is
              very touching but also doesn't fly. even if a homosexual doesn't
              supposely commit sexual crimes, what he does on a daily basis is
              already against the laws of the state, as well as the laws of
              nature. i guess if u try to deny this, u muz think that its natural
              to do that. it is not. the backdoor was created for removing waste
              (thats why both genders including animals have that for waste
              removal). thats why god or evolution depending on your taste,
              created proper channels for procreation as well as pleasure in a
              woman. if that was natural, then the woman would also only have the
              backdoor and nothing else. the homo gene is recessive because they
              cannot procreate. if the whole world became homo, the world ends.
              in any case, even if they dun molest others, they are going to hell
              anyway so thats fine.</p>

              <p>Dude, i brought up the point to illustrate that since they allow males in all girls schools, they should allow homosexuals in high-ranking positions in SAF, not comparing whether it is easier for one or the other to report as i believe it is equally difficult for both, just different circumstances. You were the one who said that NS men has more difficulties reporting such instances whereus i feel that there's really no comparison as to whether it is easier for NS men or young school girls to report due to the different basis.</p>
              <p><br>And ever heard of all girls primary schools? And besides, there are also 13-15 years old girls and not just 16 years old girls in secondary schools.</p>
              <p>It's fine if you feel that homosexualism is unnatural and not right. But that does not warrant for hate speech or blatent discrimination against them.</p>

              <p>Please keep any discussion civilised without any name calling or i will be editing the posts. If things get too heated, i will be forced to lock this post.</p>
              <p>My views:</p>
              <p>I will agree with redwiner that whether a gay or a straight, both can commit sexual offence just like the school molest cases or even adults molesting ppl on buses etc etc.</p>
              <p>The actions of 1 person in that community does not represent the entire community and 1 foul act does not condemn everyone in that community. If we were to say just because a gay officer has molested his soldiers that all gays should not be allowed to serve in the army, can we say that all males should not be allowed to be teachers because 1 male teacher has molested a student? I've known a few gays who went through NS without causing any problems with most not declaring 302. Its more a matter of self control which is up to the individual and not the fault of the entire community.</p>
              <p>The level of maturity i would say should not be an issue. Such incidents could likely cause major distress for anyone regardless of age or sex. Either way they all should know its wrong and should have the courage to fight for their own rights. Army or civilian, such cases can still be reported and handled and there is no such thing as being harder in the army if evidence can be provided.</p>
              <p>However i would say that this is not the place to discuss about gay rights etc or their wrong doing. Such a discussion is better off at speaker's corner and not here.</p>

              <p>Yeah and that's the sad truth.</p>
              <p>It's just such a misconception that homosexuals are not masculine. I know of homosexuals who are definitely physically more able or masculine than i am but just because of such a misconception that they are feminine, it restricts their career in NSF.</p>
