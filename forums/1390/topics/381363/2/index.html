              <p><span style="color: #000099;">MAJ is hardly high ranking. On
              another note, the truth doesn't stay wrapped for long. The gay dude
              is right in his fears in that homosexuality, once exposed will
              affect his already lacklustre career much more.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000099;">For eg, if he had a CEP of LTC,
              he'd probably end up retiring as MAJ when they found out. There is
              definitely a rightful aversion to homosexuality in high places in
              the public sector and conservative private sector like GLCs and the
              legal, or even academic sector working in the
              universities.</span></p>
              <p>In the public sector, the armed forces comprising of almost all
              men and with a strong emphasis on masculinity would most definitely
              recoil from it. <span style="color: #000099;"> <br></span></p>

              <p>It depends on who you speak to.</p>
              <p>Most people I know would recognise that MAJ is a low to low-medium rank. MAJ can be reached by 27 years old, and it's not even at the 50 percentile point, since its the fourth officer rank out of a total of nine officer ranks (now 10, with the baloney senior LTC rank haha). Not to mention, how it's only one rank above CPT, and CPT is given to anyone and everyone automatically one year after they graduate from university. when I see a MAJ, I'd categorise that as the start of his career.</p>

              <p>I agree. I too want to a gay club once in Singapore, and in the US went to a pub that's not officially a gay pub but known to be frequented by gays. I went to the SG one to lend support to a friend's party. And I'm 100% straight.</p>

              <p>Thats fine. Maybe you are 1 of the few who are willing to listen to his sharing since not everyone is interested to hear about gay related stuff even if they can accept the friend's sexual orientation.</p>
              <p>I agree that gay or straights. Their sexual orientation does not change the person we know nor the reason why we hang out with. If the person is a good friend, i believe he can be trusted to not do anything that will harm the friendship.</p>
              <p>However there will always remain people who treat gays etc as a disease and will cut off all contact with even a close friend just because of their sexual orientation.</p>

              <p>Yeah, we have friends who just stopped contacting him after he came out to them. I don't really blame them though, it's not something everyone can accept, especially in Singapore's considerably conservative society.</p>
              <p>Perhaps in the future, even SAF can start accepting people regardless of their sexual orientation as they can do a job as well or perhaps even better than heterosexuals can. Then maybe Singaporeans will generally start accepting homosexuals. I've always believed that the government should take such steps instead of just waiting for society to change on its own, but that's just my belief. haha</p>

              <p>why the big presumptuous reaction from the other two? i only asked him whether he sees his friend TRULY the same after he outted because I too have a close friend who suddenly became gay. He talks about having sex with his partner to me sometimes, but in extremely general terms without details. I find myself picturing it (not in a good way), yet I do understand what he means by the friendship remains as precious. I think that its not possible to see the person in the exact same way, but possible that he means no less to you.</p>

              <p>as a commander, and someone who knows some gay guys as friends and how they behave and what their typical character is like, i don't think leadership is compatible with homosexuality, no offence to gays out there who hope to go to OCS. the basis and criteria of leadership and commanding and the most common characteristics you see in gay guys are totally at odds with one another.</p>
              <p>In any case, most gays I know loathe the army, much more going to OCS. a lot of them fancy themselves to be fun, artistic, and enjoy unmoderated and extreme concepts of 'freedom', 'creativity', many are hard party animals, and many engage in recreational drugs in clubs, and have traits that are in complete opposites to what is required of leadership (especially military leadership) like discipline, rigors, self-starter, far sightedness and big picture view - traits that are tied closely to army leadership, which commands the largest number of men under each unit among the three services.</p>
              <p>Of cos this is a general statement that applies to the majority of gays, not all. I'm sure there are some gays who have strong leadership qualities and also love army principles.</p>
              <p>Generally, gays loathe the military, their NS days, and whatever the army stands for. I once chatted with a gay guy i met in the Singapore. When I told him I was enlisting soon, he made no hesitation in releasing to me his hatred for everything the army and military life stood for.</p>

              <p>All he said back was that he found his no.4 uniform 'smelly'. I don't know how his gay colourful A/X or CK tight tees smell like in his closet together where he stores his handcuffs and whips, but I think the SAF no.4 has only the smell of my mom's detergent and it's terribly comfortable to wear.</p>

              <p>That's just a whole lot of generalisation.</p>
              <p>Regardless, whether they are true or not, sexual orientation should not deter anyone from rising up the ranks as the examples you have given are more of homosexuals not wanting to do well in SAF or NS rather than them not having the capabilities to do so.</p>

              <p>as a commander, and someone who knows some gay guys as friends and how they behave and what their typical character is like, i don't think leadership is compatible with homosexuality, no offence to gays out there who hope to go to OCS. the basis and criteria of leadership and commanding and the most common characteristics you see in gay guys are totally at odds with one another.</p>
              <p>In any case, most gays I know loathe the army, much more going to OCS. a lot of them fancy themselves to be fun, artistic, and enjoy unmoderated and extreme concepts of 'freedom', 'creativity', many are hard party animals, and many engage in recreational drugs in clubs, and have traits that are in complete opposites to what is required of leadership (especially military leadership) like discipline, rigors, self-starter, far sightedness and big picture view - traits that are tied closely to army leadership, which commands the largest number of men under each unit among the three services.</p>
              <p>Of cos this is a general statement that applies to the majority of gays, not all. I'm sure there are some gays who have strong leadership qualities and also love army principles.</p>
              <p>Generally, gays loathe the military, their NS days, and whatever the army stands for. I once chatted with a gay guy i met in the Singapore. When I told him I was enlisting soon, he made no hesitation in releasing to me his hatred for everything the army and military life stood for.</p>
              <p>I tried to diffuse the tension by quipping well, gays all over the world, i'm sure it isn't different here in SG, do love various military, especially the army uniforms for role-playing purposes and fetishes.</p>
              <p>All he said back was that he found his no.4 uniform 'smelly'. I don't know how his gay colourful A/X or CK tight tees smell like in his closet together where he stores his handcuffs and whips, but I think the SAF no.4 has only the smell of my mom's detergent and it's terribly comfortable to wear.</p>

              <p>Sorry, but I have to correct your bigotry here. What you just typed are a whole lot of bullshit. Let me address some of your bigotry here</p>
              <p>1) "leadership is compatible with homosexuality"</p>
              <p>The basis of leadership lies in the traits of one's personal character and mindset. It has nothing to do with one's orientation. One's orientation merely defines the preferred type of sex and has no impact on one's leadership abilities.</p>
              <p> 2) "</p>
              <p>In any case, most gays I know loathe the army, much more going to OCS. a lot of them fancy themselves to be fun, artistic, and enjoy unmoderated and extreme concepts of 'freedom', 'creativity', many are hard party animals, and many engage in recreational drugs in clubs, and have traits that are in complete opposites to what is required of leadership (especially military leadership) like discipline, rigors, self-starter, far sightedness and big picture view - traits that are tied closely to army leadership, which commands the largest number of men under each unit among the three services."</p>
              <p><br>One vocal minority is definately not representative of the majority. Just because you socialise with a few gays who dislike the military does not equate to the entire homosexual population of Singapore disliking the SAF. It is grossly incorrect to say "the majority of gays" dislike the army.</p>
              <p>I know alot of gays who ABOLUTELY LOVES the Army. The love to see sweaty hunky young guys exercising daily- and would love to indulge in those activities with them. They love the thrill of bathing naked with them. They are excited at the prospect of staying in camp overnight with a group of random good looking males confined to a small bunk. </p>
              <p>Although I would say you are correct that most gays are liberal and forward thinking. They, however, do not all engage in recreational drug use. In fact, your above statement easily applies to heterosexual males and females as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Generally, its safe to say that all males loathe the military for taking away 2 years of their prime time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) Heterosexuals friends I know store more than just cuffs and whips in their closet. They play with peppermint nipples, candle wax, sex dolls and fake boobs too. So what are you trying to insinuate when you say your gay friend has cuffs and whips in his closet?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To conclude, gays are equally good with their straight counterparts when it comes to possessing military discipline and leadership. In fact I would argue that histroy has proven that an army of gays would be more effective than an army of straight man.</p>
              <p>This was proven in ancient greece where the Sacred Band of Thebes managed to defeat armies 3 times their size. </p>
              <p>In fact I know so many regulars(CPTs and MAJ/1WO) that didnt declare their orientation- especially warrant officers. They possess more passion in doing their job as they genuinely like the environment and the job. Sadly, they came from a time where 302 was a taboo in society.</p>
              <p> Many of these gay/bisexuals officers command a far greater respect from me as compared to those straight officers who think they are very man just by signing on.</p>
