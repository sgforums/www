              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>orry, but I have to correct your bigotry here. What you just
                                  typed are a whole lot of bullshit. Let me address some of your
                                  bigotry here</p>
              <p>1) "leadership is compatible with homosexuality"</p>
              <p>The basis of leadership lies in the traits of one's personal
                                  character and mindset. It has nothing to do with one's
                                  orientation. One's orientation merely defines the
                                  preferred type of sex and has no impact on one's
                                  leadership abilities.</p>
              <p> 2) "</p>
              <p>In any case, most gays I know loathe the army, much more going
                                  to OCS. a lot of them fancy themselves to be fun, artistic, and
                                  enjoy unmoderated and extreme concepts of 'freedom', 'creativity',
                                  many are hard party animals, and many engage in recreational drugs
                                  in clubs, and have traits that are in complete opposites to what is
                                  required of leadership (especially military leadership) like
                                  discipline, rigors, self-starter, far sightedness and big picture
                                  view - traits that are tied closely to army leadership, which
                                  commands the largest number of men under each unit among the three
                                  services."</p>
              <p><br> One vocal minority is definately not representative of the
                                  majority. Just because you socialise with a few gays who dislike
                                  the military does not equate to the entire homosexual population of
                                  Singapore disliking the SAF. It is grossly incorrect to say "the
                                  majority of gays" dislike the army.</p>
              <p>Although I would say you are correct that most gays are liberal
                                  and forward thinking. They, however, do not all engage in
                                  recreational drug use. In fact, your
                                  above statement easily applies to heterosexual males
                                  and females as well.</p>
              <p>3) Generally, its safe to say that all males loathe the military
                                  for taking away 2 years of their prime time.</p>
              <p>4) Heterosexuals friends I know store more than just cuffs
                                  and whips in their closet. They play with peppermint
                                  nipples, candle wax, sex dolls and fake boobs too.
                                  So what are you trying to insinuate when you say your gay friend
                                  has cuffs and whips in his closet?</p>
              <p>To conclude, gays are equally good with their straight
                                  counterparts when it comes to possessing military discipline
                                  and leadership. In fact I would argue that histroy has proven that
                                  an army of gays would be more effective than an army of straight
                                  man.</p>
              <p>This was proven in ancient greece where the Sacred Band of
                                  Thebes managed to defeat armies 3 times their size. </p>
              <p>In fact I know so many regulars(CPTs and MAJ/1WO) that
                                  didnt declare their orientation- especially warrant officers. They
                                  possess more passion in doing their job as they genuinely like the
                                  environment and the job. Sadly, they came from a time where
                                  302 was a taboo in society.</p>
              <p> Many of these gay/bisexuals officers command a
                                  far greater respect from me as compared to those straight
                                  officers who think they are very man just by signing on.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Sorry for the delay, i've been busy. In one sec, after a quick perusal, i can see what you're putting across. Unfortunately, all i can say is that it has failed, and also has nothing to do with what I said. It doesn't address what I said at all.<br><br>To put it all into simple mathematics, you're saying orientation of a guy = refers only to his preferred sex partner and hence orientation of a guy =/= his leadership abilities.</p>
              <p>What I said and which I will say for the last time. There are inherent characteristics that define fitness for leadership. WHY do you think there are so many wannabes who wish to go to OCS, position themselves so hard during BMT, profess their desire to their commanders to go, but do not get to go?! it is because they were deemed to be unsuitable. We can agree that it is character and personality traits that determine fitness for leadership, and I have highlighted above, the general character and personality types of gays.</p>
              <p>Of course, there are some gays who are the exception, but this applies generally. You yourself said that they are " liberal and forward thinking", more so than straight men, hence there is a higher proportion of them who dabble in recreational drugs and other devious activities. The fact that u can admit that they're "liberal and forward thinking" means that you're admitting that there is a stereotype of character traits for gays.</p>

              <p>yes, I can imagine and think it plausible for gay guys to enjoy the army for the above reasons you highlight in such lurid details.. "love
              to see sweaty hunky young guys exercising daily- and would love to
              indulge in those activities with them. They love the thrill of

              looking males confined to a small bunk".</p>
              <p>In fact i had highlighted this earlier in page 1, if you had noticed, that a gay guy in the army, is akin to a fatso in a buffet, and hence the concept of allowing gay sex predators in the officer hierarchy of SAF is unacceptable since it allows them to have a visual and sensory feast everyday. In fact, it's not farfetched a notion if some of them signed on for this purpose. Is this the kind of officers you want in the force??</p>
              <p>I see you are feverishly supporting the idea of gay officers, and yet you admit that you know "lots of gays who LOVE the army" because of those gross activities that go on in their minds when they are in camp, as they mentally jerk off to the image of their platoon mates working out or during baths. Which you seem to not only condone and even support and think its super justified.. How nice..</p>

              <p>Well, i can argue that the pros outweighs the cons too but it's pointless judging by your response.</p>
              <p>All i can say is that there aren't many instances whereby homosexual SAF officers abuse their authority and sexually harrass young boys. Just because we hear of a few cases does not determine that all homosexuals will act the same way.</p>
              <p>It's as good as saying just because a NS men died during his service, NS should be abolish all together. Yes, precautions can and should be taken, but to completely disregard a homosexual's right, it's just blatent discrimination and unnecessary.</p>
              <p>And your whole speech about being a leader is really inspiring but totally misguided in this context. Yes, a leader may be forced to make a decision but it's not as though not allowing homosexuals to be officers or high ranking is the only way out. You say it's "for the greater good" but have you considered the fact that homosexuals may be as good or even better at leading than heterosexuals. And to take away their position and give it to someone less worthy "for the greater good".</p>
              <p>This whole argument reminds me of the "myth" that Malays in Singapore have barriers that hinders them from excelling in SAF. I understand the underlying motive or fear that the government has but i'm glad that this trend has gradually been shifting, with more malays being able to enter leadership positions in SAF.</p>

                                                          homosexual SAF officers abuse their authority and sexually harrass
                                                          young boys. Just because we hear of a few cases does not determine
                                                          that all homosexuals will act the same way.</p>
              <p>It's as good as saying just because a NS men died during his
                                                          service, NS should be abolish all together. Yes, precautions can
                                                          and should be taken, but to completely disregard a homosexual's
                                                          right, it's just blatent discrimination and unnecessary.</p>
              <p>And your whole speech about being a leader is really inspiring
                                                          but totally misguided in this context. Yes, a leader may be forced
                                                          to make a decision but it's not as though not allowing homosexuals
                                                          to be officers or high ranking is the only way out. You say it's
                                                          "for the greater good" but have you considered the fact that
                                                          homosexuals may be as good or even better at leading than
                                                          heterosexuals. And to take away their position and give it to
                                                          someone less worthy "for the greater good".</p>
              <p>This whole argument reminds me of the "myth" that Malays in
                                                          Singapore have barriers that hinders them from excelling in SAF. I
                                                          understand the underlying motive or fear that the government has
                                                          but i'm glad that this trend has gradually been shifting, with more
                                                          malays being able to enter leadership positions in SAF.</p>

              <p>No, I don't think homosexuals make able commanders in the armed forces, especially in the army. Much worse so in army than navy and air force.</p>
              <p>BTW, leadership in the three services are completely different, if you didn't know. In the navy and more so, in the air force, officers operate more like a silo. Pilots do not lead troops out in the field or command 800 men.</p>
              <p>In any case, the armed forces is a male environment, period. The mostly heterosexual males would feel most uncomfortable around gays.</p>
              <p>And for your info, there was a malay SAFOS about 3 years ago. And from army, no less. When there are those who are good enough, they will naturally be there. If there isn't, its cos there weren't any good enough.</p>

              <p>Well, like i said, your stereotype of homosexuals are so strong that it's pointless for anyone to argue otherwise. I just hope you realise that the person leading beside you (as you claim to be a commander) may turn out very well to be a homosexual. As argued earlier, there are many regulars in SAF who are homosexuals but just cannot declare due to the stigma against them. Maybe when you get to know one personally, you will understand what we are talking about.</p>
              <p>I do understand your fear that homosexuals may abuse their authority, but it's unfair to discriminate against the entire group just because of a few incidents.</p>
              <p>I did acknowlege that there has been a gradual shift in recent years. And in case you haven't realise, as much as Malays are slowly being accepted into SAF (Wasn't there a case recently whereby a malay officer or something made it to a high rank and it was all over the news?), it is still prevalent that many of them end up going to civil defence or the police force for NS. And wow, ONE malay SAFOS. And i have not seen a case whereby Malays are accepted into Commandoes or NDU. Is it because they aren't good enough? I doubt so.</p>
              <p>As i mentioned, the government may have realistic underlying motives for doing things this way, but it is a hindrance to those who genuinely have an interest in SAF and wants to persue a career in it.</p>

How do you know its particular to the armed forces? how about the OMS (recognised as the SAFOS counterpart for civilians as it's part of the 3 top PSC scholarships) who are in the ministries?

              <p>I never claimed that there are MANY more or claim that the
              commanders around us were ALL gay.  I just said that there are
              more than is known. You never know if the person next to you could
              be homosexual and that's what my statement was meant to be. That's
              why i found it funny you took it so literally.</p>

              <p>I've never said anything about gay people being deluded and thinking that they have the masculine traits for commanding. It's just such a misconception that homosexuals are feminine and that's what i've been trying to say all along.</p>

              <p>Anyway, there are evidence that homosexuality can be caused by genetics coupled with social environment so most of those change 'treatment' rarely will work well since it cannot remove the genetic component of the problem though i won't deny some people can force themselves to change. However an external change and an internal change are different and whether such changes are enduring and stable is still questionable.</p>
              <p>This is becoming a personal attack and no longer a discussion so i'm going to end this once and for all...</p>
