              <h1 class="clr">AWOL NSman Teo’s accomplice gets 6.5 years’ jail, 6 strokes of cane</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Ong Boon Jun and National Serviceman Dave Teo Ming were good
              friends. When Teo was caught with a rifle near Orchard Road last year,
              it was learnt he had earlier been with Ong who did not report the
              matter to the police.</p>
              <p>For being an accomplice in the incident, Ong was sentenced to 6.5 years’ jail and six strokes of the cane on Monday.</p>
              <p>Ong was with Teo in a Geylang hotel room before he was caught in a toilet at Orchard Cineleisure later that night.</p>
              <p>Ong’s lawyer, Amolat Singh, said his client realised he should have left the hotel room when he saw that Teo had the rifle.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Amolat Singh said: "He was looking forward to the minimum mandatory
              sentence of five years. As you have heard, he has been sentenced to
              six—and—a—half—years. It’s quite close to the maximum of seven years.</p>
              <p>"We
              will visit him in prison to take his instructions. As you know, we act
              on instructions. If he instructs to appeal, then we will file the
              necessary papers to appeal."</p>
              <p>Ong’s adopted parents and a cousin
              were also in court. Ong’s mother was visibly shaken, wiping her eyes a
              few times outside the courtroom.</p>
              <p>The judge said he had considered
              the facts and implications of the case. He said it was incumbent on Ong
              to report the accused, Dave Teo, to the police so that no harm would
              come to anyone.</p>
              <p>More so, the judge said, because Teo had told Ong he was going to commit armed robbery.</p>
              <p>Teo’s
              next pre—trial conference is on 6 March. For Ong, his sentence is
              backdated to the start of his remand last September. — CNA/ir</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Man with armed NSman Dave Teo appealing sentence</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The man convicted for not reporting on his armed friend, is appealing the sentence.</p>
              <p>Earlier this week, Ong Boon Jun was handed a six—and—a—half year
              jail term and six strokes of the cane for not reporting on Dave Teo
              Ming who had a stolen rifle with him.</p>
              <p>Ong met his lawyer Amolat Singh on Friday and instructed him to proceed with an appeal.</p>
              <p>Ong is appealing because he thinks the sentence is not fair and is excessive.</p>
              <p>Last September, Ong was with national serviceman Dave Teo Ming in a Geylang hotel, while Teo was carrying a firearm. —CNA/vm</p>

              <h1 class="clr">AWOL NSman Dave Teo goes to High Court on April 24</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The case involving national serviceman Dave Teo, who stole a
              military rifle and ammunition, will be heard in the High Court on 24
              April.</p>
              <p>A preliminary inquiry will take place then, to determine if the case will proceed in the High Court.</p>
              <p>Teo
              is currently facing three charges of stealing a rifle from his army
              camp, illegally possessing eight ’live’ bullets and carrying a knife in
              a public place in 2007.</p>
              <p>The 20—year—old army corporal was
              arrested in September 2007 at Orchard Cineleisure with a loaded rifle,
              after he allegedly disappeared from Mandai Hill Camp while on guard
              duty.</p>
              <p>Now in Queenstown Remand Prison, Teo appeared in the subcourts via video conference, sporting longer hair.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile,
              Teo’s friend, Ong Boon Jun, who did not report the NSman for possessing
              a stolen rifle and bullets, was sentenced last month to 6—and—a—half
              years’ jail and six strokes of the cane.</p>
              <p>Ong, a 22—year—old pimp, was charged with being in Teo’s company when he had the illegal items.</p>
              <p>The two of them had been in Geylang’s Champagne Hotel and Teo’s actions had sparked off a man—hunt. — CNA/vm</p>
