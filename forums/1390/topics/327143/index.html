Upon appeal by the prosecution, he was fined $1,500. Judge of AppealV K Rajah noted the need for a fine “as a matter of policy and ­precedent”. <br><br>On the other hand, Mr Amit Rahul Shah, 23, was jailed for three months. It is not clear why he received such a severe sentence, considering the benchmark of a $3,000 fine. Perhaps it was because he had not applied for a deferment, unlike Mr Shantakumar</span>. <br></span><br><span style="color: #ff6600;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">What is clear is that both men had voluntarily returned to ­Singapore to serve NS, with full knowledge of the charges they would face. In other words, they were essentially punished for not doing NS at the appointed time, and not for evading NS completely.</span></span> <br></span></strong><br>In response to a recent question in Parliament, Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean reiterated the policy of calling up NS-liable males when they turn 18, and the key principles of maintaining universality and equity in granting deferment from full-time NS to pre-enlistees still pursuing their studies. <br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span style="color: #808000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">In the Ministry of Defence’s view, all should be given the opportunity to attain their ‘A’ Levels, International Baccalaureate, polytechnic diploma or equivalent qualifications before enlistment, but not higher educational qualifications such as university degrees.</span> <br><br></span><span style="color: #666699;"><span style="color: #800080;">But is this policy outdated, in a globalised world with a growing Singaporean diaspora?</span></span></em></span></strong> <br><br>As more Singaporeans and their families settle down in other countries, whether due to overseas postings or otherwise, an increasing number of young Singaporean males will be growing up and studying overseas. It would be unrealistic to expect the educational systems in those countries, or their educational paths, to accommodate our enlistment policy. <br><br>Let me be clear: I am a strong advocate of the central role of NS in the Singapore psyche. <br><br>In 2006, I wrote a piece in Today criticising the portrayal in some quarters of Mr Tan as a “lost son of Singapore”. I firmly believe in the desirability of having all fit Singaporean men perform NS, and punishing those who do not. <br><br>NS is a compulsory obligation, and we must ensure its continued legitimacy amongst Singaporeans. <span style="color: #800000;"><span style="color: #008000;"><em>Even as I agree with Mindef on the principles of universality and equity, I wonder whether its deferment policy can be refined such that it remains relevant in a globalised world, without undermining those key principles.</em> <br><br>Failure to do so may result in Singaporean males resenting the institution of NS, which could then undermine its legitimacy.</span></span> <br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Of SCHOLARS and NS timing</span></strong> <br><br>If we were to ask Singaporean men what the true sacrifice of NS is, how would they answer? <span style="color: #993366;">I dare say it would be the two years of full-time NS and the subsequent reservist obligations. <br><br>I also dare say the timing of those two years — whether they are served before or after one’s undergraduate studies — would be far less important. <br></span><br><span style="color: #800080;">As it is, the Government itself allows some scholars to disrupt full-time NS to go for undergraduate studies. It seems arbitrary to say that scholars should be allowed to disrupt their NS, but non-scholars already in undergraduate studies should not be allowed to defer their enlistment.</span> <br><br>Yesterday, for example, it was reported that Mindef rejected a Singapore Institute of Management student’s appeal to defer his enlistment for three months to sit for his first-year exams first. <br><br>I believe we should distinguish between those who are unable to return at 18 years <strong>because of certain commitments or opportunities but do so upon the conclusion of those commitments or opportunities</strong> — such as Mr Shantakumar — <strong>and those who never return and do not evince any desire to complete their NS obligations,</strong> such as Mr Tan. <br><br>If a Singaporean male had gone overseas as a child — for instance, before he turned 15 — and upon turning 18 is undertaking or about to commence undergraduate studies, perhaps we should allow him to defer enlistment until he completes those undergraduate (but not postgraduate) studies, so long as he undertakes to return to Singapore and enlist at that time. We can also require a guarantor if needed. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">&lt;- This is where the $75, 000 NS Security Bond comes in.</span></strong></span></span><br><br>This would strike an appropriate balance between maintaining the universality and equity of NS, by having all Singaporean males complete full-time NS by their early 20s, and allowing Singaporeans who grow up overseas to pursue their goals without undue disruption. <br><br>And I think most, if not all, ­Singaporeans would be perfectly fine with this. </em><br><br><br><em><strong><span style="color: #999999;"><span style="color: #808080;">The writer is a Nominated Member of Parliament and corporate counsel, commenting in his personal capacity.</span></span></strong></em></span></span></span></p>

              <p>This is indeed an interesting read. <span><em>What I find most quizzical about the new changes to exit permits and deferment policies in the past 5 years or so.</em></span></p>
              <p>Prior to Melvin Tan's case, it seemed to me that many past-Singaporeans had happily exited to pursue undergraduate studies, either returning for NS or taking up citizenship. With this debarcle, I wonder if it will bring about a different mindset and pehaps a change in the labour skills market for the future.</p>
              <p>In all honesty, while I can understand the punishment (unfair educational advantage without MINDEF permission) does/or will this deter others from returning after undergraduate studies?</p>
              <p>Interestingly enough could this also have be a movement in controlling SAF's top heavy army structure of officers? After all it has been a general theme for OCS candidates to be well-educated.</p>

              <p>This perceived rigidity within the mindef is indeed consistent with government’s
              policy in "combating" the "brain drain" that our country is
              experiencing,</p>
              <p>Threes a widely shared belief within the ranks of our government that our foreign
              educated children, upon receiving undergraduate education on foreign soil,
              would be lulled and convinced to stay on and carve a career for themselves.
              Such a situation is in fact prevalent whereby I have friends whom studied for
              their bachelor's in the States or UK
              and etc chose to stay on and find a job despite their NS commitments back at Singapore.</p>
              <p>I neither condone nor approve such actions by my peers as I am absolutely sure that they have weighed the pros and cons of their respective decisions and I am not one to tell other people how to live their lives. However, its our government's draconian laws that are long overdue for a reality check.</p>
              <p>Singaporean family's, especially those who can afford to do so, are going to continue sending their children overseas to recieve foreign education whether the government likes it or not. It is however a fallacy to subject our children across the board with an outdated law and deem it only acceptable to perceived scholars by our state. (Not withstanding thise scholars who still break their bonds and stay overseas, such is the irony.)</p>
              <p>As the author rightly pointed out, this will only increase the resentment of the system instead of cultivating a sense of belonging in our foreign educated children which is left sadly wanting.</p>

              <p>i think there is a different between nation building vs the movement to evolve.</p>
              <p>But why not look at it from a different perspective of improving SAF as a fighting force.</p>
              <p>Would a higher educated and mature individual demonstrate a better leadership quality in the SAF even for NSM especially in these days and age of 3G?</p>
              <p>SG are good at applying technology superficially ( press the button to carry out action) but not necessary understand the full nature of technology. these days hardware are intergrated to the ground troops rather than adapting to user, brain is needed at the ground so that there is a linear comprehension at the ground level to show the crabs what is needed to see in the field.</p>
              <p>Personnally i still think that it makes no impact on education path and career path, as I have relative who complete education than served NS. But i think it is necessary for officier to have higher education, and maturity decision to lead.</p>

              <p><strong>Rejected: Teen's 5 appeals to defer NS Mindef turns down SIM student's pleas to sit for first-year exams first</strong><br>By Esther Tan<br> </p>
              <p>SINGAPORE Institute of Management (SIM) student Samuel Tan Chee Hong will not get to sit for his first-year examinations at the end of this year.</p>
              <p>By then, the youth, who turned 18 last month, will have been called up to begin his national service (NS).</p>
              <p><strong>Samuel joined the private educational organisation in the middle of last year, finished a six-month foundation programme and started his course in computer science at the start of this year.</strong></p>
              <p>But, last month, he received a letter from the Defence Ministry telling him to report for NS next month.</p>
              <p><strong><em>He has made five failed appeals to Mindef asking for a deferment. At first, he pleaded for a deferment until the end of his three-year bachelor's degree.</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong>When that was turned down, he made four further appeals seeking a three- month deferment to allow him to at least complete the first year of his course.</strong></p>
              <p>All have been rejected, even with support from Aljunied GRC MPs Cynthia Phua and Lim Hwee Hua.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mindef's replies to him all carried the same reason: Male Singaporeans aged 18 and due to enlist will be granted a full deferment from NS only to pursue educational qualifications up to 'A' levels, a polytechnic diploma or equivalent qualifications such as those from the Institute of Technical Education.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">NS deferment to pursue a university degree has not been allowed since late 2005, said Mindef spokesman Darius Lim.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>At the Budget debate in 2006, Second Minister for Defence Ng Eng Hen explained that, with more educational opportunities available now, pre-enlisted males can start their courses at any time of the year. This means many more Singaporeans are able to start university or other courses locally before they reach 18.</p>
              <p>Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean also reiterated Mindef's stance in Parliament last month. 'Allowing such students deferment would be unfair to the vast majority of their peers studying in junior colleges, polytechnics and other institutions who do not have the same opportunity to be deferred for their university studies.'</p>
              <p>Samuel's father, Mr Roger Tan, said his youngest of three sons had started the SIM course knowing there was a chance he would not get to defer. 'But we didn't want to waste time waiting for him to hit 18 before he started NS. It was a risk we had to take,' said the IT manager.</p>
              <p>He could have enlisted earlier, as teens aged 161/2 can apply for early enlistment. But his father did not want him to do that: 'Boys that age are too young, immature and slow to learn. The risk is too high and they will be more prone to accidents.'</p>
              <p>An SIM spokesman said the credits Samuel obtained in his first three quarters of the year will still be valid when he finishes his NS in two years' time.</p>
              <p>Since the start of the year, five other SIM students have had to stop their studies to enlist for NS. So far, all returning students have not had to pick up new modules to replace the old ones, the spokesman said.</p>
              <p>When contacted, a Mindef spokesman said it considers two main factors when facing a deferment request.</p>
              <p>One is the need to preserve equity in terms of educational attainment before NS. The second is the need to enlist NS-liable males for rigorous military training 'while they are young and fit'.</p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="color: #339966;">Mr Tan, 54, said his son was asking for a three-month delay and would be only half a year older upon actual enlistment.</span></em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="color: #339966;">'Even with a full deferment, he would only be 20 years old upon the completion of his degree course. He'll still be young and fit then,' he said.</span></em></strong></p>

              <p>Agreed, I think the only defence I had left on that point was for those within the finance field (Employers questioning about your two year gap, did you gain any related work experience and why should you be hired for the graduate programs/job compared to your 'foreign' peers; but on hindsight it seems <em>very</em> irrelevant in the context of <em>all </em>degrees avaliable.</p>

              <p>What is the rational for scholars to disrupt NS?</p>
              <p>If they sign on army scholarship, they will still need to complete their PC tour, and doing it as a 2nd lieutenant or as a captain(degree entry rank) makes no diff.</p>
              <p>Same reason for police scholars. they also need to complete their IO tour, and doing that as inspector or ASP(entry level for good degree) makes no diff.</p>
