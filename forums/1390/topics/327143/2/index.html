              <p>A relevant piece, given that there is a growing Singaporean diaspora and a need to reform National Service to reflect reality on the ground today, and to keep it relevant in times where we cannot afford to remain monolithic.</p>
              <p>Keep the discussion civil. Thank you.</p>
              <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p><span><em>Increasing number of young Singaporean males are growing up and studying overseas<br><br></em><em>Tuesday • August 12, 2008<br><br>SIEW KUM HONG<br><br>THREE years after pianist Melvyn Tan was fined $3,000 for not fulfilling his National Service (NS) obligations, the issue of National Service defaulters is in the spotlight again.<br><br>This time, two young men were convicted for staying outside Singapore without an exit permit.<br><br>Mr Shantakumar Bannirchelvam, 19, was initially placed on six months’ probation and ordered to do 40 hours of community service. Upon appeal by the prosecution, he was fined $1,500. Judge of AppealV K Rajah noted the need for a fine “as a matter of policy and ­precedent”.<br><br>On the other hand, Mr Amit Rahul Shah, 23, was jailed for three months. It is not clear why he received such a severe sentence, considering the benchmark of a $3,000 fine. Perhaps it was because he had not applied for a deferment, unlike Mr Shantakumar.<br><br>What is clear is that both men had voluntarily returned to ­Singapore to serve NS, with full knowledge of the charges they would face. In other words, they were essentially punished for not doing NS at the appointed time, and not for evading NS completely.<br><br>In response to a recent question in Parliament, Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean reiterated the policy of calling up NS-liable males when they turn 18, and the key principles of maintaining universality and equity in granting deferment from full-time NS to pre-enlistees still pursuing their studies.<br><br>In the Ministry of Defence’s view, all should be given the opportunity to attain their ‘A’ Levels, International Baccalaureate, polytechnic diploma or equivalent qualifications before enlistment, but not higher educational qualifications such as university degrees.<br><br>But is this policy outdated, in a globalised world with a growing Singaporean diaspora?<br><br>As more Singaporeans and their families settle down in other countries, whether due to overseas postings or otherwise, an increasing number of young Singaporean males will be growing up and studying overseas. It would be unrealistic to expect the educational systems in those countries, or their educational paths, to accommodate our enlistment policy.<br><br>Let me be clear: I am a strong advocate of the central role of NS in the Singapore psyche.<br><br>In 2006, I wrote a piece in Today criticising the portrayal in some quarters of Mr Tan as a “lost son of Singapore”. I firmly believe in the desirability of having all fit Singaporean men perform NS, and punishing those who do not.<br><br>NS is a compulsory obligation, and we must ensure its continued legitimacy amongst Singaporeans. Even as I agree with Mindef on the principles of universality and equity, I wonder whether its deferment policy can be refined such that it remains relevant in a globalised world, without undermining those key principles.<br><br>Failure to do so may result in Singaporean males resenting the institution of NS, which could then undermine its legitimacy.<br><br><br><br>Of SCHOLARS and NS timing<br><br>If we were to ask Singaporean men what the true sacrifice of NS is, how would they answer? I dare say it would be the two years of full-time NS and the subsequent reservist obligations.<br><br>I also dare say the timing of those two years — whether they are served before or after one’s undergraduate studies — would be far less important.<br><br>As it is, the Government itself allows some scholars to disrupt full-time NS to go for undergraduate studies. It seems arbitrary to say that scholars should be allowed to disrupt their NS, but non-scholars already in undergraduate studies should not be allowed to defer their enlistment.<br><br>Yesterday, for example, it was reported that Mindef rejected a Singapore Institute of Management student’s appeal to defer his enlistment for three months to sit for his first-year exams first.<br><br>I believe we should distinguish between those who are unable to return at 18 years because of certain commitments or opportunities but do so upon the conclusion of those commitments or opportunities — such as Mr Shantakumar — and those who never return and do not evince any desire to complete their NS obligations, such as Mr Tan.<br><br>If a Singaporean male had gone overseas as a child — for instance, before he turned 15 — and upon turning 18 is undertaking or about to commence undergraduate studies, perhaps we should allow him to defer enlistment until he completes those undergraduate (but not postgraduate) studies, so long as he undertakes to return to Singapore and enlist at that time. We can also require a guarantor if needed.<br><br>This would strike an appropriate balance between maintaining the universality and equity of NS, by having all Singaporean males complete full-time NS by their early 20s, and allowing Singaporeans who grow up overseas to pursue their goals without undue disruption.<br><br>And I think most, if not all, ­Singaporeans would be perfectly fine with this.</em><br><br><br>[b]The writer is a Nominated Member of Parliament and corporate counsel, commenting in his personal capacity.[/b]</span></p>

              <p>Haha, beats me as to what he saw. I blinked for a moment after reading Itedino comment O.o</p>
              <p>A.) I'm RETURNING to serve out of national pride.</p>
              <p>B.) I'm even questioning the possibility of serving in a higher/harder capacity.</p>
              <p>Read, think, than act my friend.</p>
              <p>Well its good to know there's a good chance even if it is random/probable. I think my last health check rated me as Class 1, so that's proberbly the PES A I've read on the faqs? Do they expect Cdo (or any other vocational associated) intakes to be BMT fit (according to vocation once again) on enlistment? I -barely- scrape through the gold standards on that NS resource site.</p>

              <p>Yes, you will probably go to ndu or commando, if you go to mono intake.</p>
              <p>Singapore have a shortlist of degrees they actually recognized, so they may not recognized your degree. but idf your degree is from a prestigious college(harvard , cambridge), than no worries. for others, you will have to check bah.</p>
              <p>The government is rich and inflexible, so you will probably get a local health check anyway.</p>
              <p>You wil definitely be assigned to a combat vocation if you pass your health check.</p>
              <p>For naval divers, you will need perfect eyesight too.</p>

              <p>Agreed, I think the only defence I had left on that point was for those within the finance field (Employers questioning about your two year gap, did you gain any related work experience and why should you be hired for the graduate programs/job compared to your 'foreign' peers; but on hindsight it seems <em>very</em> irrelevant in the context of <em>all</em> degrees avaliable.</p>

              <p>truth it is probably too generalized for all degrees. but i am sure you can always highlight the positive aspect of your experience when going for jobs interview.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only advantage about serving the 2 yrs first prior to higher education is that you can defer your reservist for a longer period.   </p>
