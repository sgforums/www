               Hey guys,
              
              Just a random thought, how does one get blacklisted in the army? I was thinking about it while revising through my school work just now. Is getting black listed equates to getting charged in the military court? I'm contemplating whether or not to sign on with the army though. Just a random question though.

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Military Justice System in the
                                      SAF</span></span></strong><br> <br> <strong>1. Overview</strong><br> The military justice system in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is
                                      expected to treat every service personnel fairly and equally,
                                      regardless of race, rank or vocation.</p>
              <p> <br> <strong>2. Multi-levelled Approach</strong></p>
              <p>The military justice system is based on the SAF Act, which was
                                      implemented in 1972. All servicemen are subjected to the SAF Act,
                                      SAF Regulations, and orders of whatever form issued pursuant to
                                      them.</p>
              <p>While discipline is paramount in the military, not all offences
                                      committed by SAF servicemen are dealt with by formal investigations
                                      and charges. Essentially, offenders can be dealt with either by way
                                      of informal or formal punishment systems.</p>
              <p> <br> <strong>3. Informal Punishment System</strong><br> Commanders are empowered to mete out informal punishments like
                                      push-ups and weekend confinement to servicemen who have committed
                                      disciplinary breaches, like being late, sluggish, or improperly
                                      dressed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>4. Formal Punishment System</strong><br> If the offence that a serviceman committed is of a more serious
                                      nature, he may be formally dealt with by his disciplinary officer
                                      by way of a summary trial, or brought before a subordinate military
                                      court (more commonly known as the General Court Martial or
                                      GCM).</p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(a) Summary Trial</span></em></p>
              <p>The offences that can be dealt with by summary trial are
                                      essentially military offences, such as absence without leave
                                      (AWOL), non-compliance with lawful orders or insubordination.</p>
              <p>Depending on the rank of the serviceman in question, and the
                                      type of the disciplinary body hearing the case, the possible
                                      sentences that may be imposed can vary, and these can include fines
                                      or detention.</p>
              <p>The summary trial is carried out in accordance with relevant SAF
                                      regulations, and the records of the summary trial are sent to the
                                      office of the Director, Legal Services of the SAF.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>(b) General Court Martial</em></span></p>
              <p>The General Court Martial exists as a separate forum from that
                                      of the summary trial. Unlike the summary trial, the GCM can deal
                                      with a wider range of offences, and can impose a wider range of
                                      punishments including imprisonment and discharge, on top of
                                      sentences like detention and fines. The GCM is also a more public
                                      and open forum, and its proceedings are conducted using similar
                                      legal rules and procedures as those used in a civil criminal
                                      court.</p>
              <p>Generally, only serious offences investigated by the Military
                                      Police Command, and which are referred to the office of the
                                      Director of Legal Services, will result in the accused serviceman
                                      being charged in a GCM. In such a case, a military prosecutor will
                                      draw up a formal charge sheet and present it before the GCM.</p>
              <p>General Courts Martial can be further sub-divided into two
                                      categories, namely the Panel Courts Martial - consisting of a
                                      President and usually two other members, and Judge Courts Martial -
                                      consisting of a single President only.</p>
              <p>Currently, the practice is for military offences to be heard by
                                      Panel Courts Martial, while civil offences like misuse of drugs and
                                      penal code offences may be dealt with by a Judge Court Martial.</p>
              <p><br> The current policy is also for an NSman, who is or was a District
                                      Judge in the Subordinate Courts, to preside in a GCM. There are
                                      currently 10 NSmen who have been appointed by the Armed Forces
                                      Council to perform duty as President of a court martial. They are
                                      rostered by the Registrar of the Subordinate Military Court to hear
                                      cases during their in-camp training. In the case of a Panel Court
                                      Martial, the other two members are rostered from among some 155
                                      military officers appointed by the Chief of Defence Force.</p>
              <p> <br> <strong>5. Ways to Seek Redress</strong></p>
              <p>There are numerous safeguards and avenues set out in the
                                      military justice system for an SAF serviceman to seek redress if he
                                      is unhappy about the punishment imposed on him.</p>
              <p>Generally, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with an informal
                                      punishment meted out to him may request a higher level commander to
                                      review the punishment, or request for formal disciplinary
                                      dealing.</p>
              <p>In the case of a summary trial, a serviceman brought before the
                                      disciplinary officer may elect instead to be tried by a court
                                      martial. Alternatively, an aggrieved serviceman may request that
                                      his conviction or punishment imposed at the summary trial be
                                      reviewed by MINDEF's Director Manpower (a delegated authority of
                                      the Armed Forces Council).</p>
              <p>In the case of a GCM, a serviceman may choose to be represented
                                      by a lawyer or an SAF defending officer if his case will be heard
                                      by a court martial. The SAF has about 200 trained defending
                                      officers. While an SAF defending officer comes free to the
                                      serviceman, he has to bear the cost of engaging a lawyer. At the
                                      end of the trial, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with the
                                      decision of the court martial may petition the Reviewing Authority
                                      (the AFC or a committee of its members) for a review of his case.
                                      The serviceman can also appeal to the Military Court of Appeal
                                      (MCA) for a reconsideration of his conviction, or his sentence, or
                                      both.</p>
              <p>The MCA, when convened to hear an appeal, sits as a panel of
                                      five members. Heading the MCA is a President, who is appointed by
                                      the Chief Justice. By law, he must be a person qualified to be a
                                      Judge of the Supreme Court. The current President of the MCA is
                                      Justice Choo Han Teck. Four other members - two civilian members
                                      who are qualified legal practitioners with at least five years
                                      experience each, and two senior military officers - make up the
                                      rest of the MCA. The MCA is the highest court in the military
                                      justice system.</p>
              <p> <br> <strong>6. Impartial Hearings</strong><br> It is important to recognise that the GCM and the MCA are tribunals
                                      headed by presidents who are outside the SAF chain of command.</p>
              <p>Being an "outsider", the president of these forums will hear the
                                      case impartially like any other civil criminal case. The
                                      proceedings in the GCM and the MCA are also heard in a public
                                      forum, and these military courts adopt many of the same legal
                                      procedures and safeguards as that used in the civil criminal
                                      courts. All servicemen formally charged with an offence can bring
                                      their case to these forums.</p>
