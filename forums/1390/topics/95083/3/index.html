            <div class='col-md body'>Ok... this isn't a dumb, but completely ironic.<br><br>When I was in Brunei, the senior medic there issued me with chemical ice-packs to bring along for outfield. I issued to packs to the section commanders and told them to take care of them. Being the garang soldiers we were, some of the ice-packs went missing. No joke, since each pack cost around $8.<br><br>The senior medic whacked me for one whole day. He raved and ranted about what a useless soldier I was, exclaimed that my parents brought me up wrongly, and - take note of this - that I had betrayed the trust of my country and should go to DB.<br><br>Obviously I was pretty sore at him.<br><br>Anyway, a few weeks later, I was doing medical centre duty back in Singapore. It was 7am in the morning. I was doing area cleaning when some bugger approached me from behind.<br><br>It was the senior medic from Brunei. His head was shaven bald. His face was grim.<br><br>It turns out that he was caught embezzeling funds allocated to his medical centre. No, this has nothing to do with the ice-packs. He diverted the funds for his own personal use. He was eventually ratted out and flown back to Singapore. He was at my medical centre for FFI for DB.<br><br>He spent a few months in DB. After which, he was demoted from 1SG to 3SG. That's my rank. Now I'm at the same level as him. I felt vindicated.<br><br>Bloody hypocrite..... He was the one who betrayed his country. I don't hate that poor-excuse-for-a-soldier, but I absolutely refuse to respect him.</div>
