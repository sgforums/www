            <div class='col-md body'>2 guys in my unit who are WWE fans and who didn't like each other apparently, decided one fine day after booking out to stage an impromptu wrestling match just outside the camp gates. The fight starter lousy, lost the fight, called police n ambulance, and made a big hooo ha of the whole incident. He got 2 weeks RP, the other dude went into DB 8 days. CO was not pleased with the one who went into DB, but even less pleased with the one who got the RP, for starting the fight n then getting the police(or trying to. luckily an officer from my unit came out and told the police they will settle it within the unit) involved.<br>The DB goer actually got something like 8 days of doing nothing in the DB while the one who got the 14 days RP got 14 days of hell from my CO.</div>
