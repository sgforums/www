              <p><strong>[UPDATED 10:15am 1 November 2014: <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Corrected, as the boot camp penalty
                  will be applied to those who accumulate three default
                  counts</span></em></strong> <em>and not just to those who skip IPPT
                  three times in a row]</em><br> <br> Starting next year, reservists who skip the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/Enhancements%20to%20NS%20IPPT%20Management%20&amp;amp;amp;%20Training%20System">Individual Physical Proficiency Test</a> (IPPT)
                  three times will have to attend a five-day fitness boot camp.<br>  <br> According to a report by <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/more-singapore-stories/story/tougher-penalties-nsmen-who-skip-ippt-20141031"><em>The Straits Times</em></a>, the soldiers will be
                  forced to do fitness training during the camp, aside from paying a
                  monetary fine.<br>  <br> Currently, offenders are usually spared from being confined to
                  detention barracks, but they typically are asked to pay a fine of $100.<br>  <br> The new penalty comes after it was made easier for NSmen to train
                  and pass the mandatory fitness test.<br>  <br> In July this year it was announced that the IPPT would comprise
                  three stations instead of five starting from April next year.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>By Jermyn Chow Defence Correspondent <br>Straits Times<br>Published on Oct 31, 2014<br><br>Confinement, the bane of conscripted soldiers here, will continue to haunt reservists who skip the mandatory military fitness test three times in a row.<br><br>Instead of a $100 fine - the usual penalty currently - citizen soldiers will soon be locked up in camp, "forced" to exercise and still pay a monetary penalty.<br><br>The new regime starts in January, with a five-day boot camp aimed at getting operationally ready national servicemen (NSmen) fit, said the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).<br><br>It comes amid recent efforts to toughen up citizen soldiers here and get them in shape.<br><br>Measures have also been taken to make the Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) less of a chore for NSmen who have to juggle family and work commitments. These include a stripped-down fitness test starting in April and more convenient venues to train for the test.<br><br>But despite giving them more leeway to keep fit, the military said it is inevitable that there will be persistent offenders.<br><br>"There will be a small number of NSmen who may not have a valid reason for not attempting their IPPT," the army's assistant chief of general staff (training), Colonel Ng Ying Thong, told The Straits Times.<br><br>Now, those who skip the IPPT three or more times are fined or risk being thrown into detention barracks - the army equivalent of prison - for up to a week. It is understood that recalcitrant defaulters have been spared the jail term and usually get away with a fine of $100.<br><br>The new confinement will "focus on teaching NSmen the different types of fitness modalities and fitness habits", said Col Ng.<br><br>He said the SAF aims to partner NSmen to lead healthy lifestyles and the fitness camp is a "constructive programme aimed at helping NSmen train for and do well in their IPPT". Barred from leaving camp premises, offenders will get fitness training and attempt the IPPT.<br><br>Col Ng declined to reveal the number of repeat offenders. It is unclear whether they will get their salaries from the Government when sent to boot camp.<br><br>The 2010 figures from the Ministry of Defence - the most recent available - showed that half of the 116,000 NSmen who take the test annually fail it.<br><br>The Straits Times understands that the idea of confining and forcing IPPT defaulters to exercise in camps has been on the cards since last year.<br><br>Several NSmen told The Straits Times they were briefed on details of the new penalties earlier this year. One of them, a 34-year-old insurance agent who declined to be named, said: "With all the measures to make it easier for us to train and keep fit, it will be foolish of anyone not to be bothered to do something and risk being confined."</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Why don't MINDEF consider IPPT done at Community Clubs instead of going to camp. Give the Reservist a 2 month period where he can go anytime within the +/- 1 month from official date to a Community Club near his home. Afterall, we can have volunteer officials at the Community Clubs to organize this on weekends. It will also build the community spirit as his family can also do the IPPT with him. The new IPPT only have 3 stations, so it is really quite easy.</p></div>

              <p>1.   
               The IPT in the Park trial aims to provide more convenience and 
              accessibility for NSmen by incorporating fitness training in existing 
              parks and stadiums near NSmen's homes and workplaces. Going beyond the 
              conventional fitness training, the IPT in the Park trial provides a more
               innovative, engaging and fulfilling training experience, through the 
              use of varied fitness modalities such as calisthenics<sup>1</sup> and plyometrics<sup>2</sup> exercises.<br> <br> <sup>1</sup>Form
               of exercise consisting of a variety of activities often rhythmical 
              movements without using equipment.  Common calisthenic exercises include
               lunges, jumping jacks, crunches, push-ups, dips, flutter kicks, plank 
              etc.<br> <sup>2</sup>A type of exercise which involves the explosive 
              contraction of muscles e.g. Seal Jumping Jacks, Hand Touches, Low Box 
              Lateral Shuffle.</p>
              <p>2.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Locations</span>. The IPT in the Park 
              trial locations are selected based on a population density study 
              vis-a-vis distance to FCCs and proximity to hospitals. The trial sites 
              are: (1) Bishan Park (North-East); (2) Punggol Park (East); (3) 
              Promontory@ Marina Bay (South); (4) Pasir Ris Town Park (East) and; (5) 
              Jurong Central Park (West).  The training sessions will be rotated daily
               across the 5 locations. Pictures of the training locations are shown 
              below.</p>

               The trial at the 5 selected locations commences from 18 Sep to 31 Dec 
              14. For the month of September, fitness specialists from Army Fitness 
              Centre will conduct the IPT in the Park sessions. From October to 
              December, qualified commercial fitness trainers will be employed to 
              conduct the sessions.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://lifestyle.www.ns.sg/image/image_gallery?uuid=81ae84e3-3e30-4450-b5c8-a9a1a54da7d1&amp;groupId=10401&amp;t=1411614962827" alt=""></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Table 1: Training Schedule</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">4.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Duration</span>. Each training session is approximately 75 minutes in duration with the following activities:</p>
              <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha; padding-left: 10px;">
              <li>In and out-processing/Safety Briefing and warm-up – 15 mins;</li>
              <br>
              <li>Fitness Training and cool-down – 60 mins.</li>
              </ol>
              <p><br> 5.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Medical Coverage</span>.
               A paramedic/registered nurse will be onsite together with an ambulance 
              to provide immediate medical response. Similar to all fitness activities
               such as IPPT test, Remedial Training or IPT conducted in FCCs, 
              participants in IPT in the Park above the age of 35 are required to 
              attend and clear their health screening prior to participation.</p>
              <p><strong>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</strong><br><strong><br>1. Are there additional locations or tie-ups with private gyms for IPT/ RT? Can NSmen do RT in commercial gyms?</strong><br><br>Fitness
               training outside of FCCs is not a new concept. Since 2008, the SAF has 
              been offering IPT at select SAFRA EnergyOne Gyms. NSmen can volunteer 
              for these programmes for a nominal fee. However, they must do their 1st 
              and last IPT sessions at FCCs as IPPT will be conducted for them. The 
              SAF will continue to explore additional locations for IPT to increase 
              the accessibility and convenience of fitness training for NSmen, without
               compromising training standards.  <br><strong><br>2. Are there plans to move RT out of the FCCs?</strong><br><br>The
               IPT-in-the-Park initiative is a trial to move the IPT out of the FCCs. 
              The trial will run from Sep to Dec 14 and will focus on  IPT. As this is
               still a trial, we will study the findings before we decide whether it 
              should be extended to RT. Currently, there are no plans to do so for RT.
               <br><br><strong>3. How are the locations for the IPT in the Park chosen?</strong><br><br>For
               the trial, 5 locations have been identified to provide fitness training
               for NSmen who are working or living in parts of Singapore that are not 
              close to our current FCCs. The 5 locations are: (1) Bishan Park (North);
               (2) Punggol Park (North East); (3) The Promontory @ Marina Bay (South);
               (4) MOE, Evans Road (Central); and (5) Jurong Central Park (West). 
              Together with the FCCs, we have more than doubled the locations island 
              wide from 4 to 9 venues for our NSmen to take their IPT.<br><strong><br>4. How do I participate in it?</strong><br><br>The
               trial will be open to all NSmen who are eligible for the IPT programme.
               NSmen who are interested in this trial can book the session at NS.sg or
               NSMobile from 10 Sep 14. As each IPT in the park session has a daily 
              capacity of 50 participants, registration will be on a 
              first-come-first-served basis. <br><br><strong>5. Who will conduct the IPT in the Park sessions?</strong><br><br>At
               the start of the trial, Fitness Specialist (FS) from Army Fitness 
              Centre (AFC) will be conducting the IPT sessions for a month. They will 
              be replaced by commercial Fitness Trainers (FT) from Oct onwards. <br><strong><br>6. Will NSmen get to experience the enhanced IPT when they subscribe to IPT-in-the-park?</strong><br><br>During
               the trial of IPT-in-the-Park, only Metabolic Circuit training will be 
              conducted. This training programme is also available at the FCCs. We may
               consider adding other training programmes if the feedback from the 
              IPT-in-the-Park trial shows a strong demand for the other programmes.  <br><br><strong>7. Will IPT-n-the-Park sessions count towards my annual IPT requirements?</strong><br><br>Attendance
               in IPT in the Park sessions will count towards the serviceman’s IPT 
              requirements. However, the 1st and 10th session of the IPT programme 
              must be taken at a FCC. <br><br>The 1st session consists of physical 
              measurement (BMI) for individuals, IPPT and setting of Personal 
              Performance Target (PPT). The 10th session consists of an IPPT.  The 
              IPPT needs to be conducted in an FCC with the Electronic IPPT Scoring 
              System (ELISS) that provide the most efficient and accurate assessment. <br><strong><br>8. How long will each IPT-in-the-Park session last?</strong><br><br>Each
               IPT training session is approximately 75 minutes in duration with the 
              following activities: In and out-processing/Safety Briefing and warm-up –
               15 mins; Fitness Training and cool-down – 60 mins.<br><strong><br>9. Will SAF be including more locations for the IPT-in-the-Park after the pilot trial?</strong><br><br>The
               SAF will conduct a Post Implementation Review (PIR) after the pilot 
              trial to assess the receptivity and effectiveness of IPT-in-the-Park 
              before finalising the number of IPT-in-the-Park locations.<br><br><strong>10. Who can I contact if I’m late for my training session?</strong><br><br>NSmen
               can contact the administration team from NSAD at 81255925. NSmen who 
              arrive more than 15 mins will not be able to join the training.<br><strong><br>11. How will this programme help raise the fitness level of NSmen?</strong><br><br>As
               part of the overarching SAF Fitness Framework, IPT-in-the-Park aims to 
              provide greater flexibility to help our NSmen in their training 
              programme, in this case by bringing the training closer to their home or
               place of work. With a programme closely aligned with that practiced in 
              the FCCs, we believe this will encourage more NSmen to participate and 
              take ownership of their fitness and stay fit.<br><br><strong>12. Will members of the public or non-registered NSmen be able to participate in the IPT sessions? </strong><br><br>No. The initiative is only open to registered NSmen. <br><br><strong>13. How do we in-pro/out-pro at the various locations? </strong><br><br>During the trial, staff from NSAD/AFC will be deployed to each session daily to administer the program.<br><strong><br>14. Do all the locations start at the same time? What time do the sessions start at each of the locations?</strong><br><br>For
               the four locations nearer the residential estate, we are expecting for 
              the NSmen to travel home before joining the session. Therefore, we are 
              starting the session a little later at 7 pm. As for the Promontory, we 
              will be starting at 1830 hrs.<br><br>The timings of the IPT sessions are as follows:</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://lifestyle.www.ns.sg/image/image_gallery?uuid=e4ec7be8-8be1-4693-955b-5cc806f1c298&amp;groupId=10401&amp;t=1411615970458" alt="" width="560" height="192"></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>15. Is IPT-in-the-Park training safe for NSmen? What is the safety coverage in the conduct of the sessions?</strong><br><br>The
               SAF places great emphasis in the conduct of our training sessions for 
              our soldiers. The professional trainers whom we employ for the conduct 
              of IPT-in-the-Park are all certified with a valid Fitness Instructor 
              Certificate (FIC) issued by fitness agencies recognised by Sports 
              Singapore or equivalent. There will also be onsite medic and ambulance 
              at every session to render assistance to any participant who is not 
              feeling well.<br><br><strong>16. How can we ensure that the IPT-in-the-Park initiative does not affect public safety and hinder public usage of the parks?</strong><br><br>The
               SAF has booked the venues required for IPT-in-the-Park and will work 
              with the relevant authorities to ensure that we do not hinder public 
              usage of the parks.<br><br><strong>17. What safety measures have we put 
              in place in view of wet weather e.g. Do we cancel IPT-in-the-Park when 
              there is a CAT 1 Lightning Risk?</strong><br><br>We will delay the start
               of the IPT-in-the- Park session for 30 minutes if there is a CAT 1 
              Lightning Risk. If the risk persists, we will cancel the training. <br><br><strong>18. Do you have a way to inform NSmen of a cancellation due to an impending CAT 1 Lightning Risk?</strong><br><br>The
               IPT in the Park initiative is a trial over four months from Sep to Dec 
              14. During the trial period, NSmen can call the SAF Call Centre or the 
              on-site administration team at 81255925 to check if the IPT in the Park 
              for that day has been cancelled.</p>

              <p>Why don't MINDEF consider IPPT done at Community Clubs instead
              of going to camp. Give the Reservist a 2 month period where he can
              go anytime within the +/- 1 month from official date to a Community
              Club near his home. Afterall, we can have volunteer officials at
              the Community Clubs to organize this on weekends. It will also
              build the community spirit as his family can also do the IPPT with
              him. The new IPPT only have 3 stations, so it is really quite
              easy.</p>
