              <p>Take my typical day today, everybody say I kena chao-dah like that. I spent the whole day under the freakin sun greasing lar.....derusting lar. You think your ship can last long in the seawater without mainteinance on the crew's part?</p>

              <p>It depends on vocation. As a gunner, I am expected to man the .5MG machine gun rain or shine while sailing for as long as 6 hrs straight with bullet-proof vest helmet blah blah. And as a gunner, with my chief as a chief seaman as well, I am expected to support his seaman stuff also, and that's a lot of physical involved.</p>
              <p>Other vocations involve a lot of brain-work and stress-management. Life is hardly fun.</p>
              <p>Edit: Seasickness? Har! The MGB which was just decommissioned is only 45+m. Really bad weather have to go home. The MCVs, PVs are only slightly bigger.

              <p>what abt navy chef? today i see the navy website then saw this vocation , the starting pay quite good with such a low qualification. ($1365-$1965) starting pay , although they spent the most amount of time on sailing. and their qualification to entry is only N lvl pass 1 subject.</p>

              <p>by signing on as a pure combatant, you will not be doing justice to your diploma. going combat-technician on the other hand guaranteed a better pay-cheque and a faster promotion. think about it. it's a pity though this is applicable to cetain field of engineering-related diploma only.</p>

              <p>Yes i do know the ex navy SAFOS but I don't think their presence in the cabinet or civil service or their success indicates that navy is physically tougher than army, which was the claim made by 16/f/lonely and what I didn't believe. Teo and Lui became who they were because of their intelligence, it doesn't mean make the Navy physically tougher than Army. Moreover, I also can name PM Lee, George Yeo, Lim Hng Kiang and Peter Ho as ex SAFOS from Army who achieved just as much, if not more than Minister Teo or Lui.</p>

              <p>I see a lot of misinfo.</p>
              <p>Take my typical day today, everybody say I kena chao-dah like
                          that. I spent the whole day under the freakin sun greasing
                          lar.....derusting lar. You think your ship can last long in the
                          seawater without mainteinance on the crew's part?</p>
              <p>Even the weather also want to huan-dui, KNN I sweat under the
                          sun suddenly rain, kao.</p>
              <p>It depends on vocation. As a gunner, I am expected to man the
                          .5MG machine gun rain or shine while sailing for as long as 6 hrs
                          straight with bullet-proof vest helmet blah blah. And as a gunner,
                          with my chief as a chief seaman as well, I am expected to support
                          his seaman stuff also, and that's a lot of physical involved.</p>
              <p>Other vocations involve a lot of brain-work and
                          stress-management. Life is hardly fun.</p>
              <p>Edit: Seasickness? Har! The MGB which was just decommissioned is
                          only 45+m. Really bad weather have to go home. The MCVs, PVs
                          are only slightly bigger. And even on frigates and LSTs still got
                          people puke like mad in bad weather. I myself feel like puking when
                          I do fire drills with the fireman suit and tank and mask and blah
                          blah in rough seas.</p>

              <p>You say you sweat under the sun and then suddenly rain? You really think that's tougher than army?? Let me give you a clearer idea.</p>
              <p>Army is also sweat under the sun suddenly rain + sweat under sun/rain while walking 40 KM in a super thick uniform that doesn't fend off the one million insects piercing through it AND carrying a 40kg+ full pack + a SAR 21 + leading 30 or 100 men (depending on whether you are PC or OC) and getting them to listen to you + managing the one million problems that crop up when you manage 30 or 100 men below the age of 20 who feel disgruntled and don't feel that they're serving the nation or there for good reason (loss of weapon, parts, men keng-ing ALL THE TIME).</p>
              <p>That is even before the mission starts. you ever tried chiong sua-ing in an army combat unit in INF, commando or guards before?? I am very sure you have not that is why you're the only one who's naive enough to think navy is just as tough as army.</p>
              <p>After the missions, when you are outfield for weeks, you lie down on the ground, you get all sorts of disgusting insects crawling into your uniform and biting your body all over, that's normal. You drink river water. you eat strange insects and processed food rations or your own processed food. Old soldiers even have bunsen burners in their field packs when they go outfield! You wear the same uniform to chiong sua in the jungle, walking for miles in the wood for up to 9-12 days (the longest ATEC I know) without access to what is now luxury - Bathing and Warm Meals.</p>
              <p>no matter how siong navy or airforce are, they always have access to a decent bath everyday and warm meals. the life i describe above is part and parcel of army life.</p>
              <p>Do navy and airforce have to do all this?!</p>
              <p>In army, you set up your own "tent" in the jungle when it starts to pour as you sleep. You bathe naked out in the open along a row of naked men in rundown overseas camps in overseas exercises. That is army. And army is regimentation. Navy and airforce, I'm sorry are more like nursery compard to army combat if you talk abt career soldiers.</p>
              <p>Please lah it's common knowledge. If army is not physically tougher than navy or airforce, why is it that we always hear everyone saying its MUCH LESS tough to sign on with navy and airforce whenever they talk to people who signed on or interested in signing on? You think there is no smoke without fire??!</p>
              <p>And that's just the physical rigour bit. I haven't even talked about the regimentation bit. Army is the most regimented service among the 3 by a large margin. This much anyone who has ever had anything to do with the SAF can testify.</p>
              <p>You don't tell me regimentation doesn't mean it's not tough ok?! Do you think such conscious incalcation of regimentation in a soldier is needed if basic human instinct is to be disciplined and obey authority without questions? Discipline and regimentation is the counter intution of basic human instinct that is why it is TOUGH. This is the meaning of regimentation. Renouncing your personal liberty and rights in order to bow down without question to a higher authority because you respect authority.</p>

              <p><br>Relax relax....I never said it was tougher.</p>
              <p>I merely said it's tough, but it's a different kind. You know how much we study? And emphasis is on quick-thinking and ability to relay information in a concise and coherent manner. Failure to do so even on a normal sailing can lead to an accident. There's no room for errors, much less in war. The NSFs who go to ship hardly find themselves lucky in many cases. The stress can drive them to tears and there was even a case of panic attack and kena sent to hospital in a fire drill. Donning your fireman suit and equipment with all the things you need to do to fight fire is definitely tougher than MOP 4, mentally. And we're talking about confined spaces and a rolling and pitching platform.</p>
              <p>And misinfo again.....water is rationed on some platforms. What bathe?<img title="Laughing" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"> And warm food? If enemies are attacking you you will eat at your station, even if it's packed for you?</p>
              <p>You really need to experience it yourself before you find out why the hell so many regulars who signed-on to the navy to siam the chiong-sua part later regret bitterly....</p>
              <p>Regimentation-wise of course the navy has less of that......many of the sailors are regulars who are already petty officers. What regimentation is there when all reach that level? But mai lgong lah.....you all wash toilet, likewise we always kena tekan. Wear DCBA gear run around the ship. Thank god my ship does not practice this crazy thing.</p>
              <p>Anyway you sound very very bitter.<img title="Laughing" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></p>
