              <p>There ARE female infantry specialists around. I know one personally. The senior medic in my unit is also a lady. Hats off to her. Everything we did, she did as well, and more. Rappelling, fast-rope, CSB, airborne...</p>
              <p>Sometimes during the late afternoons, can see some interesting stuff at my camp's swimming pool...but not my unit's personnel though. There was once i heard this girl complaining to her superior abt another lady colleague of hers while they were having a soak in the pool...wooo.</p>
              <p>All in all...i respect the lady combatants...but for the girls who sign on for easy money/easy life by using their feminine charms..even though you might look very hot running in your fbt shorts...i won't respect them.</p>
              <p>Oh and there's a thread somewhere out there, full of juicy stories about our female regulars and "happenings" in SAF camps....good luck finding out...if you do, don't post here, lest it attracts too much attention and some fella with nothing better to do at MXX will shut it down...cheers !</p>

              <p>Thanks for your views considering most of you are males. Since some of you have female comrades who did join the force and are currently serving, maybe you could invite them to share their experiences from  a more direct perspective. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              There's no answer to which vocation is the best for women. It all depends on the physical abilities and preferences of the individual. Women are allowed to joined all vocations, be it pilot, naval diver, guards, armour, etc (except for commando as so far it is the only unit that does not have any female in it). You are given the option of choosing your vocation upon expressing interest to sign on. However, your acceptance into the vocation will be based on interview/test with the specific vocation. (Therefore it is not true that you will get what you want)
              
              As for the difference between officer/specialist, they both have different job scopes. To simplify it, officers basically manage the troops in a more macro level, whereas, specialist is on the ground working together with the troops and training them. So it once again boils down to your personal job preference, as both roles can offer great satisfaction (No flaming guys... cause you know it can be true).
              
              BMT for women is almost the same for males except that IPPT standards is lower and there is no need to go through SIT-test (This explains the shorter BMT period). Moreover, since the cohort for women BMT is always much smaller than the males, training can be completed in a shorter time as compared to the males. (Think conducting a lesson for 20vs100 people). Other then that, the women BMT offers the same program as the male, including individual field craft, weapon handling, basic close combat training, drills, physical training, battle inoculation course, road march, first aid, national education, etc.

              <p>Hmm.. I have no idea that female specs don't have to do sit test-- during my BMT there was a woman who went through the whole Enhanced course with the rest of us-- I think she did the sit test too. But that may be a special case cuz she was the only female in the whole batch.</p>
              <p>Hellraiza: U haven't ORD yet meh? Heh I think I know who u are talking about-- she did her CSB last year arnd August right? I did CSB tt time also. She really garang soldier sia.</p>
              <p>Which proves that Cookiecookies assumptions are wrong-- I have seen a female senior medic do the full 32km CSB route march carrying about the same load as the rest of us, and she didnt get special treatment. Regardless of your own bad experiences with females in the SAF, take our word for it that there are good women soldiers as well, whether in the combatant role or not.</p>

              <p>Thank you. I knew that for a fact. WSO is NOT pilot hor, icystalk. I can believe that there is female who can be WSO, but pilot? Hmmmm Common sense will inform you that the G-force causes the uterus to droop. Did you know that even air stewardesses report reduced fertility frm air pressure after a prolonged period of flying? Good luck to the kebaya waitresses.</p>

              <p><br>lol...well i heard abt it before. but still i haf NO idea if its a myth or not. perhaps it is. women haf been found to be able to withstand G-force better than men you know? anyway, if a woman can be WSO (FTR) then of cuz she can be a fighter pilot. same G-Force wad. i'm not adding in any shit here, but im sort of the neutral guy. i agree with both sides in the view that 1) yes it isnt fair, BUT this is life. 2) there really are good female soldiers ard. i know 3 personally. 2 army, 1 navy. my buddy worked for one of them before.</p>
