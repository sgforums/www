Simple grammar taught in primary 2 and against the context of a person who gained admission into a law (humanities-based programme) school speaks of the standards of said school.

              <p>Save me the speech on how because I don't tell you which school, i'm scared lah, or it means i'm a farmer grad who secretly went to NUS lah or i went to Universiti of Perak. Lets just say even if I didn't, i could say I went to Harvard or MIT and you won't be able to say shit (cos you'll just look stupid pitting against that), but I won't. Why? Because I don't have to do that. <br><br>If I say I went to Yale/IC/LSE/Oxbridge/Cornell/Chicago/Duke/Northwestern/the list goes on, farmer graduates like you cry elitism and come after it with torches when the truth is, ALL non farmer graduates feel that way about farmer graduates. Why should my school run into the flames? <br><br>Why don't you muster the courage Mr tex? Open your eyes, i encourage you. Look around you with heightened sensitivity. Stop hanging around your farmer friends who are bound for their de-education like yourself. Why? Because once you're there, they'll be ALL that surround you. And then you graduate and go to work and the story goes on. At the workplace you meet a few who didn't go to farmer universities. And they keep quiet and don't tell you the truth. People like you i have met plenty. Their and your whole world consists of your China lecturers, more China PhD students, rote learning and a mean requirement that correlates with the production of 16,000 a yr, and most of all, with strong downplay on research interests because equipping students with basic work skills and meeting the state's need to churn out a specified number of graduates have to take priority. Because you only hang out with your type, you think making it to university at all is the creme de la creme of pursuit. That you're better than say, Australian graduates or poly graduates. It's time to wake up. Who knows if you're lucky to have, one day you will look back and thank me.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I just read your stupid reply below, because the thread is locked, I edited my last post and here's what I say to your delusions. LISTEN UP! WAKE THE FUCK UP! U NEED TO WAKE THE FUCK UP NUS FARMER! You suffer from the same FARMER DELUSION suffered by ALL the other NUS farmer graduates I know.<br><br>I need to point out to you. I did not apply for any scholarship. I knew I had to work for my family and cannot work for any other company or the government OUTSIDE. But I know large handfuls of scholars</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> in JC and university </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">and zillions of NUS/NTU farmer graduates from JC, military servitude in BMT and in Mindef as a clerk.<br><br>You say that ANY Singaporean in an elite foreign institution is only there and ALL farmer grads are NOT because of two things A) They are smart enough to qualify for a scholarship or B) they are rich.<br><br>From your statement below, I can tell at a glance that you think all the past and present farmers in the 3 farmer universities could have qualified for elite institutions. Which really, isn't the first time I hear a farmer saying. You're not the first farmer grad I met who sincerely hold to your heart the cherished fallacy that any farmer student here could have qualified for top US/UK schools. That the only thing separating you from a prestigious education is top brains for a top scholarship or $$$$$. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I say to you farmer, two things: WAKE UP and BULLSHIT!</span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br>Here's some stats for you at a glance.<br><br>A) NUS is made of LARGE cohorts, but what's the largest fac in every cohort? NOT medicine, which numbers 300-400. Medicine is the most selective of faculties. The rest? The largest fac in NUS is FASS, over 5100 people. Do you know what is the 1) mean entry requirement and mean calibre of the students there 2) the lowest common denominator (LCD) entry requirement and LCD calibre of the students there? Two words I can tell you. Horse shit. Please lah Sir. Do you think foreign grads do not have farmer friends from JC and sec sch? What about other facs like Building? Science? These are all the dumping ground courses in NUS. Building, industrial design and Science have the same mean and lowest common entry requirement and student calibre as FASS, which the 4 together make up more than 80% of the university. In short, the university is made up of dumping grounds (by top JC student standard). That's also why majority of students there come from lower rung JCs, and that's also why almost 100% of A level students have a place to study in any of the 3 universities. It's a close to 100% hit rate. Go figure. When almost all students who qualify and chose to go to JC have a place in any of the 3 universities, when the hit rate is close to 100%, and here you are harping about how going to these 3 dumping grounds is so selective, and the only thing separating these mediocre students from a good education is the lack of money?</span></p>

And that's its most selective course. Take a stroll in LSE and IC. I don't have to touch on Oxbridge. You wanna compare the mean and median student calibre and entry selectivity there with any of your 3 farmer schools which take in almost 100% of university-going Singaporean body. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In the UK, only the top 5 percentile among university applicants (not population cohort) qualify for LSE/IC. For Oxbridge, only the top 1 percentile. The rest are filtered to lower rung universities such as Hull, Southampton, Leeds. Thats because the UK has over 100 universities. The US? More than 2000 including community colleges. THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE that you don't see. And you didn't have the intellectual capacity to realise this. Hmmm why? Maybe the same reason why you're heading for de-education.<br><br>B) NTU is like another NUS. The most selective course there, accountancy has the smallest (but not small by top foreign university standards) student body size. Yet its graduates make only $2200 upon graduation, the pay of fresh auditors which almost all of them become. <br><br>What makes up a startling 85% of NTU's student body? We know it's its engineering fac. Which takes in the lowest common denominator of A level grads. Why Sir? Did you not hear and know this from your JC days about how NTU engin is the foremost dumping ground? people crack jokes to those who can't make it, saying hey it's fine at most just do engine in NTU lor.<br><br>C) The 3 farmer universities boast more than any university in the world, and without any substantiation. I will not compare farmer universities with top schools like Cambridge with 83 Nobel laureates or MIT with 73 because unlike farmer universities with no self-checking mechansim, I do. To compare farmer schools with even a 3rd rate US school like UCLA or Indiana draws laughs from SG foreign students.<br><br>Lets be realistic and go regional. In Asia alone, Australian universities combined have over 10 Nobel laureates to their names. So do Japanese universities at least 8. Hong Kong and China universities have 4 Nobel Laureates. The Singapore ones? ZERO. Its score and research achievements stand on the same tier as.. Universiti Teknologi Malaya and Myanmar University, the very same universities farmer grads like you mock (which you did in the thread)! Not knowing that you're the same as them. :)<br><br>Yet not only do the 3 farmer universities boast and lie about themselves more wildly than any of the universities in Asia, they do so more than any university in the world. <br><br>You need to wake to the fact that no one got so disgusted with farmer universities for nothing. The laughable newspaper ads, the ridiculous TV ad about some ang-mo girl screaming in delight upon finding an NUS acceptance letter filmed in Woodlands suburbs? The lack of any credibility and the not so bright students by and large. <br><br>BTW you prob need to know that Singaporeans from all walks of lives, including those who didn't go overseas, say that what really happened in the ad was that the girl's letters from Princeton and Yale were rejection letters. (She didnt open them in the ad). That's why she was so delighted a dumping ground took her.<br><br>You need to know that unless SG magically becomes the size of the UK or US, and has as many universities for there to have truly elite universities vs mass universities to take in all tiers and classes of its university-going population, there can be NO top nor elite universities in Singapore. <br><br>Your 3 state universities that hold the obligation to take in 100% of our university-going population except the brilliant who get top PSC scholarships, have to remain Farmer Universities. And you, a Farmer graduate. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Because the top 1 percentile that goes to Harvard is the same percentile anywhere else. Here, they take up the top PSC scholarships. Even if you were born in the US, you wouldn't have qualified for an Ivy League school because only the top 1 percentile of American university-going cohort there do. Because in SG, you fell out of the bell curve.The same bell curve of top 1 percentile applies in any country. Are you even smart enough to know what's the bell curve? Have you even heard of it? I'm sure not.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">There is nothing wrong with being mass or normal. Just know it. And don't boast.</span></p>

              <p>Before I start on my main point, perhaps I just point out one thing. I am not as bigoted as you to flame your university because simply put, I know that there's no point blaming a university for its lowest common denominator. Unlike what you think, your university does not deserve to get rapped for producing bigots like you.</p>
              <p>The appetiser's over. Let's proceed onto the main dish.</p>
              <p>So what if you are from overseas university? Do you happen to know what is the main difference between you and a "farmer graduate"?</p>
              <p>Money.</p>
              <p>Nothing more, nothing less. You happen to be able to pursure your degree at a foreign university simply because you had a scholarship (whether govt, private or Papa-Mama Scholarship) while the farmer graduates are stuck in Singapore because they have no monetary means to pursure their studies overseas. To put it more simply, the reason why you didn't end up like them is because you had more money or a scholarship.</p>
              <p>Laughing or ridiculing "farmer graduates" just because they failed to secure the monetary means to go overseas and study is bordering on telling them to "get out of your elite, uncaring and rich face". What have they done to deserve such ridicule from you? You might as well take your stack of money and slap them.</p>
              <p>You keep on harping on the fact that people from "farmer universities" are ridiculed by "ALL" non farmer graduates as if everyone had a choice to choose between either. Reality is, most of the local graduates have no choice but to stay local because their middle-class parents have no means of supporting their exorbitant overseas education fees without going bankrupt.</p>
              <p>Instead of being thankful that you were given the privilege (it's not a god-given right) to go overseas to study and return to contribute back to the society, here you are ridiculing the general populace who are stuck here because they have less stacks of currency than you.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans, as a whole, can stomach some form of elitism or social inequality because of the entrenched attitudes towards the scholarship system. Yet, you must not lose sight of the fact that everyone has a breaking point. Too much of social inequality will just forment discontent. Just note the reaction towards 2008's batch of PSC scholars when it was revealed that more than half do not live in public housing. Hardly a microcosm of Singapore's society cross section.</p>
              <p>If you were able to go overseas to study because your parents were able to support you, then fine. You are entitled to boast (not ethical or moral but money speaks volumes). If you were able to study at a non-farmer university because of a govt scholarship, don't forget that it was supported by tax revenues of the very "farmer graduates" you are ridiculing in the first place.</p>
              <p>Not everyone will get a chance or a shot to go overseas to study or, indeed, break into the upper echelons of society. When you have it, grab it. No one says that it's compulsory to contribute back or help others but at least do not ridicule those who didn't have the chance that you were given.</p>
              <p>That's all for the main course. To top it up with dessert, I am afraid a lot more populist rage is gonna spill out here but I will save that for another day.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself, what the difference between you and the farmer graduate?</p>
              <p>All I can see is, extra money and/or extra opportunity.</p>
              <p>It's just that fine a line.</p>

              <p>It's always amusing to see such issues coming out to the fore. What's more amusing is that there are people who actually buy into the argument that being a scholar or a farmer in a city-state straddling the equator, actually has become the overarching principle ideational determination of one's own Self and path in life.</p>
              <p>Get a grip, you chaps.Your life is what you make of it, it's that simple.</p>
              <p>Please take your personal disagreements elsewhere. Thank you.</p>
