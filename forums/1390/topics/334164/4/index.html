              <p>I did not assume that those were your only 2 examples but
                              instead questioned if your perceptions are unnecessarily restricted
                              by your lack of interactions real-world wise. Well, since you chose
                              to nitpick my doubts as assumptions, I have nothing to say.</p>
              <p>As rather not going to university, now may I ask you AGAIN,
                              which university did you come from? Such contextual information is
                              crucial in order for us to know where you are coming from and your
                              motive for your opinions.</p>

              <p>Do you think it's difficult for Singaporeans, whether local or foreign educated to have interaction with the poorly tutored and poorly educated local 'university' graduates? They are everywhere! Oh my god. How many of them are admitted every year? Do you know how big the intake is? Do you think we do not meet these badly educated Singaporeans socially? All the bottom of the heap back in school who go there after A levels. And of course in NS we meet them too. So don't worry about me not meeting enough local poorly tutored 'graduates' of inferior minds. It's never a 'problem'. in fact the problem is there are too many of you. Throw a stone anywhere in the streets and you'll hit one of your kind.</p>
              <p>More than 16,000 of you every year, about the same number as people who go to JC. What this means is almost everyone who went to a JC 'qualified' to become poorly tutored after. You think you're some exclusive, elusive club member like some PS?</p>
              <p>I could tell you my university, but you'll just think I'm boasting.Just look at how you so confidently dare me to tell you what my university is. You sound so proud of what's possibly the worst university in Asia, I bet you're one of those who cut out the little Times clipping and hold it close to your heart as you sleep at night?</p>

              <p>You really think you have a smooth path to the upper echelons? You're so deluded I don't dislike or laugh at you, but I pity you really.</p>
              <p>Every year, 400 farmers graduate from the 2 law schools here. big whoop. Do you think you're some President's Scholar huh? One year only 2 or 3? I can't decide whether to retch or pity you. Let's trot out more stats shall we? Besides the 400 farmers here, <strong>even more </strong>graduate from UK and Australia law schools. These are Singaporeans mind you, not foreigners.So you think you're so exclusive and such a big fuck? It's not like you're a SAFOS (in public sector) or a hotshot investment banker in London (in private sector) landing a paydirt job offer before the finance sector tanked. ST just reported yesterday gahmen is upping the number of lawyers here by a whooping 70% in the next 2 years. I got all this info from here http://sg.news.yahoo.com/cna/20090213/tap-849-singapore-acts-lure-overseas-tra-231650b.html</p>
              <p>Besides the immensely large injection of new law grads annually to Singapore, you will be further dismayed to know that the law society president, the solicitor-general AND the attorney-general ALL have foreign university education. Isn't the law soc president the LEADER of the private sector of your field? Well, he went to Oxford. So much for upper echelon. You can't even get to the upper echelon among your tiny little swamp.</p>
              <p>Upper echelon my ass.</p>

              <p>Why? Because I had the opportunity to go overseas but unlike

              <p>Perhaps, one crucial point I failed to mention is that your
                              analysis about farmers is accurate perhaps only to the government
                              and civil service. Your myopic vision has led you overlook the fact
                              there's something called a private sector.</p>
              <p>Not so sure about you but I ain't so silly to bitch and whine
                              about local grads being termed as "farmers" by foreign universities
                              which are frankly hardly any better. Foreign universities are not
                              necessarily better. MIT is foreign, so is Universiti Teknologi

                              bitter not being part of the "cream of the crop" that goes
                              overseas. It doesn't matter because I know very well that I have

              <p>Yet, I, unlike you, have the freedom to choose the "farmer"

              <p>As for SMS... Well no comments really because I have seen people who got it with very good results and people who got it with less-than-decent results. To discount the 90th percentile because of the 10th percentile is doing statistical injustice.</p>
              <p>And oh, don't compare yourself to Hugh Hefner or Einstein. It stains their names. I am just saying that you are just one bitter soul because you have no way to climb up the social strata ladder. You weren't even offered the escape route.</p>

              <p>Well, so says you. You are right. Those friends of mine who got
                  into LSE, cambridge, oxford with results similar to mine are wrong.
                  Maybe my tutor is wrong when she said that I could've qualified for
                  a top overseas uni is wrong because her 15 years' worth of students
                  is worth less than your opinion.</p>
              <p>As for SMS... Well no comments really because I have seen people
                  who got it with very good results and people who got it with
                  less-than-decent results. To discount the 90th percentile because
                  of the 10th percentile is doing statistical injustice.</p>

              do you know I am working now? How do you not know if I am not 1)
              serving my NS 2) not working 3) working for my father? Seriously,
              you're showing more and more of your farmer traits with every post.
              It just reeks of it man! Haha!!!!</p>
              <p>Now, you're egging me to make known what less straightforward
              people don't tell you to your face. What to do? So what if there
              are people who feel that way about farmer graduates? Buay song
              right? Live with it dude!</p>
