              <p>gahmen itself says that its the most prestigious after PS.
              http://www.mindef.gov.sg/scholarship/safos_intro.asp. SAFOS is PSC.
              SMS is not. And service chiefs blah blah all SAFOS, and of cos the
              SAFOS perm secs, deputy secs in ministries, they are CEOs of stat
              boards and GLCs,.and another thing if you r older and know abt its
              past recipients, where they go after SAF and many times, even
              before they hit 45, and also the publicity of people like He
              Ruimin, well yah. Our own PM is a SAFOS. so there.</p>
              <p>I also notice SAFOS given out very few, and a lot of SMS are
              given out and is even subdivided into dunno what psychology,
              engineering and SMS (girls) what not categories.</p>

              <p>Actually, for SMS, there are only 3 fundamental categories, combat, women and others (incl. engineering and psychology). Combat will allow you to enrol in prestigious military academies in other countries (eg West Point). Women is for, well, females. Others (ie engineering and psychology) are only labels to indicate your course of study and they are pretty irrelevant nowadays.</p>

                                                                          without being either.</p>
              <p>In the military context, SAFOS' CEP(Current Estimated Potential)
                                                                          is all the way to service chief and defence chief level. SMS and

                                                                          of the generals are SAFOS because there are simply not enough
                                                                          general ranks to go around. A realistic CEP for SMS will be COL,
                                                                          around brigade or formation commader at most.</p>
              <p>Now you might think that SMS is pretty big in SAF judging by its
                                                                          CEP. It must be balanced with the police and civilian equivalents.
                                                                          They are SGS(Singapore Government Scholarship)-Open and
                                                                          SGS-SPF.</p>
              <p>There are fundamentally 2 differences between these 3:</p>
              <p>1) SMS is the only scholarship other than SAFOS, OMS and SPFOS
                                                                          that offers you full salary during your course of study although
                                                                          your allowance is lower than SAFOS</p>
              <p>2) SMS is not administered jointly with PSC, unlike SGS-SPF. SMS
                                                                          is wholly administered by SAF with no dual track in the civil
                                                                          service. However, it is common to find former SMS scholars being
                                                                          seconded to Government-Linked Companies (GLCs) upon exit of
                                                                          service.</p>
              <p>Well that's fundamentally the facts about SMS. I can confidently
                                                                          tell you that these information are the most current as of this
                                                                          year because I have been offered SMS (rejected it due personal
                                                                          reasons) and I have friends who are holders of the above-mentioned
                                                                          scholars.</p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>You're spot on that SMS is the equivalent of SGS in the ministries in rank. And ATA(military) where you can only enrol in military schools like Westpoint or US Naval Academy is the same league as SMS. ATA is like SMS, subdivided into three different types from what I rem. The others are combat and engineering.</p>
              <p>ATA combat and engineering is one rank below SMS, they are no different from LSA people.</p>
              <p>The CEP of SMS does not mean that all or even most of the SMS will make General. Simply because CEP of SAFOS is often perm sec (which is higher than CDF), CDF or COA. Being that the COA/CDF position changes hands only every 3 years or so, many of the SAFOS hit BG and then go to the ministries as perm sec (PS), deputy sec (DS) or to stat boards/GLCs as CEO and directors. Basically, SAFOS crowd out the BG rank.</p>
              <p>teraexa: you made an error in no.1. Only SAFOS and SPFOS get full salary during studies. OMS does not- they only get the allowance that all overseas scholars including SAFOS and SPFOS, stat board, GLC scholars get. The full salary component come from SAFOS/SPFOS being uniformed and the cream of PSC (monetary uniformed bait). OMS is not uniformed. SMS gets salary but I rem the salary given is lower than SAFOS even though both may be the same age and thus same rank.</p>
              <p>SMS is a wholly SAF award, just like ATA and LSA. To answer the question of nokia_lover further who asked is the difference between SAFOS and SMS really big or just quite small, I believe SAFOS is the one set apart from any award in the SAF.</p>
              <p>For one, it's the most prestigious the govt has declared after President's Scholarship (overall and not just in SAF).</p>
              <p>Second, it's the only scholarship awarded by PSC. SMS is just like the rest, awarded in SAF only. I did not know about SMS until I enlisted. All JC students who attended scholarship talks and who researched for scholarships in J2 would have known about SAFOS and the other PSC top scholarships.</p>
              <p>Third, SAFOS is a top PSC scholarship, alongside SPFOS and OMS.</p>
              <p>Fourth, SAFOS is the only one that allows disruption immediately upon receiving the scholarship.</p>
              <p>Lastly and this is the most important one because what matters in one's careers is what YOUR BOSS thinks. Only SAFOS scholars are regarded as scholars in the SAF by the government/SAF.</p>
              <p>teraexa, I'm curious..can you name me some examples of SMS who has done well in a non-uniformed capacity in ministry or stat board or GLC? You said there are but I don't know of any, whereas for SAFOS they are everywhere and all holding extremely high profile and top posts, and the govt makes no bones to publicise them and their positions too.</p>
              <p>For eg our PM and 1/4 of the ministerial cabinet are SAFOS scholars. The PS/DS of Mindef are SAFOS scholars, not SMS. And SAFOS are all over stat boards and GLCs like CEO of STB, SLA, MAS, LTA, DSTA, MD of Temasek, DBS, chairman of Astar, etc. SAFOS's achievements in non uniformed capacity seem endorsed and supported by the govt but i've not heard a thing about SMS.</p>
              <p>This is because SAFOS is essentially a PSC sacred cow. It's a PSC entity. SMS, ATA and LSA are SAF entities. This is also what I meant when I said SAFOS are equal part employees of SAF, equal part of PSC. The exposure they get to Admin Service and ministries is unparalleled.</p>
              <p>I also remember that SMS is given out in very big numbers. In my year, close to 30 were given out and they are given out very easily too. 4As would get you an SMS because I know many with only 4As. Another thing: one can apply and try for the SMS over the course of the duration of his NSF, like a grace period of up to 3 years. If he fails, he can try again. I know a number of SMS who only got their awards after the first year of their NS or second and did not get it immediately.This is because SMS is wholly SAF, just like LSA and ATA. Anytime you like, when you enlist or sign on (as a woman), you can apply for these awards.</p>
              <p>SAFOS is a creme de la creme talent search exercise conducted once a year, at the same time every year, conferred to a select few, sometimes less than 5 and SAFOS scholars are flown off immediately after they get their 2LTA and sword.</p>
              <p>To put things into context, there are lots of 4As or poly people who get SMS. And who get it in subsequent years in their NS years. For SAFOS, most 4A, 2 S distinctions students in OCS cannot get. </p>
              <p>To reply why there are so many top JC students who also take up lower rung study award or why so many end up dumping ground courses or in mediocre local universities alongside non-top JC students or poly students is because there are over 1000 students per cohort per JC. This means RJ and HC alone would have over 2000 students graduating every year.</p>
              <p>The ones who become the cream of the cohort number less than what, 20? 30? 40? That's not even 2% of the combined A level cohort from RJ and HC per year. 9 out of 10 recipients of SAFOS, SPFOS and OMS are from RJ and HC although it must be stressed there are odd itinerant ones from ACJC.</p>

              <p>Yes it's 3 main categories. Combat, Girls and Engineering/Psychology. I know the third one denotes the course of study but do note that these officers normally take on vocations related to that categories, SAF did state that that is the reason they studied those courses, its for special operational needs. I've not come across a general with a psychology background by discipline before and certainly not one whose vocation is engineering officer in SAF. Overall I'd say SMS is more like ATA, which also has 3 similar categories and is not so much for high fliers.</p>

              <p>I didn't think it was very high. SMS is only equivalent to SGS (non-uniformed in ministries) and SGS-SPF (in SPF). I did not think that was very high, because I know for a fact that there is so much competition already among the many OMS in ministries, i can't imagine what its like for SGS or if they're even noticed.</p>
              <p>Govt also made quite sure that SGS's lower status than OMS is expressed in tangible ways eg OMS are automatically emplaced as MAs like SAFOS and SPFOS. SGS is not emplaced even though they're serving in the civil service and also overseas scholars. As a recent scholarship applicant, I'm sure you know this.</p>
              <p>Before OMS was cut drastically in numbers in 2002, there were 20 OMS awarded each year. Sometimes up to 25. Can you imagine the bloodbath? I know how intense it is because I've had one too many OMS friends complain about it.</p>
              <p>In the ministries and in SAF, local study award holders are not considered scholars.</p>
              <p>In the SAF, only SAFOS cum PS (President's Scholars) and SAFOS are scholars. Some of the SAFOS scholars refer to themselves as simply "OS".</p>

              <p>Overseas allowance for SAFOS, SMS and ATA SAF Scholars depends on where you go to study, not the scholarship. i.e If a SAFOS and a SMS are both studying in New York University, they will both get the same overseas allowance-- which is pegged to the overseas allowance given by the PSC.</p>

              <p>You want to elaborate and back it up? I know this for a fact from top brass, both uniformed and non uniformed.As well as actual OS, who we know are at the top of the pecking order and have access to top tier people. Think about it. The top brass and gens are SAFOS. Why would a person (the Gen in question) think of another person less than what he himself is as his equal? I knew an OS  CPT years ago, who only when asked by people in camp if he was a scholar, would he reveal to be one. Afterwhich the next question they ask is, "SMS?". Because SMS is very common and still quite everyday man. No one ever asked "OS?" i thought that was quite funny.</p>
              <p>I'm very sure that an SMS or ATA person would tell you otherwise, and if you were an SMS or ATA person, you'll think this way about yourself, because I have heard and come across many ATA people going around telling the world they're scholars, but of cos, no one else thinks they are. Hahah! it's SAF! ATA doesn't even figure anywhere.</p>
              <p>No one who has anyone else higher than him can be top. You can't be part of the top when you're below anyone else.</p>

              <p>You're spot on that SMS is the equivalent of SGS in the
              ministries in rank. And ATA(military) where you can only enrol in
              military schools like Westpoint or US Naval Academy is the same
              league as SMS. ATA is like SMS, subdivided into three different
              types from what I rem. The others are combat and engineering.</p>
              <p>ATA combat and engineering is one rank below SMS, they are no
              different from LSA people.</p>
              <p>The CEP of SMS does not mean that all or even most of the SMS
              will make General. Simply because CEP of SAFOS is often perm sec
              (which is higher than CDF), CDF or COA. Being that the COA/CDF
              position changes hands only every 3 years or so, many of the SAFOS
              hit BG and then go to the ministries as perm sec (PS), deputy sec
              (DS) or to stat boards/GLCs as CEO and directors. Basically, SAFOS
              crowd out the BG rank.</p>
              <p>teraexa: you made an error in no.1. Only SAFOS and SPFOS get
              full salary during studies. OMS does not. They only get the
              allowance that all overseas scholars including SAFOS and SPFOS,
              stat board scholars get. The full salary component come from them
              being uniformed and the cream of PSC (monetary uniformed bait). OMS
              is not uniformed. SMS gets salary but I rem the salary given is
              lower than SAFOS even though both may be the same age and thus same
              rank.</p>
              <p>SMS is a wholly SAF award, just like ATA and LSA. To answer the
              question of nokia_lover further who asked is the difference between
              SAFOS and SMS really big or just quite small, I believe SAFOS is
              the one set apart from any award in the SAF. For one, it's the most
              prestigious the govt has declared after President's Scholarship
              (overall and not just in SAF).</p>
              <p>Second, it's the only scholarship awarded by PSC. SMS is just
              like the rest, awarded in SAF only. I did not know about SMS until
              I enlisted. All JC students who attended scholarship talks and who
              researched for scholarships in J2 would have known about SAFOS and
              the other PSC top scholarships.</p>
              <p>Third, SAFOS is a top PSC scholarship, alongside SPFOS and
              OMS.</p>
              <p>Fourth, SAFOS is the only one that allows disruption immediately
              upon receiving the scholarship.</p>
              <p>Lastly and this is the most important one because what matters
              in one's careers in what YOUR BOSS thinks. Only SAFOS scholars are
              regarded as scholars in the SAF by the government/SAF.</p>
              <p>teraexa, I'm curious..can you name me some examples of SMS who
              has done well in a non-uniformed capacity in ministry or stat board
              or GLC? You said there are but I don't know of any, whereas for
              SAFOS they are everywhere and all holding extremely high profile
              and top posts, and the govt makes no bones to publicise them and
              their positions too.</p>
              <p>For eg our PM and 1/4 of the ministerial cabinet are SAFOS
              scholars. The PS/DS of Mindef are SAFOS scholars, not SMS. And
              SAFOS are all over stat boards and GLCs like CEO of STB, SLA, MAS,
              LTA, DSTA, MD of Temasek, DBS, chairman of Astar, etc. SAFOS's
              achievements in non uniformed capacity seems endorsed and supported
              by the govt but i've not heard a thing about SMS.</p>
              <p>I also remember that SMS is given out in very big numbers. In my
              year, close to 30 were given out and they are given out very easily
              too. 4As would get you an SMS because I know many with only 4As.
              Another thing: one can apply and try for the SMS over the course of
              the duration of his NSF, like a grace period of up to 3 years. If
              he fails, he can try again. I know a number of SMS who only got
              their awards after the first year of their NS or second and did not
              get it immediately.This is because SMS is wholly SAF, just like LSA
              and ATA. Anytime you like, when you enlist or sign on (as a woman),
              you can apply for these awards.</p>
              <p>SAFOS is a creme de la creme talent search exercise conducted
              once a year, at the same time every year, conferred to a select
              few, sometimes less than 5 and SAFOS scholars are flown off
              immediately after they get their 2LTA and sword.</p>
              <p>To put things into context, there are lots of 4As or poly people
              who get SMS. And who get it in subsequent years in their NS years.
              For SAFOS, most 4A, 2 S distinctions students in OCS cannot
              get. </p>
              <p>To put why there are so many top JC students who also take up
              lower rung study award or why so many end up dumping ground courses
              or in mediocre local universities alongside non-top JC students or
              poly students is because there are over 1000 students per cohort
              per JC. This means RJ and HC alone would have over 2000 students
              graduating every year. The ones who become the cream of the cohort
              number less than what, 20? 30? 40? That's not even 2% of the
              combined A level cohort from RJ and HC per year. 9 out of 10
              recipients of SAFOS, SPFOS and OMS are from RJ and HC although it
              must be stressed there are odd itinerant ones from ACJC.</p>

              <p>ATA is now known as SAS (SAF Academic Scholarship). Yes, they are considered half-scholars.</p>
              <p>SMS does allow you to disrupt immediately upon acceptance of the scholarship under 3 conditions:</p>
              <p>1) You are a SAFOS reject</p>
              <p>2) You have good service term results in OCS</p>
              <p>3) You have an overseas university place for that academic year</p>
              <p>As for the number of SMS given out per year, there's about 13 given this year (including 6 females) so I guess it's now cut down.</p>
              <p>As for SMS' CEP, CEP are CEP and many do not even make it. To get to BG as an SMS, you need to be excellent in your performance + there's space for you.</p>
              <p>For OMS this year, there are around 20 receipients (a bumper crop).</p>
              <p>For SAF scholarships, it is important to note one thing: the earlier you get it, the higher is your Route of Advancement. This is because you get to promote faster, not to mention a higher pay grade earlier. Hence, those who get it in their first year (those SAFOS and fast-tracked SMS) will mostly have faster advancement compared to others although it's NOT always the case.</p>
              <p>As for SMS receipients who have done well, sadly I must say I have no knowledge about it. Logically speaking, it would be foolish for SMS receipients to stay in the civil service because there are so many other scholars floating around. Doing well in the private sector, meanwhile, does not mean that the government will 'glorify' you because after all, you used a government's sponsorship to study, serve your bond and go off to the private sector - hardly the 'model' scholars who serve the government in the civil service.</p>
              <p>All in all, scholarships are nice to see, good to have, but bear in mind that you literally have to step over others to grab that piece of meat cos the competition is just that high. Also, you have to take into account the bond length. Many a times, scholars regret getting the scholarship (not only SAF ones) because they get bored and want to take up more lucrative jobs but their bond does not permit them to do so.</p>
              <p>Think thrice or more before applying for a scholarship. If your motive is to solely go overseas to study, then please do the organisation and you yourself a favour, don't apply cos your lack of passion for the job will harm both parties and cause much unhappiness.</p>

              <p>edwin3060, would suggest you read properly first the posts.</p>
              <p>Teraexa and I are talking about the salary component, not the allowance component.</p>
              <p>The discussion above is about salary, NOT allowance.</p>
              <p>Allowance is something that all overseas scholars get. SAFOS, SPFOS, OMS, DSTA, MAS, EDB, SIA, SPH overseas scholars get allowance to maintain their overseas living.</p>
              <p>It should amount to about S$2K or so per month.</p>
              <p>Salary is another matter and only the following uniformed ones get full salary during the duration of their studies (SAFOS, SPFOS and SMS). Non uniformed OMS which is much more prestigious than SMS do not get salary cos they are civilians. The salary component comes from uniform hardship.</p>
              <p>ATA gets salary without any allowance, damn lame. So these ATA people end up spending their salary as their allowance.</p>
              <p>SAFOS, SPFOS get full salary and allowance. SAFOS salary is that of a A level LTA, about S$2.5K a month in addition to their allowances. Many OS I know invested their salaries in a property or have a stock portfolio of over $100 to $150K by the time they graduate.</p>
              <p>SMS get salary but less than SAFOS. Not sure about their allowance.</p>
              <p>SAFOS's salary is still higher than SMS because SMS do not get bonuses and generous increments. That was what we were talking abt. Salary. Not allowance.</p>

              <p>I didn't know SMS had to fulfil conditions to disrupt immediately. I believe all SMS are SAFOS rejects because they are divided into 2 groups. The ones who got the SMS at the same time as the SAFOS people get their scholarships, and the ones who try at 2nd or 2.5 yr of NSF. The first group probably were in Delta scholar coy in OCS tortured together with the SAFOS potentials. The coy is there to sieve out the SAFOS scholars. The better lot of rejected guys may be offered the SMS- that's the first group. Second group of SMS probably did not even make it to Delta scholar coy during OCS, since they got their SMS later in NS life. The SMS people I know with poorer grades or not so smart ones belong to this 2nd group.</p>
              <p>I don't know any SMS scholars holding high profile positions in the ministries, GLCs or stat boards.</p>

              <p>On paper, last time even the sia suay PSC low rung teaching awards were called scholarships, if you want to know. It was called Local Teaching Scholarship.What is on paper in name does not translate to perception of the people that matter.Thats why no one in the civil service regarded them as scholars, but the OMS (teaching) and Education Merit Scholars were considered teacher scholars.</p>
              <p>Do you really think the cosmetic change in name makes a difference when everyone in SAF knows that it's cosmetic? Whether someone is a scholar or not, isn't decided by the word "scholar" on paper. It's decided by the value perception of his bosses. Do you think anyone thinks different of ATA since the name change? No one in NS is in primary school.</p>
              <p>I ask you the same question:Why would a person (the Gen in question) think of another
                                          person less than what he himself is as his equal? if you can answer me, come back to me.</p>
              <p>Another thing: if you were an ATA, would you dare to call yourself a scholar in SAF and outside? I sure as hell wouldn't. I know some who tell the whole world they are. What they don't know is the response behind their backs.</p>

              <p>As for SMS receipients who have done well, sadly I must say I
              have no knowledge about it. Logically speaking, it would be foolish
              for SMS receipients to stay in the civil service because there are
              so many other scholars floating around. Doing well in the private
              sector, meanwhile, does not mean that the government will 'glorify'
              you because after all, you used a government's sponsorship to
              study, serve your bond and go off to the private sector - hardly
              the 'model' scholars who serve the government in the civil
              service.</p>
              <p>All in all, scholarships are nice to see, good to have, but bear
              in mind that you literally have to step over others to grab that
              piece of meat cos the competition is just that high. Also, you have
              to take into account the bond length. Many a times, scholars regret
              getting the scholarship (not only SAF ones) because they get bored
              and want to take up more lucrative jobs but their bond does not
              permit them to do so.</p>
              <p>Think thrice or more before applying for a scholarship. If your
              motive is to solely go overseas to study, then please do the
              organisation and you yourself a favour, don't apply cos your lack
              of passion for the job will harm both parties and cause much
              unhappiness.</p>

              <p>The competition among the SAFOS in SAF and the OMS in the ministries from what I know is a bloodbath. Some (not all) would think nothing of backstabbing another to get ahead. Those that do not compete with integrity but they too complain it's a bloodbath and cutthroat. Because of this, back in JC people say for scholarships, the only ones worth accepting are the top 3 PSC ones- SAFOS, SPF version and OMS. Accepting the rest, like low rung stat board ones or others (SGS) will be a waste of time.</p>

              <p>Are you still feeding on this dream that's told to you on paper?</p>
              <p>Can you name me a non SAFOS officer whether is SMS or other farmers who are MA (Management Associates) in MAP or AO(Admin Officers) in the Admin Service?</p>
              <p><strong> All SAFOS are MAs. </strong>Thats why they get exposed to policy making at MA level while in service in SAF.<strong> </strong>MA is precursor to AO.</p>
              <p>Even stat board and SGS scholars (these 2 groups of people are not emplaced on MAP) are left out in the cold and the odds of any coming to the fore are miniscule.</p>
              <p>In their everyday work, being in ministries SGS are doing work infinitely more relevant to policy making (what MAP/Admin Service is all about) albeit at a lower level than OMS/MAs. What is the chance of a military personnel doing anything relevant for him to ever be considered for MAP/AS? I think is 0%.</p>
              <p>Stat board scholars traditionally are said to be marginalised. First, stat boards do not do any policy work since they are regulatory/statutory bodies doing the robotic legwork and orchestration while ministries are the brains formulating policies. All stat boards belong to a parent ministry eg STB and EDB under MTI, MAS under MOF, DSTA under Mindef and so on. MTI and MOF formulate policies (done by the president's and OMS scholars) and tell the stat boards under their respective charge what the new rules in town are, then STB, EDB, MAS do the robotic legwork. So stat board staff including its scholars only do robotic legwork done by other mediocre grads, no
                                                                              experience in policy making which is only done at Ministry-level.</p>
              <p>Second, worse still stat boards are totally independent of each other. If a DSTA staff wishes to go to MAS, he has to resign and then reapply to MAS. There is no transfer because all stat boards are independent of each other. What this means is a stat board scholars often finds himself stuck in a stat board, with no exposure and only one track movement, with no lateral movement.</p>
              <p>Only one group of people, the Admin Officers known as AOs have fluid movement and access to top positions in these three domains: ministries, stat boards  and GLCs (four domains for SAFOS AOs plus armed forces), gliding in and out seamlessly.</p>
              <p>OMS scholars work in ministries. Movement for them is extremely fluid. They are rotated among different ministries exposed to policy making of an array of portfolios from finance, transport, health to anything at all at the highest level. OMS, like SAFOS are auto MAs. MA is precursor to AO.</p>
              <p>Even though stat board scholars are marginalised and don't get any policy making participation and are stuck in one regulatory body with no movement, their work is still more relevant than military officer with no civil service exposure. If the chance of stat board scholars is already so gloomy, the latter group has no chance at all.</p>

              <p>Interesting discussion. Gloater, I'm super impressed by the amount of knowledge that you hold. It's like you work in the scholarship department! Haha.</p>
              <p>Just like to ask for some opinions. Although its not really relevant to the thread, but heck, I'll take the chance and try my luck.</p>
              <p>I cleared the interview for SAS (Military) , USAFA and I'm now waiting for the remaining test and interviews. (that I heard will be coming later.)  I'm faced with the dilemma of whether to drop it to a lower SAS (Academic) as I also have a place in Imperial College, Aeronautical Engineering. .</p>
              <p>USAFA offers the 2nd Best Aeronautical Degree in the US (Not sure how relevant it is to the rest of the world). The education that you'll receive is unique and probably can't find it anywhere else. (Test flight on t-38 and many other exposures to the USAF workings). One of the draws is that the entire cost of studying (food, lodging, clothing etc) is all provided for and on top of this, you get monthly salary and a small allowance every month. The 4 years spent studying will also be counted towards your year of service due to it being a military academy.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, Imperial College is a world reknown education institute, 4 years to obtain a MEng, Aeronautical Engineering. 4 Years of life away from all the military routines and nonsense, during which you'll also get to tour Europe during the vacations. The drawback is the money involved. You'll have to make ends meet using the meagre salary given. After the exchange rate, it's left with only about 1000pounds a month. After 4 years of education and tour, you'll return home with not much left in your pocket.</p>
              <p>One thing that I couldn't find out was, how much recognition is given to a 6year old (due to the bond) degree from USAFA? Due to the fact that not many Singaporeans went to USAFA, (16 graduated till date). Both colleges are attractive in their own ways and both awards have their draws. I've weighed all possible factors that each constitute and still couldn't come to a conclusion</p>
              <p>Although I do enjoy my work in the RSAF now, but its really tough to say what will the sentiments be 4years later.</p>
              <p>I'm a diploma grad and I did relatively well during OCS. I guess that OCS performance was the main reason why i was offered this award.</p>

              <p>It's not in the league of top scholarships but to get it is another matter. Pretty tough in fact.</p>
              <p>From what I know and what I have gone through myself, anything less than 4 As in A levels is sure not to qualify even for SMS board interview. Only if you are Sword of Honour in your course will you be given special consideration (even then you need at least 3 As).</p>
              <p>For the only poly grad that I know who was awarded, his GPA was a perfect 4.00.</p>
              <p>To be more precise, SMS is more like for people who can't qualify for SAFOS but are still academically inclined.</p>

              <p>On another hand, teraexa is right about the SMS bit. It's not easy to get it even though people consider it a farmer scholarship.

              <p>It's very crucial to ask yourself this question, do you foresee yourself working in the SAF all the way till 42/45?</p>
              <p>If yes, then go accept the USAFA place.</p>
              <p>If no, I will say better chill and consider again. The fact remains that degrees from military institutions are not recognised in the private sector in Singapore (one of my course mate was a SAS(military) scholar) As such, if you have an intention to leave after your bond or not so sure about your resolve to stay, I will advise you to take the Imperial option. You don't want to regret going to USAFA, finding yourself hard to get a job outside and forced to stay in the SAF (not good for both you and the organisation).</p>

              <p>I think you keep trying hard to convince us that it's difficult to get because you said you got it but the truth we all know is that it's a farmer scholarship. From your post here, I can see you define "difficult to get" purely on one basis- as long as it has rigorous academic requirements. The truth is because of the proliferation of 4As now, having 4As is considered nothing. Dun even need to talk about now. Even back when SMS was much easier to get in the late 90s when most of the its holders are merely 4As with no S papers, it's already considered nothing to have 4As. I mean look at the number of people with 4As nowadays for A levels. More than 2000 per cohort get 4A and above if you read the news. Having 4As doesn't even get you a stat board scholarship, so using "anything less than 4A" to claim that SMS is "difficult to get" doesn't convince me at all. In fact I'd be surprised if you told me that less than 4A now can get you the SMS. In my post in Oct 23, 1.01pm, I already said <em>"4As would get you an SMS because I know many with only 4As"</em>. <strong>To get only 4As and no S distinction is considered very bad results for an overseas bound scholar.</strong> This was the situation more than 5 years ago, I think it's even more so now with the ubiquitousness of 4As. Considered 'normal' now.</p>
              <p>Among my friends who have 2nd rate scholarships (defined as stat board or private organisations' scholarships aka non PSC SAFOS/OMS), all have 4As and at least 1 S distinction. Most, as in 90% of 2nd rate scholars have 4As and at least 1S distinction and 1 S merit. Pls note that only overseas scholars are considered scholars by the government (with the exception of the odd PS who wants to do med here). So the criteria you speak of isn't even good enough to qualify for a 2nd rate scholarship = stat board and private organisation eg SIA, SPH, Keppel types.</p>
              <p>I heard from my SAFOS friends that it's often the "army/military performance" bit that does them *the SMS holders* in. Many of my SAFOS friends said that they had JC schoolmates who were also doing quite well grade-wise, but after enlisting their BMT and OCS (Delta coy) performance weren't good enough and did them in, bumping them down.</p>
              <p>There was a guy in my sec school class, among a handful of less than 7 that were groomed for the skies by their teachers. In top schools like RGS, RI and TCHS, teachers of the top class would pick out about 5-10 students that they think have the highest potential for the skies to groom. Unfortunately when it came to the crunch, he couldn't even get an OMS and only became a navy SMS!! My friend, not among the 'selected potential hotshots' when in sec school got the SAFOS! Apparently it was BMT/OCS that did the other guy in. The other 6 got NOTHING. As in NOTHING!</p>
              <p>As we all know, SAFOS are OMS calibre guys who are also top militarily. To be SAFOS, a guy must already have an OMS offer in the bag. SAFOS, SPFOS and OMS are the top tier of scholarships in Singapore. All 3 are conferred by PSC. But in many quarters, people think that OMS can't even be compared to SAFOS. And its impossible to "fashion" yourself to get the desired scholarship because it doesn't work on a fixed formula. PSC often chooses all rounded people and not just people with perfect grades. For example. most PS have 4A, 2A1, 2 SD, not a perfect grade-this is a 'normal' grade among all scholars. Yet the 4A, 2A1 and 3SD person won't even get an OMS! He ends up getting some crappy nonsense like DSTA or Astar scholarship or some lau sai teaching award. In fact i know at least 2 PS that didn't get A1 for GP, considered the holy grail subject for a top scholarship (that with PSC).</p>
              <p>Contrary to popular belief of people outside the system, PSC chooses all rounded people and NOT people with perfect grades. To give an example, most PS or SAFOS have 4A, 2 SD or 4A, 1 SM, 1SD. But the TOP SCORER 4A, 3SD <strong>NEVER </strong>gets a top scholarship (SAFOS, SPFOS, OMS). Going by the consistent historical record of the past decades, these top A level scorers all end up with lower rung scholarships like some lau sai teaching award or Astar scholarship. This is true. Ask any teacher or top student in RJ or HC. <br><br>Another popular misconception is that the top PSLE or O level scorer (that 1 top person with the highest PSLE score like the malay girl last yr) go all the way as top and end up as PS after A levels. In fact the reverse is true. The top PSLE or O Level scorer often end up, like the top A level scorer, mediocre. With either 1) some crappy teaching award 2) a lau sai Astar/DSTA/Firefly scholarship (where they rot in a stat board for eternity with no exposure outside) 3) rejected for all scholarship applications but got into top foreign university and there on own pocket or 4) in a local university with nothing.<br><br>That's why for people in the know (the scholars), they'd say "this person by odds, will probably fade into oblivion after JC" when MOE announces the top PSLE and O level scorer. People outside the system don't know this too, and many tend to think that the top graders are the people who make it by government's standards. But the opposite is true.<br><br>The people who make it are NOT the 3S distinctions people. They have the 'mandatory' 4As, 1-2 S distinctions, and 30 other qualities that can't be typecast or hothoused. In other words, PSC always chooses the 4A, 2S, OCS calibre, captain of debate team, in JC represented S'pore in science/math/humanities in a top US/UK university exchange programme, marksman and sportsman over the 4A 3SD person with nothing else. Between a 4A 1S with all those qualities and a 4A 3SD with none, they always choose the former.</p>
              <p>The PSs I know represented Singapore in Yale, Caltech, MIT when in JC. They're not the mugger toads with 4A, 3SD. Then the 4A, 3SD people I know ended up in one of those 4 outcomes I described above.</p>
              <p>The main diff other than that SAFOS is the top tier scholarship and SMS's equivalent is SGS, is that SAFOS is administered by PSC so their performance and AO calibre are monitored by PSC all the while during their service in SAF. They also get plum staff tours in J5, DPO and FSD. SAFOS are also auto-MAs so they are rotated in ministries as MAs and future AOs. But SMS is strictly under SAF only and within the SAF is always seen as second fiddle.</p>

              <p>Well, he was sent to Australia to "cold storage" cos of his bad temperament. If you gahmen and dunno what to do with something, you send it to cold storage far far away from Singapore shores. Something that is valued will be snapped up fast and placed at the epicentre of where it all happens- The ministries. They know they need the valued talent at where it matters. If not for his bad temperament, why kena sent to down under and not in Civil Service as minister like the SAFOS guys?</p>

              <p>SAS is ATA (Academic Training Award) renamed. The main diff between the military award and academic ATA is that the military one gives you allowance and salary but the academic one only gives you salary without the usual allowance that all overseas scholars have. So these people end up having to use their salary as allowance to survive. Y1w3i is therefore correct to say that his offer of SAS (military) gives both allowance and salary but SAS (academic) does not and leaves you poor. ATA (military) is higher rung than ATA (academic) thats why the former got allowance, the latter doesn't.</p>
              <p>Y1w3i, not sure why you described the allowance as small, the allowance should be standardised across the board. Overseas allowance translates to the same amount as salary according to my SAFOS friends. So if someone only gets allowance and not salary (like civilian scholars, OMS, etc) it's the same amount effectively as someone who gets salary and not allowance (like ATA academic holders).</p>
              <p>Of cos the SAFOS and SPFOS get both. So they spend the allowance like their civilian counterparts (OMS, stat board and GLC scholars), obviously you need to survive when overseas right. And they save and invest the salary. <br><br>Also note that ATA (military) is pegged to SMS. In other words, ATA (military) = SMS in the SAF, that's why it has both allowance and salary like SMS. I was told by insiders in SAF that SMS and ATA(military) don't get any bonuses or yearly increments while SAFOS and SPFOS do.</p>
              <p>ATA (academic) is pegged lower than both SMS/ATA(military), and probably not much better than LSA. ATA was also further divided into overseas and local.</p>
              <p>SAS/ATA are also not considered scholars in the SAF.</p>

              <p>Not all SMS are from D coy. As I mentioned above, there are 2 groups of SMS. The first group were in the D coy with the SAFOS guys. They were rejected for SAFOS and may be offered the SMS. The second group are people who reapplied for SMS over the course of their NSF years.</p>
              <p>As I said earlier, SMS, ATA and LSA can be reapplied for anytime during the course of your NS. After you are rejected you can try again. In fact many people who sign on after they finish their degrees eg girls or whatever, will be offered one of these, so depending on whats the best they can get with their calibre, they will be conferred with either of the 3 upon signing on.</p>
              <p>SMS is not in the same world as SAFOS. Ask anyone from RJ or HC</p>
