            <div class='col-md body'>you 38th BSLC??<br><br>Anyway.. I got the honour to be the rarer guys who gets to serve NSF as both BMTC Instructor AND unit commander.<br><br>And i tell you honestly, unit is MUCH better. I can list the pros and cons here.<br><br>PROS of BMTC Instructor<br><br>1. training is much lighter and you need not be part of the training.<br>2. you got more free time overall thru out the training phase.<br>3. There are "lull" periods where you might not have recruits for up to 1-2 months.<br>4. You get same pay for less work.<br>5. Your duties are much lesser.<br><br>CONS of BMTC Instructor<br><br>1. Your superiors are people who usually "cannot make it" or condemned already. So your chances of getting unreasonable superiors is very high.<br>2. If you are a new guy in the company, YOU WILL BE BULLIED into doing more duties.<br>3. The COs are cracking down on intolerable behaviours by commanders now.<br>4. You will have difficulty passing 2nd year IPPT<br>5. BMTC is very famous for a source of "extra" help, so if other units have some important events that needs extra manpower, your chances of getting it is high. e.g. the NDP carnival in 2005.<br>6. YOu will have to burn alot of weekends.<br>7. Your colleagues are very political with you and they then to be selfish.<br><br>PROS of a Unit sect comd.<br><br>1. Once you trained your men well and earn their respect, they can do YOUR work for you.<br>2. your men are fun<br>3. your men is willing to take the blame for you.<br>4. your men is willing to cover things up for you.<br>5. once the main bulk of training is done and after ATEC stage 1, you are much much freer than the BMTC instructor.<br>6. there is more cohesion between your CSM and your other specialists.<br>7. your offs are more regular than in BMTC.<br>8, you learn much more useful things in unit, not only military skills but human interaction.<br>9. GO other countries<br><br>CONS of a Unit sect comd<br><br>1. Unpredictable training schedule as S3 changes it as he sees fit.<br>2. due to smaller available personnel pool, your frequency for duties is more. actually depends on the camp you are in.<br>3. you are really responsible for your men, no such thing as "my recruit is stupid"<br>4. and wrong doings and extras come very fast.<br>5. more intolerable to mistakes<br>6. standard is demanded from you<br>7. Ops B. and Standby Ops.<br>8. tougher training, but you shouldn't have problem passing ippt year 2.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I mostly agree with Ponders' pros and cons.  I was a BMT instructor. I had close friends who went to units also. During my time, the SISPEC intake went to 2 SIR.<br><br>However, about interaction with people, I actually thot that in BMTC , you see a lot of people come and go.  I trained about 7 batches of BMT recruits , the last 3 batches as a platoon sgt. There are probably more people you encounter/ interact with but of course at the recruit level.<br><br>I also got to be deployed overseas ( but I was the minority who were nominated to go).<br><br>You tend to lose your skills/ knowledge and may have trouble going to a unit later during reservist.  But having said this, most instructors ( officers and specs) tend to get posted to the same unit in reservist later (e.g. in my time, used to be PDF infantry units).  So the standard expected of such a reserve unit will be lower and the commanders will give time for you to catch up.<br><br>If you like giving lectures and lessons and teaching others then BMTC posting may be good. If you want to be garang and learn to "fight", then the unit.<br><br>However, if you are an A level student and you  go onto university after serving NS, then you are likely to move on to the reserve holding list. The outcome for a BMT instructor may be different. Myself and many other  friends ( officers and specs) have ended up in "interesting " non- infantry units during our reservist.</div>

But not expected to "fight" as an infantryman. However, you will definitely be near or at the frontline... so self defence is important and therefore your individual skills as an infantryman becomes more important.  You will also learn the operating tactics and doctrine of the unit you are attached to (so for air force unit, you will learn what is an Air Tasking Order,  how to stack aircraft when there is a "traffic jam" in the air over you  ... etc etc)  That's all I can say.</div>

I was from Golf, the supposedly "support arms" company. And out of about 140, about 68 went to bravo. Anyway, the people who stayed from bravo bslc to bravo aslc was only like 5 or 6 out of a platoon of 50. SO u say 70%? Quite bullshit.<br><br>Anyway I totally agree that the lousier performers become bmtc instructors. Tink about it, why send good people to bmtc when they can go to units? It is usualy the most slack and lousiest and unrespected personnel that got posted to bmtc and NCC. At least, for my time. Not all though..<br><br>ANyway I'm in 1GDS..I'm not treated like men..haha..i've also got my recruits in now, for bmt, so I'm like a king..lol..but of cuz after that you got to be fair in how you deal with the men..and then the bond you make there will be far stronger and more useful.<br><br>Go unit..its a better place.</div>
