            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> <strong><span class="large">March 1967 - An event that changed the lives of many young male Singaporeans</span></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/pixhistory/combine2.jpg"><br><br>Today as we enjoy the relative peace and stability in our country, it should be noted that National Service (NS) has a big part to play in this. March 2005 marks 38 years of NS. For many, our fathers have done us proud in the defence of Singapore and now, it is our turn to receive the batons. It is timely to reflect on the sentiments and moods of the people when the NS (Amendment) Act was passed 35 years ago.<br><br>The NS (Amendment) Bill, 1967 was first read in Parliament on 27 Feb 1967. After a spirited debate in Parliament, the Act was finally passed on 14 Mar 1967.<br><br>Unlike previous failed attempts at NS, the 1967 Act held a special meaning to the leaders and people of Singapore. Singapore after 1965 could not rely only on foreign powers for protection. In fact, the British had by then signalled the possibility of withdrawing their forces east of the Suez Canal. The leaders knew there was little question about the need to defend Singapore ourselves, as far as was practicable. It was with that in mind that Prime Minister of the day, Mr Lee Kuan Yew and other Ministers appealed to Singapore citizens to support NS.<br><br>Not all people shared the same sentiments. The passing of the Act saw anti-NS marches, the most serious by some 300 people at New Bridge Road, Rochore Canal Road near Albert Street and Kim Keat Road. Tear gas shells were used to disperse the crowd and about 13 people were arrested.<br><br>Thankfully for Singapore, the majority of the population understood the need to defend it, having gone through the Japanese Occupation, the struggle for self-government, Konfrontasi and the ongoing struggles against local communism. Many were to say years later when interviewed, "We did not know what to expectÂ….We felt like guinea pigs Â….But we understood the need for defence." This was a voice of conviction although there was also fear of what to expect from NS.<br><br>The passing of the NS (Amendment) Act in mid-Mar 1967 was a turning point in the lives of Singaporean males. Between 28 Mar and 18 Apr 1967, registration began in earnest at the Central Manpower Base (CMPB) and its district offices in Katong, Serangoon and Bukit Panjang. Pink reminder cards were sent by post to the first batch of citizens who were born between 1 Jan 1949 and 30 Jun 1949 Â– some 9,000 of them. This marked the beginning of the citizen army and also the start of NS as a way of life for the male citizens of Singapore. Unlike the earlier days, todayÂ’s youths are better prepared psychologically to accept this challenge.<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/pixhistory/mar1997c.jpg"><br><span class="small">First National Service registration at the Central Manpower Base</span><br><br>The passing of the National Service (Amendment) Bill called for:<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  10% of eligible males to be enlisted for two years active service, followed by ten years in 'front-line' reserve, and<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  Majority of the remainder to be enlisted for part-time NS for 12 years in either the PDF, Special Constabulary or Vigilante Corps.<br><br>Only 10% of men eligible for NS were selected for full-time NS because of the relatively few number of trainers available from the small full-time army. The first batch of 900 men were absorbed into 3 and 4 SIR in Taman Jurong Camp by 7 Sep 67, while the new buildings at Bedok were still under construction.<br><br>All full-time NSmen enlisted into the Army were required to serve two years in active service and ten years in front-line reserves (that's what the NSmen were called then). On 22 Mar 68, the first intake of NSmen from 3 SIR and 4 SIR completed their basic military training and proceeded to the next level of training.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="font-style: italic;">material taken from <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg" rel="nofollow">http://www.mindef.gov.sg</a></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what irony , Government doesn't trusts the muslim countries around us.<br>Behind that shaking of hands , Singaporeans aren't dumb!<br>Technically , they still oppose our dealing with Israel , but if not for the sake of the media and to signal good relations , both of them would have their hands on each other.<br>What do we fight for ? What do we live for ? Singaporeans have a right to know how much foreign reserves and how GIC is doing.<br>Its like a men who guard his bank account , as a defender , but doesn't know how much his bank account has.<br>The government is operating at a "we know best" attitude , effectively all kinds of feedback at all levels , but they would still give "pretend to consider" attitude to us. How fake can that ever be?<br>However, on the other hand , even if Singapore wasn't a chinese majority country in comparison to our malay neighbours , it could still be attacked , just like what happened to Iraq and Kuwait .<br><br>Oh ya, the inter-religious talk held at the CC , what irony again !<br>oh yeah, a disguise of "racial harmony" so that in the event of war breaks up, communal problems wouldn't happen and the singapore troops could fight peacefully in war.<br><br>With regards to Singapore and Islam , Islam is a great religion which existed  for thousands of years and the colour of their skin , which binds them together and cannot be change. Singapore only has a mere 40 years of nation building , and citizenship can be easily changed by signatures.<br>What makes you think by indoctrinating them with propoganda , they will choose to believe in a system which is only 40 years old , rather then to<br>believe in a brotherhood across the world , from Middle East to South East Asia?<br><br>Everyone in this forum chooses to agree , but i purposely choose to disagree.<br>Go on , shoot me. Prove me wrong.<br><br>The world has so much irony.<br><br>NS is "wayang". and forever will be .<br>Racism/anti countryism still exists , though hardly felt ....<br><br>Just like coffeeshop talk by some car owners , who were blaming those<br>malay policeman for "unfairly accepting" traffic bribes.<br>So volatile. so uncontrolled.<br><br>Blind message of hate...Malaysia , Indonesia and Singapore should look towards a total dis-arnament policy.<br>But that is if everyone could be trust. Nah, not them , not us definitely.<br><br>So NS is here to stay. i pity the NS man here , who lose their singapore girls to "ang mohs" and in the end marry vietnamese girls and<br>being utilised by the government on 1 side , wasted their youth for a so-called "Nationalistic cause" on another side , and get milked out of every cent they have, with the cost of living , in which the goverment claims is low.<br>But they can never understand , how does it feels to take $1,000 a month.<br>Perhaps our finance minister could try having $1,000 a month , only then<br>will he feel , furthermore, his job is less physically strenuous then what a NS man have to go through.<br><br>I wish all singapore men all the best for the coming year..</div>
