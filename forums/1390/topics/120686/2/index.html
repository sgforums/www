On the first day, he was damned on the ball.....told us that to set up tents, etc we had to be in full No. 4 and SBO.  Then after a while, he felt damned hot and was sweating....and he was the first one to take off his No. 4 top. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The top prize goes to my unit CO.  When we went to Taiwan for exercise, he brought along a white pillow (the standard SAF issue for bunks) to sleep in the field.  Somemore he overslept once and missed the Div level exercise (ops) briefing and got scolded like hell. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Then this stupid CO....so fat.....he tried to go to slimming centres, but to no avail.  And when he moved house, he was too cheapskate to get a civilian moving company.  So he got the MT line to do it, using army 3-tonners - and paid them a few bucks each and their meals for the day (it was on a weekend).  Then they all got caught by MP.  hahaha.  The CO was on PS (pensionable service), but he was finally told to leave early.<br><br></div></blockquote>woah, seems like your NS like is full of cock-up people..........</div>
