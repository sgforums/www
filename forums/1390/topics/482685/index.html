              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">To be
              better prepared, you can participate in Total Defence activities

              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Perhaps
              you should also talk to your family members and friends who have
              lived the NS experience. The more you discuss with others, the more
              comfortable and mentally prepared you’ll become.</span></p>
              <p><strong style="font: inherit; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Because
              NS life is different from civilian life before enlistment, there
              are many adjustments you need to make.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">A good
              way to cope is to get support from your buddy and fellow recruits.
              They are going through the same tough training as you, so talking
              to one another will help relieve some tension.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">In most
              evenings during your leisure time, you’ll also have some time to
              call your family or loved ones to talk. They can give you emotional
              support during NS.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">You can
              have a one-on-one interview sessions with your officer to highlight
              any problems you may have. If you have a personal or family problem
              that need to be addressed, do let the officer know—he may be able
              to give you some advice or time off to settle your
              problems.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Life in
              NS revolves around structure, routine and discipline. This helps us
              stay united as a uniformed organisation as well as imparts the
              rigours necessary to protect our nation and citizens.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">This
              does not mean there is just work and no play. In fact, after a few
              weeks in NS and you’ll find new friends and new reasons to
              smile!</span></p>
              <p><strong style="font: inherit; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">As a
              soldier, one of the biggest adjustments you’ll have to make quickly
              is in regimentation and discipline.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Being in
              a uniformed organisation, you’ll have to obey orders from your
              superiors. Thus some of you may feel a sudden lack of freedom to do
              what you want and you may find yourself having difficulties
              accepting authority initially.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Regimentation and
              discipline build strong character and toughness, so that you’ll be
              tough enough to handle difficult combat, crime-fighting or rescue
              situations without giving up or breaking down.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">When you
              first enlist into NS, you may have concerns of being in a new
              territory, with new faces and new things to do. But don’t let this
              get to you. Just remember the saying that “when the going gets
              tough, the tough gets going”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"> <em style="font: inherit;">Following are some tips on what you can
              do to prepare yourself psychologically:</em></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Adopt a
              positive perception</span></li>
              <li><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Build
              up physical stamina</span></li>
              <li><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Develop
              good working attitude and habits</span></li>
              <li><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Overcome psychological
              stress</span></li>
              <li><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Adopt
              teamwork spirit</span></li>
              <li><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Learn
              to be independent</span></li>
              <li><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Set
              realistic expectations</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">You can
              also speak to your friends or family members who have been through
              NS. Ask them to share their stories. The sharing will help you
              reduce some of your fears, uncertainties and doubts.</span></p>
              <p><strong style="font: inherit; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">During
              NS you’ll be living with different people.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Because
              these people come from different backgrounds, they may not think
              like you do or react to situations like you would. Instead of
              trying to select your type of people, you should cherish the
              diversity. This is a chance for you to learn more about your fellow
              mates and their cultures.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">You’ll
              find that you have many opportunities to absorb the different
              cultures—during training, eating, chatting or just seeing and
              listening. Take these opportunities and learn from people around
              you, you’ll have a much better appreciation of Singapore’s cultural
              diversity.</span></p>

              <div>The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) is a 2,000-bed acute
              tertiary psychiatric hospital situated on a 25-hectare campus at
              Buangkok Green Medical Park. Set amidst serene surroundings, IMH
              offers a comprehensive range of psychiatric, rehabilitative and
              counselling services for children, adolescents, adults, and the
              elderly.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>IMH’s tradition of care started in 1928. We were the first
              mental hospital in Singapore, starting with some 1,000 patients.
              Since then, many advances have been made in treatment, training,
              and research. Our treatment integrates evidence-based therapies,
              supported by the departments of clinical psychology, nursing,
              occupational therapy, and medical social work, to provide holistic
              care for our patients. IMH is equipped with modern facilities, with
              50 wards for inpatients and seven Specialist Outpatient
              Clinics.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>IMH was the first mental health institution in Asia to receive
              the Joint Commission International Accreditation in 2005, a highly
              coveted international accreditation for healthcare
              organisations. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Over the years, IMH has gained a reputation for quality
              research. In 2008, the Ministry of Health, Singapore, entrusted IMH
              with a S$25 million research grant to implement translational and
              clinical research into the causes of schizophrenia and related
              psychotic disorders.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>IMH also plays a key role in training the next generation of
              mental health professionals in Singapore. We train psychiatrists
              and mental health professionals through the NHG-AHPL Residency
              Programme for psychiatry and through collaborations with the local
              tertiary institutions.</div>

              <div>Minister of State for Health Dr Amy Khor announced in
              Parliament on Monday two new community-based mental health
              initiatives designed to improve Singaporeans' access to mental
              healthcare.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"We are developing Assessment and Shared Care Teams (ASCAT),
              which are specialist-led mental health teams based in the
              community, in order to improve access to mental health care. We are
              also developing Community Mental Health Intervention Teams (COMIT)
              to provide improved access to counselling and psychotherapy
              services in the community," said Dr Khor.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Dr Khor also said that the Institute of Mental Health's (IMH)
              occupancy rate for the past three years averaged at about 80 per
              cent and that the hospital has sufficient capacity for new
              patients.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>There are currently about 2,000 beds across public hospitals
              in Singapore dedicated to mental health patients, with the majority
              in IMH.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Responding to queries from Member of Parliament Mr Hri Kumar
              Nair on the criteria for admitting patients to IMH, Dr. Khor said
              those with conditions such as schizophrenia and depression may be
              admitted for closer monitoring. </div>

              When patients feel at their most vulnerable, Head of medical
              social services at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) Ms Esther

              patients may have tried to take their own lives or showed signs of
              wanting to do so. Ms Lim also helps families cope when they have
              lost a loved one.</span></p>

              instance, if they have been abused by a patient.</span></p>

              she pioneered a programme in SGH to train health-care and social

              working in the emergency department years ago, I saw how a crisis,

              or an attempted suicide, can throw a family off balance.</span></p>

              to connect the suicidal person with the resources around him, such
              as family service centres, care facilities and legal aid. Often, a
              person may think nobody can help him, which is not true.</span></p>

              medical social workers also come to me to seek advice on cases they
              are working on. I co-manage the difficult cases, such as those
              which may involve suicide, or in which patients or family members
              consistently display behavioural difficulties.</span></p>

              that families with strong social support fare better in crises.
              After the initial shock and confusion, members organise themselves

              physiological and emotional comfort.</span></p>

              <p>Signs of psychological trouble</p>
              <p>WHAT are some of the signs that your child may be suffering from
              psychological problems? Psychiatrists point to some of the things
              that you could look out for:</p>
              <p>    Sleep or appetite problems</p>
              <p>    Behaviour and speech that seem out of
              character</p>
              <p>    Difficulty concentrating or a lack of
              motivation</p>
              <p>    A drop in academic performance</p>
              <p>    Becoming increasingly withdrawn from families and
              peers, preferring to keep to oneself at home</p>
              <p>    Becoming argumentative towards family and
              friends</p>
              <p>    Hallucinations, delusional beliefs, odd or
              impulsive behaviour and even suicidal tendencies.</p>
              <p>If there has been a recent crisis such as the loss of a loved
              one, a divorce or school stress, be sure to check on how the child
              is coping. Take note of how he is performing in school and how he
              is interacting with others. </p>

              <h2>Helping servicemen serve</h2>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Story by Benita Teo</p>
              <p><strong>Serving in the military is certainly no mean feat. And
              when the security of the nation is in one’s hands, mental strength
              is as important as, if not more so than, physical
              fitness.</strong><br> <br> When the going gets tough, it is often helpful to talk it out with
              a trusted family or friend. But, even with the best of intentions,
              not everyone is able to fully comprehend the intricacies of
              military life.<br> <br> To help the servicemen and women of the Singapore Armed Forces
              (SAF) cope with the challenges of their military roles, the
              counsellors of the SAF Counselling Centre (SCC) are always ready to
              lend a listening ear. In fact, the team at SCC provides
              professional counselling services not only to all members of the
              Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and SAF, but also to their
              families.<br> <br> <strong>Learning to live the military life</strong><br> <br> Unlike civilian counselling centres, the SCC comes under military
              mandate, and its primary purpose is to provide mental health care
              to ensure that servicemen are able to carry out their duties
              efficiently.<br> <br> Of the types of cases the SCC sees, Mrs Marlene Koh, Head of
              Education and Prevention Services, noted that the majority were
              Full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) with adaptation issues. "Not
              everybody is used to dealing with authority. They all came in as
              students who only had to take care of their own studies."<br> <br> She added: "The second, smaller group would be Regulars with career
              or family issues. A third group comprises families and soldiers
              affected by critical incidents that happened around them, for
              instance training incidents or a death in the family."<br> <br> Servicemen in distress may seek help directly with the SCC through
              two channels: face-to-face sessions or the 24-hour SAF Counselling
              Hotline. On top of these, a Family Support Helpline is also
              available for the family members of soldiers deployed overseas who
              are in need of assistance.<br> <br> <strong>Eyes and ears on the ground</strong><br> <br> To help junior and senior commanders to identify and assist men
              under their charge who are at risk of emotional distress, the SCC
              conducts regular workshops. In addition to basic counselling
              skills, stress management and suicide prevention are also taught at
              the workshops.<br> <br> Ms Cheryl Chia, an SCC counsellor with 14 years of experience,
              explained that equipping commanders with these skills is essential
              because "they are the eyes and ears on the ground".<br> <br> Another set of eyes that the SCC relies on to spot at-risk
              servicemen are the paracounsellors - Regulars who volunteer to help
              look after the mental welfare of servicemen at the unit level. To
              be appointed as paracounsellors, they have to go through a five-day
              course organised by the SCC that teaches basic counselling, suicide
              prevention and crisis management skills.<br> <br> Military Expert (ME) 3-3 Sulinder Singh, a Logistics Warrant
              Officer, has been a paracounsellor in his unit, 201 Squadron (SQN),
              since 2010. And being a familiar face in the unit means that
              servicemen know what to expect when they confide in him -
              trustworthiness.<br> <br> "I'm quite approachable, and they know that if they talk to me, it
              will be confidential."<br> <br> <strong>Allaying fears</strong><br> <br> Besides assuaging doubts over client confidentiality, the
              counsellors and paracounsellors also dispelled the stigma of
              seeking help.<br> <br> "(For) those who are in a position of command, it may be a 'face'
              issue," said SCC counsellor Lawrence Yap. "But so far, I've not
              encountered any clients (Regulars) who claimed that attending
              counselling affected their careers."<br> <br> ME3-3 Singh echoed his sentiments: "Is there a stigma attached to
              people in the unit who see paracounsellors? No, not at all. They
              are not mentally ill, we just need to help them find the right way
              to organise their thoughts."<br> <br> <strong>The counsellor is in</strong><br> <br> Help for a distressed soldier often begins with a visit to the
              Medical Officer (MO) with complaints of symptoms of stress. Said Ms
              Chia: "Usually they will say that they are unable to sleep or eat.
              When the MOs probe deeper and realise that the problem goes beyond
              a medical issue, they will refer them to us."<br> <br> At the SCC, the soldier will be assigned a counsellor. Through the
              sessions, counsellor and soldier will work together to identify the
              problems and set goals towards overcoming them. The counsellor will
              also impart skills such as stress or anger management
              techniques.<br> <br> When facing mental turmoil, a soldier may despair and lose his
              sense of self. One approach a counsellor may take is to remind him
              of his capabilities.<br> <br> "Counselling is about instilling a sense of hope," said Mr Yap, who
              specialises in substance and drug addiction counselling. "Everyone
              has it in them to overcome a difficult situation. We just need to
              help them see that they are not as helpless as they think they are,
              and that the situation is not as hopeless as they think it
              is."<br> <br> SCC counsellors also work with psychiatrists and psychologists from
              the Psychological Care Centre (PCC) at the SAF Medical Corps'
              Military Medicine Institute to provide all-round care to the
              soldier. PCC psychiatrists prescribe medication for conditions like
              depression while psychologists run tests to ascertain if a
              behavioural problem is linked to a learning or intellectual
              disability.<br> <br> <strong>Helping others help themselves</strong><br> <br> With the ever-evolving social landscape, counsellors must stay
              up-to-date on new behavioural problems or addictions, such as
              social media addiction.<br> <br> Mrs Koh also pointed out that there are now more cases of
              servicemen suffering anxieties about not performing well or meeting
              expectations, and that many expected others to solve their
              problems.<br> <br> Mr Yap agreed: "To change, clients have to take personal
              responsibility for their actions."<br> <br> Nonetheless, the counsellors take comfort in the knowledge that
              they are changing lives for the better.<br> <br> Mrs Koh remembered a recruit who had attempted suicide after his
              girlfriend of four years ended their relationship and started
              seeing a friend of his behind his back. Mrs Koh helped him
              acknowledge his feelings of hurt and disappointment, and taught him
              constructive ways of managing his anger.<br> <br> The recruit started to improve his relationship with his family and
              make new friends in his unit. Nine months later, he was finally
              able to move on from the break-up.<br> <br> Ms Chia also recounted a recent case: "I had a client who wanted to
              kill himself. But after working with his unit and the psychiatrist,
              just before his ORD (Operationally Ready Date) he said, 'You gave
              me hope. Even though life ahead will be challenging, at least I
              know now that there are people who care, and that there is more to
              life than thinking about hurting myself.'"<br> <br> She added: "He even baked us cupcakes as a 'thank you'. It's the
              little things like these (that let me know I’ve made a
              difference)."</p>

              <p>Some of you might be wondering why 28 days? Well, research<sup>[1]</sup> shows that the chances of becoming smoke-free increases the longer one 
                  stops smoking and improves 5 times in the first 4 weeks (averaging 28 
                  days). The risk of relapsing with time decreases after the first 4 weeks
                   of being smoke-free and becomes very low after approximately 12 weeks. 
                  In addition, withdrawal symptoms from quitting normally last about 2-4 
                  weeks.</p>

              Simply decide to stop smoking on a particular date and stay firm on
              that decision! To avoid temptations, clear all your ashtrays,
              lighters and cigarette packs and remind yourself of your reasons
              for quitting. Arm yourself with practical quit tips and with a good
              dose of willpower, you will succeed!<br>     Seek professional help from quit advisors<br> <br>     Quit Advisors will help to assess your level of
              addiction, customise a quit plan according to your needs and offer
              you useful advice and support during your quit journey. With

              quit successfully! You can combine professional advice with any of
              the other quit methods.</p>
              <p><strong><br>     Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT)</strong><br> <br>     NRT includes nicotine gum, skin patches,
              lozenges, nasal sprays or 'inhalers'. They work by releasing small
              amounts of nicotine into your body (substituting the nicotine in
              the cigarette) to counter cravings and relieve withdrawal symptoms.
              This helps you cope better with your day-to-day routine while you
              are quitting smoking. NRT is useful for smokers who are highly
              addicted to cigarettes.<br>     NRT is widely available at all pharmacies and
              does not require a prescription to purchase.</p>
              <p><br> <strong>    Medication</strong><br> <br>     Medication such as Buproprion Hydrochloride is
              nicotine-free and works by boosting the levels of chemical
              messengers in the brain. With more of these chemicals at work, you
              experience a reduction in nicotine withdrawal symptoms and a
              weakening of the urge to smoke. This oral medication is available
              only with a doctor's prescription. Consult your doctor to find out
              if this is suitable for you.<br> <br> <br> There's no magic formula to quitting. Although NRT and medication
              can help to relieve some of the withdrawal symptoms, the key to
              success still lies with your willpower and determination to
              quit.<br> <br> Kick start your quit journey by seeking advice from our Quit

              <p>    If you haven't already, throw away all your
              lighters, ashtrays and cigarette packs! ALL of them, including the
              ones you've hidden in your drawer for 'emergency' purposes. <br><br>     Make it known to everybody that you are quitting
              smoking - your friends, colleagues, bosses, family members and even
              your neighbours. If you are afraid to tell because you think you
              will not succeed in quitting, think of it from another perspective
              - making your quit attempt known to everyone will prevent you from
              failing! <br><br>     List your quit buddies. Include smoking buddies
              who are also thinking of quitting, and non-smoking friends who will
              support you. Save their numbers in your handphone and SMS or call
              them whenever you have the urge to smoke. <br><br>     Put up 'No Smoking' signs in visible areas (on
              your desktop, inside your wardrobe, in the washroom) to remind
              yourself of your new resolution. Constant visual reminders are
              powerful and can give you encouragement when your mind is wandering
              on other topics. <br><br>     Know what you are getting into. You may
              experience withdrawal symptoms and you'll almost certainly go
              through urges that are difficult to control. Understand what causes
              these urges and withdrawal symptoms and have a plan ready for what
              you will do when this happens.<br> <br> <strong>Remember the 4 Ds!</strong> <br><br> <strong>Distract yourself by doing something else</strong><br> <br> Prepare a 'Rescue Kit" to distract you from cravings. Some items

              get over an urge to smoke<br> <br><strong>Managing your cravings</strong><br> <br> Nicotine in cigarettes is a powerful drug and can be as addictive
              as heroine and cocaine. However, not everyone will experience
              withdrawal symptoms. Approximately 20% of smokers will experience
              strong withdrawal symptoms. But they often disappear after the
              first 2-3 weeks when the feeling of well-being starts to kick in.
              The withdrawal symptoms are usually worse in the first 48 hours and
              they are normal signs that your body is recovering from the harmful
              effects of smoking. Here are some tips to help manage your
              cravings. <br><br> It's all in the mind<br> <br> <strong>Over the years, you've learnt to use smoking as a coping mechanism
              to deal with your daily stresses. You now have to re-program your
              mind to use other coping mechanisms instead. Use these tips to
              strengthen your mind. </strong><br><br> Change your habits<br> <br> Smoking may have become part of your daily routine and you
              automatically reach for cigarettes at certain places, certain times
              or even around certain people. The key to changing your habits is
              to replace the old habits with new ones. Here are some tips to help
              change your habits. <br><br> Managing your cravings<br> If you suffer from withdrawal symptoms, try these to help make them
              more manageable:<br> <br> Difficulty concentrating   <br> Take regular stretch breaks to re-energise your body. To think
              better, try sniffing peppermint oil or drink peppermint tea
              instead.<br> <br> Feeling irritable   <br> Relaxation exercises like yoga, meditation and deep breathing
              really helps to calm the mind. If you've got time, catch a
              feel-good movie or comedy.<br> <br> Having headaches   <br> Get enough sleep. Stay in quiet, relaxed surroundings. A head and
              shoulder massage can ease the pain.<br> <br> Feeling tired   <br> Get enough sleep and increase your physical activity. Drink ginger
              tea to perk yourself up.<br> <br> Coughing   <br> Sip warm water. Suck on sugar-free cough drops.<br> <br> Hunger or thirst in between meals   <br> Drink lots of plain water or unsweetened fresh juices. Satisfy your
              hunger with low-calorie snacks.<br> <br> <br> <strong>Change your habits</strong><br> <br> Old habits die hard. <strong>So find new habits to replace them!</strong><br> <br>     Got a daily routine? Change it!<br> <br>     Try introducing some changes in your daily
              routine. If you tend take a certain route to work every day, take
              another path. Have breakfast somewhere else that prohibits smoking
              and if you smoke after a meal, eat a fruit or brush your teeth
              instead. Try drinking other hot beverages instead of your usual
              morning coffee. This will break the associations that you have
              formed with smoking. <br><br>     Keep your hands busy<br> <br>     You can't smoke if your hands are occupied, so
              think of ways to keep those fingers moving! Every time you feel
              like your hands are 'empty', SMS your friend or play some games
              from your handphone. <br><br>     Fill up with healthy snacks<br> <br>     Replace cigarette toxins with low-calorie
              snacks, fruit and vegetables. Fill your mouth with sugar-free candy
              or mints, this will give you an excuse to reject cigarette offers
              from your friends.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <strong>It's all in the mind<br> <br> Build a strong mind to keep your motivation strong!</strong><br> <br>     Think positive - Visualise yourself as someone
              who has overcome quitting. Being able to picture yourself as
              someone you want to be helps to shape your attitude towards
              achieving it. Smile and use positive words in your inner thoughts
              or when talking to others. You'll be surprised how contagious
              positive attitudes can be. When you are positive, people naturally
              like to be with you and that reinforces your positive
              thinking. <br><br>     Find a listening ear - You don't have to quit
              alone. Find support and encouragement from friends, family, a loved
              one or even a professional advisor when you feel your resolve
              slipping. Share with them your problems and feelings and make a
              connection with others. By doing that, you'll lighten your
              emotional load and give you more comfort and support in your quit
              attempt. <br><br>     Keep yourself distracted - Always thought about
              picking up a new language or a new hobby? Now's the time to do so.
              Sign up for class, learn a new instrument (drums might be good for
              relieving stress) or start playing some computer games to keep your
              mind off smoking. <br><br>     Get active! - Engaging in physical activity
              releases endorphins in your body, giving you a natural feeling of
              well-being. If you have no time for a proper game or a swim, try
              integrating some simple exercises such as climbing the stair or
              brisk walking to the train station. <br><br>     Find other ways to relieve stress - Relax with
              yoga or get your body grooving to a new dance! You can also try
              deep breathing exercises and muscle relaxation methods for quick
              results. If your schedule allows, you might want to go for a short
              weekend getaway to refresh your mind and soul.<br> <br> <strong>Be strong and be positive. Tell yourself you can do it! Quitting
              smoking may be a challenge, but positive thinking will help you
              achieve success.</strong></p>

              More can be done to monitor and support national servicemen with mental health issues, according to two experts who used to work with the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).
              
              These include fighting the stigma attached to such illnesses, raising awareness about mental health and having more in-camp psychiatrists.
              
              Earlier this week, State Coroner Imran Abdul Hamid delivered his findings on the death of Private Ganesh Pillay Magindren, who was found at the foot of his Sengkang condominium last July.
              
              The 23-year-old had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, which distorts a person's thoughts and emotions, causing him to lose touch with reality.

            <div class='col-md body'><p><br><br>Handling a mentally ill soldier is not easy. They require proper attention and a suitable working environment for them to thrive, said psychiatrists contacted by The New Paper. For this to happen, the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) has to take ownership of its soldiers, Dr Ang Yong Guan said.<br><br>Dr Ang, who is in private practice, was the head of the Psychological Care Centre (PCC) at the Military Medicine Institute during his 23 years with the SAF from 1986 to 2003.<br><br>He said that of his 4,500 patients, there are fewer than 10 cases of full-time national servicemen (NSF).<br><br>"I forward each NSF's case to the SAF. I believe the organisation should be responsible for its own soldiers," he said.<br><br>But he thinks that the majority of these cases do not get picked up.<br><br>"(When I was at PCC) I always made it a point to monitor those soldiers who had severe mental illnesses. I would even call their private psychiatrists to find out more.<br><br>"Only if the organisation's leaders are committed to monitoring and helping these patients can they be given the right attention and help," Dr Ang said.<br><br>Consultant psychiatrist Ken Ung of Adam Road Medical Centre said that when a soldier is found to be mentally ill, steps should be taken to ensure he is placed in a suitable working environment.<br><br>Dr Ung, who sees about 30 to 50 cases of NSFs a month, said that superiors and colleagues should also understand that problematic soldiers may not always be trying to play the system.<br><br>BE UNDERSTANDING<br><br>"There are cases where the superiors are very understanding and sympathetic towards their condition and always willing to listen to them, and (the patients) thrive," he said.<br><br>But those who had difficult bosses could lead to a downward spiral of the soldier's condition, he said.<br><br>"I've had such patients who became more and more depressed, constantly had nightmares. Parents would complain about their behaviour and some even had suicidal thoughts," he said.<br><br>Superiors should give their subordinates the benefit of the doubt, said Dr Ung, adding that they should be proactive and take the time to find out if their soldiers are all right.<br><br>"The SAF is a microcosm of society. It's inevitable that you will get soldiers who are mentally ill.
