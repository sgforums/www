              <p>Hi basically I'm going to ORD soon in less than 2 months. Problem is, my unit has this overseas exercise which actually ends AFTER i ord. So now there are two problems.</p>
              <p>First, I read and printed out a copy of the ORD directive which stated that you would ORD on the date specified, or if it is a weekend or public holiday, the prior working day. Also, you have to be PERSONALLY at your unit camp for clearance procedures during WORKING HOURS. Are there actually any fine print regarding this? (Like if you are in an overseas exercise this directive does not apply to you, etc)</p>
              <p>Second, is it possible for the unit to involuntary extend your ORD? I have heard rumors of the unit getting OCs to sign the VES (Voluntary Extension Scheme) for those who ORD before the overseas exercise ends, thereby involuntary extending their ORD. Alternatively, is it even LEGAL for the unit to force a soldier who ORD before the overseas exercise ends to participate in said exercise?</p>
              <p>Having been in the army for so long, I've long been resigned to the school of thought that basically everything in the army (rest, weekends, freetime, etc) is a privilege and not a right (that's what tekong sergeants always say when one's a recruit). However, I believe that something as important as ORD is NOT a privilege and DEFINITELY a right. Would it be too much to just ask to ORD on the date that one is supposed to ORD? Any thoughts or suggestions on this to shed some light? The unit basically imposed an information blackout after realizing that some people were checking the mindef directives using the OA by blocking all links, rendering the affected personnel information-blind. Anyone else experienced the same thing as well?</p>

              <p>OK you haven't heard the catch. Problem is, basically most of the specialists (3sg n 2sg both) in the battalion are affected (ie ORD before end of exercise). And without most of these specialists the unit is basically screwed, as the PCs cannot definitely lead the entire platoon by himself. Therefore they are so keen to do so. The first option thus does not work as they already know yet are still trying to (do dno what??). I admit to being very confused as now I don't even know if I can ORD on the date I'm supposed to ORD.</p>
              <p>Regarding chain of command, since it is a battalion+brigade thing and the CO's therefore the in-charge, by "go up the chain of command if they refuse" would you mean arranging a dialogue with the division above? If so, how in the world does one do that with someone with such a high rank?</p>

              <p>100% no way they can extend your ORD.</p>
              <p>But seeing your current situation, its a tough call. If the whole unit sergeants want to ORD, what will happen to the oversea training? Nobody know. But by right, the S1 people should have done their job and should be aware of u guys ORD during that oversea training.</p>
              <p>Not to worry, I think by then they should have new sergeants posted in to replace u guys.</p>
              <p>If not.... good luck...</p>
              <p>If no ppl replace u, and u guys wan ord, who knows what will happen during your ICT. Alot of things to play de. </p>

              <p>making it easier for unit by self extending ORD, should there be no new spec replacing TS and company, doesn't gurantee that they wun 'play' with you during in camp either.</p>
              <p>They tend to have short term memory and forget all the 'favours' the NSF did for them(Regulars). You cannot have TS count on the gratitude of the Regulars to make it easier for you during ICT.</p>

              <p>@jgho83: no the new specs only come in at least 2 months after the end of the exercise (ie abt 2 months after we ord).</p>
              <p>Alright, here is the full story. Unit A has an OE in Country X from Date 1 to Date 30 (arbitary numbers, don't mean a thing). Unfortunately 8 out of 10 specs ORD at Dates 26, 27, 28. However, since Date 27 and 28 are saturdays and sundays respectively, and Date 26 is a public holiday, according to the SAF ORD Directive, the "prior working day" would be Date 25. Therefore, all 3 dates should ORD on Date 25.</p>
              <p>Now, after attempting to cajole all the specs to extend by 1 month (which no one obviously want to), Unit A managed to arrange an early flight back on Date 27. On top of that, specs who ORD on Date 26 are now exempted from the OE on the pretext that they have no flight back. HOWEVER, this would be ignoring the SAF ORD Directive, whereby all 3 dates actually ORD on the same day! Think about it, even if ORDates 27 and 28 come back on the Date 27 flight, they still ORD late as they have to wait for the next working day!</p>
              <p>Interestingly, Unit A did not tell any of these to the specs and instead kept quiet. Which is strange, since so close to the OE and no one knows anything about the details of the OE. Firstly, it is ridiculous that one third of the affected personnel get special treatment and are 'allowed' to ORD on their proper date, yet the other two-thirds remain victimized. Can an enlightened laujiao shed some light on this? It is all the more intriguing when HQ has so much time to plan, almost one year since the specs were posted into the unit, yet they continued to belittle the event that all NSFs look forward to - ORD.<br><br>Interestingly, the Unit's RSM reportedly mentioned that he did not need the consent of the specs involved to extend their ORD and that all he needed to do was to go online and press a button. Also, and that the spec's ORD dates as mentioned in the said directive is "subject to unit approval". So basically he's saying the unit can 1) extend one's ORD however it wishes to, and 2) Ignore the Directive and therefore achieving the above without consequence. Anyone care to tell me if it's true?</p>
