              <p>Alright, here is the full story. Unit A has an OE in Country X

              other two-thirds remain victimized. Can an enlightened laujiao shed

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hi basically I'm going to ORD soon in less than 2 months.
              Problem is, my unit has this overseas exercise which actually ends
              AFTER i ord. So now there are two problems.</p>
              <p>First, I read and printed out a copy of the ORD directive which
              stated that you would ORD on the date specified, or if it is a
              weekend or public holiday, the prior working day. Also, you have to
              be PERSONALLY at your unit camp for clearance procedures during
              WORKING HOURS. Are there actually any fine print regarding this?
              (Like if you are in an overseas exercise this directive does not
              apply to you, etc)</p>
              <p>Second, is it possible for the unit to involuntary extend your
              ORD? I have heard rumors of the unit getting OCs to sign the VES
              (Voluntary Extension Scheme) for those who ORD before the overseas
              exercise ends, thereby involuntary extending their ORD.
              Alternatively, is it even LEGAL for the unit to force a soldier who
              ORD before the overseas exercise ends to participate in said
              exercise?</p>
              <p>Having been in the army for so long, I've long been resigned to
              the school of thought that basically everything in the army (rest,
              weekends, freetime, etc) is a privilege and not a right (that's
              what tekong sergeants always say when one's a recruit). However, I
              believe that something as important as ORD is NOT a privilege and
              DEFINITELY a right. Would it be too much to just ask to ORD on the
              date that one is supposed to ORD? Any thoughts or suggestions on
              this to shed some light? The unit basically imposed an information
              blackout after realizing that some people were checking the mindef
              directives using the OA by blocking all links, rendering the
              affected personnel information-blind. Anyone else experienced the
              same thing as well?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Basically, ORD is not just that person's problem. There are many clearances to do including arms, dental, logistics, returning camp pass, clear leave and etc. It is not a one day affair. You probably have to take a week to clear them all out. Check this out with your clerk.  Your officer also have to sign and return your personal docket to HQ and etc.</p>
              <p>Either you have your clearance done before the OE or after the OE, as the people have to be around to sign the clearance.</p>

              <p>Basically, your unit screw up the admin.</p>
              <p>ORD is not just a one person affair. The officers/IC from various departments need to sign on the clearance form and this form goes all the way back to HQ/CMPB for records. The clearance is to ensure that SAF dont have any legal liabilities on you.</p>
              <p>You should just not go for the OE and stay in singapore to ORD and clear leave. It makes more sense.The various bosses need to sign the clearance, it is not as simple as taking the pink IC only. How come it is so mess up? </p>
              <p> FYI, it is written in the directive that the unit can extend the ORD of the personel. But the officer in charge will have to follow another set of adminstration to explain why the ORD is extended. The accountancy department will also have to follow up to give extra "allowance" for the personnel. So usually, the officer-in-charge are not too interest in doing extra work, thought it can be done.</p>
