              <h3>My NDP Journey</h3>
              <p>Posted by BG Tan Chuan-Jin on          <abbr title="2009-04-21T10:06:00+08:00">24th April, 10:30AM</abbr> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ndp.org.sg/images/news/Chairman/BGTan1.png" alt="" width="200" height="239" align="left">  Until I was 17, NDPs were a little vague to me. Sure, like the other
              teenagers, I recalled the rolling tanks and marching bands and
              contingents – all which I caught on TV… probably between mouthfuls of
              dinner</p>
              <p>In fact, like my classmates, we were probably just glad not to have
              been called to march at the parade. If not for the Taiwanese exchange
              students my JC1 class had to host, I may not even have been there to
              watch the whole event.</p>
              <p>But there I was
              in the sweltering heat of the National Stadium, belting out those
              stirring 80s National Day songs like “Stand Up for Singapore” (which I
              still have a soft spot for today). The mood was electrifying. And as
              the fireworks lit up the night sky and we recited the pledge, I figure
              that must have been what patriotism felt like. And I believe that’s
              what many of my friends felt that day too. It is what we would call a
              ‘hair-stand moment’!</p>
              <p>But never would I
              have imagined then that one day, I’d have the honour organising an NDP,
              trying to inspire that same pride we felt, in a new generation of
              Singaporeans. </p>
              <p>So  where was this patriotic zeal coming from?</p>
              <p>For me, it was not the marching bands and showcase of military
              hardware. Rather, it was how all 60,000 plus of us in the stadium came
              together to sing our hearts out. And you know what? Those embarrassing
              songs may not have been too deep and impressive dissected, but with the
              simple words, they made everyone in the stadium become one people. And
              we had great fun doing it too!</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffffff; font-size: small;"> <strong>We  synched as One.</strong></span></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ndp.org.sg/images/news/Chairman/NDP08_144.png" alt="" width="300" height="182" align="right">As
              I soon realised, NDP was a huge complex operation that needed to be
              effectively and efficiently run. I understood the reasons, all of which
              I believed in and respected. But somehow, if given a choice, I thought
              I would rather <em>chiong  sua</em> with my guys.</p>
              <p>I probably didn’t quite understand fully why so many people seemed so
              excited about sacrificing precious weekends for those endless
              rehearsals. Don’t get me wrong. I love my country deeply and am proud
              of our National Day. I understand the importance of the responsibility
              intellectually, but I guess I just did not quite associate emotionally
              with the whole process of organising NDP itself.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffffff; font-size: small;"> <strong>And  then a few things happened that changed my perspective completely.</strong></span></p>
              <p>On New Year’s Day 2005, I stood at ground zero, surveying the
              devastation that the Tsunami had wrecked on the town of Meulaboh, Aceh
              in Indonesia. I had been tasked to lead our Humanitarian Assistance
              Support Group to help in the disaster and it was the first time I’d
              been confronted with such abject loss.</p>
              <p>It was surreal. Everything was flattened, the dead entwined with the
              collapsed buildings and trees. Bodies scattered about, left behind by
              the receding waves. There seemed to be no signs of life even as the
              odour of death lingered in the air. I remembered wondering where do we
              even start?</p>
              <p>But start we did, and we
              tried to make as much difference as we could. We managed to help
              stabilise the situation and after 3 weeks, it was time to make our
              two-day journey home. I recall sitting on the upper deck of our LST,
              RSS Endurance watching the sunset. There was a quiet sense of sadness,
              but also of admiration at the resilience of the human spirit. But most
              of all, I realised there and then, how proud I was to be a Singaporean.</p>
              <p>It was not simply the outpouring of cash and material support, or the
              many volunteers who offered to go over to help. But it was the manner
              in which our people rallied round and responded. Our soldiers, sailors
              and airmen reached out to help our friends, and treated the local
              people with a great deal of respect and dignity.</p>
              <p>There was a lot of heart that went into what the guys did. It was
              touching to see them in their No. 4s kicking a football with the kids
              at the refugee camp during their rest hour. Or when my Logistics
              Officer, LTC Nasir lent a listening ear to a man who was fishing, not
              for food, but in the hope of finding something to remind him of his
              little girl who was swept away. He had nothing left and hoped that
              perhaps he could somehow find a scrap of her clothes or something to
              remember her by.</p>
              <p>There was a
              tremendous humanity in our Singaporeans. “Regardless of race, language
              or religion”, we acted as one for a fellow being in need. <strong>It is perhaps in times of crisis that one takes a peek into the heart and soul of a nation.</strong></p>
              <p>And  I am so proud of what I saw.</p>
              <p>And I remember clearly, as I reflected then, it struck me that the
              reason we were able to pull off such a large and complex operation
              within days was not only because of all the training and drilling we
              did in our exercises, it was also because of our being tasked to
              organise massive national events like the National Day Parade. NDPs are
              real life operations that trained us to plan to the ‘nth’ degree of
              detail and to ensure that everything turns out like clock-work.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffffff; font-size: small;"> <strong>And  then Bernard passed away.</strong></span></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.ndp.org.sg/images/news/Chairman/Comd2.png" alt="" width="227" height="261" align="left">COL
              Bernard Tan collapsed when he was nearing the end-point of the
              Singapore Biathlon in 2006. He was only 39 then. And he was my friend
              and buddy with whom I grew up together in the Army. He was my senior at
              Sandhurst and we studied in London together. We were Company Commanders
              in 3 Guards and I had taken over him as Battalion Commander and then as
              Brigade Commander. We were colleagues on the General Staff when he
              passed away.</p>
              <p>Bernard was an
              outstanding leader who was respected and loved by his men. And Bernard
              loved Singapore. He believed in his duties as a soldier, which was to
              protect and serve the nation, and he inspired the people round him to
              feel the same.</p>
              <p>What’s interesting is
              that Bernard always believed in the importance of organising NDP. To
              him, it wasn’t just the challenge of doing it, but the meaning of it
              all. In fact, one of his dreams was to be Chairman NDP EXCO one day –
              the job I have now.</p>
              <p>Why? Just so that
              he could in his own way, reach out to our nation and present us all
              with an opportunity to celebrate what it meant to be Singapore, and to
              be Singaporeans. He didn’t see it as just another event to run. Bernard
              saw the link in the celebrations and the rousing of a nation to
              celebrate the good that we had.</p>
              <p>Just
              to share…Bernard once had a hare-brained idea where we would set off
              the Civil Defence sirens and have a magical moment when the country
              would come to a halt and recite the pledge together. He thought it
              would have been a blast to have the entire nation affirm our beliefs
              together, as one, no matter where we were at the time. We thought he
              was mad!</p>
              <p>But if one thinks about it,
              our pledge is a symbol of all that our country stands for. One united
              people. No matter our colour, our religious beliefs or language. We say
              the words...everyday whilst in school. But do we mean what we say, and
              say what we mean?</p>
              <p>And so, it all
              became clear what the task was at hand. As Commander 3rd Division,
              Chairman EXCO NDP 09 I share Bernard’s hope that we can own and
              reaffirm our vision as a nation. Which will be why the pledge will form
              a fundamental part of celebrations this year. (more of this later…)</p>
              <p>But as I’m pulling the NDP ideas together with my team, I’m just amused
              at how things pan out in life. How someone like me, who had been, shall
              we say, ‘a little’ indifferent towards organising NDPs, had come to
              passionately imbibe its significance and purpose so thoroughly. I guess
              in large part, my sense of pride in Singapore and being Singaporean has
              become very real. And I believe that regardless of our personal
              sentiments and perspectives, if we were to all just take one step back,
              pause and reflect - there is indeed much that we all should be proud
              of.</p>
              <p>What a tremendous honour and
              privilege it is to be part of our National Day. Together with our
              friends and partners from both the public and private sector, we
              realise that we are not just putting up a show and parade. To us, it’s
              not just another NDP, but rather, a National Day journey for all
              Singaporeans to come together to reflect, to own and be part of, and to
              celebrate all that is good and great about our country and our people.</p>
              <p>And  so my journey continues…</p>

              <p>Nope. Salary is not based on appointment at all but on rank, grade (1 or 2) and scheme. Scheme refers to A,B,C, C+ and what other components he has. Salary is not based on appointment at all. Appointment however affects rank. But appointment does not affect salary at all. Salary is directly calculated from those 3 factors only.</p>
              <p>Not sure if you can understand. Doubt you can.</p>
              <p>The salary you came out with is more of 20 yrs back.</p>

              <p>i didn't say it doesn't take anything to be div comm. I said high fliers go to joint level after div comm in response to "The appontment of division commanders only last around couple of
                                                  years"</p>
              <p>How could he have fought during Konfrontasi? It happened in 1963. http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/birth_of_saf/v01n09_history.html.print.html?Status=1</p>
              <p>Do the maths and that's 46 years ago. Let's assume since he is a farmer, he is 44 now, he was only 2 years old then. LOL!</p>
              <p>I'm curious though to know why he got his star 1 year later than Commanders of 3 and 9 Divs but he assumed the appointment earlier though.</p>
              <p>I just checked. He is 46 yrs old. http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20090626-151072.html Which means during Konfrontasi, he wasn't born yet. Another thing. If the retirement age wasn't raised to 50, he wouldn't have even gotten it.</p>
