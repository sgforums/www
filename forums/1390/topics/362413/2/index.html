              <p>I saw his wife's photos before, and also saw his wife in camp before. Not as hot as Claudel Kuek, wife of CDF, but hot in a tall, statesque way haha. he himself is tall and muscular and big sized. By the way BG Tan is very friendly and humble, if you're in his division, you can add him in facebook.</p>
              <p>Where does BG Tan live??</p>
              <p>yes, its between him and Chan Chung Sing, that's what everyone says, but now it's more to him cos BG Chan is being poached for public office (if he wants).</p>

              <p>Back to the topic, looks were only raised when someone said Singapore Idol. Who's to say what is on a pedastal and what is talking about an officer you like?</p>
              <p>I started a thread on BG Tan, after I got upclose and personal and after working under this officer in NDP. I came away from the experience feeling admiration and respect for this capable and intelligent yet humble commander.</p>
              <p>In the face of all the nutjobs who make up the majority of the officer corps in the SAF, it was a pertinent point to me that made a difference to my work and my views of conscription and defence, and I believe officers like him are what is keeping the SAF together, when I think of the usual crap that represents perhaps 99.999% of the officer corps.</p>
              <p>He is an SAF officer and this is an SAF forum. Forum is for info and gossip exchange. So there are people who'd like to trade gossip on SAF or SAF officers.</p>

              <p>Optimus, where does BG Tan live? Did you see his kids? your friend is his driver? I always see him drive to marina bay in his MID car himself. Even though looks are not what makes a good general, i'm sure it's his looks that prompt women ask him if he is married..</p>

              <p>Hey, I wont tell you where he live, sorry but i think it's not appropriate.  yeah the driver ORD already. No I didnt saw his kids i was outside his house. I guess they're still young. He drives a white MID audi right?  Yeah i agree he has the looks and that was not surprising. *there are people from some outside organisation who monitors this forum so be careful.*</p>
