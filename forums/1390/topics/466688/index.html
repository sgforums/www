Many soldiers poured out their grievances anonymously. They claimed that they often met silly individuals who are deliberately provocative. Not only they refused to allow the soldiers to sit down, they also vowed to take photos of the soldiers and publish online.</span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="line-height: 1.38;">Among these entries, one soldier complained that there were less than 10 passengers in the train cabin one day, but an auntie harassed him, not allowing him to sit down and spouted nonsense, “Soldiers should be defending our country instead of taking MRT trains. If not, go and take taxis.”</span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="line-height: 1.38;">After the entry was posted online, it attracted more than 13,000 “Likes” and more than 650 comments. Netizens sympathized with his horrible experience and criticized the deliberately provocative auntie. Someone filled with righteous indignation even asked the rhetorical question, “Aren’t soldiers’ human beings? Army training is so tough, and sitting down in MRT trains is a sin?!”</span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="line-height: 1.38;">CAPTION (top-right): There was a heated discussion after the entry was posted on Facebook. (Picture/Internet screenshot)</span></span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="line-height: 1.38;">NETIZENS SHARE SIMILAR EXPERIENCES</span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="line-height: 1.38;">Many netizens also experienced similar scenarios. Said Lee Xin Li (25, Undergraduate), who often draws army-themed comics: “The MRT is for everyone, so I don’t see why soldiers are not allowed to sit. But for ‘Priority Seats’, it’s another story. Some people lack the respect for privacy, which is the crux of the problem.”</span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="line-height: 1.38;">Said Goh Kai Ren (20, Full-time National Serviceman): “Every soldier pays his fare, so of course he has the right to sit. When soldiers give up their seats, it’s out of courtesy. However, he is not obliged to do so. Unfortunately, some members of the public lack the respect for NSFs that they even think it’s a given.”</span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="line-height: 1.38;">CAPTION (bottom-left): “STOMP Kempeitai” (Picture/Comic by Lee Xin Li)</span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="line-height: 1.38;">SOME SOLDIERS BOOK OUT IN CIVILIAN ATTIRE TO AVOID TROUBLE</span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="line-height: 1.38;">To prevent embarrassment and stay away from troubles, some soldiers had no choice but to book out from camps in civilian attire.</span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="line-height: 1.38;">According to some NSFs, in order to prevent being provoked or photographed and published online, they usually change into civilian attire before leaving their camps.</span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="line-height: 1.38;">Jeremiah Chew, 20, felt that being photographed and published online would make him feel uncomfortable. Though he cannot stop others from doing so, he would pay greater attention to his behaviour in public when in army uniform.</span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="line-height: 1.38;">Hewlett Chew, 23, said that perhaps some commuters are unhappy that soldiers’ field packs take up too much space. He hopes that the public will refrain from imposing unreasonable demands on soldiers, considering the tough training they undergo every day.</span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="line-height: 1.38;">In some places overseas, soldiers enjoy free subway and bus rides, yet hardly anyone would makes irresponsible remarks on this.</span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="line-height: 1.38;">“As soldiers, protecting the country is our duty. I hope our society does not forget our contributions and sacrifices,” says an Army Captain who prefers not to be named.</span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="line-height: 1.38;">CAPTION (centre-right): Even if standing, this soldier was photographed by someone and published online.

              Lols...aiyah...maybe the NSF personnel was sitting and at same time he felt asleep until he nearly fell down from his seat or maybe while asleep his body tilted on one side until his head landed on the aunty's shoulder. I think that would annoyed that aunty until to scorn him for sitting down and falling asleep. I have to admit, sometimes when I see young NSF personnel in uniform sleeping and nearly fall from his seat in the public transport, I feel like going to him and knock his sleepy head and tell him to be like a soldier...not a boy.
              
              Word of advise is to change to civilian after shower. Don't ever wear a dirty and smelly uniform in the public transport. It would provoke the public and give SAF a bad image.
