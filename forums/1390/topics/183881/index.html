            <div class='col-md body'>in my opinion, how a person wears his uniform is not only a reflection of personal bearing and pride, but also that of his unit's emphasis - if the unit emphasises proper bearing, then in all likelihood the person will be wearing his uniform to the correct standards. same goes for other R &amp; D related matters such as drills, commands, haircut, etc.<br><br>i cited the uniform only as an example. the main point is really what the force generally feels about the relevance of R &amp; D, and how you all feel about it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with you that a proper level of regimental discipline has to be maintain at all time. Discipline and bearing of our troopers are certainly reflective of how our armed forces project itself to the rest world, and possibly deter any potentially aggressor.<br>However, I am for operational discipline (OD) over regimental discipline (RD). Emphasis on the latter is no longer so much applicable over the former now as the battlefield strategy and doctrine have shifted away. Most importantly, operational discipline, readiness and teamwork win war, not regimental discipline.<br>Allocation of resources (time) is another aspect. Largely because we are a conscript force. As a commander of any strike or frontline unit, rightfully, the allocation for OD and RD in a time constrain space, very much should be tilted in favor of OD.<br><br>I am neither dismissing nor am I proposing to abolish RD but instead to give a more modern approach to warfare in the new era and how resources should be channelled more to training of troops where the resultant is a more impactful punch in the battlefield. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
