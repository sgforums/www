              <p><span><br><strong>PES A/B1 BMT</strong><br>This 9-week programme trains combat-fit recruits in the basic military skills to prepare them for advanced vocational training. The programme includes weapon training with the SAR 21 rifle which will teach recruits technical handling and marksmanship skills; a Battle Inoculation Course that simulates a real battlefield; a Field Camp which develops basic survival skills; progressive training to complete a 24-km route march which builds combat fitness and endurance; and hand grenade training.<br><br><em>For those who fail to achieve the NAPFA test silver award, they are required to undergo an 8-week Physical Training Phase prior to the Pes A/B1 BMT.</em><br> <br><strong>PES BP BMT</strong><br>As evidence has shown that obese recruits are able to achieve optimum fitness levels and weight loss in about 19 weeks, the new BMT programme for recruits with Body Mass Index (BMI) scores exceeding 27.0 will be 19 weeks. This BMT programme is designed to help obese recruits improve their physical fitness progressively while equipping them with basic soldiering skills and knowledge. <br> <br><strong>PES B2 BMT</strong><br>The new 9-week PES B2 BMT programme will be conducted for recruits who are medically fit for deployment in selected combat and combat support vocations, such as signal operators, combat medics and naval system operators. These recruits will be given a new medical classification of PES B2, in place of the existing PES C1 classification. This is to ensure that the medical classification of our soldiers is consistent with their deployment. The new 9-week programme will include customised physical training, as well as basic combat training to prepare them for their combat and combat support roles.<br> <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PES C BMT</strong></span><br>The new 9-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES C recruits.

              <p><span><span style="color: #0000ff;">SINGAPORE: Changes will be made
                                          to the Basic Military Training programme for National Service
                                          recruits from 2010.<br> <br> There will be a new 19-week BMT for obese recruits, and either a
                                          9-week or 4-week customised BMT for other classes of recruits to
                                          better prepare them for their subsequent combat, combat support and
                                          combat service support roles.<br> <br> Releasing details on Friday from the its two-stage review, the
                                          Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) said recruits whose Body Mass Index
                                          (BMI) exceeds 27 will have to undergo the new 19-week BMT programme
                                          that is designed to help them improve their physical fitness
                                          incrementally while equipping them with basic soldiering skills and
                                          knowledge.<br> <br> This is with effect from February 2010.<br> <br> It said the programme was introduced after a review to strengthen
                                          the BMT system as it was seen that over time, obese recruits have
                                          shown that they can achieve optimal fitness levels and weight loss
                                          in about 19 weeks.<br> <br> Recruits who are medically fit for deployment in selected combat
                                          and combat support vocations, such as signal operators, combat
                                          medics and naval system operators, will be given a new medical
                                          classification of PES B2, in place of the existing PES C1
                                          classification.<br> <br> The SAF said this is to ensure that the medical classification of
                                          the soldiers is consistent with their deployment and the recruits
                                          will undergo a new 9-week programme from June 2010, that will
                                          include customised physical training, as well as basic combat
                                          training to prepare them for their combat and combat support
                                          roles.<br> <br> As for those who are placed as PES C recruits, they too will
                                          undergo a new 9-week BMT programme from June 2010, with light
                                          physical and vocational training. This is to prepare them for
                                          combat service support vocations, such as service medic, and those
                                          related to logistics and administration such as supply
                                          assistants.<br> <br> There's also a new 4-week BMT programme that will be conducted for
                                          PES E recruits, focusing on National Education, SAF core values,
                                          regimentation and discipline, as well as vocational training to
                                          prepare recruits for combat service support vocations.<br> <br> Colonel Ng Wai Kit, assistant chief of general staff (training),
                                          SAF, said: "The latest changes to the BMT system begin with the
                                          introduction of the physical training phase to prepare our recruits
                                          who are less fit, and raise their fitness level to that which is
                                          comparable with their direct BMT peers."<br> <br> There will be no change to the standard BMT for PES A/B
                                          recruits.<br> <br> In the first phase of the review, the SAF looked at how recruits
                                          undergoing the 4-week Physical Training Phase (PTP) could be better
                                          prepared for BMT.<br> <br> This resulted in the introduction of an 8-week PTP, which will
                                          raise PTP recruits' physical fitness to a level that is comparable
                                          to their direct-BMT peers.<br> <br> The new PTP programme will begin in December
                                          2009.</span></span></p>
