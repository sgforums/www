              <p>It's 'proof', not 'prove', and look at you ignorant nus farmer farting through your mouth again with your cocksure certainty from a place of knowing.....nothing..cock sure with no cock...Amazing..everytime I think your ilk have hit rock bottom, you surprise me by outdoing yourself spectacularly. typical farmer behaviour, you're well prepared for your next phase of life, little wonder then you knew you'd only ever 'make it' to the slums you never bore the aspirations of high places....with your puny head burrowed into the knee deep sand, you personify the proverbial ostrich .</p>

              <p>Of course I knew what you were driving at with your 'invitation' to hong lim park. didn't I say you were feeling high from hollow 'victory'? And can't you see I described your half baked attempt as 'invitation' when you never once said that before? I thought you only had problems with grammar and tenses. I didn't know you had a problem understanding English as well. No wonder you could get a place in the 'regarded' and 'premier' law school in the world, that you aren't able to differentiate 'proof' from 'prove' and think 'stingy' is the adjective of sting, usual usages that primary 1 kids in popular gifted primary schools understand. Indeed..we both know no Angus Ross calibre over at the house of teraexa....Oh and don't blame SAF for your appalling  English which the degeneration institute's law school finds perfectly acceptable. My relatives and friends
                                              who have been in SAF for 9 to 15 yrs have superb command of the
                                              language, so your handicap isn't due to the SAF, instead it's connected to your impending degeneration and cements the appallingly low standards of local 'universities', which are more suited to be mental institutions.</p>
              <p>I mean the whole freaking world of Singapore knows that the cream of the A level go overseas. I think it's so hilarious for someone who aspires to be in the slums if he had the choice. And didn't you claim to have been given the choice? That's the reason why I find you peculiar out of all the farmers, i mean for them they admit freely that they couldn't make it anywhere else and can't hack it overseas. You on the other hand.. hmmmm</p>
              <p>Like i said earlier, to which you could say nothing, so some things do stuff up the fat mouths of your ilk..., the mean grade of the least selective school in LSE, ICL and an Oxford reject is higher than even a lot of the people in your most selective med here, i don't know how you can feel any pride in faulty rejected goods. definitely insane..</p>
              <p>Even when degeneration institutes give out free places without you applying in desperation, they get rejected by the cream ...not a single one wants to go.. sad...sad<strong>.</strong>..lelong lelong give people free defective goods but people are cream of the crop, Olympiad winners free if defective they also look down..so funny really..</p>

              <p>Fine fine. You win. You are overseas-educated. You win. You have good A level results (even though I think your results are not as good as mine). You are above all.</p>
              <p>Whatever. Go ahead and be delusional (ah now didn't you use that word against me too?). When 2 persons accuse each other of being delusional, there are only 2 logical outcomes, only 1 is sane or both are insane.</p>
              <p>There's no point arguing with one who openly flaunts his overseas education and wearing it like a badge of honour while concurrently slamming those that are unable to make it overseas due to constraints like financial areas.</p>
              <p>Still, I stand firm on the fact that I had a choice and it was of my own conscious decision to remain here. I have batch mates who applied to LSE and got in with results along the lines of Bs and 1 C. Certainly, that speaks pretty highly about overseas university. Oh btw, I had a classmate who was overheard asking others during a scholarship interview "What is the Cold War?" and for the Supreme Being's sake she's in LSE Economics on Parents' Scholarship! Now tell me if the likes of her can get in, what does it say about overseas universities?</p>
              <p>In the end, it doesn't even matter. You will stand firm on your point and not budge a nanometre away from it. Nevertheless, you have given me some motivation to work smart to prove you wrong.</p>
              <p>See you in 20 years' time then. However, with an attitude like yours, it's amazing that you don't get beaten up in the streets or you are just a plain hypocrite.</p>
