              <p>clap clap so which wing do you say leh?sierra for girls? foxtrot?</p>
              <p>Section field camp wildboar of delta wing is 3 days more, about 100% longer in duration all the other wings.</p>
              <p>delta is always the same OOC as Foxtrot, Sierra and Tango. Army assigned delta to be the wing to assess who they want to pick. Even the dropouts of delta wing who failed to make the cut for the SAFOS have the rights to say that they went through delta wing OCS. In fact out of the wing, since only 5 people are selected, it means the rest who are farmers like teraexa have earned the right to say they went through delta coy (did you teraexa? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png">) not bad not bad! Clap clap!!!!!! i am impressed by him!</p>
              <p>you can read one of the numerous accounts of farmers' delta experience here http://sgharry.blogspot.com/2006_06_01_archive.html there are tonnes more, this guy here is my friend...90% of scholars do not blog about this. u probably confused yourself with delta in BMT, which is well, chicken feed.</p>

              <p>still, let me clarify one thing: i didn't serve out my entire service term in delta wing. i went over to air wing after 2 weeks. unlike you, i won't consider myself having 'completed' delta wing because i never even finished the army service term there. those who have done it have gone through shit and i respect them for having done that (i count at least 3 to 4 close friends, of which 1 is an OMS in case you demand for the credentials of my friends).</p>
              <p>psycho_max is correct to state that delta wing is not exactly the most xiong wing in ocs because alpha wing is up there with them even though alpha wing usually caters to the poly intake. foxtrot and sierra cadets are not known to watch 'horror shows' for nothing.</p>
              <p>however, that said, gloater, i sometimes wonder how you are able to roll off the details of delta wing training (from your scholar relatives no doubt) with such ease and yet there is a lack of evidence that you were in delta for a single day. in fact, did you even go ocs? i feel only those who have been through, even for a single day (much less 9 mths which is why i say again i respect those who completed it), are deserving to speak of the training because that is what they have went through and experienced. i won't, because i went over to air wing after 2 weeks and also because i have a sense of shame (go ahead and start your attack on my views of local uni. i know you are itching for it right here right now). you? i am not so sure...</p>
              <p>yep 2 weeks in delta did make me grow up somewhat and being surrounded by all the scholars-to-be is a humbling experience to say the least. nevertheless, i learnt as much, if not much more, when i went over to air wing. scholars? hardly any. i can count on my hand the scholars-to-be in air wing. still, the regulars, who are mostly from poly, offered a world view that was both different and refreshing compared to that offered by the cacoon of "Top 3" jc alumni. that is something that you will never get with scholars-to-be around, no matter how intelligent, high-flying they are. it's simply because they have never gotten gpa 2.2+, never failed before and never learnt to work to pay their own studies (not for allowances or to pad their CVs).</p>
              <p>the difference in the worlds of scholars and normal poly grads are as different as the day and the night. you have been spending too much time in the day.</p>

              <p>as to what you see, your myopic view can't be more obvious when you went on to savage every single local graduate and trampled on their dignities or what little is left of them just because you happen to be born with a silver spoon and be able to afford to study in a foreign institution. now suddenly you've come to say, "i made and have plenty of friends in all walks of life including those who did not complete secondary school." while you spew your bigotry here. hypocrisy? do the 'friends' you have happen to be exclusive of the very group of local graduates which you gunned down mercilessly online? if you have this group of 'friends', what will they think of you if that post/thread was attributed to you? you know better, paper warrior.</p>
              <p>and by the way, i extend no concern towards you. it's pity. learn to recognise the difference, foreign university graduate. to you, i may be a dumbo that's just delusional about the standard of local universities. to me, you are no better.</p>

                                      high-fliers. for the uninitiated to your background here, he/she
                                      can jolly well be forgiven for thinking that you are a stalker of
                                      these high-fliers.</p>
              <p>as to what you see, your myopic view can't be more obvious when
                                      you went on to savage every single local graduate and trampled on
                                      their dignities or what little is left of them just because you
                                      happen to be born with a silver spoon and be able to afford to
                                      study in a foreign institution. now suddenly you've come to say, "i
                                      made and have plenty of friends in all walks of life including
                                      those who did not complete secondary school." while you spew your
                                      bigotry here. hypocrisy? do the 'friends' you have happen to be
                                      exclusive of the very group of local graduates which you gunned
                                      down mercilessly online? if you have this group of 'friends', what
                                      will they think of you if that post/thread was attributed to you?
                                      you know better, paper warrior.</p>
              <p>and by the way, i extend no concern towards you. it's pity.
                                      learn to recognise the difference, foreign university graduate. to
                                      you, i may be a dumbo that's just delusional about the standard of
                                      local universities. to me, you are no better.</p>

              <p>My my, thanks for pointing out that particular blind spot. Darn. How was I able to relate stingy as being the adjective of sting? My my, see what SAF has done to me... I believe a little gratitude to you is in order here. After all, I give credit even to people with craniums of concrete-thickness when it's due.</p>
              <p>Me stalking you? Well maybe you forgotten that in 3 different threads, you invoked my name 3 different times to support your local-graduate-bashing. Tell me, oh-mighty-foreign-graduate, who is the stalker and who is being stalked?</p>
              <p>As for 'inviting' you to air your views in a non-internet platform, it was a pseudo-ruse to see if you had the guts to stand by your bigoted views. Well, it seems like you totally misinterpreted it. Dear dear, what happened to your quality overseas education? Can't even interpret an easy thing like this? Or perhaps you just don't have the balls to do so?</p>
              <p>You can be rest assured that you will hardly qualify as one of my accquaintances, much less a 'friend'. After all, I believe your definition of 'friend' perhaps matches up to my definition of 'accquaintance'. No wonder you claim to have 'friends' from all walks of life. Still, even if fate dictates that I have the penultimate misfortune of having you as one of my 'friend', I guess I won't be angry with you. No point getting angry over a 'friend' whose heart is perhaps the size of a helium atom and mind as open as a virgin's pussy.</p>
              <p>For the money-vs-quality argument, you are perhaps the biggest prove that money is all that bigots like you need to enter 'quality' overseas universities compared to one who probably has more talent but much less money. By the way, you still have not stated your university for you claim that it is unnecessary and you don't wish to sully your university's name. Well, in that case, it seems like your claims of having undergone 'quality' education at a 'quality' overseas university can hardly be qualified. How can we be sure that you didn't go to Universiti Teknologi Malaysia?</p>
              <p>Still, Gloater/Gloaterback, I must congratulate you for adding a certain amount of spice to these forums. It's been a long time since a punching bag appeared in this forum and you fit the requirements like a glove (or some will say condom).</p>
              <p>If you are laughing at the person in front of you, finish it quick. I will be removing the mirror in a short while.</p>
              <p>BTW, what's up with the suffix 'back'? Did your original account get banned? Or did the Supreme Being decid to lengthen your online forum nickname in compensation for the shortening of your reproductive appendage? Or is the suffix 'back' in commemoration of something you just broke?</p>
