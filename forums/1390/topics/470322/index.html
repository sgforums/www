              <p>Okay first of all, I was caught for bringing a camera phone into camp. But I brought it for a reason. It was for my business emails which I couldn't afford to delay my reply to them. Im a NSF with a small e-business running outside.</p>
              <p>Today a sudden raid by the Security Troopers (RPs) made me forfeited my camera phone. My name &amp; IC was taken down and was given a verbal warning saying that this time they will let me off and if there were to be a next time, they will take formal actions against me. I have a few questions here,</p>

              <p>Source: www.ns.sg<br> <br> <strong>Military Justice System in the SAF</strong><br> <br> 1. Overview<br> The military justice system in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is
              expected to treat every service personnel fairly and equally,
              regardless of race, rank or vocation.<br> <br>  <br> 2. Multi-levelled Approach<br> <br> The military justice system is based on the SAF Act, which was
              implemented in 1972. All servicemen are subjected to the SAF Act,
              SAF Regulations, and orders of whatever form issued pursuant to
              them.<br> <br> While discipline is paramount in the military, not all offences
              committed by SAF servicemen are dealt with by formal investigations
              and charges. Essentially, offenders can be dealt with either by way
              of informal or formal punishment systems.<br> <br>  <br> 3. Informal Punishment System<br> Commanders are empowered to mete out informal punishments like
              push-ups and weekend confinement to servicemen who have committed
              disciplinary breaches, like being late, sluggish, or improperly
              dressed.<br> <br>  <br> <br> 4. Formal Punishment System<br> If the offence that a serviceman committed is of a more serious
              nature, he may be formally dealt with by his disciplinary officer
              by way of a summary trial, or brought before a subordinate military
              court (more commonly known as the General Court Martial or
              GCM).<br> <br> (a) Summary Trial<br> <br> The offences that can be dealt with by summary trial are
              essentially military offences, such as absence without leave
              (AWOL), non-compliance with lawful orders or insubordination.<br> <br> Depending on the rank of the serviceman in question, and the type
              of the disciplinary body hearing the case, the possible sentences
              that may be imposed can vary, and these can include fines or
              detention.<br> <br> The summary trial is carried out in accordance with relevant SAF
              regulations, and the records of the summary trial are sent to the
              office of the Director, Legal Services of the SAF.<br> <br> (b) General Court Martial<br> <br> The General Court Martial exists as a separate forum from that of
              the summary trial. Unlike the summary trial, the GCM can deal with
              a wider range of offences, and can impose a wider range of
              punishments including imprisonment and discharge, on top of
              sentences like detention and fines. The GCM is also a more public
              and open forum, and its proceedings are conducted using similar
              legal rules and procedures as those used in a civil criminal
              court.<br> <br> Generally, only serious offences investigated by the Military
              Police Command, and which are referred to the office of the
              Director of Legal Services, will result in the accused serviceman
              being charged in a GCM. In such a case, a military prosecutor will
              draw up a formal charge sheet and present it before the GCM.<br> <br> General Courts Martial can be further sub-divided into two
              categories, namely the Panel Courts Martial - consisting of a
              President and usually two other members, and Judge Courts Martial -
              consisting of a single President only.<br> <br> Currently, the practice is for military offences to be heard by
              Panel Courts Martial, while civil offences like misuse of drugs and
              penal code offences may be dealt with by a Judge Court
              Martial.<br> <br> <br> The current policy is also for an NSman, who is or was a District
              Judge in the Subordinate Courts, to preside in a GCM. There are
              currently 10 NSmen who have been appointed by the Armed Forces
              Council to perform duty as President of a court martial. They are
              rostered by the Registrar of the Subordinate Military Court to hear
              cases during their in-camp training. In the case of a Panel Court
              Martial, the other two members are rostered from among some 155
              military officers appointed by the Chief of Defence Force.<br> <br>  <br> 5. Ways to Seek Redress<br> <br> There are numerous safeguards and avenues set out in the military
              justice system for an SAF serviceman to seek redress if he is
              unhappy about the punishment imposed on him.<br> <br> Generally, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with an informal
              punishment meted out to him may request a higher level commander to
              review the punishment, or request for formal disciplinary
              dealing.<br> <br> In the case of a summary trial, a serviceman brought before the
              disciplinary officer may elect instead to be tried by a court
              martial. Alternatively, an aggrieved serviceman may request that
              his conviction or punishment imposed at the summary trial be
              reviewed by MINDEF's Director Manpower (a delegated authority of
              the Armed Forces Council).<br> <br> In the case of a GCM, a serviceman may choose to be represented by
              a lawyer or an SAF defending officer if his case will be heard by a
              court martial. The SAF has about 200 trained defending officers.
              While an SAF defending officer comes free to the serviceman, he has
              to bear the cost of engaging a lawyer. At the end of the trial, a
              serviceman who is dissatisfied with the decision of the court
              martial may petition the Reviewing Authority (the AFC or a
              committee of its members) for a review of his case. The serviceman
              can also appeal to the Military Court of Appeal (MCA) for a
              reconsideration of his conviction, or his sentence, or both.<br> <br> The MCA, when convened to hear an appeal, sits as a panel of five
              members. Heading the MCA is a President, who is appointed by the
              Chief Justice. By law, he must be a person qualified to be a Judge
              of the Supreme Court. The current President of the MCA is Justice
              Choo Han Teck. Four other members - two civilian members who are
              qualified legal practitioners with at least five years experience
              each, and two senior military officers - make up the rest of the
              MCA. The MCA is the highest court in the military justice
              system.<br> <br>  <br> 6. Impartial Hearings<br> It is important to recognise that the GCM and the MCA are tribunals
              headed by presidents who are outside the SAF chain of
              command.<br> <br> Being an "outsider", the president of these forums will hear the
              case impartially like any other civil criminal case. The
              proceedings in the GCM and the MCA are also heard in a public
              forum, and these military courts adopt many of the same legal
              procedures and safeguards as that used in the civil criminal
              courts. All servicemen formally charged with an offence can bring
              their case to these forums.</p>

              <p><span>From 1 Sep 2012, camera mobile phones will be permitted in
                  designated areas within 14 Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) camps as
                  part of a pilot security zoning programme.</span></p>
              <p>Selected for the high volume of Operationally-Ready National
                  Servicemen (NSmen) and full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) who
                  pass through for training or administration, these include camps
                  that house fitness conditioning centres, training institutes, the
                  Central Manpower Base and Basic Military Training Centre.</p>
              <p>Areas in camps where camera mobile phones are allowed are termed
                  Green Zones, though the existing security stance on photography
                  remains the same. Unless authorised by unit commanders for special
                  events such as open houses, graduation parades and cohesion
                  activities, photography is prohibited. Examples of Green Zones
                  include medical centres, accommodation bunks and cookhouses.</p>
              <p>Within the Red Zones, which are areas where sensitive and
                  classified information is present, camera mobile phones are not
                  allowed. Before entering a Red Zone, camera mobile phones must be
                  deposited in lockers. Examples of Red Zones include units'
                  operation rooms and offices with computer access to classified
                  information.</p>
              <p>The pilot programme was implemented for the convenience of
                  servicemen, and because of the proliferation of smart phones,
                  according to Chief of Staff-General Staff Brigadier-General Tung
                  Yui Fai, who announced this initiative at the Infantry Training
                  Institute (ITI) on 31 Aug.</p>
              <p>He added: "This security zoning allows us to better secure areas
                  we think we need to protect better. At the same time, it allows
                  flexibility and convenience for our servicemen who operate within
                  the camp."</p>
              <p>Enhanced security measures will be in place at the Red Zones.
                  Where practical, a perimeter fence will be erected to demarcate the
                  Red from the Green Zones; clear signboards will be prominently
                  displayed at the entrance of a Red Zone, and digital locks and
                  close-circuit cameras will be installed for added security.</p>
              <p>Only camera mobile phones are allowed in this pilot programme,
                  which will last for six to nine months before a review is
                  conducted. Tablets such as iPads, laptops and digital cameras are
                  still prohibited.</p>
              <p>For NSman 3rd Sergeant (3SG) (NS) Lavin Achudan, a
                  marketing manager with Johnson &amp; Johnson who uses an iPhone 4S
                  to access his work emails, being able to bring his camera phone
                  into camp eases his workload. Previously, he would borrow his
                  brother’s basic NOKIA phone when he had to go for his In-Camp
                  Training.</p>
              <p>"As a marketing manager, I have to constantly reply to emails
                  from my sales team and customers, and replying emails in the
                  shortest time possible is my highest priority. Allowing me to bring
                  my iPhone to camp allows me to communicate with my customers
                  efficiently, and that is very important to me," said the platoon
                  sergeant of 731st Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment.
                   </p>
              <p>"When I am not training, I can reply to these emails
                  immediately, as opposed to having to wait till I book out at night
                  to reply to emails. It allows me to reply whenever I have time...
                  It's about the convenience of being able to bring in a phone which
                  I always use, which happens to have a camera," added the
                  28-year-old.</p>
              <p>Echoing this sentiment is 20-year-old NSF 2nd Lieutenant
                  (2LT) Kok Chun Hou, who is a curriculum coordinator at ITI. He
                  uses a basic NOKIA phone in camp and an iPhone 3GS outside of
                  camp.</p>
              <p>Citing some inconveniences of using two phones, such as having
                  to input contacts into both phones, 2LT Kok said: "This current NSF
                  generation grew up in the IT age; it's our habit to stay connected.
                  We live, work and play differently from previous generations, so
                  connectivity is very important to us."</p>
              <p>"I would also use my smart phone for personal banking and
                  stock-investing. With the implementation of the pilot scheme, I now
                  have the option of just stepping out of the office to use my smart
                  phone," he said</p>
              <p><span>For the convenience of our servicemen, the Singapore Armed
                  Forces (SAF) will be implementing a pilot security zoning programme
                  across 14 selected SAF camps. Under the pilot security zoning
                  programme, these 14 camps will be segregated into two distinct
                  zones: Red and Green Zone.</span></p>
              <p><span>From 1 Sep 2012, servicemen will be allowed to carry
                  camera equipped mobile phones into the Green Zones of the 14
                  selected SAF camps. For servicemen who need to enter the Red Zone,
                  they must deposit their camera equipped mobile phones at designated
                  lockers prior to entry.</span></p>
              <p>Photography in all SAF camp premises for both Red and Green
                  Zones remain prohibited unless expressedly allowed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) will be implementing a
                  pilot security zoning programme across 14 selected SAF camps on 1
                  Sep 2012. These 14 selected SAF camps will be segregated into
                  either Red or Green Zone. Servicemen will be allowed to carry
                  camera equipped mobile phones in the Green Zones. Possession of
                  camera equipped mobile phone is prohibited in Red Zones. Before
                  entering a Red Zone, servicemen who possess a camera equipped
                  mobile phone are required to deposit them at the provided
                  lockers.<br> <br> <strong>Red Zones.</strong> Areas where sensitive and classified
                  information and equipment are processed and managed. These areas
                  may include server rooms, unit operation rooms, and offices with
                  computer access to sensitive information. All other areas outside
                  the Red Zone will be designated as Green Zones. Some examples of
                  Green Zone areas are medical centres, accommodation bunks and
                  cookhouses.<br> <br> Enhanced security measures will be implemented in the Red Zone.
                  Wherever practical, a perimeter fence will be established to
                  segregate the Red and Green Zones. Clear warning signboards will be
                  prominently displayed at the entrance to inform servicemen that
                  they are about to enter a Red Zone. Digital locks will also be
                  installed to control access into the Red Zones. CCTVs with images
                  wired to the unit operations room will also be installed at
                  selected locations within the Red Zone.<br> <br> Photography in all SAF camp premises continues to be prohibited
                  regardless of the zone.</span></p>
