Just light and tricks, say investigators<br><span class="small">By Nur Dianah Suhaimi</span><br><br>THE cellphone sex video craze that has hit the mainstream Internet in recent weeks seems to have spawned an offspring:<br><br>The cellphone ghost video.<br><br>One video circulating online shows a group of military policemen filming themselves on guard duty at night when, suddenly, they hear the sound of continuous, cackling laughter.<br><br>Then, as if to explain the cackling, a white, unmoving figure appears on the right side of the screen, causing the men to panic.<br><br>Another video shows four policemen singing National Day songs while manning a roadblock on a deserted-looking stretch of road. A car passes by, followed shortly after by a white, floating figure.<br><br>Many people, it appears, are falling for them.<br><br>'I think the videos are real because the ghost appearances look accidental. Nobody will purposely make the videos just to scare people,' said Miss Lina Lee, 24, a customer service officer.<br><br>Miss Lee could not be more wrong.<br><br>Video experts and paranormal investigators told The Sunday Times that the 'ghosts' in the two videos are far from paranormal.<br><br>The Singapore Paranormal Investigators (SPI) said that the videos had been sent to it by e-mail and a number of questions had been posted on its Internet forum.<br><br>The SPI investigated and concluded that there were no ghosts in both videos. In fact, the video of the military policemen on guard duty had obviously been faked.<br><br>When he examined the 'ghost' in the minute-long video, SPI investigator Alvic Tan thought it was possibly a target board used in the army.<br><br>'When I zoomed in on the figure, I saw a long gun barrel protruding out, which makes it look exactly like a standing target board,' he said.<br><br>SPI investigators and other Singaporeans also commented that the cackling laughter sounds very much like a cellphone ringtone once popular among youngsters.<br><br>As for the video of the police roadblock, SPI experts said the white floating figure was actually light from the car.<br><br>'The phone camera was used in night mode and this increases the contrast and brightness of the captured video. The 'ghost' is just the bright light from the headlamps of the car,' said SPI member Sim Joo Khai.<br><br>But the willingness of Singaporeans to believe in such things might have to do with an enduring fascination with the supernatural.<br><br>Horror movies and ghost story books have always had an enthusiastic following here.<br><br>Locally produced horror film The Eye grossed nearly $2 million at the Singapore box office in 2002.<br><br>But video expert and production assistant Foo Soo Hian said fakes are easy to produce.<br><br>'Nowadays, videos can be doctored like photos. There's even a specific programme which allows people to add special effects like white orbs or green glow to normal videos. So we mustn't easily believe whatever that is shown to us,' he said.<br><br>ndianah@sph.com.sg</div>

Me went back for reservist and already had to go through stringent checks on whether we are bringing in a camera phone.<br><br>Now with this clip, it shows that the system has double standards in perm staff, NSFs and NUSAFs that go in and out of the camp everyday, and NSmen. Me noticed whenever me reported back to camp for my reservist, all the permstaff, NSFs and NUSAFs need not go through the checking process, and me had to toss my things and handphone out of my pockets for the RPs to check with the metal detector brushing around my body.<br><br>Maybe time for MINDEF to review the SOPs for checking.</div>
