Sublaterns do have their fair share senior officers using their rank to throw all sorts of work and shit to the sublaterns. well it just doesn't happen in the SAF, but across the working world.<br><br>There are also managers supervisors who by means of balls carrying do climb to senior or management position, and their lack of working ethics has cast a blanket of misjudgement and mistrust by those who has worked with them.<br><br>And junior officers ain't really the king in a Unit, not in my case, as potraying such arragant behaviour usually have a bad working relationship with his commanders and men. Throwing the bars ard in camp might scare people off at certain time, but ultimately the sublatern will stand to lose out more if the men choose to play him out. And i am NOT saying that the officers has to be popular  among the men.<br><br>Being popular is easy, being a gd leader isn't. Unpoplular decisions has to be made at times, for all these events may seem unpopular with people, this how the world works, your not going to tell me just because a Commanding officer likes so and so and send the other companies to fight.<br><br>Lastly, my platoon sergeant onced told us back in BMT, "before you start to comment on your superior decisions and actions, you these CCBS better have earned his rank first before even saying that out"<br><br>regards<br></div>
