            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gordonator:</div><div class="quote_body">please enlighten me. got junior officers posted to secondary schools as NCC commander?</div></blockquote>Was formerly an NCC cadet and am now a SISPEC trainee so I know a thing or two about this arrangement.<br><br>The NCC runs on a kind of dual management track. Half of it is run by the MOE and the other half by MINDEF since each ministry pays for half of the operating expenditure of the Corps.<br><br>At the top of the management you have a Commandant who is usually a Regular LTC who's arrived at the final 2-3 years of his career. This final posting allows a senior officer to rub shoulders with big shots from the two ministries without doing anything really strenous.<br><br>At the middle level, you have the Teacher Officers, who were seconded to the Corps by the MOE.<br><br>After that come the Warrant Officers. These are regulars who are either rotated out after a 2-3 years or are posted there permanently (usually due to medical downgrade).<br><br>Last come the NSFs. These are Officers and Specialists who were lucky enough to be combat fit and Infantry-trained but hit the jackpot when they arrived at the most relaxed posting possible for someone with their background. Officers usually number around 5 and specialists about double that number. Characteristics that are usually seen for people posted to NCC are:<br><br>1) No tattoos<br>2) Usually from JC and speak decent English (for officers especially)<br>3) Performed average in OCS or SISPEC. Not exactly the rotten worst of the lot but never the best either. They don't send crap to NCC since NCC tends to attract a sizeable number of whitehorses e.g. Minister's sons, Senior officer's children...</div>
