              <p>Hi comrades,</p>
              <p>I've been recently downgraded from combat fit pes to C9L9 due to some injury which will stay with me for the rest of my life, unless I opt for surgery to get it fixed. I don't really wanna talk about this injury as it makes me feel so upset and depressed all over again.</p>
              <p>My superior made a joke out of my injury on two different occasion already, he often came out with sarcastic remarks about my injury and making a joke out of it in front of the whole platoon. Perhaps he thought that I don't have any feeling with regards to his insensitve "jokes" Just for your information, I got injured during active service to this country and I gave my best performance during every training. Now I can't believe I'm being treated like this when I'm injured. So much for care for soldier as the core value.</p>
              <p>Given my current PES status, I'm aware that I can't be deployed outfield and I can only be stationed in base for work. Is it a breach of TSR if my superiors despite knowing about my PES status still insist on deploying me outfield to carry out work which will worsen my medical condition? And who do I look for to seek help with regards to my situation right now. I don't have excess money to go out to seek treatment from private doctor and the waiting time for public hospital is really long though. I just have to wait for the mean time for my appointment.</p>
              <p>My condition has somehow worsened after being deployed outfield for two times and is it possible for me to seek legal service outside to take action against these officers for making me carry out task which I can't really do so due to my condition?</p>
              <p>How do I seek reddress against that officer who've been making insensitive remarks about my medical condition? Somehow I feel that approaching his boss will only resulting in this matter being covered up internally by them.</p>
              <p>Please do not think that I'm some chao geng soldier or Kengster, I've always wanted to serve and now after getting injured and being treated like the above mentioned way really changed my perception about serving NS and I just lost all my passion for NS and the purpose of me serving. </p>
              <p>Someone please just tell me what to do. </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Military Justice System in the
                      SAF</span></span><br></strong><br> <br> 1. Overview<br> The military justice system in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is
                      expected to treat every service personnel fairly and equally,
                      regardless of race, rank or vocation.</p>
              <p> <br> 2. Multi-levelled Approach</p>
              <p>The military justice system is based on the SAF Act, which was
                      implemented in 1972. All servicemen are subjected to the SAF Act,
                      SAF Regulations, and orders of whatever form issued pursuant to
                      them.</p>
              <p>While discipline is paramount in the military, not all offences
                      committed by SAF servicemen are dealt with by formal investigations
                      and charges. Essentially, offenders can be dealt with either by way
                      of informal or formal punishment systems.</p>
              <p> <br> 3. Informal Punishment System<br> Commanders are empowered to mete out informal punishments like
                      push-ups and weekend confinement to servicemen who have committed
                      disciplinary breaches, like being late, sluggish, or improperly
                      dressed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Formal Punishment System<br> If the offence that a serviceman committed is of a more serious
                      nature, he may be formally dealt with by his disciplinary officer
                      by way of a summary trial, or brought before a subordinate military
                      court (more commonly known as the General Court Martial or
                      GCM).</p>
              <p>(a) Summary Trial</p>
              <p>The offences that can be dealt with by summary trial are
                      essentially military offences, such as absence without leave
                      (AWOL), non-compliance with lawful orders or insubordination.</p>
              <p>Depending on the rank of the serviceman in question, and the
                      type of the disciplinary body hearing the case, the possible
                      sentences that may be imposed can vary, and these can include fines
                      or detention.</p>
              <p>The summary trial is carried out in accordance with relevant SAF
                      regulations, and the records of the summary trial are sent to the
                      office of the Director, Legal Services of the SAF.</p>
              <p>(b) General Court Martial</p>
              <p>The General Court Martial exists as a separate forum from that
                      of the summary trial. Unlike the summary trial, the GCM can deal
                      with a wider range of offences, and can impose a wider range of
                      punishments including imprisonment and discharge, on top of
                      sentences like detention and fines. The GCM is also a more public
                      and open forum, and its proceedings are conducted using similar
                      legal rules and procedures as those used in a civil criminal
                      court.</p>
              <p>Generally, only serious offences investigated by the Military
                      Police Command, and which are referred to the office of the
                      Director of Legal Services, will result in the accused serviceman
                      being charged in a GCM. In such a case, a military prosecutor will
                      draw up a formal charge sheet and present it before the GCM.</p>
              <p>General Courts Martial can be further sub-divided into two
                      categories, namely the Panel Courts Martial - consisting of a
                      President and usually two other members, and Judge Courts Martial -
                      consisting of a single President only.</p>
              <p>Currently, the practice is for military offences to be heard by
                      Panel Courts Martial, while civil offences like misuse of drugs and
                      penal code offences may be dealt with by a Judge Court Martial.</p>
              <p><br> The current policy is also for an NSman, who is or was a District
                      Judge in the Subordinate Courts, to preside in a GCM. There are
                      currently 10 NSmen who have been appointed by the Armed Forces
                      Council to perform duty as President of a court martial. They are
                      rostered by the Registrar of the Subordinate Military Court to hear
                      cases during their in-camp training. In the case of a Panel Court
                      Martial, the other two members are rostered from among some 155
                      military officers appointed by the Chief of Defence Force.</p>
              <p> <br> 5. Ways to Seek Redress</p>
              <p>There are numerous safeguards and avenues set out in the
                      military justice system for an SAF serviceman to seek redress if he
                      is unhappy about the punishment imposed on him.</p>
              <p>Generally, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with an informal
                      punishment meted out to him may request a higher level commander to
                      review the punishment, or request for formal disciplinary
                      dealing.</p>
              <p>In the case of a summary trial, a serviceman brought before the
                      disciplinary officer may elect instead to be tried by a court
                      martial. Alternatively, an aggrieved serviceman may request that
                      his conviction or punishment imposed at the summary trial be
                      reviewed by MINDEF's Director Manpower (a delegated authority of
                      the Armed Forces Council).</p>
              <p>In the case of a GCM, a serviceman may choose to be represented
                      by a lawyer or an SAF defending officer if his case will be heard
                      by a court martial. The SAF has about 200 trained defending
                      officers. While an SAF defending officer comes free to the
                      serviceman, he has to bear the cost of engaging a lawyer. At the
                      end of the trial, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with the
                      decision of the court martial may petition the Reviewing Authority
                      (the AFC or a committee of its members) for a review of his case.
                      The serviceman can also appeal to the Military Court of Appeal
                      (MCA) for a reconsideration of his conviction, or his sentence, or
                      both.</p>
              <p>The MCA, when convened to hear an appeal, sits as a panel of
                      five members. Heading the MCA is a President, who is appointed by
                      the Chief Justice. By law, he must be a person qualified to be a
                      Judge of the Supreme Court. The current President of the MCA is
                      Justice Choo Han Teck. Four other members - two civilian members
                      who are qualified legal practitioners with at least five years
                      experience each, and two senior military officers - make up the
                      rest of the MCA. The MCA is the highest court in the military
                      justice system.</p>
              <p> <br> 6. Impartial Hearings<br> It is important to recognise that the GCM and the MCA are tribunals
                      headed by presidents who are outside the SAF chain of command.</p>
              <p>Being an "outsider", the president of these forums will hear the
                      case impartially like any other civil criminal case. The
                      proceedings in the GCM and the MCA are also heard in a public
                      forum, and these military courts adopt many of the same legal
                      procedures and safeguards as that used in the civil criminal
                      courts. All servicemen formally charged with an offence can bring
                      their case to these forums.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>REDRESS OF WRONG</strong></span><br><br><strong>AVENUES FOR SERVICEMEN SEEKING REDRESS</strong><br>MINDEF discourages servicemen from going to people or organisations outside<br>of MINDEF to seek redress as it may lead to a breach of existing security<br>regulations. The Official Secrets Act prohibits servicemen from communicating<br>classified or protected information to people who are not authorised to have<br>access to such information. Similarly, the Essential (Control of Publications<br>and Safeguarding of Information) Regulations, 1966 also prohibits all servicemen<br>from communicating their grievances, complaints or protected information to<br>any newspaper unless prior written consent has been given by Permanent<br>Secretary (Defence).<br><br><strong>Seeking Redress Through Proper Channels</strong><br>The SAF provides for any serviceman who thinks that he has been unfairly<br>treated to seek redress. If any serviceman thinks he has been wronged in any<br>matter by another serviceman superior to him, he must first approach his<br>immediate superior commander. If the complainant is an officer equal in rank<br>or superior to the commander, he may complain to an officer next senior in<br>rank to him. Complaints are to be fully and clearly stated in writing. For<br>servicemen seeking redress via MINDEF Feedback Unit, they may only do so<br>if their attempts to seek redress for their grievances at unit level were<br>unsuccessful.</p>
              <p>If a serviceman is not satisfied with the steps already taken by the officer to<br>redress his problem, he may complain in writing to the Armed Forces Council.<br>Such complaints should be addressed to the Secretary of the Armed Forces<br>Council. The Armed Forces Council will examine the complaint and do justice<br>in the matter.<br><br>The SAF Military Police (MP) Command will conduct an investigation into the<br>complaint dealing with the alleged breach of military discipline. If the investigation<br>discloses evidence of wrongdoing, MINDEF will take disciplinary action against<br>the offending parties. However, if the complainant is found to have made a<br>false accusation, disciplinary action will be taken against him.<br><br><strong>Seeking Redress Through Outside Parties</strong><br>Servicemen are prohibited from taking up issues concerning SAF or SAF<br>personnel to any party outside of the SAF. This includes posting such matters<br>on the INTERNET and other public forums. Servicemen should note that they<br>are not allowed to bring political (such as Members of Parliament (MPs)) or<br>outside influences to support or advance their individual claims. These include<br>work-related matters such as the terms and conditions of employment, extension<br>of contract, posting and change of vocation.<br><br><strong><em>Under exceptional circumstances</em></strong> where a serviceman has strong reason<br>to believe that he has been wronged by his colleague or superior, he may<br>approach the MP of his constituency for assistance.<br><br>To ensure factual accuracy of the complaint, a serviceman who approaches<br>his MP must give a detailed account of his complaint in writing. The serviceman<br>will sign the statement and give his name, rank, NRIC number and unit.

              <p>Hi comrades,</p>
              <p>I've been recently downgraded from combat fit pes to C9L9 due to
                      some injury which will stay with me for the rest of my life, unless
                      I opt for surgery to get it fixed. I don't really wanna talk about
                      this injury as it makes me feel so upset and depressed all over
                      again.</p>
              <p>My superior made a joke out of my injury on two different
                      occasion already, he often came out with sarcastic remarks about my
                      injury and making a joke out of it in front of the whole platoon.
                      Perhaps he thought that I don't have any feeling with regards to
                      his insensitve "jokes" Just for your information, I got injured
                      during active service to this country and I gave my best
                      performance during every training. Now I can't believe I'm being
                      treated like this when I'm injured. So much for care for soldier as
                      the core value.</p>
              <p>Given my current PES status, I'm aware that I can't be deployed
                      outfield and I can only be stationed in base for work. Is it a
                      breach of TSR if my superiors despite knowing about my PES status
                      still insist on deploying me outfield to carry out work which will
                      worsen my medical condition? And who do I look for to seek help
                      with regards to my situation right now. I don't have excess money
                      to go out to seek treatment from private doctor and the waiting
                      time for public hospital is really long though. I just have to wait
                      for the mean time for my appointment.</p>
              <p>My condition has somehow worsened after being deployed outfield
                      for two times and is it possible for me to seek legal service
                      outside to take action against these officers for making me carry
                      out task which I can't really do so due to my condition?</p>
              <p>How do I seek reddress against that officer who've been making
                      insensitive remarks about my medical condition? Somehow I feel that
                      approaching his boss will only resulting in this matter being
                      covered up internally by them.</p>
              <p>Please do not think that I'm some chao geng soldier or Kengster,
                      I've always wanted to serve and now after getting injured and being
                      treated like the above mentioned way really changed my perception
                      about serving NS and I just lost all my passion for NS and the
                      purpose of me serving. </p>
              <p>Someone please just tell me what to do. </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>You should be posted out of the unit, assuming no administrative paperwork lapse. <br>A change in PES most likely is a change in vocation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are strongly urged to opt for surgery.<br>If it is a knee injury, a recovery will be speedy/ easier as you are still young. <br>Get an MC and disppear for half-a-year. <br>The condition will only get worse when you get older. </p>
              <p>If you are C9L9 and you are not posted out of the unit, please seek your supervisor/ Manpower Officer/ Chief Clerk to do the paperwork for the vocational posting. It is important for your reservist too.</p>
