              <p>Hey guys,</p>
              <p>I just want to ask anyone for advice as i get blisters on my feet constantly even though i've worn my same pair of boots for the past 1 yr. Are there any advice u guys can give me aside from wearing double socks and putting powder? Coz i tried both of them and i still get the blisters. In case any of you are wondering why i'm not seeing an MO its because i think blisters is a matter of prevention. Furthermore my camp no MO so want to RS just for small thing like this very troublesome.</p>
              <p>Thanks in advance.</p>

              <p>You gets blisters because there's some movement between your feet and the boot while you wear the boot. Like what "the Bear" said.</p>
              <p>I'd advice you to go get a properly fitting boot, that fits well with one pair of socks, if you plan to wear it as such. The one you have is probably a little too big. Then when you wear your boots, make sure you lace it tight.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There's another novel solution that is much more convenient if not a little bit unorthodox. But trust me, it works. Go to any convenience store and buy some "warm jelly". It can be found along with the condoms. Its a sex lube. apply it at your blister area. It won't make the blisters feel better or heal faster, but it will prevent future ones.</p>
              <p>You might also consider stretching a condom over your feet.  </p>
              <p>Ok i was kidding about the last bit. </p>
              <p>mmmm... warm jelly.</p>

              <p>Hello, I used to have the same problem as TS. The boots had the correct size but fit poorly.</p>
              <p>I would recommend Bear's method of using tape... but not masking tape. Masking tape does not allow air to permeate in/out of the skin. Go to Guardian and buy rolls of tape used for bandaging or supporting fractured arms. Will cost a few dollars every time you have a route march. The trick then is to wrap the tape around your foot properly such time it doesn't slip.</p>
              <p>I hope you do not get blisters from just walking from bunk to cookhouse in boots.</p>

              <p>Wat size r u wearing?</p>
              <p>I guess TS is not referring to having blisters when doing route marches since he is already 1 year into service..Wat i can think of is TS did not tighten his boots,thus causing your foot to rub through the socks. I learn this the hard way coz 1 of my BMT mate did not tighten his boots and the whole platoon was knocked it down by the sgt and somemore take out our boots and under the hot sun..</p>

              <p>that type of surgical tape is good.. but sometimes in camp, can't find the correct type of tape.. so like i said, when push comes to shove, and need that kind of protection for your feet, i've found that there's aways masking tape in the camp  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p><br>I just go to Guardian or Watsons to buy enough for a few route marches at one time, then try to stock them up once in a while. I suffered for a few route marches (including the hellish 24km BMT march when I got 6 or 7 big blisters on each sole) before reaching this solution.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remember the first march I had with foot bandaged up well <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"> think I flew!</p>

              <p>lol thx for the suggestions guys. I'm trying to tape up with the bandage tapes i have from the first aid box i have in my storehouse =D so far the situation has improved and i fell more comfortable walking longer distances. FYI for you guys though, i do tighten my boots as much as i can and they fit me fine. I tried other sizes and its either too big or too small.</p>
              <p>Oh and its not for route marches =) I'm a ammo storeman then on certain days need to walk around the storehouses to do certain checks. Although not as shiong as route march but doing it consistently almost everyday really hurts the feet so thx for all the advice!</p>
