              <p>HAHA! Ya. He once commented that <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; color: #cc0000; font-weight: bold;">"All junior commanders should step up and take up the Ranger challenge and all unit commanders should encourage their subordinates to do so."</span></p>
              <p>Later Ranger course become compulsory... HAHA!</p>
              <p>But I'm disappointed that the incoming COA is so much less decorated then the outgoing COA. A trained Ranger and Guardsman, Thai Airborne Badge if I'm not wrong, Senior Parachutist with lots of ribbons. The incoming COA cannot compare in terms of decorations. </p>

              <p>Thanks for sharing your view but however respectfully i disagree.</p>
              <p>If the transformation of the SAF from 2G to 3G is orders from the Lee family, I must say they are really amazing and handling everything well.</p>
              <p>Outgoing CDF transform the SAF into a effective armed force that even foreign forces agree that SAF is credible and operationally ready force.</p>
              <p>There might be some string pulling behind but still the CDF decide what is good for the SAF and improve the standard.</p>
              <p>Just my honest opinion. =D   </p>

              <p><br>Indeed. CDF is just a puppet. He listen to the Minister of defence- Lao Teo. U see. Always got overseas general come. Lao Teo always go and entertain one. The CDF is just like a passer by. Help to entertain them only.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, why got so many badges? SAF din even fight in war before. They just want to make the uniform look nice only. But to me it just a pile of useless badges. If u are US Marines 4 star general. I think u dun even look upon our generals in Singapore. China same too.</p>

              <p>* You can see friends around u. Either IPPT failed or Pes C. why real figure to hurt our country. As agreed. For show ma.</p>
              <p>I don't know why must have 1 million regulars to have a 3 star general. I would like to know why you said that. Honestly no offence, just want to see your views. =D</p>
              <p>* A strong forces consist of how many regulars. Refer to US and China. U need a 3 star to rule over i mean i est 100,000 regular and active NSF. What kind of logic. Read history. 4 to 5 star is always born when a war start and all the reserve forces became active or after war.</p>
