              <p>OH! No more 5 minute rule before i can post again! YEAH!</p>
              <p>Hey Itedino! Thanks for sharing your view! Greatly appreciated!</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">* You can see friends around u. Either IPPT failed or Pes C. why real figure to hurt our country. As agreed. For show ma.</span></p>
              <p>Hmmmm.... I not sure thou. I have friends who are just wth weak but i do have mates who are fit as hell. 30 plus chin up one go is no problem for them. Some are weak and some are strong. But still can't say much from what happening around me thou. =D</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">* A strong forces consist of how many regulars. Refer to US and China. U need a 3 star to rule over i mean i est 100,000 regular and active NSF. What kind of logic. Read history. 4 to 5 star is always born when a war start and all the reserve forces became active or after war.</span></p>
              <p>Hmmm... well i don't know much about this. Number of troops need for a general. I am open to any comments and I will read further about this. Thanks!</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">* So can you list down his concern of work for our country to see, please include his salary also so we can benchmark. No offense.</span></p>
              <p>HAHA! Yeah his salary is out of his world. But I guess no country release their Generals salary. If they do then we should really compare and demand a decrease. But every logical reasoning should be able to tell that his concerns should be plenty. Just the training death occurring lately should keep him busy for a while. Now our neighbor is having a little religion conflict going on, I believe he will have to consider a possible situation happening there and how it will affect us. I believe he do have a lot of concerns but just can't anyhow let people know thou. =D</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">* so u only check on one country AUS. How about others?</span></p>
              <p>HAHA! Sorry about that~ My bad my bad! But since Aust like closest to us. I thought i just google it and see it.</p>

              <p>hey nobrainer! Thanks for sharing! And thanks for the "first" post honour. LOL</p>
              <p>Hmmm i should have paid more attention while reading the article. Thanks for sharing.</p>
              <p>Since the operationalize of 3G SAF is pretty much done with the Advance Combat Man System and the purchasing of new shooter assets and the Battlefield Management System that help integrate all the 3 services into a effective fighting system , I guess the new COA will have to do what you said, make everything much more better.</p>
              <p>But i read a recent article of the incoming CDF, <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;  ">he emphasised that, at the core of Singapore's defence is not advanced hardware, but "the hearts and minds of our people".  and <span style="font-size: 13px;   color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold;">"The most important issue, however, boils down to the hearts and minds of our people. You can have a lot of solid equipment, but are you willing to fight for your country?" - MG Neo.</span></span></p>
              <p>I guess he will do something to change the mindset of young Singaporean the need to defend what we call home. "Expecting lots of flaming but all views are welcome! =D"</p>
              <p>Maybe I am too used to see Generals fighting along side man. </p>
              <p>Perhaps Junior Commender's should be warriors with some brain but Generals should be all brain since they are so old already. LOL</p>

              <p>Both MG Neo KH and BG Chan CS are scholars. Both are SAFOS, BG Chan is also a president's scholar, and he is VERY smart. Have seen him in action before. Only SAFOS are considered scholars in the SAF.</p>

              <p> In LG Kuek's own words:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Three years ago, I outlined our
              vision for One SAF. This was to be realised through three key
              thrusts under the acronym O-N-E. The first was to
              <strong>operationalise</strong> the first spiral of the 3rd
              Generation SAF, and by 2010, we will be stepping into the next
              spiral of development.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> 
              (see his recent interview in Pioneer)</span></p>
              <p>So MG Neo will have the next spiral of development to bring to
              the table.  As to what exactly that is seems to be anyone's
              guess so far.  My guess: greater integration of the new
              platforms across the three services.  He will also have the
              new MDES scheme to implement.</p>
              <p>Warriors-vs-scholars: It takes someone with sufficient
              brain juice to understand the complexity of today's geopolitical
              situation and to fully utilize the high-tech military assets
              we have.  I for one will be very worried if the senior
              leadership in the SAF consists of only belligerent, old-school
              minded gunghos.</p>

              <p>actually, when oversea general comes to Singapore, they are normally at the invitation of someone from SAF with the same appointment. For example, the Chief of Army from MAF comes to Singapore at the invitation of our COA, etc... However, beside meeting our COA, he may also pay a courtesy call to someone with a higher rank... like CDF or the Minister... but the main person who is going to entertain him is the COA.</p>

              <p>FYI, Ng Chee Khern was a MG when he was serving his duty as CAF, and it is highly possible that the reason why he wasnt posted to become the next CDF was because his family would be too powerful in that sense, because his younger brother Ng Chee Meng is the current CAF and his other brother is also a general in the Navy.</p>

              <p>Actually 90% of the badges is not given by SAF. They are given by military from other countries... This has becomes the unwritten rules for militaries all over the world.</p>
              <p>Regarding your comment about how US 4 star general thinks about SAF, you'll be surprised to hear that they actually think quite highly about SAF. (Actually, I'm quite surprised myself) When I was schooling in US, one of my dorm mates whose father is now a US 4 star general ever told me that he has done quite a few joint exercises with SAF before and he think we are quite solid even though we are never in combat before... so he has a lot of respect with them... He is a straight talking person, so I think he mean what he said... Anyway, I'm just a nobody, so he does not need to say something if he doesn't mean it...</p>

              <p>BG Ng Chee Kern, current CAF was widely gossiped to be the next CDF, but he lost to Mg Neo.</p>
              <p>In any case, there has been one CDF who didn't come from Army, LG Bey Soo Kiang. Besides him <strong>all the rest are from army</strong>.</p>
              <p>Navy has fared the worst, producing ZERO CDF haha.</p>

              <p>I often heard exercises integrating between Army and Air Forces, but I have never heard of anything between Army and Navy or Air Forces and Navy... I guess from this sense, it's difficult to groom a CDF from the Navy... as they often train and fight standalone (from Singapore's context).</p>

              <p>Joint exercise is not the barometer from which they determine who gets to be CDF and even if so, it is not even scarcely the most important.</p>

              <p>Yeah too bad. It is well-known among anyone who's been through NS even for a few months in a combat unit, not need to be regular. Btw the three combat formations are only Infantry, Guards and Commando.</p>
              <p>Other than the slightly higher standards in IPPT in guards, there is no difference at all in missions and ops between the two.</p>
              <p>In fact, i have an hilarious anecdote that paints this, but for the safety of our defence capabilies against the enemies, I better not say it.</p>

              <p>FYI, Ng Chee Khern was a MG when he was serving his duty as CAF,
                          and it is highly possible that the reason why he wasnt posted to
                          become the next CDF was because his family would be too powerful in
                          that sense, because his younger brother Ng Chee Meng is the current
                          CAF and his other brother is also a general in the Navy.</p>

              <p>Your speculation is wrong, according to people in the system. And anyway, based on what you said, I can more or less know that it's your own speculation not based on any inference from sound knowledge.</p>
              <p>Anyway, make no mistake. In Singapore, when someone is worthy of a place, there is no such reason as 'for fear of too powerful family' as to stop him from ascending. It would be a reason attributive to none other than himself and the level of trust he can inspire in the system. In this system, I've seen unworthy people benefit like a number of duds getting their star so the system can make a 'point', but so far, no worthy person has been denied of fruits.</p>
              <p>I have nothing against Ng Chee Khern really, though I have never heard him speak in person, only heard of him.</p>
              <p>Its his brother in the air force that almost everyone I know who knows him says is a total idiot. And no, intelligence is NOT equal among siblings.</p>
