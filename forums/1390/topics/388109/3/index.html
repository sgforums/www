              <p>actually, when oversea general comes to Singapore, they are
                  normally at the invitation of someone from SAF with the same
                  appointment. For example, the Chief of Army from MAF comes to
                  Singapore at the invitation of our COA, etc... However, beside
                  meeting our COA, he may also pay a courtesy call to someone with a
                  higher rank... like CDF or the Minister... but the main person who
                  is going to entertain him is the COA.</p>

              <p>He may pay a courtesy call, like you said. Notice who's the one doing the paying of respects to whom? Its all pegged to seniority of appointment. The lower ranked guy must be the one to do the paying of the respects. And yes, like you said above, and what I said previously to the retard, same rank meet with and entertain same rank. Their wives are involved too, sometimes, if the foreign dignataries bring wives.</p>

              <p>Your speculation is wrong, according to people in the system. And anyway, based on what you said, I can more or less know that it's your own speculation not based on any inference from sound knowledge.</p>
              <p>Anyway, make no mistake. In Singapore, when someone is worthy of a place, there is no such reason as 'for fear of too powerful family' as to stop him from ascending. It would be a reason attributive to none other than himself and the level of trust he can inspire in the system. In this system, I've seen unworthy people benefit like a number of duds getting their star so the system can make a 'point', but so far, no worthy person has been denied of fruits.</p>
              <p>I have nothing against Ng Chee Khern really, though I have never heard him speak in person, only heard of him.</p>
              <p>Its his brother in the air force that almost everyone I know who knows him says is a total idiot. And no, intelligence is NOT equal among siblings.</p>

              <p> Ng Chee Khern is quite friendly... I have a few chances speaking to him in a non-military function. On the other hand, I won't be surprised if his brother is a idiot... I've never spoken to him before, but looking at his photograph, I don't like him either....</p>

              <p>Care to share what you saw when you mention 'BG
              Chan is also a president's scholar, and he is VERY smart. Have seen
              him in action before.' Just very curious! LOL!</p>
              <p>And yes! Our CDF is not a puppet to whoever, foreign CDF or COA are met with our CDF. Just that to be polite, foreign CDF or COA also meet our defence minister.</p>

              <p>Now that he is COA, i guess you will hear more of him speaking, since COA tends to address the whole army. And there has never been a PS who became COA, that people said there was a curse. Now BG Chan has broken 'it', if the curse even existed..</p>

              <p>Hey TheMissus!</p>
              <p>I believe you don't have to be so hostile. I do know nothing so
                      therefore i am asking. And ya I am a pre-enlistee but that doesn't
                      make me less of a person.</p>
              <p>I do like to serve btw, very eager actually! Planning to sign on
                      so there is no doubt about my faith or loyalty and i personally
                      hate people who try to chao keng or whatsoever.</p>
              <p>My 2 cents worth are of my own idea, you don't have to go crazy
                      about it.</p>
              <p>I just want to know about what this new CDF will do and trying
                      to get ideas from others. No need to have you go crazy about it
                      man.</p>

              <p>Err i didn't go crazy about it. You never stated that you knew nothing, or revealed you were a pre-enlistee. If you had stated that at the start humbly and asked to know more, people would have gladly told you. But it was very obvious from your post that you didn't know much or anything, but also tried to sound like you did, and that can be irritating. Its not just pre-enlistees. A lot of people who've served still know nothing, like some others here. If one knows nothing, his two cents is worth nothing, not worth even one cent.</p>
              <p>I applaud your interest and dedication to serve. There is no greater calling than to defend your country. </p>

              <p>Btw, why got so many badges? SAF din even fight in war before.
                                                                                          They just want to make the uniform look nice only. But to me it
                                                                                          just a pile of useless badges. If u are US Marines 4 star general.
                                                                                          I think u dun even look upon our generals in Singapore. China same
                                                                                          too.</p>

              <p>The Taiwanese army also has not engaged in combat. Since its formation in 1948, the Korean army did not engage in any combat since the 1950 Korean war until today in 2009, in which it was completed whipped and raped by the communists, and only survived because of American support and reinforcements.</p>
              <p>Singapore has the SAF for the same reasons as Taiwan and Korea have created, invested and trained their armed forces. It has to, if only to safeguard its sovereignty which is the basest of needs, far before economic imperatives. Of course, you don't possess all this common knowledge known to people with brains, why do I bother to wonder if you did? You speak and sound like a complete bumpkin farmer. </p>
              <p>Did you know that Singapore, when it was under the banner of "Malaya", was engaged in armed conflict, not just against the invading Japanese, but later on against the Indonesians too? </p>
              <p>The badges are not meant to decorate the uniforms only, like you claim. You don't know how silly you look, I mean you haven't earned a single one when you were an enlisted personnel, you can't even match up to the regular joe on the street on any area, beyond the mental and physical fitness attached to the badges. You don't have a single thing to your name, that gives you any clout or place to hold a candle to anyone who has a badge. I doubt you have anything beyond super simple N or O levels, because you don't have requisite capabilities (IQ) to obtain even N or O levels, from the things you say. No wonder there are at least three people who called you dumb in this topic, including one thinly veiled sarcastic one from limywv on page 1.</p>
              <p>And you're right. The SAF is a far cry from the US armed forces. Although our top soldiers most certainly have valuable experience training with the US army, they regularly top the US military courses too, and are commended by top US generals when the meet in military congresses. I personally know a few of such SAF officers.</p>
              <p>YET SAF will never be comparable as a whole force with the US military, because of our size and budget limitations, our almost non-existent diplomatic and political standing, but most importantly because the bulk of people making up the SAF is crap. And guess what, if you sign on, you'd be one of them! </p>
              <p>Lots like you should be kowtowing in gratitude to people like COA for holding up the whole fabric together, the very thing that you and people of your ilk (stupidity level) bring down, and thanking them for seeing the higher purpose in doing so. Without them, not merely the SAF but the whole country would have long unravelled. How is this so? Easy. If your stupidity is reflective of the bulk of Singaporeans which I suspect it is, woe WOULD HAVE long betide us, IF NOT FOR THEM.</p>
              <p>Anyway, a person of your calibre compare with US for what? As if you will ever have a chance to be a part of the US in any way, form or shape...*rolls eyes.. People of top calibre I know in the SAF get offers from the United States left right and centre, be it top uni places after A levels, top scholarships, PhD offer from top unis after they graduate, top jobs in consulting and banking, top $$$$, recognition from US generals. </p>
              <p>You leh? Nothing. </p>

              <p>The SAF is in good hands.</p>
              <p>BG Chan has all the experience necessary to be COA.</p>
              <p>As for MG Ng, he's now in a really really important position in MINDEF that actually is more powerful than the CDF. And yes, he is by far one of the friendliest people I met in MINDEF.</p>
              <p>Our chiefs are very qualified people. You really have to see them in action, in meetings, doing things, then you will realise how capable these men are. Don't take my word for it, if you really want to know how things are, go talk to these men. They all have very sharp minds, and are people you would definitely want to have in good, important positions.</p>
              <p>I just left MINDEF recently, and I found it to be a good place, with strong and good leaders at the helm.</p>
              <p>In anycase, I just wanna ask, who is taking over BG Chan  as the new COS-JS?</p>
