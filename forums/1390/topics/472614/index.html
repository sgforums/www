              <p>Pre-enlistees will be required to complete pre-enlistment
              procedures and medical screening before they are scheduled for
              enlistment.</p>
              <p>They will be scheduled for enlistment into the respective
              enlistment intakes based on numerous considerations such as the
              medical &amp; physical fitness and educational qualifications of
              the individual, as well as the manpower and operational
              requirements of the various intakes.</p>
              <p>In general, pre-enlistees from the same 'A' level/International
              Baccalaureate (IB) or polytechnic cohort are enlisted over two
              intakes due to capacity constraints at the NS training schools. For
              example, 'A' level/ IB holders who graduate in Nov/Dec are
              typically enlisted in the Dec and Mar quarterly intakes.
              Polytechnic diploma holders who graduate in Mar/Apr are typically
              enlisted in the Jun and Sep quarterly intakes. ITE certificate
              holders and pre-enlistees with other qualifications are enlisted
              throughout the year.</p>
              <p>Pre-enlistees can only be assigned to an enlistment intake after
              being certified medically fit for enlistment at the pre-enlistment
              medical screening. Pre-enlistees will receive Enlistment Notices to
              notify them of their enlistment date about 2 months before their
              scheduled enlistment.</p>

              <p>They will be scheduled for enlistment into the respective
              enlistment intakes based on numerous considerations such as the
              medical &amp; physical fitness and educational qualifications of
              the individual, as well as the manpower and operational
              requirements of the various intakes.</p>
              <p>In general, pre-enlistees from the same 'A' level/International
              Baccalaureate (IB) or polytechnic cohort are enlisted over two
              intakes due to capacity constraints at the NS training schools. For
              example, 'A' level/ IB holders who graduate in Nov/Dec are
              typically enlisted in the Dec and Mar quarterly intakes.
              Polytechnic diploma holders who graduate in Mar/Apr are typically
              enlisted in the Jun and Sep quarterly intakes. ITE certificate
              holders and pre-enlistees with other qualifications are enlisted
              throughout the year.</p>
              <p>Pre-enlistees can only be assigned to an enlistment intake after
              being certified medically fit for enlistment at the pre-enlistment
              medical screening. Pre-enlistees will receive Enlistment Notices to
              notify them of their enlistment date about 2 months before their
              scheduled enlistment.</p>
