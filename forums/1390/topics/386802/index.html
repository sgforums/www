What kind of mindset did you adopt when you went into Basic Military Training (BMT)?</strong><br>I went into BMT telling myself: "Ask not what Singapore can do for you but what you can do for Singapore." I think it's important to contribute and play an active role. If you don't, then who will? There's a positive and negative to everything but I feel that a positive mindset towards NS is very important. Not only should one understand and follow instructions, one has to understand the objectives and that will serve a more memorable and meaningful experience. <br><br><strong>Wow! You certainly have the right mindset. During BMT, I understand that you were part of the company Journal Team and you made suggestions and changes which resulted in the team strength increasing from a modest five to several committees, totalling 80 members. Where did you and your members find time to do all these things?</strong><br>Time is a very important asset, in terms of planning. We did our planning of the journal during our own free time, even on weekends after booking out. It actually depends a lot on how you motivate the others to work along the lines to achieve your objectives. Different people have different strengths. Some of them were interested in design while some of them preferred to plan and coordinate. So it's a matter of identifying their strengths and assigning them different job scopes. <br><br>I<strong>nteresting outlook. How did it feel to be chosen to be the CO's personal assistant (PA) since it required a few rounds of selection and interviews? </strong><br>It was not something out of the blue. It was a goal that I aimed for and an appointment that I wanted. As a CO PA, I'm able to learn from my commanders and understand how the management works. My intention and objective is how I can, though all this learning, contribute to the squadron. <br><br><strong>You received the SAF/MINDEF Outstanding WITS project award at the 19th MINDEF PRIDE Day for the Integrated Personal Verification System (IPVS). Can you tell us how the idea of IPVS was conceived? What kind of research did you do before coming up with this idea?</strong><br>After my training as a Field Defence trooper, it was time to begin observing where I could contribute to improve the system in terms of security and access control. The research started off with me understanding the status quo and how the other departments work. <br><br>Actually, the inspiration for the IPVS came from the movie Star Wars. The IPVS comprises the Visitor Management System (VMS), which addresses the security access management of visitors while the Personal Verification System (PVS) takes care of the permanent pass management. <br><br>The challenge of the IPVS was how to link up all the departments. But luckily many of my commanders were supportive of our ideas and receptive towards embracing changes. <br><br><strong>What is your motivation in NS? What gives you the drive to push on and achieve what you have today?</strong><br>During NS, all servicemen are alike and they play a very significant role. It doesn't take much strength to do things but I feel it takes a lot of strength to make decisions, to decide what you want to do and what you want to achieve. If we set a goal, we just have to work doubly hard to achieve what we want. The strength to carry on doesn't come from the physical strength but from your indomitable will. I think taking NS as a form of personal development helps me too. Taking about motivation, anyone can quit when the going gets tough, be it in the SAF or in life. How to counter that is to have a positive mind and tough and strong will to achieve your goals. <br><br><strong>It seems that you enjoyed your NS stint. What was your most memorable moment during your two years of NS?</strong><br>My most memorable moment has be to receiving the Best Field Defence Specialist Award during RSAF Day Parade on 1 Sep, which was my 22nd birthday. Receiving the award from Chief of Air Force BG Ng Chee Khern made it a glorious and memorable award and moment for me! I was really touched when my name was called out. </span></span></p></div>

              management, prioritisation. I've also learnt that sticking to your
              beliefs and principles, and good communication is very important. <br><br><strong>Lastly, can you inspire your fellow NSFs with just one line?</strong><br>Live each day as if it were your last and you’ll develop a keen respect for time, opportunity and creativity</span></p>
