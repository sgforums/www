            <div class='col-md body'>Well I have to add to this discussion, well being given the rank of 3SG means that you have certain leadership qualities. Well most infantrymen get them through sticking their butts through BSLC and ASLC. Which I have to go through even though I was from AD. I have to say its a rank that you earn.<br><br>Back in the Air Force School some of the "trainers" did not even go through all these course and were promoted to the rank 3SG and subsequently to 2SG have the cheek to pump us and make us run like dogs.<br><br>And some of these "trainers" don't even need to pass IPPT... errr u can kiss my butt if you call that fair. What do these people that are bestowed the rank know about leadership? If I were to be lead by him to war the 1st 5.56mm round that is coming out of my M-16 would be for him. I would rather die in battle serving than die without any cause and lead by a person that have no skills, knowledge and leadership skills.<br><br>BTW if I've served 6 years in the Air Force as Air Defence Combatant and through rank and file and I must say this is a good idea. I've seen most of the stuff that could happen and happened.<br><br>In a situation of a war( which would never happen, Virtually), the combatant would be carry a gun with these tech guys would be behind the lines and doing servicing, no doubt the are one of the most important factor towards winning the war but if non of the combatant were to take up arms and hold the line, what's the point ?<br><br>The soldiers on the front lines are the one's that need a good leader that would be able to take them to battle and try to bring everyone in one piece... would a tech bec able to do that? Some even have running problem... hmmm....<br><br>There should only be a handful of such techs that should be bestowed with the rank and through training as any other combatant goes through so they would appreciate what the front liners are doing so in return they would know what they do would make a difference in the front line soldiers.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>let us be objective here once again...the existance of specs be it combat or techincal or service..is an integral part of any army be it the SAF or any other armed forces. While it is great to think we should give our combat specs the respect they are due..let us not forget that the army runs as far as its supply lines can stretch.. without your so called "theory" specs, the army will not be effective enough...as to thinking of your rear line specs..u seriously do not have any knowledge of rear line ops.. be it supply or maintenance.. we in the rear lines are also drilled in combat drills. While we do not go out and do combat patrols, or engage in taking the objective...we constantly train to respond to attacks, and engage the enemy, take them out if they are small pocket forces, or stay in fortified positions to engage and hold down the enemy while friendly forces can respond.. its not as easy as you think. you generally think tt rear echelon forces do not face attacks...well granted..we face less action compared to our armour or infantry counterparts..but the forces we face are generally enemy left over pocket forces or even commandoes..who raids our rear lines..try defending against a well armed bunch of enemy commandoes...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, i am from the logistic side. I have seen alot of 3sgt of pes C that do not deserve the rank, yes they abuse the rank and think they are big shot. But well, for every group, there are the good ones. I have some pes A or pes B logistic Spec who take pride in their job and carry it beyond their duty.<br><br>As for some logistic vocation, it is to my understanding that they do go thru some combat training such as convey movement and such. Well, i would not say it is same as ASLC or BSLC, but u cant just ignore that.<br><br>The main reason for 3sgt to logistic side is so that they can carry out their task w/o being questioned. i have seen some combat spec or even officer questioning logistic cpl and they cant do anything because they do not have the basic rank of 3sgt.<br><br>I argee that the logistic and engineering side shd look into the selection process of its tech and spec but we do not choose them, CPC does and they aso decide the ones that go to ocs or sispec.  In addition, no everyone want to become a logistic spec, they are certain few who is willing to go thru the toughest training to become a combat spec.<br><br>And lastly, for us logistic side, our pay of cos make up the biggest difference. the spec earn only what a combat cpl earn in ns. and the storeman earn juz a mere 350 per month. i hope this could make u understand us better. I am not saying u r all wrong, just that hope u can look at us in our own shoes.<br><br>p.s i was from combat side b4 i got injured and was OOC and posted to log side. i seen both side of the fence. Hope this haven add more disputes. Just want u all see more in the hidden stuffs of SAF.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;&gt;In the event of a war, I might, I just might, fire at 'theory sergeants' first then save some rounds for actual combat.&lt;&lt;<br><br>I find this line of argument quite juvenile, &amp; you're not the only guilty party. We're currently a peacetime army, hence the chickensh!t you described. But the good news is that the SAF has consciously sought to streamline the training schedules for reservists, so that frontline personnel don't interact with rear echelon staff as much as possible. My first few ICTs were usually 3 weeks' plus, about one third spent in base camp. By the end of the cycle, almost everybody didn't even bother to take over the bunks anymore. We'd report, move out immediately for exercise, come back for IPPT &amp; maintainence, &amp; then outprocess. No more chickensh!t.<br><br>Frankly, I don't understand the whining over promotions &amp; stuff, as if you guys are wannabee regulars. Ditto the present Specialist hierarchy among the other rank, on the basis that a fighting army should be kept as "young" as possible (26-27 tops in age, afterwards it's confirmed diminishing returns). In wartime, the old-school triumvirate of SGT, CPL &amp; LCP is enough to help a company-level troop.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And some 3SGs take pride in what they do.<br><br>I found the line about shooting inept commanders very childish and really stupid. If the commander was just not able to perform to the point that the entire platoon/section is in the shit, if you think you can do better then just relieve him of his command. (I'm saying this in the context of combat)<br><br>By saying those lines you have thrown whatever credibility right out of the window. Hence, I feel that perhaps the SAF has not seen you fit to be able to be promoted or given a chance to be a 3SG with this kind of mentality and you are feeling sore about it. Call me disrespectful, but you don't deserve it with that line.<br><br>What a shame.</div>

I have seen alot of 3sgt of pes C that do not deserve the rank, yes they abuse the rank and think they are big shot. But well, for every group, there are the good ones. I have some pes A or pes B logistic Spec who take pride in their job and carry it beyond their duty.<br><br>As for some logistic vocation, it is to my understanding that they do go thru some combat training such as convey movement and such. Well, i would not say it is same as ASLC or BSLC, but u cant just ignore that.<br><br>.</div></blockquote>hey yep bro..ur totally rite on that.. as a 3SG and pes B and a Sec Comd to boot..yeah i have seen my fair share of crappy pes C specs who cant even do a all round defence properly..not to mention doing a proper leap and bound or a proper flanking yet at the same time there are those who really deserve it...my coursemates during my MSCC, some of my men whose actions deserve the rank they wear..and even to some extent i tink i deserve my rank too..not based on juz training mind u...any one can go thru training and be "qualified". i am talking abt their attitude and apitude in their vocations. Some of my men think that cuz they are specs, they can boss their way ard some of the junior men yet they cant even differentiate a transmission from a powerpack!, and as commanders, we are the ones who should step in and keep them in line. mind u, as a 3SG talking to a fellow 3SG, its a whole new different ball game compared to talking to a Pte or Cpl, u cant pull rank..and even as they say in SAF its the appointment that counts, pulling rank is still damn common..that why as commanders we should deal with the problem.<br><br>While i can deal with my men who are crappy by making them do stuffs again and again..such as those combat drills and doing it with them to improve section standard, we cannot control how each and every single crap spec thinks and behave. its something i believe our fellow brothers in arms in the logistics/ CSS formation will have to deal with from time to time..<br><br>As for commanders, i won't say that our training is exactly the same as BSLC or ASLC, but i believe it is sufficient and fine tuned to the exact requirements of maintenance ops..which is a different ball game together compared to infantry/ combat ops. The stuff my men go thru are fine tuned for maintainance ops only..they would not be fully fit or prepared to lead an infantry section..but when it comes to personal and sectional survival in the battlefield, it should be sufficient in keeping themselves and my section alive..that i haf faith in..since i trained them, and we all were trained under the same model.</div>

They tend to compare technical/staff 3SGs against combatant 3SGs and this is an unfair comparison.<br><br>The rank is there to help you do a certain task in your field of specialistion, be it commanding a section of Guardsmen as a Guards SC, running a manpower branch as an Admin Supervisor or being just a simple tech spec in a depot maintenance section (where the Section IC can be a MSG/2WO).<br><br>Can we look beyond simplistic comparisons and try to move away from this notion that if you have not gone through SISPEC, your rank is worthless. If that is the case, why don't we simply close down ATI, OETI, IMOS, SOL, and all the other technical command schools? If there is no respect for your fellow Specialist just because he or she is of a different PES, then even as some combat Specialists distrust their technical or staff counterparts, the opposite will also happen as well.<br><br>I have had experiences of Guards Specialists throwing their weight around in my depot and ordering my guys to perform certain tasks like transportation of mortars et al, heavy items that under SOP, they as the sending unit, are required to do by themselves. This was in spite of the fact that me and fellow Specs are there and nearly causing an accident to happen to one of the junior techs.<br><br>If we did not have our rank, this chap could have caused a lot more trouble and he might not be easily rebuffed if the ranking tech on the spot was just a CPL facing down a 2SG.<br><br>Lastly, everyone I knew never cared about the SISPEC issue. Our rank is rightly earned in our field of specialty, and it would be utterly ridiculous to rate a tech spec on the basis of an infantry leader.Sure, we may be not as proficient as them in combat operations, but can they do a better job than us at MIS or managing armament systems maintanence planning?<br><br>Now this is not to say that we are a vindictive bunch, but there are reasons why non-combatants do require a certain junior commander's rank. In the end, the only factor that matters is mutual respect for the task that everyone does.But apparently some people have a huge chip on their shoulders.<br></div>
