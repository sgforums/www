              <p>I went to see a specialist regarding a reoccurence of my back pain last week and the doctor gave me a little memo for camp MO.</p>
              <p>I have just POP and is now going through my block leave and has no unit yet. Do I hand this letter to the MO on the first day when I go to my new unit or go back to Tekong medical centre? But this would also mean the letter will be so long already by the time I pass it to the MO.</p>
              <p>What I worry is that on the first day when I enter my new unit, there might be a lot of admin stuff to do and will be quite busy settling down and I may not have enough time to report sick in the morning to see the MO. Moreover, it doesn't give a good impression for reporting sick on the first day entering a new unit.</p>
              <p>How's the usual procedure like for something like my case? And what could be a better way for this?</p>

              <p>So when I book in to my new unit camp, after I get into my bunk put my things inside, I will go report sick? Or would there be a time for me to do so?</p>
              <p>In BMTC, there is a timing to report sick, that's during first parade. But during the first day, there wouldn't a first parade thing. Therefore I don't know at which timing would be the best time to do so. And I will be carrying so many things with me, fieldpack plus duffle bag, it will be so inconvenient. I suppose I will have to go up to my new bunk before I could report sick to see the MO. But by then, would it be still the right time to report sick?</p>
              <p>Sorry please pardon me if I sound stupid because I really don't know how it works and how the process would be like when entering a new unit and am worry that I may do something wrong as I don't wish to get screwed.</p>
