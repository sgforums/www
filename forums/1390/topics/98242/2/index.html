            <div class='col-md body'>"FFI" = "Fit for Instruction." It's a medical certification process, done by a unit MO, to determine if a soldier is fit to go for certain training (or attend a certain course, or be posted to a certain vocation). The MO conducts his checkup while referencing the relevant FFI criteria for the purported endeavor; the soldier will undergo this quite a few times until he finally stands down from reservist obligations.<br><br>It's technically separate from the PES medical classification done at CMPB, which is more of a general guidance/categorization. Wah lau eh, don't you read the papers? There was a mini-controversy over the ongoing Commando Trial this past week, when Hu Enhuai's PES B grade should've rule him out for CST training. The MO who cleared Hu's FFI testified that it wouldn't have mattered (his old injury had healed) or altered his assessment that the guy was fit.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Is Guards the only unit that drive the Light Strike Vihicle (LSV)? </blockquote>Officially, yes.<br><br><blockquote>Why Guards didn't learn parachuting also ar? </blockquote>Cuz they're RDF (Rapid Deployment Force). While not organized under any of the DIV structures, the GDS are still a conventional force - touted "elite infantry" - trained to hit the battle zone suddenly.<br><br><blockquote>What does commandos do during war? Is it planning, sabotaging, sit back and watch? </blockquote>CDOs are more raid specialists, operating in small units &amp; relying on stealthy infiltration to carry out missions.<br><br><blockquote>Is the fences surrounding the camp electrically supplied? So anyone trying to climb up would be electrocuted? Or it's just a sensor to inform them there's instruder? </blockquote>Not that I know of, but there's sentry &amp; prowling guards on 24/7 duty (with live bullets). Maybe the DB, though I noticed only 2-layer high fences when they 1st built the facility next to my camp in CCK. They had dogs free-roaming in between the fences, &amp; I reckon probably also MG- &amp; searchlights-equipped towers within.<br><br><blockquote>And in the camp like places such as the bunk room or corridors, is there any hidden or security camera? </blockquote>No. It's hard to find even a workable wall socket in some camp bunks!<br><br><blockquote>What is the booking in time and booking out time for Guards? Does it applies the same to all units? During weekends, the unit can don't book out and stay in, right? Just that they will be bored and lonely, right? Has anyone done that before?</blockquote>Regular nights-off times for combat units should be between 1800-ish (after conducting last parade, but sometimes you gotta wait for people to finish the indented dinner) &amp; 2359 (unless they want you to rest early for the next day's training). Yeah, weekends aren't stay-in unless they're "burned" for various reasons, in which case you can usually claim a off day-in-lieu. I ended up not minding the latter, as long as I could regularly book out to wind down during weeknights.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do I still need to apply for deferment now although I received the postpone letter? Or for the time being wait till the next Enlistment letter arrive that states the date I should go report?<br><br>Commandos like very good like that leh, like thay learn more things than Guards leh, they learn how to row the boat, parachuting, etc.... and also learn what Guards learn like rope repelling except the LSV if I am right I guess.<br><br>By the way, speaking of LSV ar.. they will teach you how to drive just like what any other normal people taking the driving license is it? Will they like give you theory and practical lesson on driving and present you a class license which you would be allow to drive a normal car on a road outside?<br><br>What if you already got yourself a driving license? Will it be an added advantage that you do not need to learn driving over there?<br><br>Do Commandos need to swim also? I know Guards need to swim.<br><br>Another question I curiously wanted to know is that for the first few days in army, what will those freshies be doing? As for those who is in PTP, what will they be trainning on? How's the procedure? At the end, will they need to take the Napfa test and will they tests on your Sit &amp; Reach?</div>
