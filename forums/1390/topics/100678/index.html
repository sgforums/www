            <div class='col-md body'>u are suppose to expend all ammo issued is because due to the weather all those..It may cause the ammo to decrease their conditions..And if alot of rounds are return..The ammo storeman will have to inspect all those boxes that have been opened..This is not a small sum..And ammo are constantly restocked..If old ammo don't go, how do new ammo come in..And the old ammo maybe reaching their shelflife soon anyway..So just expend it as many as possible...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Handled the ammo supply once.<br><br>Well, they got a certain percentage of ammo one must expend. So whether rounds are fired or not, still gotta expend it until that percentage is attained.<br><br>As to why must expend this percentage of rounds indented, no idea on the budget side. But I guess why would one not make careful planning regarding the number of rounds to be indented. No sense indenting one thousands and expend a 100 at the end. Very leceh for the ammo man to collect it all back and count. Show no proper planning too. But range officers just go ard this rule by expending spares.<br><br>As for RAIs, they are brought in to be weighed.</div>
