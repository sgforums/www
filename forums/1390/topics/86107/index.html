Apparantly we didn't and we were late by 5-6 hours so by that time most of them had flat batteries. I was the only one who used the high capacity battery which had a 20 hour life span and it lasted through the whole mission. But it was no use in the end after the rest had their comms down and I was left talking to myself  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Since it was our first time using the sets, none of us brough along any spare battery nor the AA battery compartment.<br><br>Another disadvantage I found with the headset is that it kinda blocks out most of the external noises(much like noise cancellation earphones), so when wearing it I kinda become half deaf on the side of my ear which I had it fixed. It becomes really annoying when u have to keep asking others to repeat louder what they are saying cos you cant really hear when you are trying to observe noise discipline as well.</div>
