            <div class='col-md body'>I had a hairline fracture on my ankle that had me me crutches for weeks.. This from coming down a steep slope too quickly.<br><br>What is there to blame the army for.  These things happen.  There were also good experiences in the army what.  You make friends in there that you would not be able to make in any other setting.<br><br>A friend of mine got struck by lightning when the struck my jeep's signal set antenne.  He got blown 8 metres by the explosion, suffered burns and serious shock.  He recovered.  After time in hospital, he came back to unit and was as cheerful as ever.  Even into reservist.  Never blamed the army for it.<br><br>So for all those of you who suffered minor scraps and bruises and bitch about the army, perhaps you should take a lesson from my friend.<br><br>Whenever he was asked about his experience, he said: "for all the cuts and minor injuries I got during training, it was probably my fault for not being careful.  For the 'who the heck would have expected a lightning strike on a clear blue sky day' that was an act of God."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Die in a war i can consider... but die in training is what the fug!?.. Yeah true.. not being carefull... but the soldiers are being pressured.. and assume they can and they prove it or scared to fall-out.... so as a result they push beyond their limits... So.. injuries hit them!.. coz they're not experience and being told of this every NSF mentallity.. "fug la.. its juz a ns... cibye la.. lazy la.. pay also not much.. but the training like fug!" then they still train... still run around like monkeys.. draggin their arse ard.. that's where the "alertness" of self is gone.. Unlike the crazy "super-on" soldiers or they are blessed to become a passion soldiers... then its a different thing..<br><br>So... like we all. yea.. we take care of ourself.. den.. that is where the "keng" starts... to avoid injuries or etc2.. coz we know.. that is potential of danger in any mean....<br><br>Injuries is part of a chapter in life there is no escape!.. but....... Please DO NOT DIE IN THE ARMY!! unless u're fighting hard to defend ur country... thats worth die-ing!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mine is not really a serious physical injury... It's more of a "mental injury"... Feeling rather traumatized after the incident... LOL<br><br>I had a high fever in camp one day, and I was sent to the medical centre. (I won't say which one, to protect the identity of those involved.) The MO examined me and then asked a medic to put me on IV drip (intravenous drip). The medic, being new, couldn't find my vein, and he inserted the needle into my left and right arm alternatively for 5 times, before he finally found my vein.<br><br>I was rather traumatized because the needle was so thick, and there was no painkiller when he poked the needle into my arm. But curiously, after being poked 5 times, I felt so scared that I sweated a lot, and the sweating brought down my fever pretty quickly... Haha.<br><br>After this incident, I dare not report sick anymore. I have phobia of medics.</div>

Admittedly I came away from M203 firing with a bruise that lasted 5 days.. but the first few times the recoil kicked but didn't hurt.<br><br>It was only after the bruise started to develop then it started to actually hurt.  Too bad they don't use the pure HE round anymore instead opting for the HEDP round.  Now the HE round was spectacular on impact, especially at night.</div>

Because if you are unwell and did not report it, you can be charged if you fail in carrying out your duty subsequently due to illness.
