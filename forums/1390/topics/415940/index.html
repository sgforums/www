              <p>My solution is very simple. To all the would-be-soldiers, protect your rifle like your own wife. If u see anyone trying to take it away from u without permission, whack him. Even if u see the rifle already in their hands, go ahead and snatch it back by force if needed. Becos on the day u receive your rifle, u also vowed to protect the rifle. Dont care whether they are your superiors or not. Becos if u do not retaliate, u will be the one who suffer by doing extra duties and getting confinements.</p>
              <p>If they ask u "Hey recruit, why u hit me?" </p>
              <p>U answer back "Who the fuck are u to take my rifle."</p>

              <p>Yes, rifle are your wife, you must at all time stick to your 'wife', if someone want to steal from you, whack him even it comes to blow and landed him to hospital in serious condition.</p>
              <p>If I have chance to go back basic bmt, I will surely whack that guy, be it sergant or cpl or officers, I will whack him till he half dead. I am not wrong wah! Just protecting my 'wife'.</p>
              <p>BUT remember dont cock and fire at him. You will be charge.</p>
              <p>Shit! Why ns still 2 yrs? Cant they reduce to 1 yr?</p>

              <p>He will likely sign extra for the next few weekends.</p>
              <p>In simple terms, he will be confined and will have to do guard duties when he is confined.</p>
              <p>This kind of things is not really that severe as long as your friend learns from it. However, if he is really bor chup, and allows his rifle to get stolen from him all the time, he may be recommended by the CO to serve time in DB. (Not that it is likely to happen, since the CO must have been that kind who is going all out to tekan if that is to happen).</p>
              <p>Most of the time he will just sign more and more extras if his rifle get stolen again. NOTE that it is possible for him to come back to do guard duties after he pass out and before he enter his new unit. After he enter his new unit, it is POSSIBLE for the guard duties to be "transferred" to the new unit for him to finish.</p>
              <p>And yes, like the other say, if a commander get your rifle and you fight for it back, you will sure kana tekan such as pumping or whatsoever. However, they will likely not make you sign extra or confine you, since you have fulfill your "duty".</p>
