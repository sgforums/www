A Saw is not really mean to be properly stabilise and lay down auto fire, that a machine gun job , if you need, bring a GPMG .  The ultimax does what is really require of the Saw better then M249, it allow the handler to do fire and movement with it easiler. Which it is best used for short 3-5 round burst, also with ultimax the advantage is user can easily fire on the move and still can hit the target thanks to the low recoil, light weight and easy handling.</div>
