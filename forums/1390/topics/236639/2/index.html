So he go and convert so that he can have less salary by retiring soon and stress himself to go find a job somewhere 5-10yrs down the road?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's all about appointments...whether WOs get promoted to officer rank is not their immediate division's HQ but MINDEF...Also, there also must be a quota and ethic issues.. If for eg, the division/school/Insitute SM is a MWO, a SWO appointment would be replaced to a LTA appointment..</div>
