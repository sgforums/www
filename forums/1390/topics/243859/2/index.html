A properly sharpened bayonet could do the job, but the material and design on the Fairbairn-Sykes is close to ideal for the job.  Being primarily designed as a stabbing weapon, the narrowness of the blade allows it to slide more easily between ribs.

I have been out of there for some time.<br>Locking device not allowed because a proper locking knife can be almost the same size as a non-folding knife, and can fight with almost same efficiency, but it also CAN BE CONCEALED because it can.. fold into half, while normal knife cannot.<br><br>Those swiss army knives, can fold into half, so is concealed, but you think you can kill anyone with that? lol.. the blade will fold inwards into your fingers the moment you stab.. you end up cutting your fingers off instead. *ouch*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

The thing is the blade is not strong enough and will snap after the first hit.<br><br>Because folding knives without a locking mechanism was never meant as a fighting knife but a utility knife i.e. swiss army knife.</div>
