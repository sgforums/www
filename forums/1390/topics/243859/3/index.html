And I have alot of experience with knives, I think I daresay even more than Gedanken. I train with knives almost daily.<br><br>I would prefer to come up close and use the knife on the person rathr than throw it at him anyday too. A knife is a close in weapon, a last resort if you lose all weapons capable of extended reach (spear, bow, arrow, bullet).. If you throw the stupid knife, you have nothing left but your bare hands.. and assuming you hit.<br><br><strong>Note: Most knife throwing is done sideways-the blade flys sideways, not forwards. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You grip the knife by the blade and throw it.</span> Not by the handle. Throwing the knife by the handle is much more difficult.[b]</strong></div>
