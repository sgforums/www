The british Army used to have a commando unit but after the war, the role was given to the royal marines - I think its because the army commandos operated a lot from the royal navy's ships anyway.<br><br>For an archtypal commando-type raid during the war, look up Operation Chariot on google where british commandos raided a german submarine base. Basically I think what is extraordinary about the commando role is that they were given missions that meant almost certain death or capture.  IIRC, they piloted a little ship dressed up to look roughly like a german ship into the base under the noses of german watchtowers and machine gun posts and proceeded to blow up the base.<br><br>All of them were captured or killed.<br><br>Jeremy Clarkson of Top Gear did a documentary on it. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsYXEQ6F8J4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsYXEQ6F8J4</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Our Guards are very similar to the British Paras </blockquote>British Paras are proper airborne, lah. IMO Our GDS ops model takes after the US Air Cavalry division of the Vietnam War. Their modern version is the 101st "Screaming Eagles", but I'm not sure how much of their troop strength is airmobile &amp; how much airborne.<br><br><blockquote>I really don't see the difference of training between SIR and Guards... </blockquote>I sorta concur, having been attached to their exercises &amp; as well as with the CDO once.<br><br>But GDS does have a legit predigree, both locally &amp; in the larger air-assault ops. Their forefathers were the glider infantry in WW2, which the Band Of Brothers DVD didn't dramatize but which the Stephen Ambrose book did. (Imagine sitting in those flying coffins, with no airborne training &amp; no escape routes if the plywood plane catches fire or breaks into two.) Helicopters then took over the ferrying some in the Korean War, but airmobile tactics would take off only in Vietnam.<br><br>Locally, the GDS &amp; CDO units were once together in a biggie outfit called 7SIB, then under 3DIV. That was where I was coming from in my last post. This is really testing what I studied in NUS but, I believe, the SAF has gone through 3-4 ORBAT phases in its history. Apologies for any sweeping statements &amp; errors:-<br><br>(1) 1970s, when 'Area 3 Command' (later 3DIV) &amp; 4SAB were the pioneering frontline legions of the fledging SAF, &amp; followed later in the decade by their reservist counterparts (6DIV, 9DIV, &amp; the armoured versions). All other combat units were non-division. The 'superstar' was 7SIB, comprising 2 CDO units, 2 GDS units (initially as SAFGU &amp; 8SIR) as well as ITD (precedessor of BMTC). But otherwise there was a general rivalry between the more conventional troops in "mechanized infantry" (SAR) &amp; those in "line infantry" (SIR).<br><br>(2) post-1983, with the newly-introduced 13-yr reservist cycle (disastrous news for impending enlistees like me then ~lol~) &amp; a wholescale revamping (even disbanding of) active outfits as a result. Each DIV gained a bunch of combat-support units, but would only command the majority of them on paper. The CDOs &amp; ITD were already transferred out, but 7SIB retained its elite-infantry status after 7SIR (3GDS) converted to join them to form an all-GDS BDE. Most old-bird peng, as I recall, would immediately gave respect whenever 7SIB was mentioned back then, rather than to the more-hyped Best Unit competition.<br><br>(3) early-90s, under the Army 2000 plan. More troop redistribution, but each DIV finally assumed proper command &amp; become true combat-arms entities. Best personalified by reservists &amp; "ROD" becoming "NSmen" &amp; "ORD" respectively to reflect new ops status. 8SAB joined 3DIV &amp;, to me, that deflated a lot of the old rivalry between the active-time SAR &amp; SIR units. Still, 4SAB, like CDO, was non-divisional &amp; could thus still claim "independence". 7SIB was transferred out to spearhead the new 25DIV (RDF), &amp; got their own khaki berets.<br><br>(4) I can recall the SAF announcing a Army 21 plan near the end of the millennium, but it appeared the post-9/11 events have prompted a rethink. The new one is the 3G SAF, introduced last year but no significant ORBAT changes so far.</div>
