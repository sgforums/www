The last time i happened to talk to a police recruitmt offr, she told me (for police) i can apply as early as 6mths b4 graduation..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe i can relate wat i gathered from my IO frens. Firstly, u have to have a certain vocation before u can be a full-fledged IO. (ie. for those IOs in the navy, they have to get their Certificates of Competence (COC) and Bridge-watchkeeping Cert (BWC) b4 they are actually posted back to the intelligence service. This will normally take ard 2 yrs.)<br><br>Secondly, wat Joshua1975 said was spot-on. Pls dun expect to do much hardcore intel work since ur initial contract is only 5 yrs. So lets say u spend 2 yrs in an operational unit, u'll only get 3 yrs doing very limited intel work.(This was wat an IO told my fren b4 he signed on 2 yrs ago)<br><br>Wat i must add is that be prepared to write lots and lots of intel papers for ur superiors.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
