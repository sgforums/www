              <p><span><span style="color: #0000ff;">SINGAPORE: Changes will be made to the Basic Military Training programme for National Service recruits from 2010 onwards.<br><br>There will be a new 19-week BMT for obese recruits, and either a 9-week or 4-week customised BMT for other classes of recruits to better prepare them for their subsequent combat, combat support and combat service support roles.<br><br>Releasing details on Friday from the its two-stage review, the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) said recruits whose Body Mass Index (BMI) exceeds 27 will have to undergo the new 19-week BMT programme that is designed to help them improve their physical fitness incrementally while equipping them with basic soldiering skills and knowledge.<br><br>This is with effect from February 2010.<br><br>It said the programme was introduced after a review to strengthen the BMT system as it was seen that over time, obese recruits have shown that they can achieve optimal fitness levels and weight loss in about 19 weeks.<br><br>Recruits who are medically fit for deployment in selected combat and combat support vocations, such as signal operators, combat medics and naval system operators, will be given a new medical classification of PES B2, in place of the existing PES C1 classification.<br><br>The SAF said this is to ensure that the medical classification of the soldiers is consistent with their deployment and the recruits will undergo a new 9-week programme from June 2010, that will include customised physical training, as well as basic combat training to prepare them for their combat and combat support roles.<br><br>As for those who are placed as PES C recruits, they too will undergo a new 9-week BMT programme from June 2010, with light physical and vocational training. This is to prepare them for combat service support vocations, such as service medic, and those related to logistics and administration such as supply assistants.<br><br>There's also a new 4-week BMT programme that will be conducted for PES E recruits, focusing on National Education, SAF core values, regimentation and discipline, as well as vocational training to prepare recruits for combat service support vocations.<br><br>Colonel Ng Wai Kit, assistant chief of general staff (training), SAF, said: "The latest changes to the BMT system begin with the introduction of the physical training phase to prepare our recruits who are less fit, and raise their fitness level to that which is comparable with their direct BMT peers."<br><br>There will be no change to the standard BMT for PES A/B recruits.<br><br>In the first phase of the review, the SAF looked at how recruits undergoing the 4-week Physical Training Phase (PTP) could be better prepared for BMT.<br><br>This resulted in the introduction of an 8-week PTP, which will raise PTP recruits' physical fitness to a level that is comparable to their direct-BMT peers.<br><br>The new PTP programme will begin in December 2009.</span><br></span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Mono intake is usually for those below local Diploma upon enlistment. So will your son have completed his degree/diploma when CMPB calls him up? That will determine if he will go to mono or tekong. Mono intake simply means your son is enlisted straight into a unit. but that being said mono is not all that lousy with "uneducated" recruits. It is a matter of working with different people from all walks of life. After BMT, soldiers from tekong will be posted to units and that is when the real training start.</p></div>

              <p>Mono intake means from the day of your enlistment, you are posted to a camp and you are going to do your 2 years of NS at that camp.</p>
              <p>If you go to tekong, you can get a chance to go command schools to be 3sgt or Officer.</p>
              <p>I donno about austrialia college is it equivalent to a local diploma.</p>
              <p>Don't worry so much, just send to your son to study, come back serve that 2 years of NS and fuck off.</p>

              <p>well i am in no position to decide what is year 12 in australia, because the government here look at papers, so if there is no paper, not point saying equivalents, because private diplomas are actually equivalent to a local diploma or at least better than A Levels. However, the government do not recognise them.</p>
              <p>Another reason is that I used to have a buddy, who left for the states after Os. he distrupted his studies and came back and he is in the mono intake.</p>
              <p>like gunner said, he will not get the chance to go to command school. but of course there are A Level an Diploma holders (from Tekong) doing a normal men jobs. They are not less worst off, they are the ones who do the work, which w/o them nothing much can be done.</p>
