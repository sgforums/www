              <p>x2. I like this idea.</p>
              <p>Talk to the supervisor in charge of duty rosters. Make him do one weekend duty. If he can't do, then make him do the next weekend. And again and again and again.</p>
              <p>Certainly he can't get away with it.... sooner or later he has to do duty.</p>
