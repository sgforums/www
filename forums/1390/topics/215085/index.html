            <div class='col-md body'>i believe NS is a good experience for all boys. some might say it's a waste of time whereby one can be using this period of time to furthur their studies or start working. but surely we don't have to rush to do these thing right? we can still do them after NS.<br><br>in fact NS can be a good time to get to know more friends, learn new skills like teamwork, organising and people management.<br><br>sure some of u might complain of unfair treatments, incompetent superiors, lack of freedom etc, but aren't all this also a good experience? not everything we encounter in life is a smooth walk in the park. whatever we do and experienced is a lesson in life to better prepare us for greater challenges in future.<br><br>advance and overcome.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Most male when they are in their teenager age think that they could do whatever they want and get over with it. But in the Army, it a total difference thing. Could see most of my friends, change quite alot since being enlisted into the army. More reponsible and rational in their thinking. It good for their own characters.</div>
