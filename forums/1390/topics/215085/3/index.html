            <div class='col-md body'>Well after serving 2 yrs of NS, no doubt about it there are negative points as well as positive...i will list down what i experience in this 2 yrs and my thoughts....<br><br>1)NDP---well i ganna for 2 yrs. First yr 2005 setup the stadium. Damn lots of saikang, damn shag..but i learnt that organising a NDP is not an easy job.<br>Second yr 2006, ganna performer as the marching contingent for the number '2', every week sian have to go training, weekend burnt. But at least i get experience as a performer. I made millions of millions of people happy watching at home or live at the stadium. Whether they appreciate it or not none of my business. I done my part as a soldier and as a singaporean.<br><br>2)Platoonmates---well i can say my platoon in my unit is a mixture of good and bad. I have been saboed b4 and backstabbed b4. It sucks big time but at least i see thru them. Means next time i see you i noe who you are and less contact with u. But of coz there are aso some of them tat i take as friends, when there are bad moments, they are with me. Then i got even offered to do a guard duty for $200. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Altough at first i reject, but think again we are frens. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>3)superoirs---Ok not much to say about it but same logic, suck up to the boss. Do lots of things for show only,do liao then say cannot do again, or do liao say ok no need tat thing liao..-_-. No difference when u work outside.<br><br>Conclusion, you will appreciate civilian life more after u do NS. I now enjoying civilian life playing dota  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ....now looking for jobs, quite a headache aso. If i got anything real bad to tok about NS, i can say is quite hard to recap what i learnt during poly. In the other words means have to work extra hard...</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>One thing good about NS is that you'll meet many different types of people and learn how to handle "workplace politics"... (e.g. boss-employee relationships, tricks to score points, backstabbing colleagues and competitors, forming alliance and teams, etc etc) After going through NS, you will be more cautious of people around you and you'll be able to protect yourself better when you go to work. (Of course, you won't say all this if all your superiors and colleagues during NSF are very nice to you. For me, I have "kena" lousy officers, cunning platoon-mates, people who steal things from bunks, people who backstab one another in order to score point, etc.) In NS, if you stay high-profile, you will get a lot of arrows. If you accomplish too much, people will be envious and they will find ways to backstab you. But if you stay low-profile, people will think you are slacking and they will also arrow you for sai-kang. So it's important to find a balance in order to have a comfortable life during NSF.<br><br>On the other hand, one thing bad about NS (for me) is the long duration. I served a full 2 and a half years, and I spent most of my time doing nothing productive. (Nothing productive for me, but a lot of things for SAF... haha) Now, NSF is reduced to 2 years, but it's still too long for me. Also, another bad about NS is that after NSF, we still have to go through reservice... so the "nightmare" drags on after the completion of NSF...</div>
