              <p>Hi, I'm enlisting in december and I have a few questions:</p>
              <p>1) Are there washing machines in camp, or do I have to wash my clothes with a brush and bucket. I don't have anywhere to go duing weekends to wash my clothes.</p>
              <p>2) I know contact lenses are not allowed during training, but can I bring a pack of monthlies to wear in camp in between training periods? I have no problem wearing them for long periods.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>EDIT: Anyone know where I can get a phone with no camera? Or can I just get a normal phone and destroy the camera.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>EDIT: Yes, I have black rimmed glasses. I'm asking if I can still use contact lenses.</p>

              <p>1) Don't bother washing during BMT, just buy extra to cover for the whole week use, weekend bring back to wash. First, either u damn shack to even go downstairs. Second, u no time to watch ur clothes, so someone else comes along to the washing machine, dump ur clean clothes to the floor and wash his, u also LPPL.</p>
              <p>2) There are no guarantee lull periods, ur sergeant can just scream for you to fall in anytime anywhere even when he tells u that you can take a break just a min ago. It can even happen when he calls you guys to fall in 15min after lights off just because some bugger sneak out to call his gf. So I just dunno how you are going to handle, besides if your coy rules states no contacts and ur sergeant finds ur contacts during stand by bed, u can also kena jialat jialat.</p>

              <p>They actually have a rule to ban contact lense during training?</p>
              <p>I think if u know you're going to be away from your bunks and amenities for a few days, then perhaps it's better to go with specs. If u can, maybe bring both. I wore contacts last time at times, but mostly wore specs as it was easy to take on/off, not worry about a few days without washing etc.</p>
              <p>Afterwards wear for a few days without washing and sleep in them somemore - cannot take out then u know. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>Top tips: Wash your clothes, at least in the first 2 weeks. (You get only 5 sets, and you dont want to bring home 2 weeks of really dirty clothes for your family etc to wash)</p>
              <p>Lenses , washing machine? Depends on your coy, so the answer is usually no, dont risk it.</p>
              <p>Glasses black is fine.</p>
              <p>Get extra powder (for your body and stinky clothes), get energy pills/drinks etc (You need them), and get febreeze (Since you're not going to wash anything)</p>

              <p>Wait, Alize, does that mean that I can leave camp in the morning on weekends and return at night on the same day? Obviously it wouldn't work on Pulau Tekong, right?</p>

              <p>If they allowed you to stay in camp. I don't see why not? In fact I even go back to camp before during wee hours to drop someone off. Because we don't know where he stayed. But I think u need to seek Mindef approval or at least ask them and see what they say?</p>
