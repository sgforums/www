              <p>Was reading BMT FAQ but thought i could add in some useful information, in no order of importance or whatsoever.</p>
              <p>Recruits
               doesn't mean you're really treated like dogs. That depends on your coy.
               Recruits from welfare coys can talk to their commanders like friends 
              and even kick soccer with them or whatever crap. This kind of situation 
              will seem quite alien to recruits from up there coy. So far the latest 
              siong coy should be, School 1 - Apache, Falcon. School 2 - Kestrel, 
              Ninja. School 3 - Taurus. School 4 - 5th coy. 6th coy is the pai kia 
              coy. Welfare coys - Jaguar, Ulysses, Whiskey, 1st, 4th, 7th. (May not 
              have listed all) A normal day starts at 0545 (But you'll probably need 
              to wake up at 0445 - 0500) and ends at 2230. No handphone chargers in 
              BMT! Most coys should be able to bring dry food in, ie no drinks, no 
              instant noodles. Spectacle hooks aren't a must. Buy lots of black tape 
              and febreeze.</p>
              <p>In BMT the difficult part is adjusting to the 
              fatigue and regimentation. As you slowly transfom into a soldier, there 
              is no rest when you are tired and you continue with the day's activities
               all the way till RO. Different coys focus on different stuffs eg 
              fitness, force prep, discipline, drills etc.</p>
              <p>Honestly, try not to 
              report sick. Reason being, if you miss out on important stuffs, you'll 
              have to do it while others are continuing on with the main activity. 
              Worse still, there may be situations where you book out on Saturdays 
              11am. However, this may depend on individual coys.</p>
              <p>Pray that 
              it doesn't rain during field camp, that's all. Other than that, the main
               problems a recruit would face is probably the hygiene, high kneel and 
              HEAT RASH! Of course, trench.</p>
              <p>Most important BMT components: IPPT,
               range (BTP), field camp. Start exercising if you're not, or else if 
              your IPPT cmi, be prepared to book out only on Saturdays 11am after 
              remedial training!</p>
              <p>Other programmes: Ability group run, Basic
               close combat, Speed, Swim, Grenade, Battle inoculation course, Lots of 
              talks, AREA CLEANING, WEAPON CLEANING, Drills, SOC (Fun!), route marches
               (4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24). Ok lazy to continue listing.</p>
              <p>This is 
              important: On enlistment day you will be issued with a freak load of 
              items. Try not to lose anything although it is difficult to do so. 
              Reason being, you'll probably have to burn your weekend time to go 
              purchase whatever you've lost. Personally i find civilisation time too 
              important for this crap. Pay very close attention to instructions on the
               first few days as this would be the time where you are taught how to 
              fix your field pack, LBV and 10 pack items. It's very complicating for a
               recruit, trust me!</p>
              <p>Punishments in BMT (Other than physical) would
               be confinement, guard duty and stoppage of leave. Don't report for book
               in late or make silly mistakes, it'll probably save you from the first 
              two. SOL is slightly more serious, for people who misfire/bring camera 
              phones, fight, smoke wo permission etc.</p>
              <p>There will be express 
              interest survey for command school. (SCS/OCS) Answer no and you will 
              straightaway be denied entry. Just pray you don't get posted to GDS/INF!</p>
              <p>All
               the best for your BMT! For future recruits, just try to pass your NAPFA
               with a silver. Don't bother wasting your time for PTP (17 weeks) or 
              Obese (19 weeks) and just sail through the 9 week BMT.</p>

              <p><strong>Honestly if you can't pass, you won't pass any time soon. so don't be garang and volunteer yourself for pre-enlistment remedial training?</strong></p>
