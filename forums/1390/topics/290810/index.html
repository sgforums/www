Because in the 60s to early 80s if you are a regular NCO with 3 or 4 'O' Levels you can go to OCS.Sorry but at that time I didnt meet any regular senior NCOs or Enchik who finiished their secondary education with 'O'level passes and my OC barely passed his A-level.Hokkien is handy at times when you meet hokkien peng and I agree that cursing in hokkien  has more effect than any other languages that I know in Singapore but to try to give individual intruction to an English speaking soldier is absurd.I have never ever heard of a Cantonese speaking company but have encounted a 'Malay Platoon'(that is most of the troopers are ethinc malays).As for the tamils .........you put two Indian together anywhere and after 10 minutes you get a platoon&gt; <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div></blockquote></div>
