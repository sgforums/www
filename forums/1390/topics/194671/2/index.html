Kena a 1 week att B, then CSM, nice fellow... asked/volunteered me to be a mess boy down at school 2 mess.<br><br>Not bad, quite a chill out thing.. even the house fly in the mess also chill out. U can touch them and they won't fly.  No, I did not spike anyone's food.<br><br>Quite alrite lar, its was like working at the cafe all over again.  Talk to the WOs, CSMs, SPecs alike. Chit chat with them... listen to their sad stories.  Made a lot of new friends that way.<br><br>Somehow, as a messboy, its the only time that as a recruit, they actually talk nicely as instructors. THat is, if u are courteous and nice to them also lar.  Customer Service techniques apply.<br><br>Meanwhile, during the day, just have fun playing pool, watching DVDs, and help with a bit of the cleaning up here n there.  THe aunties were damn nice also... they keep feeding me with lots of free food! Hahahaha, shiokest time as a recruit!</div>
