            <div class='col-md body'>My experience is that the polyclinic docs don't check the electronic medical records. But the hospital side definitely do, namely the A&amp;R &amp; the specs.<br><br>Technically, still can "bluff" lah, if you go to different polys. They still rely mostly on written dockets there, though I know the hospital side will send post-visit feedback back to the poly for record purposes. That said, the GPs increasingly like to be just GPs, &amp; write referral letters to direct patients onto specialist clinics instead. (In your case, a skin spec.) No more straightforward calamine lotion anymore, for example, not until after undergoing blood tests for a wide range of possible illnesses.<br><br>You'll get new medical appointments for sure, but likely only a time sheet from the GP. And, if you ever meet the spec, they'll see your background &amp; can then ask you why you're seeing so many GPs, or why didn't turn up for the spec appointment -- possibly passing a stapled note along to your MO, if they're suspicious.<br><br>My tip is to continue seeing the spec, since your rashes are for real. (But shouldn't they have pinpointed your allergy yet?) Very costly if it's continued treatment, though. Just to see the spec each time, it's $20 if you're subsidised &amp; at least $50 if you're not (before other charges).</div>
