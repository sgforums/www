            <div class='col-md body'>Today I went to hospital to see doctor for rashes(real case. not chao keng).<br><br>After seeing him, I ask him for mc today. He say "can. but for this type of case you should see your camp MO. He will be able to handle it. You have come to this hospital or 8 times this year already".<br><br>I admit that out of this 8 cases, only 3 are genuine while 5 are chao keng. Even though these 5 cases are chao keng, the doctors believed me and gave me quite long mc for these 5 cases.<br><br>So I was wondering what is wrong with reporting sick at that hospital for 8 times this year. It isn't really that much as it is only about once a month.<br><br>Of course, these 8 times in hospital does not include the many times of mc which I go to polyclinic to chao keng  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But the hospital system cannot check how times I go to the polyclinic to see doctor right? Its a government hospital but I shall not say out the name of the hospital.<br><br>So next time I just go to the polyclinics to take mc, will the polyclinic doctors be able to know from the system that I went to this hospital 8 times to report sick?<br><br>How about if I go to other government hospitals to report sick? Can they check that I went to this hospital 8 times to report sick in this year already?<br></div>
