            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting to note that we might have 20 Longbow Apaches and our Primus has been confirmed to be derived from the M-109 Paladin chassis.Our future light tank is likely to be similar to the US Army's FCS concept.<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Army upgrades<br><br>Equipment deliveries to the army over the last two years highlight the upgrade of existing capabilities. These include the SAR-21 assault rifle, developed to replace the US-made M16A1; the Bionix Infantry Fighting Vehicle to initially supplement and ultimately replace the US-made M113 armoured personnel carrier; and the articulated, armoured All-Terrain Tracked Carrier (ATTC), complementing and then replacing the unarmoured HÃ¤gglunds Vehicle Bv 206 all-terrain vehicle. Singapore Technologies (ST) Kinetics developed all three, and is currently completing the prototype of a new 8 x 8 armoured infantry fighting vehicle.<br><br>The Bionix and ATTC are initially being deployed with the 4th Singapore Armoured Brigade, with deliveries of the former nearing completion as reserve units await their turn. At least two armoured battle groups, the 40th and the 42nd, have been created within this formation.<br><br>This same development process finds the army currently looking to buy six deployable hospitals, providing a hard-shelter system to replace the tents used currently. Similarly, the commando battalion is re-equipping with high-speed boats capable of reaching 70kt.<br><br>Developments in artillery involve a different approach altogether and will require the introduction of new doctrine as self-propelled howitzers (SPHs) supplement towed systems. ST Kinetics has also acknowledged it is developing a 155mm/ 39-cal lightweight SPH 4 x 4, although this air-transportable system is ostensibly for export.<br><br>More clearly fulfilling a local requirement, Singapore bought 54 United Defense LP M109-series SPH chassis. These will be fitted with an indigenous 155mm/52-cal turret, but the programme's timetable is not known. Firepower may eventually be further strengthened by acquiring a multiple-rocket launcher system. Although Singapore has so far hesitated to introduce such a capability to the region.<br><br>A delivery of CH-47D Chinook and an order for eight AH-64D Apache Longbow attack helicopters, funded by the army but operated by the air force, also represent new capabilities.<br><br>Singapore has six CH-47s in service and, although not confirmed by MINDEF or Boeing , is widely reported to be the launch customer for Boeing' s CH-47SD with up to 12 aircraft on order or option. As for the Apaches, an additional 12 may eventually supplement the eight attack helicopters currently in service.<br><br>Concurrent with the Chinook acquisition, a new army facility was built at Bedok to serve as the Guards headquarters. The guards comprise one active unit, the 7th Singapore Infantry Brigade and a reserve unit, and constitute the SAF's rapid deployment force with a brigade each focused on airborne and amphibious operations. Bedok is close to both the Chinooks, based at Sembawang and the new Endurance-class landing ships, based at Changi naval base.<br><br>MINDEF sources say a replacement for the AMX-13SM1 light tank will be considered within the next five years. "We are looking at whether we should replace this with a similar class of vehicle, or introduce a new concept fulfilling the basic function of a tank but not necessarily looking like one," a source explained. "The USA has looked at the Future Combat System [FCS] and we find that to be an attractive idea. We can explore along a similar line." Though as the FCS is only just on the drawing board (Jane's Defence Weekly 13 June), a similar system for Singapore is some time away.<br></div>
