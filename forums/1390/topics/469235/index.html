              Servicemen can expect new measures to better motivate, support, and 
              recognise them, as well to help them balance their NS commitments with 
              their family and career commitments.</p>
              <p>These aims were revealed by the Committee to Strengthen National 
              Service on Wednesday, after it held its first meeting at the Basic 
              Military Training Centre on Pulau Tekong. Over the next six months, the 
              committee will gather ideas from servicemen and the public through focus
               group discussions and town hall sessions.</p>
              <p>The public may also air their views on a new website <a title="www.strengthenNS.sg" href="http://www.strengthenNS.sg">www.strengthenNS.sg</a> or through e-mail at <a href="mailto:strengthenNS@starnet.gov.sg">strengthenNS@starnet.gov.sg</a>.</p>
              <p>The 20-member committee is chaired by Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen, 
              and includes Members of Parliament, senior military personnel, 
              employers, and NSmen. It was set up during this year's Committee of 
              Supply Debate in March, which saw robust debate over how to better 
              recognise National Servicemen in light of continued immigration and the 
              need to preserve a Singapore core. In recent months, members of the 
              public have responded to the news by calling for greater monetary 
              incentives, including subsidies for transport, education and health, and
               time-off to rest after reservist in-camp training.</p>
              <p>Over the next six months, Singaporeans will be asked for feedback on how to beef up National Service.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>The
               Committee to Strengthen National Service, announced in March, will lead
               focus group discussions and town hall sessions while also conducting 
              online consultation sessions via a new website, <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/strengthenNS/index.html">www.strengthenNS.sg </a></p>
              <p>The Committee meeting for the first time today, expects its work to be done within a year.</p>
              <p>Made
               up of 20 members, including Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen, Members of 
              Parliament,military top brass and private sector employers, the 
              committee will use the feedback gathered to recommend measures to 
              enhance National Service as a critical institution for Singapore's 
              continued survival and success.</p>
              <p>The measures are meant to motivate
               servicemen to give their best in serving, help them balance their 
              duties with family and work commitments, enhance support from families, 
              companies, new citizens and the broader community, and promote 
              recognition of servicemen's efforts.</p>
