              <p>Hi im a pre-enlistee with some questions :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Is it compulsory to weak black spectacles for BMT? (Those shiny metal specs allowed?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) If I cant complete the exercise will I get punished even though i tried my best? (e.g. 2.4 km timing is 20 mins)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Will I cause platoon mates to get punished?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) What happens if I fail BMT and stay as a recruit for the rest of my NS liability? Will I still be mobilized for war?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) And is it advisable to fail BMT and remain as recruit if i really got very poor fitness? (I cant pass Napfa even using girls' standard)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks</p>

              <p>dude, when are u enlisting? Why worry so much? Road will get straight soon enough.</p>
              <p>I've finally pushed through my NS life. You could too. However, I will still answer your questions if it will make u feel btr.</p>
              <p>1) It is absolutely not compulsory to wear black plastic spectacles, but it is strongly reccomanded to get a plastic spectacles, (not those with bright  colors) as it will  injured yourself as bad as metal ones during your physical training which might be hectic and vigorous later on. We strongly do not encourage people to wear contact lenses and will punish whoever break the rules. As for other companies, I'm very sure abt the rules on contact lenses. For you own benefit, it will be good to get a plastic black spectacles before enlisting to save alot of trouble.</p>
              <p>2)well, initially, especially during the first 2 weeks, asumming u are from the direct entlist BMT batch, we will not punish people who could not complete certin physical jobs, we could only push them to the limits and will try not to punish those weaker ones.</p>
              <p><br>3)Therefore, only in the late BMT phase if u still cock up, u might cause your platoon to get punish too.</p>
              <p>4)The only way to fail your BMT is = fail to attend the following, Range, 7 days field camp and your SIT test. Or of course, injury that causes you to be temp downgraded. However , u will be posted out if u are Out of training and will resume your BMT once deem fit. You will still be promoted to private ... etc after a certain duration through your NS period.</p>
              <p>5)There is no reason for you to fail your BMT, unless u got sick and missed the above mentioned excercise. Or u downgrade yourself to pes C or lower. Else, we as instructors will push you through your whole BMT phase and MAKE SURE you pass like everybody else.</p>
              <p>6) if u are still unsure of what will be happening to you, you could just PM me your details, and I will try my best to help u out. regards</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">1) Is it compulsory to weak black spectacles for BMT? (Those
                                      shiny metal specs allowed?)</span></p>
              <p>shiny metal specs are allowed, but you really should make black plastic specs.</p>
              <p>because in outfield, route marches and field / jungle training where it'll be very rugged, your shiny metal specs will spoilt quite easily, especially when you need to crawl on the ground through mud and all that tough.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">2) If I cant complete the exercise will I get punished even
                                      though i tried my best? (e.g. 2.4 km timing is 20 mins)</span></p>
              <p>of course! u think NS = sec school NAFA test? lol</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">3) Will I cause platoon mates to get punished?</span></p>
              <p>all for one and one for all! so, of you can't complete certain exercise, you very likely will cause entire platoon to be farked.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">4) What happens if I fail BMT and stay as a recruit for the rest
                                      of my NS liability? Will I still be mobilized for war?</span></p>
              <p>impossible to fail BMT.....you may get Out-Of-Course, but they'll post you back to BMT again and again till u pass.....never heard of anyone who remained as recruit during entire 2 years of NS. even those who fail BMT get promoted to Private and then they join another BMT course later in their NS lives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">5) And is it advisable to fail BMT and remain as recruit if i
                                      really got very poor fitness? (I cant pass Napfa even using girls'
                                      standard)</span></p>
              <p>then very likely you'll get PES C1 L9 or lower, meaning you'll excuse lots of tough exercises. Make sure you get letter from heart specialist on the condition of your heart and whether it can take such strenuous stuff in NS.....do a detailed heart check-up and give the letter to medical officer when you go to CMPB.</p>
              <p>the only thing i can advise you is to get as low as possible for your PES status so that you'll have an easy life.</p>
              <p>btw, no need to worry so much about being recruit and not getting mobilized for war if one day SG really gets invaded.......because some people, like me, will be joining the enemy anyway.</p>

              <p>I speak on experience</p>
              <p>1) Get plastic specs. My first metal frame one, do IPPT nia, drop on the tarmac, gone. My second backup one, do 5BX that time, suddenly fly out of my face, suddenly hear, "CRACK", my sergeant "niao" me becaue my spec is held up by black tape for one bloody week after I book out to repair it.</p>
              <p><br>2) Company line policy, different company line, different policy, my coy didn't punish anyone, we were just made to go for more training.</p>
              <p>3) Confirmed one, even you are not the one, people around you still sabo the whole platoon even you blanket party them liao, they still do it. Some people enlist as kids, POP as kids, ORD as kids and ROD as kids. They just never grow up and wake their f**king idea.</p>
              <p>4) Fail BMT, recourse lor. recourse until u can pass. mobilisation is for all soldiers one nia, all soldiers will involve in mob at some point of their time during their NS life, be it NSF or NSMen.</p>
              <p><br>5) I am a ah pui, is a ah pui before enlist, is a ah pui during BMT and ORD as an ah pui. NEVER pass IPPT, Army also give up kind so you think lah, if you can't pass after extensive training means you can't pass, more training or they push u till exhaustion, you still can't pass, what can they do? 2 years nia. They suck thumb, lick their own balls and LPPL only.</p>
              <p>SAF knows that people are fundementally different, be it physically and mentally, you can only do so much to influence them. If you try the best within the bounds and still can't, they just LPPL only what. Just don't go do something stupid like AWOL, etc.</p>
