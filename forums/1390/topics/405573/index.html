              <p>The SAF is trying to keep every1 as high PES as possible. You have to understand that some people have flat foot, but they are pronated normally. Hence they can be Pes B.</p>
              <p>If the specialist has recommended a lower Pes then most likely the SAF mo will just follow and put it up to medical board according. After all, he is just a small fry in the medical hierarchy he have no say. Most likely he will send to see the SAF orthopedic specialist for a second view.</p>
              <p>Just keep on visiting the medical centre, whack with Physio and MC until your medical condition is resolved. </p>

              <p>If incorrect walking or running motion, the joints might be worn out more quickly, so it will result is pain, swelling as symptom and eventually it will leads to arthritis later (might not be old). So take care. </p>

              <p>Thanks Lokey for the advice,</p>
              <p>i think i am already suffering for the effects of my conditions..  Whenever i recover from kneeling or squating position, i will put alot of strain on my knee.. i have to use my hands to support myself. And usually after a bath, i can feel some pain at my big toe bone..i wonder if this is arthritis?</p>

              <p>If you already boarded then the HQ should have been informed of your new status, as for insoles if I not wrong you can claim for it. But detail have to check with your chief clerk or your PC. As for recourse had to depend on when is the next recourse, some very fast, some had to wait until when they nearly ORDed then go, fyi no recourse no rank, so you are going to be a Rec until u go bmt.</p>
