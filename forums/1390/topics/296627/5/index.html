Cause if you have a problem be it mental or physical, 80% of the time people will say you keng and criticize you even it's genuine. It's just army, just do it and soon everything will pass and when you look back, you'll just laugh it off.<br><br>But of course if you feel that what you do isn't within your ability, just sound off to your PC or SGT.

            <div class='col-md body'>Seems like ahjun is facing a rather big problem. Cut him some slack guys. you would'nt know how he's coping with he's current mental condition.<br><br>I've seen many of his case before. but ah jun, I assure you, if you think positively and optimisticly, u could still go thru those obstacles waiting for you in NS.<br><br>Its hard, I know, I've been there. The forum dudes here might have rmb giving me all sort of advice before I go in for my BMT. But rather den thinking negatively of wad bad things might happen to u in there, it better to think it as a journey that every man in singapore have to go. In no time, you might even enjoy it.<br><br>As I said, there is nothing much to worry, but due to your GAD or some sort condition, you are prone to worriness. But I doubt it will affect you daily activities since u are physically fit. I'm sure the sergants/PCs in there will guide u along. Treat them as your teachers, not your masters.<br><br>With that in mind, you'll never go wrong.</div>
