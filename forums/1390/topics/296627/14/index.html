Stooky i haven't 'suffered' under him to comment but i seems like hes a totally diff case from FF or ahjun and i don't think we need too much such 'special' people</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would say military life will not be much of a problem for him. His only and main problem is he just thinks and worry too much. While in camp training etc keeps him busy and he won't have the time to think and worry. Physically he can take the training, hes not that unfit. However once he returns home for that day or 2 and he starts to have free time, he starts to worry about things and here he will come. He lacks a proper life and things to do to pass his time without worrying so i guess a stayin unit will suit him well and as long as hes kept too busy to think, he will be fine.</div>
