            <div class='col-md body'>I see tt u r old bird here..so i hope to be able to seek some advice frm u.<br>I will be enlisting to 1sir for ptp soon. However, i haf some personal problems which is tt i worry constantly for anything and everything. Its a problem tt i haf since young. When i went for medical check up, i was given pesA. at tt time, i did not tell the MO my condition becos i dun haf any supporting evidence and my biggest problem was inability to connect to pple. any the worse thing started to reach me..i was thinking up and down many straightforward things abt ns and thus losing slp and appetite. my mum asked me y i was talking to myself but i didn't even know tt i was doing so! and i thought tt since i am going ns, i haf to do something to help myself. i was seriously in distress tt time partly becos of unable to go poly and had to enter ns, and also my worries which affected my life so greatly. I first went to mount elizabeth hospital for a free consultation wif the head counsellor there and afterwhich he adviced me to go polyclinic for insomnia treatment first and he will arrange a counsellor for me. So i went to get medication for insomnia and referral to specialist which is the behavioural medicine clinic a branch of IMH. If u haf seen my topics and posts, it is somewhat matching something called GAD generalised anxiety disorder. I haf went for both counselling and IMH appointments on a monthly basis but haf since stopped due to NS enlistment date. My specialist said tt either i go back to cmpb and show them my appointment card so tt they can request him for my letter or i enter NS first and see how since there r counsellors, psychologists in saf too. at tt time, i decided to enter ns first since i doubt they will entertain me if i go back to cmpb wif juz an appointment card. My counsellor has also left the hospital becos his term ended and he said tt if i nid help again i could call back there and ask to be arranged a counsellor again but its like a waste of time if i haf to repeat everything again.<br>Someone frm this forum said tt i could speak to my pc during interview and see whether i could be referred to MO. But i am in a loss now. As the date comes nearer, my thoughts run wild..i cnt control imaginery fear. There's always something in mind tt tells me i will die inside. I do haf my appointment card, polyclinic,IMH receipts and my medical label wif me though..what shld i do? I am veri afraid my condition will be kept under wraps and i am left to suffer or this whole thing takes too long and constant worries will juz affect me again and again. what shld i do?<br><br><strong>Some said i am trying to keng, some said i juz continue wif training( which i doubt i can), some said i talk to pc. what shld i do? i am freaking out.pls gif me some advices b4 i enlist. </strong></div>

My family onli say ns is easier now, everyone is doing it together tt kind of thing which doesn't seem to help. And, i practically haf no friends now. I can't make it to poly. They may haf gatherings but i wasn't informed. Even if i do, i won't show up. I take olvl failure as humiliation. What i haf told u i fear to see friends/teachers outside. When i was in sec sch, if there r gatherings, i will be the last informed or not informed at all. And facing humiliation frm my family side is worst enough. I dun want to face humiliation from my frens side. Worse still, my mum seems to enjoy telling her colleagues tt i am entering NS and even changed the subject to ME entering NS if she call my aunts or my aunts gave her a call. I dun think not being able to enter poly and haf to go for NS is something worth to mention and repeat many times right? even if u finished poly/jc education and move on to NS, ur mum also dun spread it to other pple tt u r going NS every now and then right? The humiliated one is still me..of cos</div>
