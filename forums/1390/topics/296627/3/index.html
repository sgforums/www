These are all the physcology issues most people who are soldier to be facing. I am no exception. well, my case is more serous than you , u could dig the thread out to read if u dun beleive me.<br><br>So what you really need is motivation. The courage to face what u will be going thru. Do not keep thinking of downgrading yourself. What the Medical Officer define u is in otherword 100% gareentee your PES status. Unless u tend to injure yourself during the training. These PES grading for your does not come out just a 'snap'. it takes time, analysising, and lots of other factors to determine your PES. It takes more den 1 person to view and determine your PES. so if u are declare PES 'A'. It means u are fully functionable to be a soldier.<br><br>Get over it. I am like you. But I get over it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not too sure whether my advice is correct but coming from a medic's pov, yes you have the 48 hours to talk to your PC to sound out anything...<br><br>you have your receipts from IMH. check.<br>you have seen the specialists there. check.<br>there should be a case file of you lying in the dockets room of IMH.<br><br>Like what has been said before in this thread, I assure you that you will confirm have a first interview with your PC to sound out whatever fears you have, what medical conditions that you have (even your receipts are supporting documents!) etc. If you feel that you like to talk more to your PC/OC/OO, request for a special interview. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You have to take the initiative to request.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, there's some good advice provided in this thread, so don't challenge them as yet (whether to boost your self-esteem or whatever). As stated, you'll definitely have two outlets early in BMT to highlight your predicament to (the PC interview; the MO when you report sick).<br><br>Just don't expect quick resolutions. Your PC may have a quiet word with your DIs but training will otherwise carry on as usual, &amp; peer pressure can be tough if you whine to much or don't carry your weight. You may not necessarily get to OOC before BMT finishes either, even if the MO sends your docket up the COC for further review/boarding. In other words, DON'T rely on your condition as a security blanket. This is a new stage of your life, &amp; it's time to grow up accordingly.<br><br>If the unit doesn't have an OO, there's always the SAF Counselling Hotline. Just keep in mind that neither source has any real executive powers; they can only provide a listening ear.</div>
