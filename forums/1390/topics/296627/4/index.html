As stated, you'll definitely have two outlets early in BMT to highlight your predicament to (the PC interview; the MO when you report sick).<br><br>Just don't expect quick resolutions. Your PC may have a quiet word with your DIs but training will otherwise carry on as usual, <span style="color: red;">&amp; peer pressure can be tough if you whine to much or don't carry your weight. You may not </span>necessarily get to OOC before BMT finishes either, even if the MO sends your docket up the COC for further review/boarding. In other words, DON'T rely on your condition as a security blanket. This is a new stage of your life, &amp; it's time to grow up accordingly.<br><br>If the unit doesn't have an OO, there's always the SAF Counselling Hotline. Just keep in mind that neither source has any real executive powers; they can only provide a listening ear.</div></blockquote>what DIs? training will carry on but to that particular individual, will attention be paid more on him? no OO and not even a counsellor attached to the unit? tt's seriously unfair to mono guys. and i dun understand the line in red</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My only advice to you is talk to your PC when you enlist. There'll be a 1st interview with you and usually they'll talk nicely to you since you're a newly enlisted soldier.<br><br>But just don't carry this attitude with you when you talk to the PC. If the forumers here are irritated by your attitude, i'm guaranteed that the PC will also be irritated.<br><br>Bring all your medical documents on the 1st day and show them to the the PC and request to see the MO. Since you're a recruit, they won't treat you too badly and special care will be given to you.<br><br>But keep in mind one thing, in the army, you can never find reassurance or whatsoever. Army is usually wait and see type of approach. So have some courage and do your best. BMT is usually the most relaxed and fun period in whole of your 2 years in NS. If you really got problem, just sound out your problem, don't keep it inside. If not just ask your parents to talk to your OC and see what can be done.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Come on la friend...<br><br>Dont use a mental condition as a constant excuse... this will make you even worse... You are just succumbing to it...<br><br>Go and keep yourself occupied with other things, like training, jogging for your 2 years of NS...  This will help you to "keep away" from the mental condition and may even give you confidence...<br><br>Why sit around, do nothing, post silly questions and talking to yourself, when you can train hard and get yourself prepared...?<br><br>Life is always up and down... if everything is so smooth then it is not life then... Learn to stand up and do something for yourself...<br><br>Winners choose what to say... Losers say what to choose...<br>Winners say "I gotta do something for myself", losers say "Something need to be done..."<br><br>My advice, be proactive and keep yourself occupied... DONT keep ponering for nothing!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by WP_:</div><div class="quote_body">My only advice to you is talk to your PC when you enlist. There'll be a 1st interview with you and usually they'll talk nicely to you since you're a newly enlisted soldier.<br><br>But just don't carry this attitude with you when you talk to the PC. If the forumers here are irritated by your attitude, i'm guaranteed that the PC will also be irritated.<br><br>Bring all your medical documents on the 1st day and show them to the the PC and request to see the MO. Since you're a recruit, they won't treat you too badly and special care will be given to you.<br><br>But keep in mind one thing, in the army, you can never find reassurance or whatsoever. Army is usually wait and see type of approach. So have some courage and do your best. BMT is usually the most relaxed and fun period in whole of your 2 years in NS. If you really got problem, just sound out your problem, don't keep it inside. If not just ask your parents to talk to your OC and see what can be done.</div></blockquote>well seems like my onli choice now was to wait for 1st interview and sound out my problem.</div>
