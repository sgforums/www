            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Ah Jun,<br><br>I do not know much about your condition, but from your previous posts in this thread, I figure you are someone who needs constant reassurance and encouragement, or should I say you have a rather low-self esteem.<br><br>I am glad to see that you have taken concrete steps to help yourself, open up and ask people for help. Now that you have understood your condition, I believe the last thing you need would be a negative mindset and attitude. Instead, I think you should now try to look ahead, and think of concrete steps or actions that you can take to solve this problem. Asking yourself questions repeatedly, and constantly worrying, be it conscious or otherwise, would not be productive; this state of inaction and constant worrying would not bring you anywhere, and if any, would only deteriorate your current condition.<br><br>There are many ways advices as mentioned by others on this forum. I believe, besides constant reassurances and encouragements by those around you, what you really need to do now is to decide on what you are going to do. Of course, to each, there may be only more questions that you will probe about, but why not take them one by one slowly with time. Instead of wearing yourself out with more questions, why not focus on one option (say, sound out to your pc on the first day, perhaps), and just wait to find out whatever happens next. Perhaps, things aren't as bad as you think, and whatever circumstances that you may be thinking may not even occur in the first place.<br><br>In army, or in life alike, I believe you should try to slowly build up the confidence and trust in you, otherwise, it would be a rather hard time for you out there. I believe no one would appreciate associating with one who keeps doubting himself or having negative thoughts, like I said, be it conscious or not. In any case, I am sure you will be able to do that. Have faith in yourself! Medication and counselling, alone, I believe, would not aid your condition much. What will, however, is your resolve to start believing in yourself and thinking positively.<br><br>Do not try to attribute whatever difficulties you may be facing now to your condition. Instead, look at them, accept them, and come to terms with them.<br><br>Draw strength from those around you and more importantly, yourself. If you don't help yourself, no one will. If you don't believe in yourself, who will? Prove those that doubt you wrong. You will do fine, I assure you.<br><br>Good luck for your enlistment. I will be enlisting next Jan.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

And if they could pull through the NS sh.it, so could you.<br><br>You recognize the fact that you suffer from anxiety disorder and you came to this humble forums for advices; people were kind and they gave you some advices and encouragement.<br><br>There is only so much, we could do for you; we could tell you. You understand your condition well; if you need the extra medication, get it. If you need the extra counselling, get it. At the end of the day, it's only you who can help yourself... So snap out of the self-sympathy, learn to control your excessive worrying and take it on the chin like everybody else.</div>
