My family onli say ns is easier now, everyone is doing it together tt kind of thing which doesn't seem to help. And, i practically haf no friends now. I can't make it to poly. They may haf gatherings but i wasn't informed. Even if i do, i won't show up. I take olvl failure as humiliation. What i haf told u i fear to see friends/teachers outside. When i was in sec sch, if there r gatherings, i will be the last informed or not informed at all. And facing humiliation frm my family side is worst enough. I dun want to face humiliation from my frens side. Worse still, my mum seems to enjoy telling her colleagues tt i am entering NS and even changed the subject to ME entering NS if she call my aunts or my aunts gave her a call. I dun think not being able to enter poly and haf to go for NS is something worth to mention and repeat many times right? even if u finished poly/jc education and move on to NS, ur mum also dun spread it to other pple tt u r going NS every now and then right?

I've told you more than once that you have to face your failures. It might be humiliating to have failed but its just 1 failure, its not the end of the world. Not all successful people are degree holders. I've a friend who left sch in sec 3 to go out to work and hes now a manager in an IT company. Its not about your education level but about  how commited to your job you are etc that will determine how you will fare. People like us who have degrees or persuing our degrees, so what? That cert is only useful maybe the first few job applications, after that its all base on performance etc that determines who gets the job. Pay might be higher i won't deny but who says you can't study part time etc and still achieve some sort of success in future? The point is not to give up on yourself. So what if your friends laugh at you or something, they might laugh once, twice but will they laugh forever? Is it worse to let them laugh at you a few times or worried about being laugh at all your life?<br><br>So what if your former friends don't call you for their gatherings?

During this interview, just declare and talk to your PC YOUR problems. If you think he can't help much, you can always request to talk to your OC (Officer Commanding) instead.<br><br>If after talking to OC also can't help, for BMT phrase there is always a OO (Orientation Officer) attached to the unit for recruits with problems.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ad3285:</div><div class="quote_body">If you want answer, i'll tell you now.<br>Every recruit who goes into a unit will get interviewed by their PC (Platoon Commander) within 48hrs. During this interview, just declare and talk to your PC YOUR problems. If you think he can't help much, you can always request to talk to your OC (Officer Commanding) instead.<br><br>If after talking to OC also can't help, for BMT phrase there is always a OO (Orientation Officer) attached to the unit for recruits with problems. They are the trained one to handle all these problems.<br><br>OO will always take all these things into matter. so just trust them. if you don't trust them, i really don't know who can help you with YOUR problems.</div></blockquote>but right now i haf supporting documents alrdy- my IMH appointment card, a couple of receipts to show medication and visits and also some medicine labels i got. so i declare and show pc all these too? i am worried this whole thing might juz drag too long and i wun be able to survive. some pple in this forum say tt there r no OO attached to mono units. all go to tekong. i think they probably  dun wanna help us cos we got lesser education.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, someone suggested to highlight these during the PC interview. I have lots of cases like you. And normally if they could bring along their medical certicert to prove that their unfit for certain duties, it helps alot. I would advise them to report to the medical center MO. from there , they will justify whether you are fit or unfit to carry on your BMT. If you declare unfit, means OOT or (Out of training), you'll be having to make an appointment wif your specialist they appointed. most probably will be IMI. once you are Out of training, you will be excuse for certain chores, for eg. Those having excuse lower limbs before of leg injuries, are excuse marching, squating etc. these are just examples. Most mental cases I saw are only those really serious kinds that are only able to request to go OOT. so if the MO certifies your condition as FIT. there is really nothing much else we could do about it. And that means you are really fit, only that your mental is unfit. That can be solve by going thru counselling with me.<br><br>oh and I forgot to mention that, those who go OOT will normally given a temp pes status. and once you visit the specilist outside and if serious enough , you could be downgraded. forgot to tell u that OOT personal will NOT join in the Normal routing training. Most of their time will be helping us doing admin, and misc work.<br><br>hope this helps.</div>
