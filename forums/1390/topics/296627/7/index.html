NEVER. even now. I started to haf sleepless night and big loss of appetite. I didn't know tt i was serious or perhaps i juz shrug it off as a negative personality which doesn't require any attention at all. the thing tt gave me the most impact was what happened after tt. i figured out tt since i'll be entering ns, i got to do something abt it. i had to do something to help myself be it medication..counselling whatever.</div>
