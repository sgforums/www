              <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
              <p>I am anxious on how the Medical Board Result will be since I have Aspergers Syndrome, Obssesive Compulsive Disorder and Paranoid Schizophrenia, so I keep having nervousness for any kind of interviews/ consultations/ meetings, even with my regular psychiatrist. Today I am diagnosed with Paranoid Schizophrenia, what will happen?</p>
              <p>Will I be granted PES F that deemed me unfit from NS/ medically discharged from SAF?</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>

              <p><br> The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) is a 2,000-bed acute tertiary
              psychiatric hospital situated on a 25-hectare campus at
              Buangkok Green Medical Park. Set amidst serene surroundings,
              IMH offers a comprehensive range of psychiatric, rehabilitative and
              counselling services for children, adolescents, adults, and the
              elderly.</p>
              <p>IMH’s tradition of care started in 1928. We were the first
              mental hospital in Singapore, starting with some 1,000 patients.
              Since then, many advances have been made in treatment, training,
              and research. Our treatment integrates evidence-based therapies,
              supported by the departments of clinical psychology, nursing,
              occupational therapy, and medical social work, to provide holistic
              care for our patients. IMH is equipped with modern facilities, with
              50 wards for inpatients and seven Specialist Outpatient
              Clinics.</p>
              <p>IMH was the first mental health institution in Asia to receive
              the Joint Commission International Accreditation in 2005, a highly
              coveted international accreditation for healthcare
              organisations. </p>
              <p>Over the years, IMH has gained a reputation for quality
              research. In 2008, the Ministry of Health,
              Singapore, entrusted IMH with a S$25 million research
              grant to implement translational and clinical research into the
              causes of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.</p>
              <p>IMH also plays a key role in training the next generation of
              mental health professionals in Singapore. We train psychiatrists
              and mental health professionals through the NHG-AHPL Residency
              Programme for psychiatry and through collaborations with the local
              tertiary institutions.</p>

              <p><strong><br> <br> MOH to launch two new community-based mental health
              initiatives</strong><br> <em>Posted: 12 November 2012 1930 hrs</em></p>
              <p>Minister of State for Health Dr Amy Khor announced in Parliament
              on Monday two new community-based mental health initiatives
              designed to improve Singaporeans' access to mental
              healthcare.<br> <br> "We are developing Assessment and Shared Care Teams (ASCAT), which
              are specialist-led mental health teams based in the community, in
              order to improve access to mental health care. We are also
              developing Community Mental Health Intervention Teams (COMIT) to
              provide improved access to counselling and psychotherapy services
              in the community," said Dr Khor.<br> <br> Dr Khor also said that the Institute of Mental Health's (IMH)
              occupancy rate for the past three years averaged at about 80 per
              cent and that the hospital has sufficient capacity for new
              patients.<br> <br> There are currently about 2,000 beds across public hospitals in
              Singapore dedicated to mental health patients, with the majority in
              IMH.<br> <br> Responding to queries from Member of Parliament Mr Hri Kumar Nair
              on the criteria for admitting patients to IMH, Dr. Khor said those
              with conditions such as schizophrenia and depression may be
              admitted for closer monitoring.</p>

              <p>Hi nich</p>
              <p>diagnosis does not mean immediate PES F. it will be decided by your psychiatrist, not really for us to speculate.</p>
              <p>lokey</p>
              <p>i am not sure where you get your information from, but PES status and medical diagnosis is not publicly released. Even government agencies will have problems retrieving your medical records, much less private organisations. And even then, they need a legal form signed by you to attain those records. unless you volunteer that information beforehand.</p>
              <p>it is more applicable to PES F however, as your time of service can look suspicious just by duration. </p>

              <p>yes, taru is right</p>
              <p>you can request not to be PES F if they offer you, but you will be put on a period of "trial" service, whereby your superiors will feedback to the psychiatrist on your performance at work. </p>
              <p>however if you want it, you could request it too. haha. they might or might not reject you based on your condition</p>
