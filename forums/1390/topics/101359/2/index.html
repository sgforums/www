            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>wgat i want is to ORD as a lao jiao in my unit now</blockquote>Skip this post if you're serving only 2 years ....<br><br>Since you're in Arty like I was, I suppose I should warn you that a 2.5-year serviceman may not ORD together with the unit. The timeline is designed around the main body (officers, specialists, mono intake) finishing NS at the same time. It's not a problem if your liability ends earlier than them but, if you've instead got a few months more to serve, then the unit may post you out to another needy "active" outfit. Accordingly, you'll likely end up doing reservist with the latter bunch, not the former lot.<br><br>There's what nearly happened to me. My BC was tasked to arrow someone to be attached for a month-long jungle training. The choice narrowed down to me, but he made a promise to take care of my interests if I would agree to go. I did, &amp; about 4 months later - just as the unit was ORDing - he got another instruction requiring one of his Air-Level soldiers (i.e. extra half year to serve) to be posted on to a younger active SAR unit. Again, the choice narrowed down to me &amp; one other guy. "Fortunately", I could call on the favor &amp; be retained, while my friend had to do field exercises for another 6 months - with an unfamiliar, non-Arty outfit at that.<br><br></div>
