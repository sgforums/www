            <div class='col-md body'>My guesses:<br><br>No more re-vocational training, if you've already been formally trained in your present one.<br><br>Same unit? Depends on needs, I guess. Don't see why your current outfit shouldn't get 1st shot at retaining your services. It'll help if your Signal Officer or Specialist fight for you.<br><br>Yes, you'll do reservist. The best lobang you can hope for is to be out onto a holding list - i.e. no unit - &amp; maybe they'll forget you. Much depends on the timing of your ORD: if it's together with fellow combat-unit personnel, you'll likely join their reservist roster. If it's an earlier date or if you're with a higher-up outfit (or a training school), then it's a matter of demand &amp; supply. Could end up a newbie joining a lao chiao unit in the middle of their cycle, or a long-forgotten lao peng suddenly posted to a newly-ORD'd unit years from now.</div>

Combat &amp; service-side people are "easier" to assign for reservist stints, without needing a formal induction like for converting technical vocationalists.</div>
