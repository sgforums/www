My unit was a Guards unit. We started training on V200 vehicles when we were in our final reservist years. So during the course of our full-time NS and the 13 years of reservist training, my unit have deployed from helicopters, ships and armoured vehicles.<br><br>Most units from PDF are defensive in nature. A small number are used for attacks - some with light armoured vehicles. Some units within are "seasoned" battalions doing their last few ICTs with the PDF, others are newly formed infantry battalions made up of other previously non-infantry trained personal - so they start from basics (2 PDF).<br><br>However all this might change - starting with the new batches from 6 SIR, which seemed to specialise in defence, plus the ever changing organisation of the SAF. Already, 1 PDF units are transferred to the CADs.<br></div>

I was from the Guards unit that operated with the V200s, and we never had to dig trenches or do defensive exercises while in PDF. It was business as usual for my unit, accept that we now had V200s for some missions.</div>

All over 30s+ , except for those Spec/PCs, which are much much younger than us...<br><br>btw, there is no need to run around with the full pack during the 4d3n defence exercise. Full pack are just for show only. We just throw it down at our trench area throughout the exercise.. There are also not much running or cheong during the exercise.. Only need to dig and dig only and we always take turn to rest...<br><br>also, although SOP say that we must wear number 4 , with helmets and rifles while digging the trench, we did not bother to do so. take off "long four" and wear t-shirt instead. helmet and rifle just left it by the side.
