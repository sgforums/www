              Having diabetes neednâ€™t be a barrier to actively enjoying sports and exercise. Diabetic sportsmen and women are common and diabetics have achieved some of the highest sporting awards available on the planet. 
              
              Famous UK diabetic sports achievers include Steve Redgrave, who has won numerous gold medals at the Olympics despite being type 2 diabetic.
              
              
              Gary Hall, Ten-Time Olympic gold-medalist swimmer, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes during  year 2000 However, He didn't give up and continued to win more gold medals for the country.
              
              Will Cross, Who has Live with Type 1 Diabetes for more than 30-years, has climbed the highest mountain peaks on all seven continents and walked to the North and South Poles.In 2001 he climbed fifteen unmapped, unexplored mountains in Greenland.
              
              So Why Do Most of the Countries Military Force Reject Diabetics? They Can Still Exercise as long as they want. Or At least, Light Physical stuffs.. Just take a look at will Cross, He climbed the highest mountains. He did Not even faint once. What does this proof? it proofs that Diabetic won't faint even when doing strenous exercises, But Most of the Armed Forces are just too scared. They didn't get the facts right. Just like HIV won't be spreaded through saliva but people believed still and ran as far as possible when they saw a HIV infected person. How unreasonable are they.

            <div class='col-md body'>We Are also not handicapped. We still can fight for the country. We're the same as normal humans as long as we take good care of blood glucose. We are not as worse as cancerous diseases etc. We are still normal human being. we have no problem seeing,hearing,jumping,running and everything we can do as a normal human being. They're just being unreasonable. its like seeing people with cough and thought they had TB and rejected them . This is too Extravagant.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THis is what other diabetic says: I control my diabetes by limiting the carbohydrates I consume and/or by exercising.  My A1c hasn't exceeded 6.0 which is probably better than most "non diabetics."  Diabetics don't "need to eat" unless they experience a low blood sugar caused by too much insulin on board. Basically Metformin Doesnt cause Low blood sugar. only insulin. this isnt fair.</div>

              <p>Because during war - diabetic soldiers cannot find proper food for their diet.</p>
              <p>Because during war - diabetic soldiers cannot find the right medicine because enemy is restricting supply</p>
              <p>Because long run - diabetics run the risk of getting other illneses such as high blood pressure, blindness and amputation.</p>
              <p>Therefore, diabetic soldiers are ineffective in the battlefield.</p>

              <p>You created this thread before.</p>
              <p><a href="/forums/1390/topics/451185?page=2">The first thread</a></p>
              <p>As a frontline combat medic specialist, I already have a lot of work on my hands. During my last ICT, I had to handle two heat injury cases, one fractured wrist, one dislocated shoulder, two severe chest pain cases (they had hypertension to begin with), one anaphylaxis case (multiple hornet stings), and even one bugger who got stung by a scorpion at MUTF.</p>
              <p>And those were only those casualties<strong> I</strong> handled. The other medics had their own casualties to take care of.</p>
              <p>One of the heat injury cases had a fever the previous night, but he didn't sound off because he was feeling very 'on'. Needless to say, when he collapsed the next day during movement to contact with a 39 degree fever (and rising) without sweating, I scolded him terribly for making everyone's lives difficult from his sense of being 'on'.</p>
              <p>If I have to handle one hypoglycaemic case involving one bugger who knows he has diabetes and didn't sound off, <strong>I WILL GO POSTAL</strong>.</p>
