This ensures your comfort.<br><br>your rifle (if M16) can be rested on your right waterbottle. the magazine part can be rested in the space between your right bottle and your body. this way, your neck, shoulder are do not have to bear the weight.<br><br>don't hesitate to flush a bottle of water from your head down...  water is unlimited.<br><br>ensure correct boot fit.<br><br>just endure and think of nothing about the distance....</div></blockquote>outstanding ponders!<br><br>well finally something, otherwise this thread has turned into just hot air.<br><br>anyway,<br>for blisters (either u already have them or to prevent them), get hansaplast's blister plaster and smack them where blisters usually form for u.<br><br>i tried it, bloody effective!! 2-3 days and the blisters are gone. completely gone.<br>but i do hate the fact how they stick so well to yr feet it's hard to remove them, well better than having blisters the size of 50cent coins.<br><br>if u do get abrasions on yr ankles, my was so bad it bled and even my buddy (calls himself "seasoned") was shocked.(asked me why i didnt go see MO  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> )<br><br>try applying plasters(not the usual small strips) but bigger ones the size of cards, and stick them ard yr ankles as if they were full of wounds.<br><br>not sure if it works for u, but it did for me.<br><br>try eating chocs, helps boost the mood.<br><br>when marching off, just tell yrself " fark it, aiyah x km only, give it to u lah!! "<br><br>enjoy the journey, look at the surroundings, and when singing, dont just shout , sing with energy, project yr voice, sing with bottom of yr heart.<br><br>during 4km rest points, tell yrself, " xkm - 4km = how many km?" bit by bit, u will get excited. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Because the route march is so monotonous... I feel that it is actually more tiring than an equivalent  long tactical march.  I have participated in a long movement to contact ( 20 km) before , overnight, no sleep, engaging enemies a few times along the way ... and it was not so tiring as a concentrated route march of 24 km.<br><br>I found it helped for route marches when:-<br><br>1) You have a few songs in your head and you "sing along" mentally. Hopefully, it has a nice rhythm to get you going .<br><br>2) Having water just before the route march helps... It allows your body to move vital minerals and nutrients around, and also avoids dehydration. Energy levels you will find much higher if you are well watered.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>personally for me is ... i used to pair up with a very good group of people then we walk the last .... We make alot of noise, talk cock, the platoon sing one song we sing another song ... disturb the next platoon by singing along with them ... u know keep your mind occupied.<br><br>Some personal Experiences ...<br><br>- Drink alot of water ....<br><br>- Stretching is a must esp the calf muscles and shoulder/back muscles.<br><br>- Dun wear double socks ... just wear one semi new socks with good powder   padding. Too much powder will cause discomfort.<br><br>- Wear bicycle shorts (tights). Very effective<br><br>- Most important is Dunt dread the walk. Take it like a man with positive attitude. Cannot make it, live to fight another day.<br><br>- Make sure m16 the sling is not hurting .. must be nice fitting. Find a gap or spot to "park" your weapon.<br><br>- Rest hands on weapon<br><br>-<br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't look at the road in front.. the never ending road will make you feel shag, you will think "fark sia where is the rest point?" for me I keep looking down or look at the feet of the guy in front of me and concentrate walking.
