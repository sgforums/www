            <div class='col-md body'>If prone to abrasion between the thighs, can consider wearing tights. Otherwise can apply powder to reduce the chafing, put lots.<br><br>Make sure that any blister prone areas are well taken care off. ie. paste plaster even b4 setting off. Might want to keep some extra plasters handy as well. Keep them dry.<br><br>If prone to corns (areas of thickened skin that occur in areas of pressure, esp on the foot), there are those kind of plaster with a hole in the middle. can use them to relieve the pressure.<br><br>If prone to nipple abrasion (v common, most ppl wun even know until first few times route march), can consider using plasters as well. If really bad, then use nipple guards.<br><br>Do adequate stretching during pit stops.<br><br>Drink enough water, don't hold back.<br><br>Just enjoy the process.

This ensures your comfort.<br><br>your rifle (if M16) can be rested on your right waterbottle. the magazine part can be rested in the space between your right bottle and your body. this way, your neck, shoulder are do not have to bear the weight.<br><br>don't hesitate to flush a bottle of water from your head down...  water is unlimited.<br><br>ensure correct boot fit.<br><br>just endure and think of nothing about the distance....</div>
