              <p>LANCE Corporal Budiman Mohamad Som, 23, needed a job to help
              support his single mother - a sales assistant - and his two younger
              brothers.</p>
              <p>Having just completed his national service (NS) in December, he
              was not hopeful of getting a job immediately.</p>
              <p>But thanks to a new enhanced certificate of service (COS) for
              full-time national servicemen (NSF) who have just completed NS, he
              managed to secure a job within a month.</p>
              <p>Associate Professor Koo Tsai Kee, the Minister of State for
              Defence, yesterday announced the introduction of the new
              certificate, which gives a more detailed description of a
              serviceman's contributions and achievements during NS.</p>
              <p>Those who performed exceptionally well or who assumed positions
              of responsibility will also get personal testimonials from their
              unit's commanders.</p>
              <p>NSmen can use this certificate to apply for jobs, scholarships
              or places in tertiary institutions.</p>
              <p>Previously, the certificate would only state whether the
              performance was 'good' or 'outstanding'. It did not describe what a
              person did - whether he was a team player or if he had good
              organisational skills.</p>
              <p>The first Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) unit to get the COS was
              the 1st Battalion Singapore Guards in November 2007.</p>
              <p>LCP Budiman was a light anti-tank weapon sharpshooter in the
              unit. In his COS, he was commended for having good organisational
              skills.</p>
              <p>He organised company activities, took part in singing
              competitions to boost morale, and was praised for being a team
              player who carried out duties efficiently.</p>
              <p>His performance and conduct were listed as 'outstanding'.</p>
              <p>Using his COS, he applied for a job at Aetos, the auxiliary
              police force, two weeks after completing his NS on 8 Dec. He got
              the job during the interview and started work last month. He is now
              based at the Woodlands Checkpoint, earning $1,000 a month.</p>
              <p><strong>MORE CREDIBILITY</strong></p>
              <p>LCP Budiman said the COS helped him during the interview. He
              said: 'The certificate is from the Government, so it has more
              credibility and is recognised.</p>
              <p>'If I were the boss of a company, why would I not want to hire
              someone who performed well in the army during stressful
              situations?</p>
              <p>'It will motivate NSFs to work harder during NS.'</p>
              <p>LCP Budiman's younger brothers are aged 19 and 13. An older
              sister, 24, who is married without kids, also lives in the family's
              four-room flat in Teban Gardens.</p>
              <p>Aetos' commanding officer (land checkpoints), Deputy
              Superintendent (Auxiliary Police Force) Roland Wee, 47, is in
              charge of the Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints. He interviewed LCP
              Budiman for the job.</p>
              <p>He said previous certificates did not contain enough details of
              what an NSF did. The COS gives employers a better idea of whether
              job applicants were suitable.</p>
              <p>He added that LCP Budiman's COS contributed to the decision to employ him.</p>
              <p>He said: 'The COS was a good one, as it reflected his
              contributions to the SAF. It has been accurate in describing his
              character and abilities.'</p>

              <p><span>MINDEF has enhanced the Certificate of Service (COS) that
              is given to each full-time national serviceman (NSF) when he
              completes full-time NS. MINDEF has redesigned the COS so that it
              contains more information which could be relevant in the job
              market. NSFs who have completed their full-time NS from Nov 07
              onwards would receive the enhanced COS.<br> <br> When they complete full-time NS, each serviceman will receive a
              transcript and a certificate of completion. The transcript lists
              the NSF's contributions, achievements and courses attended during
              NS as well as a short description of the skills he has acquired
              during NS and personal attributes he has displayed. The certificate
              is awarded to recognize the successful completion of full-time
              NS.<br> <br> In addition, NSFs who performed exceptionally well and those who
              shoulder leadership responsibilities would be given a testimonial
              in recognition of their contributions.</span></p>
