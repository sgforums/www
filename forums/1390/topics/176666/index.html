            <div class='col-md body'>I've heard of 2 Lame ones.<br><br>1.  Excused "Green".   Claimed to have phobia of the color green, as well as it causing vomitting n dunno wad.  Basically, was reposted to navy or air force as clerk.  Possible Urban Legend.<br><br>2.  Excused ALL PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES.  Tried to OOC from BMT very badly and got the above excuse.  Possible Urban legend shared with me from my PS in BMT.  He claimed to have told the recruit to lie down in the training shed and NOT MOVE for an hour.  Had 2 canteens of water with him.<br><br>OH yeah, the excused sunlight one is quite... err common?  Some ppl get strange rashes from overexposure to sunlight.  Not that they are vampires or smth.</div>
