              <p>Better economy is meaningless if there are no jobs for the common people. Only the rich overpaid CEOs and politicians who failed the common people benefits. Do we have a scaled tax where the excessively rich gets taxed a lot more, accordingly? Since their wealth is ultimately the result of common workers and citizens too.</p>

              <p>Academic degrees are nothing these days. A lot of people who are hardworking with their studies has it. Well unless you have a research based-PhD or something which clearly demonstrate your ability for indepent thinking and creativity, and project management skill.</p>

              <p>Hi, I'm interested to know how many retired SAF officers
              are there in this forum. Pls share your invaluable experiences in
