            <div class='col-md body'>Anyone out there do it before. Kana it when i was training at signal camp in cck. The cemetary is around the lim chu kang area and along the way you will see a temple(i think). During one of the exercise i was sway sway <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  sent there. there almost nowhere to pee, every time you take out your boy all you see is tomb stones, pee on them sure die later and the place is so quiet except for the occasional sound of explosions from the live firing area. Not much trees and dont even see any birds. Some tomb stone got a small cemented area like a balcony for them. We took short naps there and read the wordings on the tomb stone. Worse that day we were doing coding and decoding exercise but did not receive the coding booklet when we left camp. <strong>MISSION GONE MAN</strong>. Cannot decode what to do? PC say copy down message better than nothing. Thought sure kana a lot when go back. We pray to the tomb stone where we rested for help.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sure. Not with comms but doing OP throughout the night.<br><br>My Arty battery deployed inside at one of the corners quite a few times. The drive-in was often quite pai-seh; imagine more than a half-dozen M113s convoy-rumbling into what's supposed to be a sacred resting area. We then had to set up 2 OP stations, &amp; the irony is no one wanted to do OP duty set up <span style="font-style: italic;">iaway</span> from the cemetary, beyond some woods &amp; looking towards what looks like a private housing estate. It was mosquito-infested dirty &amp;, also prone to check by officers (to deter us from stealing fruits or disturbing the residents for makan/drinks).<br><br>Instead, we preferred the OP set up towards back up the road where we came in, looking into the cemetary &amp; with graves on both sides - but at least cooling &amp; insect-free. First night was scary as hell - you keep hoping not to spot unnatural things at 4 am or so - but subsequently we got more brave. Some of the insomniacs who joined us even went gravestone "sightseeing"; one kwai-lan chap even took to sleeping on a flat conrete-slab grave.<br><br>I also recall attaching out for one 5-day infantry exercise - with 5 SIR, if correct - where one of their missions was a search-&amp;-destroy that "erupted" inside the cemetary. It was their scout platoon who took up the brief "firefight" before the enemy quickly withdrew.<br><br>Both experiences - authorized or not - surprised me in the sense that I thought the SAF won't "disturb" such facilities, if only out of respect.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Back in SAFINCOS, there was a 3 day company Movement to Contact exercise , which involved movement from Mandai forest , thru Dairy Farm , thru' LCK cemetary and then end up in Area D.<br><br>The first part (Mandai and Dairy) was uneventful in terms of enemy contact. But on the 2nd day when we reached LCK cemetary, the instructors threw a big enemy reception ! Enemy had GPMG posts  and OPs , it was protecting their main laager area behind the cemetary, scattered in the cemetary area. We spent a whole day clearing the cemetary, until night fall. I remember there were plans to hold the cemetary till the next day.... which meant over-nighting... but luckily an order was issued to move out at 2300 hrs.<br><br>At this time, I was nominated platoon sergeant and had to walk at the rear of the platoon extended column. My platoon was tail-end Charlie for the company. So guess what, I had the awful job together with the platoon medic to hang back to catch any stragglers.  Not pleasant, as you are walking thru' the tombstones with the eerie black and white photos of the dead staring back at you. And you have the terrible feeling that someone is following you !!!</div>
