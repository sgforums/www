              I hate to be the bearer of bad news but there have been accidents before for section/platoon live firing and atleast one death.
              
              I'm unsure about the exact date but the death occurred during a platoon live firing at the initial stage where there's actual firing. 
              A recruit griped on his way to cover after lighting a demolition fuse for a breaching exercise, tripped and fell. He managed to get under another "unplanned" shelter and was safe from the blast. 
              However at this stage the main assault was suppose to start and the recruit was shot when another trainee prematurely came out (before the all clear to commence the assault) and shot the other guy unintentially (as per in the report). 
              The wounded trainee passed away en route to the hospital/medical centre.
              
              The event is from OCS.
              
              But still the live firing exercises are pretty safe. Alot of lessons learnt and alot of contingencies put in place to prevent mishaps. This incident was a really unfortunate event. 
              
              Don't worry, incidents are rare and deaths rarer still.

              <p>You may wish to have a look at 4) of Timewalker84's 2nd post. It seems that crossovers from ASLC has to spend an even longer period in OCS as compared to crossovers from BSLC:</p>

              <p>"4) Illusionist_85 and jyyj87: Yeap. Whether from BSLC or ASLC jump to OCS, they'll still throw u to join the purebred cadets in Service Term II. Cross over from BSLC personnel spend the same 9 mths commissioning while ASLC crossovers spend 11.5 months." quote from Timewalker84</p>
              <p>As I interpret it, probably what Timewalker84 meant was that there is no extra time served for 'BSLC crossover to OCS' cadets, and they will commissioned same date as 'BMT to OCS' cadets. Whereas, there seems to be no exemptions for 'ALSC crossover to OCS' cadets(still go in during service term); furthermore, they need to do additional 2.5 months(13 weeks) of ALSC after their BSLC, before crossover to OCS. In this way, as it seems, ALSC crossover cadets are without any advantage over BLSC crossover cadets. Indirectly, ALSC crossover cadets undergo a longer path of training than both BLSC &amp; BMT crossover cadets, who take a similar duration of 9 months to be commissioned as officers. By relative comparison, ALSC cadets, 'Bo Hua', need to train additional 13 weeks. Also ALSC cadets may need to do the fire trench digging exercise (Nutcracker) twice.</p>

              <p>Hi xoxoZz,</p>
              <p>There is, but if you are a Sispec trainee, you will not be allowed to use it.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              Hi, 
              
              I am a SISPEC Crossover to OCS. I was awarded the Golden Bayonet in ASLC and Coy Best in BSLC.
              
              In OCS i was nominated for award but i didnt get any. But its alright.
              
              Anyway, honestly, the training in the SAF is generally very safe and noone should really have to be overly concerned for safety matters. Just pay attention to the briefing and pay attention when bullets are flying then you'll be cool. This is not withstanding if there is a moron around you that does dangerous things ofcourse.
              
              Section Live Firing, Platoon Live Firing are very tame events. The procedure is so set in stone that the likelihood that anything will happen is slim to none. I have done it twice the amount an average commander trainee would have to on account that i have been through SISPEC and OCS and its a really dull affair. I got bored during the second time. Especially since there is a dry rehearsal, then a blank rehearsal and finally a live rehearsal plus another one for night (atleast for SISPEC).
              
              Also, for those wondering, which is tougher, SISPEC is tougher hands down.
              
              I was from one of the most laid back company in SISPEC, and went to one of the toughest wings in OCS but, SISPEC is tougher hands down.
              
              SISPEC is tactical all the way in the outfield. Meaning when you go outfield training, the moment you get out of the tonner, you've got to behave as in you are in the enemy can be around. Totally no nonsense. You only get a break when it is all over. The longest i have had to endure this was in taiwan for a continuous 7 days. 
              This means that even when its time to sleep, you have to maintain the alert ratio as per ordered. usually 50:50. This was even during the rain (the temperature was 5 degrees that night) and we still had to carry on with the mission. It was the single most physically and mentally toughest things i had to go through in the Army.
              
              In OCS, its alot of symbolic and theatrical bullshit. I am not saying that i am ashamed to be an officer. But OCS doesn't do training like SISPEC does.
              In OCS's toughest experince for me, was in taiwan (again, though in the summer now), it was  a 5 day exercise, but in between mission we can have a tactical break (that means you can just chill) at one point we were sleeping on top of an open hill with all our equipments scattered around me. I'm not especially proud of this, but if you're in rome.
              
              I just get a little upset when officers behave like they are better than specialists. Cos the truth of the matter is that the best specialist is better than every other officer. And officers like to brag about going through the tough trainings of OCS, without knowing that SISPEC is tough too, and much more so.
              
              Cheers.
