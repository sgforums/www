              <p>Anyway, my platoon mate that crossed over in BSLC was not an
              award winner too. But you could see that he was different than the

              <p>Interesting Yamimono,</p>
              <p>Exercise Nutcracker was part of my BSLC back then. The exercise was done in the jungles of Pulau Tekong. And the 32km graduation march was part of our graduation parade in BSLC before we were promoted to corporals, and then to sergeants in our advanced specialist courses.</p>
              <p>I heard from my friends, in the new SISPEC, they shortened the route to 28km? I was really suprised as the old Tekong batches marched more than 32km, especially for me, since my PC was a commando and he liked to play mind games with us and marched round SISPEC after the 32km without stopping, probably around 34km. He also instilled his motto to us of not just giving your 100% for everything, but 110%!</p>
              <p>And before and after all our meals, we had to do pullups. And my company, Echo coy(my instructors referred to it as eagle coy) practise was that when we did the very last pull-up until we had no more strength, we still had to give it one last shot to do another last pull-up, shouting  'One more for the eagle in the sky!' to completion for our last pull-up.</p>
              <p>And our OC was a commando too, and he liked to shout 'Echo Elite!' during my PT exercises when he met us during running, and we had to shout back, 'Hoo-ah!' :)</p>
              <p>No doubt he was influenced by the American paratroopers cheer when he was sent to their special warfare courses when he was a PC.</p>
              <p>And I had only a few canteen breaks and no night outs at all throughout my entire BSLC because SISPEC was located in Pulau Tekong then. No doubt I am proud to have gone through such arduous and insane trainings :)</p>

              <p>Oh.. I guess its just a change of name. My batch was 28km route march for bslc... now they further shortened it to 24km as the recruits in BMT only do 16km for their POP.Oh and the pull up regimes... it is only enforced in the first 2 wks of BSLC. After that the enthusiasm dies and no one remembers it.</p>
              <p>Oh and fire trench digging is only done in ASLC. Digging of shell scrapes is only done once in BSLC for grandslam.</p>
              <p>SISPEC is going through a lot of changes now, its going to turn into something like OCS. I cannot post it here until it is officially announced.</p>

              <p>Oh my gosh! A transition to 24km? That was how far I marched in BMT! What has happened to the tough trainings SISPEC once had? </p>
              <p>Probably I'm not in a position to comment on the new training methods. Haha.</p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p>But still, the red berets, MWO Philip Kang and 2WO Chew would be very disappointed to hear that their beloved echo coy has deteriorated to such a state.</p>

              <p>Its true that SISPEC has a lot admin time, so we did have loads of fun.</p>
              <p>I think the Warrant Officers run the show very efficiently. There was not much of wasting time and such.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But when we went outfield, it was really work work and no screwing around.</p>

              <p>You're really causing a lot of problems declaring so late. You should have reported this in BMT. All the requirements for you to pass BMT would have already been met by then. (trust me i was a commander there).</p>
              <p>Now as for SISPEC, you will go for a medical review after you tell your commanders. Then the MO will OOT you if it is serious enough, or maybe just give you a status excusing you from some activities.</p>
              <p>If you OOT, you may recourse after they post you out for a while, but you must be keen to get back into SISPEC. If they post you out, tell your immediate officer that you wish to recourse. If he is a nice enough chap, he'll try to make it happen.</p>
              <p>So, Yes, there is still a chance for you to be a 3SG.</p>

              What is the structure of the Signals Specialist Course?
              How many weeks?
              Are there any overseas training incorporated in this course like the ASLC?
              How intense is the training of Signals Specialist Course?
              What are expected out of it?

              <p>How long is the current program. Seems very light, unless its theory and in camp lessons intensive.</p>
              <p>Especially without Grandslam.</p>

              <p>If i'm not wrong the schedules for ASLC were up a couple of weeks before the end-of-course for BSLC for Hotel, Echo and Golf coys.</p>
              <p>&gt;Audiophile: Its 8 weeks, same as before. But ASLC became much tougher</p>
              <p>&gt;Culture: Foundation term(BSLC) lasts 8 weeks. You will get the posting order on the day you finish the course, or the day before. Pray you don't get posted to ASLC(Pro term) or Recce (1SIR,5SIR) as those are considered the worst vocations possible to get posted to ~</p>
              <p>&gt;whowhat : Took a look at schedule. Lots of route marches, including 32km incorporated into Combat Skills Badge. Expect lots of your weekends to be burnt for live firing, including one confinement because of 2x live firing, including 1 x GPMG live firing on weekends. River crossing also. Your batch going Taiwan, which is pretty lucky as i heard the R&amp;R is in hotel,lol. You will also learn platoon level assaults, according to the timetable...</p>
