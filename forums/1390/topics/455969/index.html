              <p>Hey, just like to ask if you have a serious wrist problem, which affects you for pull-ups and wish to down PES (A status that would exempt you from IPPT), is it highly possible? Assuming that you go to specialist after getting referral letter from polyclinic.</p>
              <p>The extent of my injury is like even holding something as like as a netbook that would be painful for me. The injury has been going on for a long since like for 4-5 years and has worsen in NS due to training. </p>
              <p>In addition, I suspect I have low blood pressure, keep getting gizzy during training.</p>
              <p>Another question, I am currently on course at Arty, if I down PES to admin stuff, will they post me out of my current camp or I will go to the current camp's HQ for admin position.</p>
              <p>Also, I was unfairly given extras to sign, we were in an outfield lesson and were going to gather for a lesson by the instructor after setting up our equitment. We were a 3 man group and someone in our group left before us, we thought he was holding on to the equitment as we could not see it at our place. Then later the Sgt picked it up and passed it to our supurior which later asked us to sign extra. It was obviously the fault of the first guy who did not take the equitment in the first place right? Any avenues to air the unfair punishment?</p>

              <p>You need to tell your MO your problem, ask him to refer you to a specialist who will order an MRI of your wrist, then the specialist will write a memo to downgrade you. </p>
              <p>In the mean time, your MO should excuse you from using your wrist and lifting any heavy objects. SAF foots the entire bill.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If he took the equipment it's his fault alone. Can complain but it will do you more harm than good, take it as the last extra you ever serve before downgrade and smile cos the joke is not on you.</p>

              <p>If you are having a wrist injury, go to the polyclinics and get a wrist support to hold up the wrist to prevent further injury. Seek specialist opinion for Physio. Wrist injury is not a joke as you need to use a keyboard and mouse all the time for the rest of your life. Nerve injury is the hardest to tackle.</p>
              <p>You may not be downgrading, rarer having a long MC for recovery.</p>
              <p>The "extra" thing you can just forget it as no one can help you on this aspect. Suck thumb.</p>
