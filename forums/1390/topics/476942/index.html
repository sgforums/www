              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>I ORD-ed as a PTE (NS) in 2012. I am a PES C reservist. <br><br>By the way, I have just completed my 1st Low-Key in 2013.</p>
              <p>How to get rank promotion at least to a LCP/ CPL as a NSman during my In-Camp Trainings (ICTs)?</p>
              <p>1. Perform well enough, good work attitude, volunteer to do things, be more on the ball? <br>2. Request/ Ask/ Speak to the immediate Officer-In-Charge (OIC) of me? <br>3. Seek support from the immediate Sergeant to put in a good word of me to OIC?</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, this picture taken from Google.com:</p>
              <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Bun3Z09.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1200"></p>

              <p>Promotion for the NSF is to recognise his performance and past contributions during NS. Due to the onerous nature of duties for those deployed in combat vocations, they are promoted earlier than those in service support vocations.<br><br>The SAF regularly reviews the promotion guidelines, the last revision to the enlistee promotion guidelines being in 2011 and 2013. Currently, NSFs may be promoted to the Corporal (CPL) rank between the 12th and 18th month of service. The minimum service for promotion to Corporal First Class (CFC) has also been shortened in the 2013 revision. Aimed at according timely recognition to our servicemen, the revisions were not driven by cost considerations. The promotion system is already automated, with minimal paperwork.<br><br>We would also like to highlight that promotion in rank is not an entitlement: servicemen would have to meet the stipulated minimum criteria to be eligible. Unit Commanders are also given the discretion to assess if a serviceman who qualifies for promotion is deserving of the promotion at the given point in time, after considering the operational requirements of the unit.<br><br>Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback. We look forward to your continued support of NS.</p>

              <p>Yes, is possible to be promoted.</p>
              <p>My unit officers, ORD with LTA.</p>
              <p>Some during active or during first 5yrs after ORD. They attend the staff and command  course. At yr 5, they got promoted to CPT.</p>
              <p>The men, some attend some courses, most men was promoted to LCP or CPL. Some CPL with field rand as 3SG.</p>
              <p>Basically by time ROD.. my unit lowest rank officer was LTA with majority CPT. and 2 become MAJ.</p>
              <p>specialist, the highest became a staff and most become 2nd and 1st SG.</p>
              <p>Majority of men become CPL.</p>
