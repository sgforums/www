              <p>imagine you're a fresh young doc who've just finished your MD, you still have to go back and serve your stint in the army, from which you disrupted, so many years ago, this time, as a captain, you may be a big fark MO in camp, but remember, outside, you're still a greenhorn doc still trying to make your way up the specialization ranks, you'd still have to work your way up the hierachy of senior specialists, many of whom may be able to put a crimp on your career ... the medical profession, like law, is a tight fraternity after all ....</p>
              <p>further more your MD is newly minted and you are inexperienced ... unlike the experienced specialists senior docs whose MCs soldiers would bring to you to endorse .... wouldn't your first reaction be, hmmm ... why such a diagnosis ? ... does this more senior specialize know something I don't ? ... it wouldn't be unlike a fresh B.Eng questioning a P.Eng with many years' experience, no ? ...</p>
              <p>so ... what would your reaction be in such a case ? ... simply endorsing it would be the easiest way out, no ? ... after all, you're serving your NS too, just like the chap with the MC, and his MC is minted by a senior chap who may be high up on the medical board .....</p>
              <p>thus, unless MOs have a good reason, e.g. to suspect malingering, or the unit feedback a serious rash of convenient "sickness" .... they won't simply refuse to endorse MCs for the fun of it ....</p>
              <p>go ask any young doc friend .... they'll tell it to you as I've told you ...</p>

              <p>Hmm..don't go to MP la....it will make things ugly and you won't appear mature in front of them.</p>
              <p>Try to explain it nicely to your MO, if still cannot, ask if you can speak to someone higher.</p>
              <p>MO also got boss one...You can request to speak to someone higher, all the way up to your CO and even higher, as long as you follow chain of command.</p>
              <p>Chain of commands means you ask your PC to talk to OC, ask OC to let you talk to CO, etc.</p>
              <p>If you're in a brigade, refer this to your BMO (Brigade MO).</p>

              <p><br>a battalion MO's immediate head is a brigade MO, but in terms of appointment only. both MOs r highly likely to be NSFs as well. Next, both their superior is the division/formation MO. this time, he is a saf <span style="text-decoration: underline;">regular</span> MO, of at least Major rank and above. He is usually the chairman for the division/formation 's monthly routine Medical Boards. Except for those cases referred to MMI medical boards, then the senior MMI specialists there will be the chairman.<br><br>and usually, to be a regular MO of Major rank and above, he/she of course needs to go for medical upgrade courses, such as a Masters to be a specialist, or other medical graduate diplomas for other specialistations...</p>

              <p>ic thanks for the advice eac. my camp MO gonna ord soon i heard. maybe end of this year or even sooner gotta check with the medics. ya i think i will rope in my chief clerk to help or even s1 coz i am with good terms with them if the need arises.</p>
              <p>and my specialist is govt hospital. and yea my condition solely leads to my current pes e status. sorry i will not mention my condition. its very very personal for me. aint too good to reveal too much here esp if that MO might be reading on this.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">but if i ask my specialist to write to the bosses of my MO wont it be very difficult as civilian email address cannot reach military OA? there's no way of meeting these bosses personally to present my case or even get their contact numbers for my specialist to talk to them? instead of just via email? cause as a clerk i have experience. CC and BCC are dangerous backstabbing weapons.</span></span></p>

              <p><br>i suggest against this. it is best that u might need the specialist to write the above replied <em>stonger worded memo</em> attention to the medical board chairman, is good enough to support ur &gt;28days MC medical case to be put forward for a decision at the medical board meet. if not wrong, their OA email address properties should list their office numbers.<br><br>cc and bcc is another tool for office politics. only use it when u know how to use it in the situation arises. it applies to any other companies public/private sector...<br><br>another thing... ur vocation workwise, u must arrange with ur chief clerk on who is going to cover ur work while in absence...<br><br>and request ur specialist to include his/her contact numbers in the memo. <br><br><strong>medical directive states that<br><span style="color: #ff9900;">att c MC for &gt;28 days = medical board;<br>att b light duties/excuse anything for &gt;84 days = medical board.<br></span></strong><br><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>medical directives can be found and read easily on the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">intranet</span>. just go to its HQ Medical Corps website there and browse a while.</strong></span></p>
