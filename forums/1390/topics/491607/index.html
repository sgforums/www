A minimum sum equivalent to half-day service pay will be paid for NS activity of 4 hours or less.</em><a style="color: #005688;" href="http://www.ns.sg/cs/content/eServices/mindef/NSmen%20Payments%20(nspay)/General%20Information/c-mf_nspay_gi_overview.html">http://www.ns.sg/cs/content/eService..._overview.html</a><br><br>The following slide is sourced from <a style="color: #005688;" href="http://www.ns.sg/cs/content/eServices/mindef/NSmen%20Payments%20(nspay)/Document/c-mf_nspay_paymentmatters_briefing_slides.pdf">http://www.ns.sg/cs/content/eService...ing_slides.pdf</a> , titled: 'NSmen Payments Matters', Updated in Jun 15, NSmen Payments Centre, MINDEF Shared Services)<br><img id="vBCodeIMG" class="vbimgcodelimit" title="Resized image - click to view original size" src="http://i.imgur.com/dfthkb4.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="514"><br><br>In essence, I suspect that not few NSmen are indeed being paid BOTH service pay as well as their normal full monthly salaries by their companies (company claims this from SAF but SAF does not reclaim service pay from NSman) resulting in a significantly biased remuneration scheme which can only be better explained with the example of SAF being a medieval corporate entity, with subjects(NSmen) being divided into 2 distinct classes of slaves (only paid pittance 'service-pay/ allowance') vs the mercenaries (receive their hourly ransome PLUS allowance).<br><br>This kind of <strong>blatant, inequitable double standard treatment</strong> will certainly severely penalize NSmen who are retrenched, studying, between jobs, sabbatical leave, house husbands, taking care of ill relatives, unstable income source or paid lump sum fees at intervals with no formal documentation, project based work in across different continents, structurally under-employed, anyone without black-white proof of regular salary/ too onerous to declare locally, un/ underpaid due to poor-business/ failure etc and cause NSmen to view the SAF as an economic tool/ device to prop up GDP statistics at all costs: thus subjugating the professionalism of a robust fighting force to the short term concern of boosting commercial (GDP) statistics.<br><br>The internet seems pretty rife with discussions along the lines, e.g. of <a style="color: #005688;" href="http://www.mycarforum.com/topic/2649480-minimum-pay-to-evade-ict/page-2">"Minimum pay(salary) to evade ICT"</a><br><br>It is thus my heartfelt suggestion that in objective recognition for an NSman's sweat and toil during his 2-2.5yrs of NS fulltime (NSF) training, for whatever bonafide reservist test, trainings or courses and NSman should undergo, the pro rata equivalent of a regular serviceman's salary ought be paid in recognition for the skill and sacrifices an NSman has made.<br><br>Let the following negative reactions to NS be the exception rather than the norm that the majority of lower wage earning NSmen feel inside, let every Singaporean not feel shortchanged by NS. Lower wage Singaporeans should not have their past military experience discounted and high wage Singaporeans should not use NS as an opportunity to profit more than deserved. <br><br>Young NSF recruit enlistees must enter with the mindset that no matter what their future economic fortunes/ misfortunes, they would always be equitably remunerated for their reservist postings/ trainings and that exaggerating medical conditions to evade reservist liabilities in lieu improving one's commercial value does not pay.<br>Where NSmen perceive SAF as a professional organisation both in conduct and in remuneration of NSmen, a good reputation of SAF amongst NSmen would automatically follow.<br><img id="vBCodeIMG" class="vbimgcodelimit" title="Resized image - click to view original size" src="http://cdn.mothership.sg/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bmt-recruit-face-epic-cover.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="514">[<a style="color: #005688;" href="http://mothership.sg/2016/01/this-bmt-recruits-face-is-exactly-how-sporean-males-feel-about-national-service-on-the-first-day/">pict source</a>](<a style="color: #005688;" href="http://i.imgur.com/7tIsuKK.jpg">alt photo reserve</a>).<br><br><img id="vBCodeIMG" class="vbimgcodelimit" title="Resized image - click to view original size" src="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y29/vnc2005/jobsFTns.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="514">[<a style="color: #005688;" href="http://disgruntledsporean.blogspot.sg/2006/04/jobs-for-foreigners-ns-for-sporeans.html">img source</a>]<br><br>BTW:<br>Since NS is a duty and by definition involuntary, all reservists ought to be compensated pro-rata the equivalent regular serviceman (in equivalent appointment) salary, whatever one earns in civilian job capacity ought to be discounted for the 2 weeks or so reservist service and the economically well off shouldn't grumble but either perform the duties to their best ability or suggest to their manpower officer how NS could be better diversified and themselves be better deployed to perhaps new NS vocations serving the community at large: e.g. as accountants for charities, nurses and therapist in hospitals or even the training in new vocations to adopt new appoints during reservist e.g. logistics officer for someone now employed as logistician etc etc:<br><img id="vBCodeIMG" class="vbimgcodelimit" title="Resized image - click to view original size" src="http://i.imgur.com/MTy8nOC.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="514">[<a style="color: #005688;" href="http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/current-affairs-lounge-17/median-opportunity-cost-ns%3D-s%2475-000-implied-even-handed-pap-gahmen-5292487.html">pict source</a>]<br><br><br>(PS: All info referenced is official released/ publicly available and retrieved via Google search in internet, no secret military info referenced/ revealed here).</div>

              As mentioned, for want of a more equitable remuneration scheme which recognises the actual NSmen efforts towards contributing to the security of Singapore as measured by the appointments in NS he has obtained etc (as quoted above but I tidy it up here for U), the following less commercially active NSmen receive the short end of the stick due to unfair NS remuneration policies which myopically reward immediate commercial profit to the detriment of long term beneficial outcomes as defined as follows:<br>- <strong>Business owners/ employees temporarily sacrificing some/ all salary</strong> to keep business afloat financially: additional hardship due to SAF penalizing the individuals for commercial unprofitability even if it is necessary to tide a business through economic downturn etc.<br>- <strong>Individuals who do not receive documented financial reward for bona fide reasons</strong>like studies, taking care of ill relatives, home-makers, on sabbatical leave, retrenched, employment abroad, salary too low/ onerous to declare to income tax (small scale pte tuition to fund education) or not paying medisave due to other important exigencies etc which are an ordinary part of life (sick relative) and are important social/ intangible activities achieving greater future good: these people are disincentivized due to financially biased SAF reservist remuneration policies to the probable detriment of future good.<br>- The fear of individuals to follow their calling/ change jobs due to fear of suffering financial loss during reservist since one's value is measured in purely financial terms by mercenary SAF<strong>resulting in job stress and eventual structural unemployment due to unwarranted fear of following one's calling, broken families, higher cancer rates due to stress: eventual breakdown of entire society</strong> from such unnecessary stress caused by myopic, outdated, clumsy, blunderbuss SAF reservist remuneration policies.<br>- Worse of all is Singaporeans trying to outsmart the gahmen by feigning sickness/ requesting excuse for every insignificant medical ailment to the extent that<a style="color: #005688;" href="http://www.sammyboy.com/showthread.php?181640-Life-Sucks-Vast-majority-of-NSmen-not-even-fit-to-take-physical-fitness-test"> &gt;60% have in fact declared themselves unfit as soldiers (cannot even take running test)</a>: this 60% is public knowledge BTW: and<strong> it simply reveals to a serious degree how sneaky Singaporeans are and how much they lack integrity</strong>.<br><br>My suggestion is to review the reservist remuneration scheme to a single equitable measure (pro-rata regular salary for the respect rank/appointment is one) to ensure cohesion and equity across the board (the current lack of: being a source of cynicism by new enlistees most of whom are already well cognisant of what I am now writing) as part of the continuous review/ improvement process to keep up with the times, otherwise, the SAF will become a liability to Singapore, an organisation which stifles progress and divides society: the trojan horse that will make Singapore surrender to its foes as<strong> distrust and disunity FROM WITHIN makes Singapore UNABLE to respond decisively nor cohesively</strong>.</div>
