It's a pretty brilliant concept... except that when you take it out into the field, it starts getting uncomfortable VERY fast. It's hot, it makes running awkward and you have difficulty making quick entries and exits into vehicles, especially into the driver's cabin.<br><br>Having said this, it's still a good concept. Just make sure that you take the SLIMMEST possible configuration. I doubt many SAF troopers get issued pistols, but when we trot out the P226's for our requisite fashion shows infront of CIO etc, we also get drop-leg holsters for the P226. That's really about the furthest Id go. Dont try to put much more on a drop-leg platform than you would normally stuff in your pants cargo pocket.<br><br>Of course, this is for field use. If using a drop-leg platform makes you feel more macho, and the most you do in the field is on-site technical stuff... than GO FOR IT!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Incedrius:</div><div class="quote_body">Have you actually USED a drop-leg pouch in the field? It's a pretty brilliant concept... except that when you take it out into the field, it starts getting uncomfortable VERY fast. It's hot, it makes running awkward and you have difficulty making quick entries and exits into vehicles, especially into the driver's cabin.<br><br>Having said this, it's still a good concept. Just make sure that you take the SLIMMEST possible configuration. I doubt many SAF troopers get issued pistols, but when we trot out the P226's for our requisite fashion shows infront of CIO etc, we also get drop-leg holsters for the P226. That's really about the furthest Id go. Dont try to put much more on a drop-leg platform than you would normally stuff in your pants cargo pocket.<br><br>Of course, this is for field use. If using a drop-leg platform makes you feel more macho, and the most you do in the field is on-site technical stuff... than GO FOR IT!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>The drop leg pouch is more useful for tools and tech equipment that cannot fit well into the SBO and when you readily need them and its not field advisable to move around with a toolbox.<br><br>Just have a few ideas regarding the drop-leg pouch.Will be considering trying out the concept on street and event photography.</div>
