            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys! I'm a Warrant Officer in the US Army and am interested to know more about Warrant Officers in the Singapore Army.<br><br>In the US Army, Warrant Officers are Technical Officers specialising in a particular field.  We have the status of Officers, are saluted and are members of the Officers Club. There are five ranks. On qualifying from Warrant Officer Candidate School (WOCS), WOs are initially appointed (i.e. receive a 'warrant') at the rank of Warrant Officer 1 (WO1). When they are promoted to Chief Warrant Officer 2 (CW2), they receive a Commission from the President of the United States. The more senior ranks are CW3, CW4 and CW5.<br><br>(see the attached link  http://usawocc.army.mil/whatiswo.htm )<br><br>Do your Warrant Officers have similar roles and status to US Warrants or are they more similar to British and Australian WOs <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would say that the WOs in the SAF are closer to the British and Australian WOs, where they are senior non-comm officers who can lead companys and hold junior comm officer positions.<br><br>They are not saluted FYI.But are to be addressed as "Sir" or more commonly, "Encik"(Malay term for a older, respected male figure).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I would say they are in the officer club but rather they are so much the same as officer just without the prestige. Majority of their roles are in the support or assisting the officer commander of the running of the unit.  Further more the authority is based on appointment rather than just rank in itself. A senior WO with much important appointment can still allocate punishment on junior officer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our warrant officers are soldiers, who worked their way up from NCOs (we refer to them as specialists)  to WOs.<br><br>They usually have lots of experience in their specialisation, and often take on roles usually filled in by officers. Some are platoon commanders/leaders in training schools, and  most of them will have an opportunity to serve as regimental sergeant majors.<br><br>As mentioned, they are not saluted as they are not commisioned by our President.  Warrant Officers do have an opportunity to convert to become Commissioned officers, but few would.  Doing so usually means a pay-cut as their Warrant officer rank pay is somewhat higher than the equivalent Officer rank pay.<br></div>
