              <p>Due to huge differences and constant conflicts with my parents, my parents had decided to apply for an eviction order which may be in place by next month. This is something very private to me and I wouldn't like to reveal too much about.</p>
              <p>I contacted a few of my friends who have got vacant rooms in Bangkok and Taipei to rent out to. However, I have In-Camp Training coming up in a few months' time. Therefore, I am thinking of moving to Thailand or Taiwan when that eviction order is in place and never to return to Singapore again. I am currently saving money for that.</p>
              <p>I understand that I will be a 'wanted' man for escaping NS but I wish to know if the local authorities will even bother to contact Interpol or the Thai or Taiwanese authorities to have me arrested for just skipping NS. Thanks for your answers as I do not wish to run into any trouble overseas!!</p>

              <p>here's the long and short of it..</p>
              <p>if you move to another country, you better be sure you are able to stay there legally and permanently..</p>
              <p>and that takes a long time.. they will want to find out everything about you, including your status from your "home country" which is Singapore.. they will want you to be a "good citizen" here before they let you live permanently in their country... and also they will want you to be able to be economically independent which means you will be able to work and contribute to the society where you are going, and not become a burden to them..</p>
              <p>else you become an illegal immigrant there after you overstay your visa or visit pass... after that, you have no rights to things like medical treatment, education or anything like that.. if you find someone to get married there, you may not even be able to register yourselves without the authorities knowing about your status as an illegal immigrant...</p>
              <p>the NS part will be the last of their concerns...</p>
              <p>think about this thing first before flying off to some country on a wing and a prayer</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>1st of all if u going overseas to work or study, u'll just ask for disruption from ICT. Also like what bear had say, if u become an illegal immigrant in any of those country, make sure you are very very rich, or else, not only the legal people will find you, the illegal one also will come looking for u. How much more can you'll wealth handle those? Unless you are telling me you are as wealthy as Bill or Warren.</p></div>

              <p>It is a terrible thing to be an illegal in antoher country. Not sure if you need to apply for VISA to go to Taiwan or Thailand. If you overstay your VISA, you be considered illegal. As an illegal, you can get deported back to singapore. So don;t even think about singapore contacting the authorities in taiwan or thailand because the moment you apply for job, want to take a flight or show your passport, you be considered an alien (due to overstay).</p>
              <p>An illegal has no rights in another country - cannot get a legal job, cannot own property, cannot drive car due to no license, cannot open bank account and cannot even rent a room because of improper documentation.</p>
              <p>The only way is to go NS.</p>

              <p>The Bear has mentioned your major concerns regarding your host country. To obtain PR or even long term residence as a spouse of a citizen, you may need to get a certificate of no criminal conduct from the police. This may apply whether you are applying for PR, work, residence.</p>
              <p>Ironically skipping an ICT<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> may </strong></span>not be a criminal offence depending on the circumstances. It may be a military offence settled by a fine.</p>
              <p>You notice that Singapore ICTs are not a problem. As long as you are out of the country, you are not liable to be called up. You must tell your unit you are leaving for good. When you are next return to Singapore, you must show your passport as proof that you were really overseas for all the ICTs you skipped.</p>

Once you are eligible for citizenship conversion over there, etc then just convert and send the proof back (or at the consulate) and tada! no more SG, no more ICT with no troubles and you can still visit sg anytime like a tourist with no penalties.</p>
              <p>As some forumers have said, if you go illegal means, not only u can get deported back, u loose your chance for any citizenship conversion and worst, come back still have to squat in DB. Bo hua leh.</p>

              <p>i shudder to think if ippt and remedial army athelete trainings could be reinforced overseas then my technolgy bild up would be in jeopardy as i dont work best when subjected to stress and tiredness due to running around a stadium and do other strenous physical activity for 2 hrs 3 days in a week!</p>
              <p>as i had calculated i dont have time for ippt or time wasting athelete remedial trainings but  do have time for reservist trainings in jungles for 4 weeks as thgat as enjoyable and fun even .</p>

              <p>A deputy director of the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) collapsed and died on Wednesday night.</p>
              <p>It is believed that Mr Ng Tiong Lee, 47, collapsed at his home in Sin Ming Walk after a run.</p>
              <p>His death was mourned by his former colleague, Minister of State for National Development and Manpower Tan Chuan-Jin, on his Facebook page. In a Facebook post, Mr Tan said his heart was heavy after hearing the news that his former colleague had died.</p>
              <p>Police said they received a call from Mr Ng's wife, requesting assistance, at 8.55pm on Wednesday. She made a similar call to the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) at 9pm, in which she said Mr Ng had suffered a stroke.</p>

              <p>Due to huge differences and constant conflicts with my parents,
              my parents had decided to apply for an eviction order which may be
              in place by next month. This is something very private to me and I
              wouldn't like to reveal too much about.</p>
              <p>I contacted a few of my friends who have got vacant rooms in
              Bangkok and Taipei to rent out to. However, I have In-Camp Training
              coming up in a few months' time. Therefore, I am thinking of moving
              to Thailand or Taiwan when that eviction order is in place and
              never to return to Singapore again. I am currently saving money for
              that.</p>
              <p>I understand that I will be a 'wanted' man for escaping NS but I
              wish to know if the local authorities will even bother to contact
              Interpol or the Thai or Taiwanese authorities to have me arrested
              for just skipping NS. Thanks for your answers as I do not wish to
              run into any trouble overseas!!</p>

              <p>A few month's time is still a long way.</p>
              <p>1. You apply for overseas notification first.</p>
              <p>2. Apply for working permit, there be it bangkok or taipei.Let say suppose you r to be a muay thai fighter, apply for working permit there.Even as a waiter in the resturant also can. (somehow u got to work right?). I think even if you apply for student pass, it is also ok.</p>
              <p>3. Update the SAF that you are staying and working or studying overseas, and apply for deferrment of ICT.</p>
              <p>U must get clear in your mind! You are not skipping ICT! You are going overseas and will be unavailable for ICT. Therefore you have to apply for deferrment.</p>
