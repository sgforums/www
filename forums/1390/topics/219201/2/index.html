Whats so urgent? Buy coffee for his CO?<br><br>b. How do you know the gates are opened at 8.15 exactly ?<br><br>c. Why nobody go and check to ensure that the number on the signboard is updated and accurate?  Then put the signboard there for fcuk?  Deco ?  What happen if got emergency and need to contact someone?<br><br>d. if its so troublesome to keep the place locked and unlock, why don't just leave the place open for public use?  MINDEF can fence up other areas that are deemed out of bounds, in this manner, you don't need to stick a lobo to be in-charge of the area.<br><br>e. since this represent a negligence of duty, is the lobo charged?  </div></blockquote>Dude, relax! Its opening of gates to a park. really nothing to get excited about.<br><br>a. He is wrong to do so without arranging for another to take over. Hence he should be punished. The exact nature the punishment will not be disclosed because we would not want to infringe the privacy of the individual concerned.<br><br>b. Coz the guy who is supposed to open the gates said so.<br><br>c. The guys who are in charge of opening the gates should have checked the signs for accuracy periodically. They omitted to do so and will be disciplined. OR That was an oversight on Mindef's part. In case of emergency, the fire service/police should be called anyway.<br><br>d. Because if it is a park, and it is under mindef's control, Mindef is responsible for the state the park is in. With that in mind, Mindef clearly needs to restrict access to protect the park.<br><br>e. Bloody hell. You are quite grumpy aren't you.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually i also encountered these kind of examples before. mainly it's because of the bo-chup and lazy attitudes of those who are tasked with the responsibility to be there on time to do what thet are supposed to do.<br><br>for example in my camp, i take the 1st ferry bus to work everyday which will reach camp at around 7am. the ferry bus can only come in via the back gate, but depending on who are the RPs on duty that day, some will come late and end up everyone in the bus will have to wait for them to open the gate. having know how screwed up the some of the RPs there are, they have overslept.<br><br>same goes raising of flags every morning at 6am, they are like babies, everytime must wake them up or they will kept sleeping.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
