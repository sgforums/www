For those in leader course (CTW-topo) and Cdo sniper (SIW) they will have to do it 2 times. The last one is with the company before you pass out with red berets.<br><br>Route are planned and recce.  Resting point are fixed. Start from jurong to woodlands and back to Changi.  Some good places like, Housing estate like Woodlands, Hougang, Eunos and Tampines.<br><br>Some company start with helmet, half way change to jungle hat and track shoes.  Reasons, after you pass out, LRRP or FF. Guys in red will know.</div>

During my time in 90s, my team started in Mandai, walk around there and Sembawang, pass by SLE (under construction at that time), Woodlands, Marsiling and Kranji area, walk alongside railway line and cross Kranji Dam to Neo Tew, Lim Chu Kang. The average time taken for each team to complete was 24 hrs. My team came in at 27 hours. Started on Friday morning, finished on Saturday afternoon. Based on an average of 4km/hr, the total distance covered was somewhere between 90 to 100 km. While it isn't a route march, it is still a considerable distance to be covered. Chaffed thighs and big blisters on foot was the norm at midpoint and end point of Long Walk. At times, we even have to fast march.

Hmm, wonder if old troopers like us are still entitled to the badge? 6 weeks for scout cmdr course, wonder what are the parts they took out. Maybe the shortened course is due to new technologies being implemented. My course lasts a total of 13 weeks. Everybody trained together during the same course, in order to foster espirt de corp. If you happen to bum into any of the old WOs, ask them whose callsign is "dragon" in the 90s. That callsign is equivalent to pain during my course.</div>
