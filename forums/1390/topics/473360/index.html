              Hi everyone. I'd just like to share my situation with you. Sincere bros out there please advise, otherwise please don't anyhow comment. I'm in dire financial straits. 
              
              I was a store man during my NSF days and ORDed as PES E9L9. I've some problems getting a job in civil service due to my PES status.
              
              I was retrenched from the private sector after 7 years and now for the sake of my family, I need some stable income in civil service. My "emergency fund" is running low and the way I see it, a career in civil service is the only way for me to sustain current standard of living. I've no luck with the private sector in the past 5 months. 
              
              My background is honours degree in engineering from local uni. I am seeking Civil Service job that require physical fitness as I need the salary. 
              
              I was PES E9L9 for skin problems. I've letter from dermatologist saying I've recovered and en route to UPPING my PES status back to A.
              
              I'm in bad, bad financial state and a career in Civil Service or Home Team is the only options I have left in order to maintain my former income. I was offered to be "re-hired on contract basis" but this would mean a more than 40% pay cut and not ideal.
              
              IPPT, reservist is something I can handle as I'm desperate. I'm not interested in borrowing or selling my assets as this is only short-term. Job is long-term. Thanks.
              
              My worry about UP PES STATUS (E9L9 TO PES A ) is this:
              
              1) Would this mean I have to go for BMT recourse (I ORDed 10 years ago, never once reservist)
              
              2) Civil Service don't care about UP PES or not and will look at medical history in its entirety (some in HR say they ask for updated/latest PES status only, some say that they look back all the way back to day 1 and if they find out you lie during an audit = instant termination)
              
              Any bros here in HR/ Civil Service that can advise me on this? I'm sincere when I say I really need to get past MEDICAL REVIEW for Civil Service and need this to work in order to survive. Please help!!!
