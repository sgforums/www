But dont worry i am sure some sense and humility would be knocked into that dense cranium of yours in BMT. You already sound like a potential SAFOS and president scholar, hiding your "trepidation" behind big words in 1000 word essays.. Just keep working at it and good luck yah? You need lots of it</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Classicist:</div><div class="quote_body">Nah, guess you arent smart enough to read in between the lines. It was just my initial trepidation along with perhaps unintended cordiality misexpressed? I dont need a 1000 word essay to prove my sincerity, or my willingness thereof. Just some innocent, cordial reply and you take the world for it. My goodness.</div></blockquote>No, I deliberately avoided reading between the lines, and there's a point behind that.<br><br>Ask any of the fellows who've been through NS here and see if they've had problems resulting from what they say being taken literally.  When everybody is under pressure, what you say can and will be used against you by instructors and platoon mates who don't have the available resources to appreciate the nuances that consitute the substance between the lines.  Put simply, nobody's going to talk nice when they're struggling to keep their own arses covered, so you need to account for this, foresee problems and take preventative action.<br><br>In BMT, if you respond to anyone the way you responded above, you're going to find that you've just placed a huge obstacle between yourself and OCS, because this is the kind of thing that will cost you the opportunity to demonstrate your potential.  Your instructors will mark you as a loudmouth, and you will fail to get the support of your platoon mates, reflecting lack of leadership ability.<br><br>The name of the game is simple: the ones who make it control what they say, get down to the job and, whenever possible, help their mates to get the team's job done.<br><br>Make of this what you will.  If you consider your response to me to be the appropriate one when your buttons are pushed (and rest assured that they will be pushed in BMT), then I put it to you that you are working against your own ambitions.<br><br>You've asked what the environment is like.  I've given you an answer, only instead of describing my point I've chosen to demonstrate it, and you happily obliged in completing the demonstration.  Now it's entirely up to you to take the point on board and put it to good use.</div>

I may not be an officer, but I've trained officer cadets, and their usual mistake and flaw is the assumption that they are always right, and a huge case of ego that usually will manifest itself negatively when a brouhaha happens.<br><br>Lead by example, admit your mistakes and rectify them promptly.<br><br>That's all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Very fun. Hardly sign extras, all you get is naggings from OC, PCs, PS and Sect Comds.

When everybody is under pressure, what you say can and will be used against you by instructors and platoon mates who don't have the available resources to appreciate the nuances that consitute the substance between the lines.  Put simply, nobody's going to talk nice when they're struggling to keep their own arses covered, so you need to account for this, foresee problems and take preventative action.<br><br>In BMT, if you respond to anyone the way you responded above, you're going to find that you've just placed a huge obstacle between yourself and OCS, because this is the kind of thing that will cost you the opportunity to demonstrate your potential.  Your instructors will mark you as a loudmouth, and you will fail to get the support of your platoon mates, reflecting lack of leadership ability.<br><br>The name of the game is simple: the ones who make it control what they say, get down to the job and, whenever possible, help their mates to get the team's job done.<br><br>Make of this what you will.  If you consider your response to me to be the appropriate one when your buttons are pushed (and rest assured that they will be pushed in BMT), then I put it to you that you are working against your own ambitions.<br><br>You've asked what the environment is like.  I've given you an answer, only instead of describing my point I've chosen to demonstrate it, and you happily obliged in completing the demonstration.  Now it's entirely up to you to take the point on board and put it to good use.</div></blockquote>Is your phd from aussy?</div>
