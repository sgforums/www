              <p>hi. i am about to POP on this coming 9th sept tuesday and i was wondering what is the most slackiest vocation that a recruit can get for his posting.</p>
              <p>slackiest can be:</p>
              <p>very little physical training/stuff<br>MORE time ( like MP work 1 day, 1 day off)</p>
              <p>please exclude those vocations that a PES C or E recruit will get.<br><br>just want to roughly know what kind of slacky vocations do PES A/B recruits can get, no matter how low the chances of getting it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank You.</p>

              <p>you could say that i am a kengster, but at the same time, i do have some medical problems.</p>
              <p>firstly, i have only done 4km only...so im not going to be marching the 24km, neither am i going to be taking part in the Graduation Parade.</p>
              <p>reason is because i am born with a Sunken Chest.<br>in other words, im physically challenged and have smaller lungs compared to any normal average human being. i had serious chest pains on my left (where my heart is) since sec 2 till sec 4 whenever i play soccer for too long...like after 30mins...although i know thats short but probably over exert myself too much. however, i didnt went to see a doc in the past as i thought it wasn't serious. why i thought it wasn't serious? the moment i stop moving, the pain stops. but the moment i move...like just a simple slow run...the pain begins. so i had to rest and do nothing for some time.</p>
              <p>affter sec 4, i didnt faced that problem...until probably during BMT. i did had left chest aches. most of the time during physical training, whenever the chest aches begin, i stop, so that it wont worsen further to the next stage...as i fear it would.</p>
              <p>due to this reasons, i had only march 4km. the moment i go into FBO, after 5 - 15mins, my breathing becomes tighter and uneasy. if its SBO, im fine.</p>
              <p>meanwhile, i am still waiting for a call from MO, to tell me when is my appointment date with a lung specialist. its been 2 weeks already and they ought to have arranged an appointment by then.</p>
              <p>my situation now is, i dun have any solid black and white papers to say i am unfit for this and that....as because the doctors do not know what i have been through and my experiences with my sunken chest but only know that my sunken chest  is "normal" for me. Thats all.</p>
              <p>i was hoping to get a MP interview but my name was not called. and i also heard that for those who didnt tick YES for command school will  have a high chance of posting to GUARDS, which i have heard that its the 2nd most siong compared to commandos physical training.</p>
              <p>if i am already struggling in BMT and just got a PASS, how can i go for something 2 or 3 or 5 times more siong for physical training?</p>

              <p>Hmm.. then this is not keng-ing already.. Yea.. loki_chaos is right.. Why didn't you sound out during your pre-enlistment check up?</p>
              <p>I suggest.. That you should start being honest and tell your PS, or directly tell your PC "Sir, I would like to request for a interview with you". Let this be official, let him write down in your interview booklet. This is your first step to getting a black&amp; white for your condition. After that, whoever that asks you to go to medical centre for check ups, just go, absolutely don't worry about anything else. Coz' your health comes first before any sneering from the people around you.</p>

              <p>i guess its because it slipped my mind and didnt took NS seriously back then...as i did ask a lot of ppl how is NS life and from their words, i didnt think NS would be this physically TOUGH! i do know NS is something serious...but never had i thought once that it is so so....physical....before i went for BMT.</p>
              <p>furthermore, i was afraid of a scenario where they would think i am lying when they put me through some machine tests. and its a chargeable offense to lie...am i right? not sure about all the rules yet.</p>
              <p>thank you <strong>loki_chaos </strong>and <strong>superlibra</strong>.<br>you gave my mind some stress relief.</p>
              <p>My Platoon Sergeant and Platoon Commander knows about my condition. so does the MO. My platoon Commander did wrote quite a lot of things in my interview booklet...as i was sharing with him my Personal Experience with Sunken Chest. I am asthmatic due to this reason as well. how serious? well...ranking the factors that would cause me to have a high chance of an asthma attack: <br><br>1. Smoke (from cigarettes)<br>2. Dust/Sand<br>3. Cold (Low temp)</p>
              <p>during primary school times, i would have asthma at least once a year.
              but now it has been once every 2 years. you could say my chest and
              lungs are growing bigger, but i doubt its enough for such strenous
              physical training. i am able to support myself, that is my own weight
              during training, but with additional weight...that will be a problem.</p>
              <p>This coming monday, which is tomorrow, i will be contacting the MO regarding my appointment. hmm...if what superlibra suggested can help in my case, i will contact the moderator for advise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>once again...thank you <strong>loki_chaos</strong> and <strong>superlibra</strong></p>
