              <p>Well, since this report is from the Straits Time, you'll have to wonder how accurate it really is.</p>
              <p>I thought the SAF had always been giving leeways to requests more serious than this? Requesting to eat special types of food and keeping his hair long seemed like a comparatively simple request when you compare it to people whose religion forbids them from picking up arms and being allowed to be posted to the SCDF instead.</p>
              <p>Why can't the private here be allowed to eat his own food when the muslims are allowed to have their Halal food, and some other religion allowed to have Vegetarian meals?</p>
              <p>Being allowed to keep his hair long seemed like a pretty simple request in my opinion. The 'Today' newspaper mentioned that Skihs were allowed to keep their long hair because it's always been so since the colonial times, and no further leeways can be given to other people. Some Hindus were also given permission not to shave during certain periods of the year due to their prayers. So what is this? Special privileges granted to a group of people while denied to another group?</p>
              <p>How can the SAF force it's soldiers to go against their basic religious requirement when if handled properly, such simple requirements will cause minimum disruption to their service?</p>
              <p>Just my opinion here. Seeking to clarify some things, and not going against the SAF or what.</p>

              <p><br>I think that are the few reasons why his religion case is not strongly backed...</p>
              <p>Of cos , when comes to religion issue. SAF always is sensitive abt it. But unless it comes from such high establishment. Most probably , SAF will hack care abt it.</p>

              <p>Mindef wasn't 'forced' to release a statement because of the internet, don't be naive.</p>
              <p>The malingerer's father tried to stir shit with high-ups, including emailing the president and PM, the father himself said so in the Asiaone forum.</p>
              <p>Mindef's response to him: too bad. The statement released to the press is to tell everyone including the malingerer: too bad. And also to say it won. Don't want to serve, can .. just fuck off and make sure you don't come back also (ala Melvin Tan the pianist).  How you can evade seeing the crystal clear fact that this story is reporting on the guy backing down is amazing to me.</p>
