              dream is to make it for OCS. </p>
              <p>Computer thingy at BMTC i did the best I could. I'm a dipolma
              holder with good GPA I would say. Going to NTU. Got Gold for my
              Napfa. </p>
              <p>However after browsing thru the forum for some time i realise
              the intake to ocs would be a problem for me. so I would like to ask
              if I could still make it to ocs? </p>
              <p>oh btw, do i need to extend my service if i go ocs? think i saw
              it some where?</p>
              <p>Do note that i will need to disrupt my Ns for Uni. oh and I have
              mild colour blindness.</p>

              <p>Hi AnswerMeSuccess,</p>
              <p>Agree with tarutaru, nothing is for sure. A good GPA and an university placement does not make you a confirmed candidate for OCS. The selection criteria for OCS has a lot more factors than you think. But generally if you are a true good leader, you will be able to display and perform well in most of the activities and get a relatively good result. </p>
              <p>Every Leadership batch in Tekong will have intake for OCS. You won't have the need to extend service if you follow your own intake cycle, ie, you don't OOC and join the next course or whatsoever. </p>
              <p>Disrupting for uni and mild colour blindness won't affect your selection for OCS in Tekong one. </p>
              <p>Regards.</p>
