              <p>Question: Why did you not call them up after a few months or so?</p>
              <p>Constant nagging actually does help to get internal processing work done. Just because they didn't call you back doesn't mean you are not eligible.Â </p>

              <h3>Service Injuries</h3>
              <p>When an NSman sustains an injury due to an authorised activity
              sanctioned by the Unit Commanding Officer during his In-Camp
              Training (ICT), he is required to report the incident immediately
              to his Unit S1/Manpower Officer and Unit Medical Officer (MO), so
              that his unit can assist him in the filing of his injury report and
              to provide him with the required treatment for his injury.</p>
              <p>NSman is to provide the following, should he wish to submit his
              bills incurred for the treatment of his service injury:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Original tax invoice/receipt</li>
              <li>Certification from hospital/doctor that the bill incurred is
              for the treatment of his service injury</li>
              <li>Statement from CPF Board for amounts deducted from Medisave
              account (if any)</li>
              <li>Statement from insurance company on the amount deducted from
              policy plan for the treatment of his service injury (if any)</li>
              </ul>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div><br>
              <h3>Service Injury (SI) Card</h3>
              <p>Upon the approval of his injury as attributable to service, the
              NSman may be issued with an SI card, if it is certified by his
              attending doctor that he would require long-term medical treatment
              for his service injury. This SI card will provide him with fully
              subsidised medical benefits at government/restructured hospitals
              and polyclinics at his eligible ward for as long as he requires
              it.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div>
              <h3>Medical Reimbursement</h3>
              <p>If NSman has incurred medical fees at government/restructured
              hospitals and polyclinics for the treatment of his service injury
              prior to the approval, he is to retain all original receipts,
              certification from the doctor that the treatment is for his service
              injury and other supporting documents to his payment of medical
              fees. He may submit these documents to MINDEF/SAF Human Resource
              Shared Services Centre (HRSSC) upon the approval of his service
              injury for medical reimbursement. Do note that only medical fees
              incurred at government/restructured hospitals and polyclinics are
              reimbursable by MINDEF and he is to seek referral from doctors at
              polyclinic, hospital's A&amp;E or his Unit MO for treatments at
              government/restructured hospitals.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div>
              <h3>Ex-gratia Payment</h3>
              <p>If the NSman remains on continuous medical leave upon his ICT
              due to his service injury, he may be eligible for ex-gratia payment
              if it is certified by his employer that he is not receiving any
              salary for the period of his medical leave for his service injury.
              He is to provide a letter from his employer to inform MINDEF of
              this and the amount that is to be reimbursed, together with
              supporting documents.</p>
              <p>This ex-gratia payment, which is meant to compensate NSman's
              loss of income during the period of medical leave, will be paid in
              a stepdown approach based on his civilian pay or an equivalent pay
              of a regular serviceman, whichever higher. The ex-gratia payment
              will cease upon the termination of his medical leave or the award
              of his disability compensation, whichever earlier.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div>
              <h3>Lump Sum Disability Compensation</h3>
              <p>If it is certified by his attending Specialist that his service
              injury has stabilised, the NSman is to inform his unit to request
              for him to be reviewed by his Unit MO. He will be required to
              complete an authorisation form to allow MINDEF to obtain a
              Disability Assessment Report (DAR) from his attending Specialist on
              his service injury. The hospital will take about 3 to 4 months to
              revert with the DAR. Upon the receipt of the DAR with no further
              query, he will be scheduled to attend a PD Board by Military
              Medicine Institute (MMI) for the endorsement of the PD that has
              been assessed by his attending Specialist for him to have suffered
              as a result of his service injury. Upon the endorsement and
              approval of his PD Board Outcome, MINDEF/SAF HRSC will then be able
              to process his disability compensation. He will be informed of the
              award of his lump sum disability compensation subsequently.</p>

              <p>Question where did you do your Percentage disability ?Â Your unitÂ must setup an army review medicial board - which will recommend the percentage disability. If that is done, the next step is they would arrange the insurance side to make do a review , right after that they will inform you the disability payment.</p>
              <p>It does not matter whether you are working or not. The SAF - buy insurance based on your whole body. Thus based on your % of disability - they will calculate based on that percentage.</p>

              <p>Your unit is suppose toÂ bookedÂ a medicial review board for you right after that - where will review and recommend downgrading and also PH - usually the insurance side willÂ recommend a lower % disability recommendation :) .Â  If all goes well a few month see cheque send to you.</p>

              <p>it is not that the case is serious, or not. it is the administration and workingÂ attitude of the clerks. noted that filing a claim has no date due. so the paper will be most like left on the table. the more important things such as going lunch, life program, book out, comes in as higher priorities. who care about you? if you dont make noise, shoot the cases all the way to mindef? Nobody will bother. Who cares? Some1 will take over the work when the clerk ORD. They will eventually clear the work, but it will take years.</p>
              <p>It is very impt to have a backup copy as they might lost in.Â </p>
              <p>Hopefully this will enlighten some1. Â Welcome to the REAL world!</p>
