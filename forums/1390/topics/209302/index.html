            <div class='col-md body'>There is no point of the NEA to do routine checks of mosquitoes around S'pore housing estates, because all of them are bred in SAF outfield trainig grounds. If you ever enter the thick vegetations in outfield training, every square foot you can find mosquitoes. Actually there's no sandfly in these areas, and soldiers often thought that when their skin itch but hearing no buzzing sound, it must be sandflies. Wrong. Just on a lamp and you can see those 'wild' mosquitoes biting through your uniforms at night.<br><br>There are 3 types of mozzies in outfield:<br><br>1. Black with white stripes. Their bites will heal pretty fast, within 6 hours.<br><br>2. All black. Their bites are slightly longer to heal, about 1 to 2 days, and will be gone. Not a problem.<br><br>3. Brown to black brown slim 'silent flying' type. This is the famous 'commando mozzies' which cause the 'boxing gloves' effect. They are not as noisy but they are wild and extremely savage. They don't hover around but sting instantly the moment they sense heat of blood flow on your skin, like a bee. Bite takes about a week to heal completely. Few people know that they are the cause of fever during outfields. Thier bites are mistaken for sandflies. Anyway, they are huge and slim and not as noisy as other types.<br><br>In some areas there're so much mozzies at night that you can find a swarm of 20 hovering around you. Take a look at the ponds and streams nearby and you find larva-infested water. All soldiers can swear that mosquitoes come from the forest, that is, if they're smart enough to realise it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh com'on, this mosquito problem only surface of recent or what?? it has been around and will be around as long as Singapore is in the tropical region. Forested area of course will have mosquito lah, together with the insects, plants and trees. You want NEA to conduct checks in the forests?!? what a joke!<br><br>i dunno. seems like dengue mosquitos are only apparent in built-up area. i don't remember anyone getting dengue from my NS stint during the late 90s. there were exercises held in forested areas, as usual, everyone will kenna bitten by mosquito. but none got dengue.<br></div>
