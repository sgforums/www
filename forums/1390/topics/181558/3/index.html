On Feb 28 at midnight, I saw a huge group of recruits marching along the pedestrian walkway in the park. They were singing and chanting loudly.<br><br>I was rudely awakened at 3.30am when the recruits marched past the stretch of park near my block. Little did I expect that I would be awakened again at 5.30am and 6am by the recruits singing at the top of their voice!<br><br>While I appreciate the need to build up the recruits' stamina through road marches, such training should not be carried out at the expense of the residents' sleep. Ideally, army training near residential areas should be done before midnight. If it has to take place after midnight, the noise should be kept to a minimum.<br></span></blockquote></strong><br><br>slp slp slp... onli noe hw 2 slp... tell her go route march la.. den try wakin other ppl up....</div>
