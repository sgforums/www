Sure, it boosts morale, etc, but noone is going to die for want of a song. On balance, the inconvenience to hundreds of residents would clearly outweigh the inconvenience done to the marching soldiers. After all, they can sing on other legs of the march. They could also march elsewhere, away from residential areas. Woe be to the one who tells me there is no where else to march. That is utter and complete bollocks.<br><br>I also do not think the apology is dumb. Why -not- apologise? I was under the impression that you apologise not only when you've done wrong, but also when you've inconvenienced someone; it is only polite.

The loooooong road on the boundaries of Changi airport, though not very hilly, is also ideal. The entire Lim Chu kang area is good for marching as well. Another place would be the mandai area. The officers could always indent vehicles to transport the soldiers.Not difficult at all. As you can see, there are plenty of training areas for soldiers to march in. At these places, you can scream however loud and however long you want, no one is going to complain. I have been woken quite a few times whilst at SISPEC by people on route marches. But I have never really complained because tekong is a training area.<br><br>There is a time and place for everything. Now, if you are going to march in Public, then you must be expected to act within the boundaries of common decency and in accordance with the principles of neighbourliness.<br><br>I dun get the point about vulgarities though. Whether or not a soldier is vulgar has no bearing on his operational capability.</div>

The recruit just came in from being civilians and it is already a culture shock so bmt should not be excessive tough.(but i can assure you that when they are in combat unit and already more suited to the combat lifestyle,we do long flanking walk in jungle terrain) ECP maybe suitable for leisurely walk but it is certainly not leisurely when you are loaded with Full Combat Order of about 20+kg.<br><br>And as per what the above forumer posted,route marches are not an everyday event,heck it not even a monthly event.More like once in 3 months for this ECP route march.So such infreqency can even disturb civilians everyday until they can't perform?What next? Ambulance siren should not be there cos an once in a while emergency happen and the siren is raised,aircraft should be mindful of their noise level (being that ECP is near to the airport).Every infrequent and random event should be complained upon to satisfy such a resident.Hello we live in a real world,there cannot be perfection so you will have to try and conform to these inperfection instead of complaining about everything.<br><br>Yeah vulgarities.True that it is certainly not good in a civilise world.But NS is a different world from the normally civilised outside(we are call soldiers inside not civilians).And if you even bother to think about it,it is neccessary to mentally train up the guys.If you fight in a real war and is capture or something,do you think that the enemy will talk to you in a nice manner.If our men cannot even tolerate normal verbal vulgarities thrown at them during peace time,what makes you think they can withstand vulgarities couple with a beating up throw at them by the enemy.They will break down easily and what ? cry infront of their capturers and giving all sorta info out?Do you really want such a Kuniang army to protect your ass? This shows that you completed do not understand anything about the Army and should not even have attempted to come comment on this.<br><br>You are just the typical singaporean , too well protected from the harsh reality of life that you think some random infrequent disturbances should be an acted upon to complain and whine about.</div>

What is wrong with complaining in this instance? You say one night of disrupted sleep should be tolerated. But if there wasn't a complaint, would there be a 2nd, 3rd and 4th time? In fact, in my experience, once a route had been checked out, and planned for, commanders usually prefer to reuse that route in future because then they do not have to recce the route, look for the best route to the hospital, water points, potential danger areas, etc, etc. Chances are that had there not been a complaint, the route would be used again, and again and again.<br><br>I suspect alot of the animosity here is due to the perception that the soldiers invovled may very well be punished.

She was inconvenienced, she acted on it to try and prevent it from ever happening again. She did not say "punish those soldiers". Neither did she say "Ban those soldiers from using ECP".

At the most, maybe my CO/S3 got a bit of flak from the higher brass for that, but no one else got penalised for that incident.<br><br>Also, your point about reusing routes makes sense, but I'm afraid that unless there's some severe safety concerns/incidents, the SAF would most probably continue to use ECP from time to time as a route march training area. At most the marching troops would be told to silent march.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway singing boost the morale of the soldier. Btw I'm sure they'll pass the place quite quickly at most 15 min . U only did not get to sleep for 15min those in route match did not get to sleep the whole night. Why not let it be? Complained to much for what. Also whenever there's a route march going on, I'm sure there is a ambulance on stand-by....if the route match take place in some ulu places  u know how long does it take to evacuate.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone,<br><br>I'm new to this forum. I heard about this "Army Boys singing" matter from my friends and would like to add something to the discussion.<br><br>During my time in NS (in the 90s), we used to march in Tekong and Lim Chu Kang areas and was quite interested to know SAF also conducted marches near residential areas.<br><br>I still remember we were repeatedly warned not to disturb the public and keep a low profile whenever we were out of the camp area either booking out or for exercises. I remembered one guy from my unit who kena extra duties for travelling on the MRT in full uniform and not giving up his seat for a pregnant lady in the same cabin. Thus I am very surprised to know that nowadays there is even singing during marches in the middle of the night and near residential areas.<br><br>May be i belonged to another generation and the SAF is now being called a 3rd generation army, but i still feel that it is not appropriate to sing loudly during marching especially near residential areas which might disturb the public.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think the public must give and take a bit if not thankful we got a bunch of ppl who do not want to be there anyway carrying heavy load &amp; rifle while taking a measly amount of money every month doing an important job for our country. if a civilian's sleep is more important then conditioning our men for combat then our country have no chance in war.</div>
