On Feb 28 at midnight, I saw a huge group of recruits marching along the pedestrian walkway in the park. They were singing and chanting loudly.<br><br>I was rudely awakened at 3.30am when the recruits marched past the stretch of park near my block. Little did I expect that I would be awakened again at 5.30am and 6am by the recruits singing at the top of their voice!<br><br>While I appreciate the need to build up the recruits' stamina through road marches, such training should not be carried out at the expense of the residents' sleep. Ideally, army training near residential areas should be done before midnight. If it has to take place after midnight, the noise should be kept to a minimum.<br></span></div></blockquote>what an irony..on march 7th at 2100, 1GDS recruits began their 24km route march in battallion lvl..guess this resident would be rudely awakened 3times again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I live in Marine Parade as well... just 400m from the MacDonald's at ECP. and I can also sometimes hear the RECs singing as they do their route marches at ECP. I remember once getting woken up at 3am by their singing... but I ain't gonna KPKB about it. I guess a lot has to do with the fact that I've completed my 2 1/2 years of it already.<br><br>I suppose the complainant either hasn't done NS before, or doesn't have a son who has done it.  It seems that he thinks that his beauty sleep takes precedence over the recruits. Well, it is precisely because of those recruits that he gets to sleep in a nice comfortable bed at night instead of in a concentration camp run by some heartless b*stards.<br><br>With complainants like these, how can you not fault NSFs for feeling that they're not being appreciated? Their girlfriends leave them for 'not spending enough time' with them. People in public shun them for the stench of their No.4s. And now, residents complain about them for trying to build up cameraderie and spirit by singing.<br><br>They are sacrificing 2 years of their lives at the risk of life and limb. People have died doing NS, and countless others have gotten injured. At least appreciate them for the fact that if they're not there, you won't have the luxury of complaining without getting an enemy bayonet in the gut.</div>

There will forever be ingrates out there who cannot seem to recognize that. Just remember that for every ingrate, there will be others who do indeed appreciate what you are doing. Just because they do something wrong doesn't mean that you can't do something right.<br><br>Fight ungratefulness with dedication and devotion to your tasks at hand. In the end, it will be you who benefits, not them.<br><br>Besides, not all girls are the type who dump their boyfriends once they enter NS. While I've heard of many cases of girls cheating on and dumping their guys, I also know of many other cases of girls who stick to their men through thick and thin, no matter what.</div>
