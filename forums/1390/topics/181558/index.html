On Feb 28 at midnight, I saw a huge group of recruits marching along the pedestrian walkway in the park. They were singing and chanting loudly.<br><br>I was rudely awakened at 3.30am when the recruits marched past the stretch of park near my block. Little did I expect that I would be awakened again at 5.30am and 6am by the recruits singing at the top of their voice!<br><br>While I appreciate the need to build up the recruits' stamina through road marches, such training should not be carried out at the expense of the residents' sleep. Ideally, army training near residential areas should be done before midnight. If it has to take place after midnight, the noise should be kept to a minimum.<br></span></div>

(btw if most of the march is done at night so that the lung training has to be done then too, then we have to question the training schedule dont we??)<br><br>fatigue wise maybe bah, but then again from personal experience i feel its useless. and maybe they should consider it as an extra conditioning to do it without the singing.<br><br>afterall while training is important, they should consider others too, especially when small adjustments can be done to convenience other with no expense.<br><br>on the other hand i really have to wonder why need to march in residential areas at night. i'm guessing there are other places like tekong or other islands or those army training grounds, but i wont stake anything on this though<br><br>edit: out of topic but just wondering. does it ever chafe you guys that you are made to do "stupid" things in the army and no reasons are given? i mean if some one had actually told me that the stupid singing was to increase stamina maybe i won't have felt it was so stupid and maybe joined in more eagerly.</div>

Much more effective than singing.<br><br>Just to add that singing does have its purpose. Every morning at about 8am you will hear many people singing in Army camps. The purpose? To let the Div/Bde Com know that they are working la! Otherwise the go training no one know what is the point! Also explains why ppl like to run at 0730 to 0830. Otherwise no one know they are training. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Aveme:</div><div class="quote_body">well when you sing,it will tax your lung power,so actually at first it will make those singing to have problem regulating their breathing but the lung now know its is not powerful enough and will try to build itself up to try catching up with the increase demands of it,just like if you do body building,the muscle will try to build itself up from heavier and heavier demands of working out.So it is actually to make you work to your max instead of not working hard enough.<br><br>True they can do this another way by making the trainees walk or run faster so that their breathing is more ragged,but well they will also involve way more muscular demand and lead to muscular fatigue way faster than is ideal for a long march.</div></blockquote>If you want to train their hearts, to train their body to handle oxygen deprivation, then I suggest that short sharp busrts of speed, followed by periods of rest is the way to go (interval trg). Professional sprtsmen do that, why not the army? Singing does not really tax their lungs and there is no real way of monitoring who is not actually singing. Again, If you can sing, you are not training anything other than singing.<br><br>So whatever advantages to be gained by singing, can be gained through other more effective and proven methods.<br><br>To move on with why NOT singing - Singing on route marches is not training as you fight. I have been involved in a brigade exercise and a couple of battalion exercises before, and as far as I know, when marching to attack the objective, nobody advertises their presence by singing. In fact, during those marches, stealth is the key. That is why we are told to tape down everything, not to use torches, not to talk, not to mark routes too obviously and to avoid attacking in broad day light.<br><br>Singing helps lift morale. mmm...Maybe or probably. But you do not have that luxury when on exercise or on Ops so why not learn to live w/o that luxury?<br><br>Singing builds camaraderie - Yes, I agree. Then make them sing when marching to the cook house or something.</div>
