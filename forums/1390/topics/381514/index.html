              <p>I'm not sure if I saw an old topic on the same issue, but since we're on this whole '3G SAF' concept nowadays, I think it would be high time to restore the traditional naval ranks like Commander, Lieutenant-Commander and Ensign back to our own Navy.</p>
              <p>Note that I used 'restored' instead of 'changed' because Singapore used to have these ranks before tri-service standardisation.</p>
              <p>I mean, the current system is as though our Navy is subordinate to the Army. It is only us and Indonesia which pegs their naval rank system to that of the Army. The current system, in my opinion, is not good practice.</p>
              <p>It makes things complicated for international relations. When most navies with a very minute minority have traditional ranking, it makes it confusing during exercises. An RSN Captain would be a Lieutenant in the RN, RAN, RNZN or even the USN for that matter. An RSN Colonel would be a Captain in every other Navy.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, restoration of the traditional naval rank titles would give our Navy its own distinct identity that they should be proud of. What should be realised is that the cultures of the Army and Navy are different, and they should be treated as such. The Navy is not the Army. It has its own professional traditions which must be respected and not sacrificed for the sake of standardising all three services. Blending them like what is being done with the current rank system is not giving much thought to the hundreds of years of naval tradition that the world's nations have been brought to respect. It is not a matter of 'copying ang moh navies' when Malaysia and India are using them. We also cannot give the excuse that it would be confusing when every other country in the world (except Indonesia, again) can differentiate Petty Officers from Sergeants and Captains from Colonels without difficulty.</p>
              <p>Maybe one day there will be change. Any views on this matter? Would you agree or disagree that our Navy's ranks need reform?</p>

              <p>Since the system has been this way for some time, actually changing it would make things messier for SAF since there is often alot of interactions between the 3 service and changing the ranks might cause more confusion without our own armed forces.</p>
              <p>External navies that works with Singapore should already be used to our ranking system already and should not be too much of a problem for them.</p>
              <p>SAF usually has the policy that if something is not broken, there is no major reason to revamp things to cause confusion among the people</p>
              <p>However i would say regardless how the ranks are called, they are meaningless to me so i am not really bothered nor concern about that.</p>

The issue here is about adhering to time-honoured tradition. The Naval Service is unique, and in my opinion, should be recognised as so.

              <p>I personally prefer the Navy to adopt naval ranks as well. They have a maritime feel to it.</p>
              <p>However, I can see why there are rank commonalities. It might be the result of wanting to maintain ease of command in joint operations, it helps when people don't have to translate different ranks into their equivalents when working with people of a different Service.</p>

              <p>However, I can see why there are rank commonalities. It might be
              the result of wanting to maintain ease of command in joint
              operations, it helps when people don't have to translate different
              ranks into their equivalents when working with people of a
              different Service.</p>

              <p>Definitely. It would be confusing for non naval officers at Joint level.</p>

              <p>Perhaps it might be confusing initially, but when every other navy in the world can get by and function well with traditional rankings, I don't see why we cannot do so as well. I understand where the argument about tri-service confusion is coming from, but this should this understanding be allowed to erode tradition for purely practical reasons? Tradition is at the heart of any armed Service. Since every other navy can get by, is the current policy being overly pragmatic?</p>
              <p>What do you guys think?</p>

              <p><br>The hiearchy still stays no matter how you see it.</p>
              <p>The only officers who got their hands dirty with the specs were the attached ones. Typically its because they had just graduated from OCS and they just can't stand back and watch people seat. Things change when they become part of the estab crew. Understandably its partly because they act as supervisors.</p>
              <p>Neither do they participate in the funny shit that happens in the bunks of the specs.</p>

              <p><br>I don't think it is a matter of Officer vs other ranks. It is perharps more of a evolving nature it take into consideration with scope and the size of the fleet too....</p>
              <p>RSN has assumed Task force Command in the gulf and will be for somalia coast next year. You are now bringing scope and responsibilities of more than just your own ship. But also foreign shorelines and foreign ships and Helio.</p>
              <p>It is something to think about what kind of acquired knowledge and skill for a combine arm "Commander"  before you put him/her up there with the same Rank....</p>
