              <p>I'll answer your questions:</p>
              <p><strong><span>By the way.. I really wish to know.. Are
                                      there draft dodgers in Singapore? Maybe some unscrupulous Singaporean boys
                                      cross the border between Singapore and Malaysia in order to avoid
                                      military service?</span></strong></p>
              <p>This is something few Singaporeans understand. In Singapore, you are not allowed to renounce your citizenship between age 11 and National Service. To study abroad beyond age of 16, you must post a security deposit of $70,000 and if you do not return, you will be convicted when you do. If you are already abroad, you cannot be stopped from renouncing your citizenship any time you want.</p>
              <p>You can and MUST renounce your citizenship before becoming a soldier, otherwise your duty remains and you will be convicted for not serving it. There was a stupid idiot who lived in Malaysia for 20 years and was jailed. He said he was not aware of his duty. The penalty for draft dodging varies.</p>
              <p>We have a famous draft dodger, Melvyn Tan. There was a controversy over his treatment when he returned to Singapore and our long-serving defence minister explained to the public:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the default period exceeds two years but the defaulter is 
              young enough to serve his full-time and operationally ready NS duties in
               full, MINDEF will press for a short jail sentence.</li>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot serve his 
              full-time NS in a combat vocation or fulfil his operationally ready NS 
              obligations in full, a longer jail sentence to reflect the period of NS 
              he has evaded may be appropriate.</li>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot be called up 
              for NS at all, a jail sentence up to the maximum of three years may be 
              appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Unfortunately, Melvyn was to serve around 1974 and returned in 2005. He was fined about $3000 and not jailed.</p>
              <p>Some believe the government is eager to boost the local arts scene and forgive a famous and successful pianist, or that Melvyn is well-connected. It is an insult to the honour of our NS Men that Melvyn performed a piano recital at a ceremony marking 45 years of National Service.</p>
              <p>http://kementah.blogspot.com/2011/12/45-years-of-national-service-ns.html</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There was also controversy over our President's son. He deferred National Service 11-12 years to study a PhD in the US. When he returned, he served a comfortable job as a non-uniformed "defence scientist" which may or may not have benefitted his career.</p>
              <p>For every other soldier, you cannot defer NS more than 2 years to complete secondary education and cannot defer at all to attend university.</p>

              <p><strong><span>You know.. His Excellency Prime Minister
                                      Lee served in the SAF longer than 20 years.. Even though
                                      he is His Excellency former Prime Minister Lee’s
                                      son.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Lee joined the Singapore Armed Forces in 1971 (age 19) and rose quickly through the ranks in the Army, becoming the youngest Brigadier-General in Singapore's history after his promotion in July 1983. Lee left the military in 1984 in order to enter politics.</p>

              <p>Americans are 99% concerned about the economy at this time and they know they have a comfortable lead in military power. President Obama picked as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs an Army general known to be budget conscious, and the Army alone is expected to shrink by about 10% soon.

The saying is that no human body is perfect and you just have to find the problems. This grants excuse from fitness tests that must be taken until about age 40. While serving they have to be assigned as clerks, storemen, drivers etc. How many of Korean soldiers serve in these easier jobs?</p>

              <p>Yes I see Koreans mock slap the faces of their subordinates on TV. The subordinate gets away with a huge chiding only if she's female.</p>
              <p>We probably have the 2% excused from service and maybe 20% in the administrative side of the army, driving vehicles, working as storemen. Another 5% are in the strictest medical condition who still serve, handling nothing but paper at the headquarters, sometimes not in uniform.</p>
              <p>An ordinary family can afford to spend a few thousand dollars in medical fees investigating that ache and pain somewhere in the body. He will enter the 20%. A rich family can spend more money and be more creative, they enter the 5%. Of coure there are honest medical cases as well.</p>
              <p>We don't have alternative non-military service at all. Those who refuse to bear arms for religious reasons (eg Jehovah's Witnesses) are jailed for 3 years. Jehovah's Witnesses are an intellectually successful community here, so the government is reluctant to punish them too much.</p>
              <p>However, many of our minorities serve in the Police or Civil Defence forces, instead of the Army. Within the Army, they are seen more often in some units and less often in others.</p>

                   very tricky business. We've got to know his background... I'm saying

              <p>I really think you have too sweet a view of Singapore. Perhaps have not spent a reasonable length of time here, or are a member of our Korean expatriate community and generally insulated from the problems of average Singaporeans. It is not all fun and games here.</p>
              <p>I have noticed the Korean community here has very positive views of Singapore. They've told me they feel Singapore is an intelligent nation because the senority system is not practiced here, and English allows us to engage other cultures. To them, the experience is truly liberating.</p>
              <p>I would say this view is too extreme. Korean expatriates tend to mix with the upper crust of our society here. If they were to socialize more widely, they would not find many people like me who know so much about your country or any others. (Look at the three posts below my post.)</p>
              <p>You might know the Korean government makes a show of wanting the US to leave Korea, but is actually reluctant to take over. Any country would want the overwhelming power of the US on its side, what more tens of thousands of US troops to guarantee US promises. Consider this: your ROK military is technologically advanced but has refused to take on advanced capabilities such as Apache attack helicopters and MRLS beyond token numbers. The US provides the bulk of these expensive weapons, Korea does not have to pay. Of late, why has your Navy received the most high-tech goodies? Because the standing US naval commitment is extremely modest, not a single ship is permanently there and Korea must defend itself at sea. What has done more to reduce troop numbers in Korea from 37,000 to 30,000 and now to 23,000: Korean opposition or US commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan and the economic crisis? And why has the takeover of Combined Forces Command been delayed yet again?</p>
              <p>We in Singapore continue to court US presence through our air and naval bases, only the sensibilities of our neighbours prevent this from happening.</p>
              <p>Last week, our former Deputy Prime Minister and founding PAP member Toh Chin Chye died, aged 91. He is mourned by Singaporeans and remembered as more caring and humane than someone else, who did not command respect by fear. He also served a shorter time than many of our ministers in office today, and was a critic of our government after leaving politics in the 1990s. One wonders why he left office or if anyone made him leave. It might be wise to accord some credit to men like this, and not all to Lee Kuan Yew who never apologizes for his mistakes and seems to insult his subjects whenever he speaks.</p>
              <p>Perhaps the grass is always greener on the other side wherever one may be. You might like to live in Singapore just as I would like to leave for another country. I would personally do so even if I do not benefit materially. I consider it more important to have a richer journey in life.</p>

              <p>Those who are liable to serve national service but refuse are
              charged under the Enlistment Act. If convicted, they face three
              years' imprisonment and a fine of S$10,000.</p>
              <p>Controversy arose when the penalties were increased in January

              <p> </p>
              <ul>

              young enough to serve his full-time and operationally ready NS
              duties in full, MINDEF will press for a short jail sentence.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot serve his
              full-time NS in a combat vocation or fulfil his operationally ready
              NS obligations in full, a longer jail sentence to reflect the
              period of NS he has evaded may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot be called
              up for NS at all, a jail sentence up to the maximum of three years
              may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Each year, a small number of people are convicted for their
              failure to enlist or refusal to be conscripted. Most of them were

              they are usually held in a low-security detention facility and
              separated from other conscription offenders. The government does

              <p>Hi, Mr Daeho0228 again, as request if you want to understand more about our founding father whom I believed you know who I am refering to without any bias, I suggested that you read up on "interesting" event that is related to our Singapore 3nd President Devan Nair. After that whether the whole incident is an fact or fiction on why our President Devan Nair resigned, you decided and be the judge cos I am not saying anything negative or positive "fairy tale" in Singapore. But personally I can only said in "courtesy" way that part of singapore success is build on "Machiavellian" philosophy.</p>
              <p>And as the the answer to your thread question, you might be interested to read this acticle what an top school NS man in Singapore done when he is serving his NS term : <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_690146.html">http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_690146.html</a> anyway this incident is just an minority because as mention those singaporean who choose to sign on are either due to "good" salary or is because of Scholarship opportunity to study in university offered by SAF which they have to serve 6 years.Other than that most singaporean don't see the reason why they must get into trouble with the law. In fact there is an indirect saying that for Singapore Armed people, just a wind blow they will be "blow" away. Unless you are charged with serious offence like the above news link, the top brass/rank would only just raise their voice instead of using violence against their junior. And thank for your answers. <img id="yui_3_2_0_15_132879487082550" src="http://mail.yimg.com/ok/u/assets/img/emoticons/emo14.gif" alt="B-) cool"></p>
