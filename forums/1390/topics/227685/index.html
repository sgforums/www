            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, are u sure u can confirm + chop and guarantee u are getting a spot in OCS in the first place? Ignoring PES status, Till now, the only confirm way I know is<br>1.) U are a scholar<br>2.) U are white horse<br><br>If not, boils further down: Are u eligible?<br>1.) Poly grad?<br>2.) A level grad?<br>If u are not any of the above, u already can kiss ur OCS dream goodbye.<br><br>Next. If u are eligible, we come down to selection criteria, till now, I still have no idea how they choose ppl for OCS. Seen cases where ppl show leadership, did well in their sit test but still end up as combat medics,etc and ppl who zhuo bo lan, sabo king can end up in OCS. So really dun know how the heck they choose.<br><br>So how confident u are confirm getting a place inc OCS?<br><br>Second, taking PES into consideration. U willing to risk ur medical condition just for a spot in OCS? Even such that it may cost u ur life? Ur career? Ur future?<br>Sure, u can tahan now but what about in the future? 10 years? 20 years?<br><br>Dude, there is nothing wrong in striving for being the best BUT not at the expense of your health.<br><br>Coming back to ur questions<br>1.) Yes, chances are they will notice, everything computerized liao.<br>2.) Yes, he will care, he goes by the book one. (Not kidding, really, every MO got a book to follow one)<br>3.) Depends.<br>4.) Maybe, or the MO will send u down to SAF's OWN specialist for examination.<br>Because SAF MO dun really trust outside doctors recommendations.<br>5.) Maybe.<br>6.) Not really. If u are trying to keng downgrade then maybe the MO will do something.<br><br>In short, although I dun really like SAF MO, they do have a set of rules that they must follow. First, they cannot suka suka downgrade a person. Similar, they cannot suka suka upgrade a person also. To get a upgrade from a downgrade, ususally involves Medical review and examination. The reasons for these are checks, just in case for chao keng ppl aiming for downgrade or injured gung ho ppl who are trying to get upgrade.<br><br></div>
