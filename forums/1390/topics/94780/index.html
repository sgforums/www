            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the update. Too bad about the by-the-rulebook; my CO would've given chance for 1st-time skippers during my time - post-scolding, of course.

            <div class='col-md body'>No la.....it can still be covered up........only thing is much harder than last time and still very risky because now the records are all centralised. A little power has been taken away from the NS Units, in exchange for easier monitoring. (Frankly i dun find it easier......bullshit birthday window system, but without the centralisation, monitoring would be near impossible, especially when u have so many NSmen to handle........)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Btw anyone here know anything about this<br><br>During ICT IPPT, if u fall out after the static stations cos u have failed one or more part and opt to fall out for the 2.4 run, will you be considered as having completed the IPPT quota for that window period but get a failed result or is it considered an invalid attempt and it will be recorded that u still have not taken any IPPT for the window.This is what my reservist unit told me.<br><br>I kenna this and to safeguard myself after being told about that 3rd time DB case,i booked for another test outside. Asked about it with them and they said that as long as a person attempt any static station,it will still be considered a valid attempt for that window period. Anyone know if there is anywhere i can check if i have already fulfilled the single attempt needed for the year?</div>

I dunno which specific person informed you otherwise, but the source to clarify with is your reservist unit. (Not necessarily your actual S1 cell, but certain regulars/NSFs who do the administrative work on behalf of your CO - see the address/contact no. on the letters they send you about mob mannings etc).<br><br>More generally, I think what you highlighted was one of the structural problems that created IPPT/RT "skippers" under the old format, possibly for the present one as well. Essentially, we were instructed time &amp; again that the ICT IPPT - pass or fail - was the OFFICIAL result, &amp; any other test you book/took in your own capacity was of "no count" if the latter also occurred during the same workyear.<br><br>A few years of these frequent reminders, &amp; it's bound to cause a few of the more daring reservists to skip the individual callups for IPPT, even risk rescheduling a couple of makeup RT sessions, if they know they would also be attending ICT soon.<br><br>Citizen soldiers are human, after all. I presume that's partly why my CO threw the book only at the recalcitrant "skippers", &amp; tended to give other such offenders more the benefit of the doubt.</div>
