              <p><br>That FFI for cmd sch is common.Every recruit in a leadership batch even if it is PTP one also goes for it.My batch of 200 recruits in the company went for it at one go,lol!It is just a standard medical check up to say that you do not have any major medical conditions that will prevent you from taking up training in ocs/sispec.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A more accurate measure of your chances would be IPPT and SOC.If you have a pass/silver/gold for your ippt and you managed to clear SOC then you got a chance but it is not guaranteed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Other factors would be the peer appraisal thingy and your SIT test results of course.</p>

              <p><br>20 only?Don't mind me asking but are you from a BP batch?That's weird,maybe there has been a change of rule after I left or they staggered the ffi into much smaller groups to prevent human traffic jams at the med centre.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't think it is possible for you to reject so close to your POP.Most probably you got to do it after you get your posting orders if you end up going to OCS/SISPEC.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One of my friends rejected his OCS posting during the tri-service term but he could not outright reject from the start because you have to talk to the wing OC and they will usually want you to try it out first then see.He OOC from his course after 2 weeks and got posted out to unit as a M203 gunner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think the same procedure can be applied to SISPEC too.Just make sure you voice out on the very first day of your posting.</p>

              <p> Yep, i am from the mild obese batch. My OC told us we alrdy
                                          reach combat fit fitness and will upgrade our PES status to B after
                                          we POP, bla bla bla. And according to my friends in other mild
                                          obese coy, they only have like less than 40 ppl selected for the
                                          FFI. With so little people going for the FFI (20 in my case), will
                                          we have a high chance of going into command sch? Moreover all of us
                                          mostly met the criteria (some just passed ippt, some failed ippt,
                                          some fail soc) The criteria given to us were BMI 27 and below , minimum a IPPT pass (not neccessary hav to pass as said by my OC, probably we r mild obese), done SIT test and the EI thingy</p>

              <p>If you get best recruit for your coy,I forsee a high chance.They will definitely send a few from each BP batch for command school.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In your group of 20,did you pass your IPPT?How many others passed too?If it is like 4 only including you then you have a high chance.If you manage to clear your SOC,it is even higher.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way,congrats on getting shorlisted for cmd school and going all the way till POP!</p>

              <p>You still can voice out on the  first day if you end up there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tell them you really no interest then they will most likely OOC you after a while.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just be mentally prepared for unreasonable sai kangs they might throw at you after you voiced out as they might view you as a "black sheep".Just bear it then till they post you out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My opinion is that you should try it out first.Since you were shortlisted for it among the many in your batch,you obviously have certain positive traits as a leader.Maybe you are well liked and can communicate well with others?A never say die attitude?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whatever your choice,be proud of what you accomplished in BMT and no,you don't have to be commander to feel good about what you have achieved during those months in tekong.</p>
