My CO told us that BSLC is split into 2 terms. Term 1 which is 6 weeks whereby outstanding trainees can cross over to OCS. Term 2 starts after term1 and is 4 weeks. At the end of BSLC, trainees can also cross over to OCS.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>heh to clarify somethings, i got posted out of SISPEC in june last yr i think,quite long liao.<br><br>1) forget about ur 7hrs of slp.cock sh!t.most of the time will drag on and on.there's once i came back from pasir laba (how u spell?) from section live firing atabout 3am,went for breakfast without brushing teeth at 7am.<br><br>2)You can fail your SOC in bslc. i didn't even do any SOC due to a knee injury.however i managed a silver for ippt and i passed out of BSLC successfully.but i failed the physical aspect of my course because of the dumb SOC, but in ASLC you will have to pass your SOC<br><br>3) talking about BSLC and ASLC, BSLC is basic section leader course.here you will get your CPL rank upon graduation.depending on MAnpower see where u will get posted to.Depends where u will be going lar,for my batch we were the Support Arms batch, meaning very little of us went ASLC.<br><br>4)Sniper section will take place in BSLC.you will have to go for interview.they will pull you out of SISPEC after BSLC if you get selected.i think ur vocation will depends on that personality test that you took at CMPB before enlisting.so if u not made for sniper means not made for it lar<br><br>5)out field is like your home.you will get to know the trees and birds better.sleeping under the stars will be a time you treasure,cos its really pretty.Camo cream everyday before moving out walking till blisters with all that section training.but its really fun if you go and enjoy it<br><br>6) exercises are considered minor.finale is the Ex. Grandslam where you have the platoon assault or something like tat.den you have the dig trench whole day Ex. Nutcracker. KNN i really hate that exercise. you have to build a fire trench and a shell scrape all day and all nite.after which u cover it up the next day....<br><br>i hope this tell you more.i didn't go on to ASLC.but u will get to go Brunei for ASLC.heard its much more fun den BSLC.do enjoy it if you can lar.Carry on to ASLC and earn your 3SG rank!thinking of OCS?sorry man but OCS is not any better than SISPEC.and they have Jungle Confidence Course and the super jialat SOC.forgot what's the name.Any officers help?</div>
