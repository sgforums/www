            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting to see the same concerns and pride involved in SISPEC , compared to my SAFINCOS (the forerunner of SISPEC) days. Just some comparisons...<br><br>1) don't think there was a TSR during my time of min. 7 hours sleep ! God favours you if you average 5 hours per nite. Usually, we hope to do well during the week, escape extras, and get the reward of booking out on Friday nites. So that we can sleep the weekend and recover the lost sleep. No girl friends on Saturday nites for the few months in the course, as I remember !<br><br>2) I think there are more outfield exercises  than what is written in this thread.  At least when I was a reservist and I met up with younger chaps from SISPEC and heard from them ... also SAFINCOS in the old days .  There are many late night/ overnight TOPO exercises. This is the most important aspect of an infantry leader...  so the trainers will maximise time. I believe TOPO is one of the first few subjects taught and this would involve very long days and nights.<br><br>3) Also live firings.... quite a number, and about one third as I remember, conducted at night.... so I don't think you get 7 hours sleep on average thru' out the course.<br><br>4) My company escaped the summary exercise in Tekong  5 days/ 4 nites.... because that was the time when the strange episode of the dead recruit in Tekong happened. Replaced by 2 packages of 3 day/ 2 nite exercises in the Dairy Farm/ Gombak area... which is now condominiums and Mindef HQ ! This summary exercise was supposed to be the longest outfield during my time. During my time, if you were selected as an appointment holder during the summary exercise ... you are going to be in trouble. Very often the worst performing trainee will be given a last chance to exhibit his leadership skills during the summary exercise near the end of the course. This was not easy as by then, all your platoon mates know you and your weaknesses, and they are also by then, quite relaxed , knowing that they had accumulated enough to pass the course.  They may not be bothered to cooperate with you. You will be in for a tough time.<br><br>5) Noticed from the various posts that there is an increased amount of pride from people graduating from SISPEC. Was not the case during SAFINCOS. The people who had similar pride were those who were selected to go for the Platoon Sgt's course. Anyway, good for you guys and best wishes !</div>
