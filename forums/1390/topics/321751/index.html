              <p>SINGAPORE : A new unit in the SAF has been exploring new frontiers in technology.</p>
              <p>The 1st Military Intelligence Battalion, which was inaugurated two months ago, is also bringing reconnaissance capabilities to a whole new level -- all part of the SAF's 3G transformation.</p>
              <p>A soldier's rifle isn't the only weapon he brings to the battlefield anymore; today, he is also armed with a digital camera and laptop, turning the art of reconnaissance into a science.</p>
              <p>Employing unmanned ground surveillance equipment, the SAF can safely detect enemy movement from far away, greatly improving a soldier's survivability.</p>
              <p>Said Lt Col Arthur Kuan, Commanding Officer, 1st Military Intelligence Battalion, "Current reality for intelligence is that we still have scouts and recce troopers, using binoculars and exposing themselves to danger just to report on the enemy. The Military Intelligence Battalion is in charge of experimenting with new sensors; some of these exploit unmanned technologies and new imaging technologies to help us do more with less."</p>
              <p>Pictures of the enemy can be sent back to the headquarters where commanders can then assess the situation.</p>
              <p>"Live" video can also be fed back from remote positions.</p>
              <p>Images can even be collected day or night, and enemy targets spotted using unmanned aerial vehicles.</p>
              <p>Said 3SGT Cheng Wei Han, Reconnaissance Specialist, 1st Military Intelligence Battalion, "There is an element of excitement in dealing with this type of technology. We are at the vanguard of the tech in the SAF; whatever new sensors, new so-called toys the engineers develop, we experiment on them and give them feedback, improve upon them."</p>
              <p>The combination of all this equipment means giving the SAF better information management in the battlefield.</p>
              <p>Instead of just relying on voice information, there is now visual confirmation, helping commanders make better decisions with accurate information. - CNA /ct</p>

              <p>In the intelligence field, you can only sign up as a regular as an officer, ie. "Intelligence Officer". You'll be interviewed to determine if you're suitable for the job.</p>
              <p>But don't be too imaginative, you won't be a spy or Mi-6. Its mostly analytical work, other vocations/tasks are all classified and can't be discussed here.</p>
              <p>There're specialists and warrant officers in intelligence departments as well, such as in MINDEF G2, all the respective G2s and JID (Joint Intelligence Directorate).</p>
              <p>These are experienced intelligence specialists and warrants, transferred from other units or posted there after completing their courses in the School of Military Intelligence.</p>
              <p>Someone mentioned the people in PLC with the globe voc badge, those are people from SMI - a training school.</p>

              <p><br> You went for the interview by that 3 crab guy oso ar? Haha...but
              its a little crazy for them to ask you to sign on for 20+ years
              without even telling you wat your job scope is like...</p>
              <p>Anyway...1st Military Intelligence Battalion do recon
              stuff...like out in the field</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">SAF Intelligence Corps do other
              things...which i'm not sure if i can say here...but it's really

              <p>Military intelligence pple's vocation follows the formation that they're in.</p>
              <p>ie. if they're posted to armour in their OCS pro-term, they're vocationalised as armour officers, and etc. and they will wear that vocations' beret.</p>
              <p>Likewise, there can be combat-engineer vocation officers, serving as intelligence officers, etc.</p>
              <p>Intelligence training takes place after completion of vocation training.</p>
              <p>Anyway, its nothing scary to sign on as IO or IS, you won't get to be sent out as spies or whatever, its just that the scope of duties are so wide, they can't even finish telling you.</p>
              <p>You'll be trained to cover majority of the duties, and your exact job depends on where they post you, but primarily analysis based and assisting with administration for analysis.</p>
              <p>For 1MI, since they are primarily infantry based, you guessed it, they all wear green berets.</p>
              <p>1MI's operational role and capability is classified, just like every other combat unit.</p>
              <p>What is known to the public and allowed to be repeated here is that they do experimentations for different technologies and equipment, relating to collection and reconnaissance.</p>
              <p>They are primarily infantry based, but have other capabilities.</p>
