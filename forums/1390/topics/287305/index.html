I attended ASA(Admin Support Asst) course at SOM(School of MAnpower) during active period.</blockquote>Some more you said you served at 2 PDF, so shouldn't you have already gained some insight on how they utilize reservists there? Do they convert clerks to rifemen, along with other "disused" vocations like PTIs &amp; ammo technicians, etc? From what I know, it's supposed to be a pao-ka-liao unit &amp; thus a wild card. They may "claim" you back, with your new NSman liability.<br><br>If you were combat, I'll be quite sure you won't be reposted on to another formation. By contrast, clerks belong to a more utilitarian vocation, so who knows.<br><br>But I also note you had served at Div HQ level (correct?) &amp; as such, according to one interpretation, shall join the more-general NSPC holding list. Combat-side has their own holding lists, supposedly organized at the DIV level (3rd, 6th, 9th, 21st, 25th) with their reservist units replenishing from this pool (ex-deferments, ex-disruptions, make-up ICTs) first before looking elsewhere.<br><br>Here's an illustration someone posted here a while back which I've saved:<br><br><img src="http://i204.photobucket.com/albums/bb223/blitzonic/1-Par-0008-ImageParimage01.gif.jpg"></div>
