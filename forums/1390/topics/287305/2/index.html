Do they convert clerks to rifemen, along with other "disused" vocations like PTIs &amp; ammo technicians, etc? From what I know, it's supposed to be a pao-ka-liao unit &amp; thus a wild card. They may "claim" you back, with your new NSman liability.<br><br>If you were combat, I'll be quite sure you won't be reposted on to another formation. By contrast, clerks belong to a more utilitarian vocation, so who knows.<br><br>But I also note you had served at Div HQ level (correct?) &amp; as such, according to one interpretation, shall join the more-general NSPC holding list. Combat-side has their own holding lists, supposedly organized at the DIV level (3rd, 6th, 9th, 21st, 25th) with their reservist units replenishing from this pool (ex-deferments, ex-disruptions, make-up ICTs) first before looking elsewhere.<br><br>Here's an illustration someone posted here a while back which I've saved:<br><br><img src="http://i204.photobucket.com/albums/bb223/blitzonic/1-Par-0008-ImageParimage01.gif.jpg"></div></blockquote>I served as a Registry clerk at 27 SIB which is a unit of 2 PDF Comd.

Field duties are not necessarily combat duties, eg. attached to BN HQ depending on which formation you're in. The one parallel I'm familiar with was when this downgraded reservist was roped in to do MT-line SGT in my outfit (Arty), although he didn't stay long.<br><br>C9 itself means only excuse IPPT.<br><br><blockquote>What do reservist do in TRADOC especially for a clerk?  </blockquote>Sentry post at the Wargame Center, barb wire &amp; all? ~lol~</div>
