I was at NYP open house last Saturday. There was this booth set up by the Air Force and an officer was there talking to a group of 4 or 5 people whom I don't know them. I just stood behind them all the while and listen to the officer speak to them. There was this gal who kept on saying she don't want to be dentist liao because the pay, according to her, maximum is up to $5,000+. She kept saying the starting pay of this job (ADSS) quite good and higher than AOSS. She gives me the impression that she wanted to sign on next time just because of the money and furthermore, she wanted a <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">senang</span></strong> job.</div>
