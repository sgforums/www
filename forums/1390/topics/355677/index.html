            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi, I enlisted on 13th march but has since ooted like 2 weeks back. They oot-ed me because of a history of cyst in my lung when i was young which i didn't declare at cmpb. When i declared during pc interview and went for Med. review, they x-rayed me and said i should have recovered but i still feel chest pain/breathlessness when i run. so they oot me and sent me for specialist review which is this thurs. What happens if the specialist say there is nth wrong with me? when do i have to recourse.. next batch or nearing ord? and what happens if i'm still struggling during recourse? will they oot me again?</p></div>

              <p>If the specialist review says you are ok comes before you are being reposted then maybe u might join next batch but mostly you will go unit and come back a year or so later closer to ORD.</p>
              <p>If you recourse and still OOT then no need clear BMT liao lo cos normally recourse time not enough time for a 3rd recourse but generally recourse is pretty slack.</p>

              <p>i believe by nw u shld be alrdy posted to a unit, if specialist review state u're ok, thn u'll continue in ur current unit since u're not pending medical board i supose.</p>
              <p>BMT lowered down the requirement to pass BMT during beginning of this yr. it depends, i'm going ORD but i failed all my FFI, recently my friends they went for PES A/B ffi for bmt recourse, they failed. On the following day, S1 told them tht CPC require em to go for PES C FFI which they passed , lan lan must go. i duno how it works, for me i failed my ffi but they did not call me up. heng suay lor. :D</p>

              <p>hey guys, thanks for reply. I've been posted to OETI as auto tech b, but my course only start on 22 june. So if i recourse next batch means confinement again? and if really can't take it and oot again, then will it reflect badly on conduct?</p>

              <p>Wah why all the OOT ppl all become technicians these days. As a technician, don't spoil our image ah :p</p>
              <p>You will have a slack time at OETI being an AS till the course starts and its another slack 3 months before you start your proper technician life in either 3AMB or 9AMB.</p>
              <p>There is no confinement for reBMT as far as i know</p>

              <p>Recourse does not care you PTP or BMT and its also very slack and alot less regimental than the original BMT cos everyone got rank etc liao and no longer chao RECs. I know of 3SG who go recourse as well and quite lame to see 3SG pump 3SG.</p>
              <p>They change the auto tech course to 2 months at OETI and 3 months OJE? It used to be 3 months at OETI and 2 at OJE. Not sure since i was from BTT 22 and now i think yours is BTT 44 or so liao.</p>
              <p>Enjoy your life at OETI, unit life isn't too bad as well depending on where you posted. Feel free to pm me any qns you might have regarding a B tech work etc but don't ask me how to repair a vehicle cos i hardly remember anything :p</p>

              <p>Hi dkcx, I'm currently on course as B veh technician. I need find out from you urgently how is life like during and after your OJT? Which unit were you from? Cuz my knee and ankle ( due to torn ligament) are always hurting, and if unit life involves alot of squatting, standing, carrying heavy loads etc, I might not want to con't with my course. I have a specialist letter recommending me for a clerical vocation, but I haven't decided if I would want to pass it to my camp MO.</p>

              <p>Hi dkcx, I'm currently on course as B veh technician. I need find out from you urgently how is life like during and after your OJT? Which unit were you from? Cuz my knee and ankle ( due to torn ligament) are always hurting, and if unit life involves alot of squatting, standing, carrying heavy loads etc, I might not want to con't with my course. I have a specialist letter recommending me for a clerical vocation, but I haven't decided if I would want to pass it to my camp MO.</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>
