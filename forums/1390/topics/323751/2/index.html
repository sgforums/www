              <p>MP Selection the guidelines is about like this:</p>
              <p>Height not so important as long as average height 1.65 and above...</p>
              <p>No tattoo, no criminal record, good conduct, no bow legged...</p>
              <p>Believe me, your past school ccas and the test at CMPB applies...</p>
              <p>You can highlight your interest to become MP.. if they find you suitable they will take you... You can say you want to go command school then go MP, there is still a chance to become MP Spec, but you risk your chance.</p>
              <p>If you are keen to be a MP then be prepared your weekends burned and shift system...</p>

              <p>An MP can arrest any military personal on orders from a MP officer. After all, all investigations and decision are made by officers.</p>
              <p>A non-MP non-officer can detain non-officers senior in rank provided the junior ranked non-officer believes that the senior ranked non-officer has contravened SAF act (this is stated in SAF act).</p>
              <p>My CPT OC was stopped by a CPL MP for driving without LOA, the CPL saluted as per normal, but told and reminded my OC that he must have an LOA to drive MID vehicles. My OC's particulars are taken down, the MP told my OC either he find someone with an LOA now, or leave the rover there until a LOA'ed driver comes by to bring the rover back to camp (<br>this was just outside Mandai training area)</p>

              <p>No i am not an MP. I had a vocation many NSFs hated me for.</p>
              <p>MP opening is for selected people regardless whether you told your PC if you are interested. Your PC is just an NSF too who will not go far beyond telling your OC that you are interested in becomeing an MP. Most probably your interest in becoming a MP will be their lunch time topic after your PC interview.</p>
              <p>I dunno how you are selected, basically towards the end of BMT, many units will drop by for selection interviews so if you are selected for an MP interview, and you said you want to be an MP. Your chances will be high.</p>
              <p>You will need to go to an MP course.</p>
              <p>You need clean backgroudn and of course no tattoos. And meet the height requirements also</p>
