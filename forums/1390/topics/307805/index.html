              <p>Hi TS, I also a very blur and very slow in doing things person. I also a bit shy and softspoken, that's why even I PES E, assigned to clerical, also kena bullied by colleagues, superiors and even NSmen who come in for ICT. Therefore I can understand almost very clearly what you have been going through.</p>
              <p>Shyness is not necessary something you have to be ashamed of unless it's the extreme kind: you cannot even look at people when you are talking to them or they are talking to you. You try to stay in one corner even when people try to be friendly towards to you. That's extreme.</p>
              <p>You can learn to become sociable but I hope you also learn not to come across as desperate in wanting to be friends with everyone and you are willing to do anything to earn their friendship. That's dangerous. Cos I'm speaking from experience.</p>
              <p>Of course, I have not yet achieved the right balance to doing the above yet. I'm still falling very often as I try to achieve this goal of making friends and finding true friends who practises mutual respect and love for one another.</p>
              <p>I wish you all the best for your POP, your future unit and your ORD. I also wish you all the best for your future after ORD.</p>
              <p>Take care, iluvmilky. :)</p>
              <p>P.S: A shy guy can have friends. A shy guy can find true friends. You have to believe in that. You have to believe that it will happen one day if you don't give up.</p>

              <p>Once you POP, most of your platoon mates will probably be in different vocation from you. Just treat it as a brand new start, a brand new way to know other people better.</p>
              <p>If people say u slow in doing things, tell them that at least you will do it slow and right, because if do fast and wrong, who is gonna get blamed?</p>
              <p>When u go to ur new unit, u can open up more by taking the initative to make new friends. A "Hi" or smile always do wonders to humans.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>but after u get out of BMT, and get posted to unit life, after a while it gets different, partly when u have more or less adapted to the so-called army life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it happens to many others too, so dont worry, just do ur best u will be fine. most important is to make some friends u can talk to. =)</p>

              <p>Hello TS just want you to know that being shy is not really a bad sign, shy people are generally good listener and very polite but however you still have to lighten up yourself and be brave enough to converse with people so that people can take notice of you and be your friend. The most important thing to counter your problem is to ignore what others thinks about you. You need to know that no one is perfect and entirely loved/hated by everyone.</p>
