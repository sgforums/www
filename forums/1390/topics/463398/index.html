              <p>perhaps if you could provide us with more information on</p>
              <p>1. how you got the temporary Excuse Stay Medical Excuse</p>
              <p>2. what was written on the Memo as the supporting reason to doctor recommends stay out</p>
              <p>3. what did you tell the unit M.O when you submitted the medical certificate for unit mo to endorse.</p>
              <p>Back when I was given stay out..I also need to have Officer to guarantee that nobody (applies to all stay-out-requests) will mis-behave just simply because i'm medically backed up permantly to stay out - by the Medical HQ M.O despite me just having last 6 months to ORD years back as they have EXTRA filters put in place that's not the usual practice.</p>
              <p>Military function as a whole, but each individual unit has their own practice..so follow them if you want to stay out of trouble.</p>
              <p>If you're unable, feedback to your-direct superior if not your closest captain/major to speak in a few words for you..</p>
              <p>Coz if you call the SAF hotline, than your unit's officers will be alerted to take care of you, which looks bad on them as it means they cannot handle the situation on their own thus their performance bonus will be affected (for those regulars) then they will pay extra attention.</p>
              <p>Seek help from your direct officer-in-charge, your immediate captain before going to calling for help.</p>

              <p><em><strong>Being psychologically prepared is all about knowing
              what to expect and being prepared for it.</strong></em></p>
              <p>To be better prepared, you can participate in Total Defence
              activities and Open Houses organised by the SAF/SPF/SCDF.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you should also talk to your family members and friends
              who have lived the NS experience. The more you discuss with others,
              the more comfortable and mentally prepared you’ll become.</p>
              <p><strong>Because NS life is different from civilian life before
              enlistment, there are many adjustments you need to
              make.</strong></p>
              <p>A good way to cope is to get support from your buddy and fellow
              recruits. They are going through the same tough training as you, so
              talking to one another will help relieve some tension.</p>
              <p>In most evenings during your leisure time, you’ll also have some
              time to call your family or loved ones to talk. They can give you
              emotional support during NS.</p>
              <p>You can have a one-on-one interview sessions with your officer
              to highlight any problems you may have. If you have a personal or
              family problem that need to be addressed, do let the officer
              know—he may be able to give you some advice or time off to settle
              your problems.</p>
              <p>Life in NS revolves around structure, routine and discipline.
              This helps us stay united as a uniformed organisation as well as
              imparts the rigours necessary to protect our nation and
              citizens.</p>
              <p>This does not mean there is just work and no play. In fact,
              after a few weeks in NS and you’ll find new friends and new reasons
              to smile!</p>
              <p><strong>As a soldier, one of the biggest adjustments you’ll have
              to make quickly is in regimentation and discipline.</strong></p>
              <p>Being in a uniformed organisation, you’ll have to obey orders
              from your superiors. Thus some of you may feel a sudden lack of
              freedom to do what you want and you may find yourself having
              difficulties accepting authority initially.</p>
              <p>Regimentation and discipline build strong character and
              toughness, so that you’ll be tough enough to handle difficult
              combat, crime-fighting or rescue situations without giving up or
              breaking down.</p>
              <p>When you first enlist into NS, you may have concerns of being in
              a new territory, with new faces and new things to do. But don’t let
              this get to you. Just remember the saying that “when the going gets
              tough, the tough gets going”.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Following are some
              tips on what you can do to prepare yourself
              psychologically:</em></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Adopt a positive perception</li>
              <li>Build up physical stamina</li>
              <li>Develop good working attitude and habits</li>
              <li>Overcome psychological stress</li>
              <li>Adopt teamwork spirit</li>
              <li>Learn to be independent</li>
              <li>Set realistic expectations</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can also speak to your friends or family members who have
              been through NS. Ask them to share their stories. The sharing will
              help you reduce some of your fears, uncertainties and doubts.</p>
              <p><strong>During NS you’ll be living with different
              people.</strong></p>
              <p>Because these people come from different backgrounds, they may
              not think like you do or react to situations like you would.
              Instead of trying to select your type of people, you should cherish
              the diversity. This is a chance for you to learn more about your
              fellow mates and their cultures.</p>
              <p>You’ll find that you have many opportunities to absorb the
              different cultures—during training, eating, chatting or just seeing
              and listening. Take these opportunities and learn from people
              around you, you’ll have a much better appreciation of Singapore’s
              cultural diversity.</p>

              <p><br> The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) is a 2,000-bed acute tertiary
                  psychiatric hospital situated on a 25-hectare campus at
                  Buangkok Green Medical Park. Set amidst serene surroundings,
                  IMH offers a comprehensive range of psychiatric, rehabilitative and
                  counselling services for children, adolescents, adults, and the
                  elderly.</p>
              <p>IMH’s tradition of care started in 1928. We were the first
                  mental hospital in Singapore, starting with some 1,000 patients.
                  Since then, many advances have been made in treatment, training,
                  and research. Our treatment integrates evidence-based therapies,
                  supported by the departments of clinical psychology, nursing,
                  occupational therapy, and medical social work, to provide holistic
                  care for our patients. IMH is equipped with modern facilities, with
                  50 wards for inpatients and seven Specialist Outpatient
                  Clinics.</p>
              <p>IMH was the first mental health institution in Asia to receive
                  the Joint Commission International Accreditation in 2005, a highly
                  coveted international accreditation for healthcare
                  organisations. </p>
              <p>Over the years, IMH has gained a reputation for quality
                  research. In 2008, the Ministry of Health,
                  Singapore, entrusted IMH with a S$25 million research
                  grant to implement translational and clinical research into the
                  causes of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.</p>
              <p>IMH also plays a key role in training the next generation of
                  mental health professionals in Singapore. We train psychiatrists
                  and mental health professionals through the NHG-AHPL Residency
                  Programme for psychiatry and through collaborations with the local
                  tertiary institutions.</p>

              <p><strong><br> <br> MOH to launch two new community-based mental health
                  initiatives</strong><br> <em>Posted: 12 November 2012 1930 hrs</em></p>
              <p>Minister of State for Health Dr Amy Khor announced in Parliament
                  on Monday two new community-based mental health initiatives
                  designed to improve Singaporeans' access to mental
                  healthcare.<br> <br> "We are developing Assessment and Shared Care Teams (ASCAT), which
                  are specialist-led mental health teams based in the community, in
                  order to improve access to mental health care. We are also
                  developing Community Mental Health Intervention Teams (COMIT) to
                  provide improved access to counselling and psychotherapy services
                  in the community," said Dr Khor.<br> <br> Dr Khor also said that the Institute of Mental Health's (IMH)
                  occupancy rate for the past three years averaged at about 80 per
                  cent and that the hospital has sufficient capacity for new
                  patients.<br> <br> There are currently about 2,000 beds across public hospitals in
                  Singapore dedicated to mental health patients, with the majority in
                  IMH.<br> <br> Responding to queries from Member of Parliament Mr Hri Kumar Nair
                  on the criteria for admitting patients to IMH, Dr. Khor said those
                  with conditions such as schizophrenia and depression may be
                  admitted for closer monitoring.</p>

              <p>If everyone can just say cannot adjust to NS, get a doctor to write something and excuse themselves, we will have no army.</p>
              <p>It is fair to observe exactly what disorder (if any) will be manifested.</p>
              <p>Seriously what adjustment you need? More than 900,000 men have gone through NS. Are you a spoilt brat who can't do without your mummy and maid? Be a man !<br><br> It sounds like a lame excuse and malingering. Malingering is an offence that can bring you into the detention barracks (military prison).</p>
              <p>Life just goes on as usual, you breathe the same air, you eat food....what adjustment you need?</p>
              <p>SAF has every right over you, during your NS liability. External doctors' letters will only be reference and SAF is not obliged to accept them. They will however take reference and form their own judgment. SAF doctors are also qualified full-fledge doctors.</p>
              <p>To be honest, this stay-in/stay-out thing is hard to believe. Don't tell me you have never stayed in a hotel, chalet, etc. before? Army camps also have nearly everything you need, there's no excuse for whatever you need to adjust to....or you simply cannot do without internet? No excuse.</p>

              <p>your MC is given by IMH.</p>
              <p>Which means your MC needs to endorse by camp MO.</p>
              <p>Which give camp MO authority to follow the recommendation or overide the recommendation.</p>
              <p>The only one that can speak to the camp MO is your IMH specialist needs to call your camp MO for a discussion. But if your IMH specialsit say follow your camp MO instruction that basically nthg you can do and serve.</p>

              <p>But very curios that now a days have such a thg as adjustment disorder, never hear before last time...</p>

              <p>Everybody is different, I am man enough with courage to come out solve my problem. Though I need counselling, I have followed my counsellor advices to seek professional treatment at IMH. I just need more time to sort things out gradually. I am not malingering, genuine case. Even though I don't consult a hospital specialist to get a memo letter, the MC is issued by the camp medical centre MO. Perhaps I just need to sit down and reason out with the camp commander, if should he grant me a personal 1-to-1 private interview.</p>
