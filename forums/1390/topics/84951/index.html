            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, i recently had a soccer accident and broke my ankle. I have a fractured ankle and just had an operation recently..i think its a fracture tibia..had a blade and screws inserted and the doc told me that its hard<br>to downgrade and he won't write me a downgrade letter. however, prior to the surgery, he said that i will be downgraded for about 1year..now he's saying another thing. I believe that there are alot of pple who downgrade their pes status because of fracture. Need advice on this..should i consult another doctor regarding this? thanks alot for input guys! cheers</div>
