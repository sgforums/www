For every eat-snake medic that you see, remember that there are many other good medics who do their job as best as they can be it in the medical center or outfield.<br><br>2. I can tell you that drawing of blood is not a skill which can be learnt in a textbook. It is not just about sticking a needle in and pulling a syringe. I can tell you how to do it right now over sgforums, but if I give you a needle and vacuum tube and ask you do try it on someone else, I'll bet dollars to donuts that you'll fail.<br><br>Besides, different people have different physiological makeups. For some people their veins are closer to the surface, while for others it's further in. Some people have lots of valves in their veins. And not to mention hefty people who don't have very visible veins due to the fat.<br><br>Besides, have you ever tried drawing blood samples from fifty guys within half a day? I have. It wasn't easy for me to keep my mind straight after that. You can't really blame the medic for missing the vein if he's tired.<br><br>3. Once again, watch the tar and brush. Fair enough, there are medics who aren't committed to the cause and can't even remember basic first aid skills. I had one platoon medic who totally forgot EVERYTHING about POCM (Rockhound and other medics will know what's this) just prior to alert manning.<br><br>I was forced to sacrifice one whole day of off in lieu just to come back to camp to give that bugger a crash course in casualty management.<br><br>But for every medic like him who aren't conscientious, there are many others who do their job well.<br><br>It would do you a whole lot of good to remember that.</div>

While waiting for a heli medi-evac, there's a medic who got freaked out after seeing my leg and was instructed to give me a drip by the MO... Instead, he was shaken from the sight and didn't react to MO's instructions... Then the MO shaked him a bit and asked if he's okie, he was still in a trance... The medic's hands were shaking so badly that me told the MO that the medic might poke wrongly... Afterwhich, the medic was asked to step aside while the MO and the senior Medic Spec attended to me...<br><br>And the worst thing was this super blur medic sat onto a drip needle that he left on the stretcher...</div></blockquote>how did that happened? any tips on how to avoid it happening?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I got harassed by a medic once. we were on a run and I just could not be bothered. So my friend and I decided to take it easy. Just that we fell to the back. Eventually this medic came cycling up on his bicycle. And he started to ask me to run faster...<br><br>Du lan...<br><br>Want to cao keng also get harassed. Needless to say, I did not pick up speed. I think he got tired of covering safety for us and rode off ahead.<br><br>Lagi Du lan... Medic never cover safety. pui... cao keng also need safety right or not?</div>
