            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Forumers,<br><br>I knew last time during my NSF days, I heard many serviceman usually go to Beach Road to get the sewing of ranks/name-tags done. During my NSF days, I sewed everything myself but now with all the many tags/badges coming up, I thought I should do it 'externally'.<br><br>May I ask:-<br><br>1- If don't intend to do the sewing oneself, where do you normally go to get your name-tags/No. 4 ranks/'SINGAPORE' tag sewed for No. 4 uniforms?<br><br>2- Is Beach Road still the place that we can get the sewings and the purchasings of items (other than SAF-eMARTs) done?<br><br>3- Are those shops still there or have they moved?<br><br>4- Any good recommendations in terms of price, waiting time, etc?<br><br>5- The SINGAPORE tag and those formation/collar tags, are they issue by the unit when NSman report for their 1st ICT or should the NSman buy it and sew them on before ICT?<br>The problem is I do not know under which formation is my unit? How?<br><br>6- Do I leave out the formation and collar tags first? What about the 'SINGAPORE' tag? Must NSman get it befor-ehand and sew it on or are the 'SINGAPORE' tags also issued by unit?<br><br>7- I don't have the F.B.O. (i.e. the helmet, webbing (2G-type with pouch behind) and full-pack), it was returned when I ORD 11 years ago from NSF. Is the F.B.O. issued by unit also now?<br>I don't suppose the helmet and webbing (either 2G or 3G one) is for sale in the SAF-eMARTs, right? Credits allocated won't be enough also.<br><br>Please advise above 7.<br><br>I asked because my (first) reservist is coming up (after 11 long years  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> ) and I thought it is time to get these things done.<br><br>Thanks in advance and pardon for the above many queries.</div>

Rank is a bit more ex. ( only for WOSEs)<br><br>All 'SINGAPORE' badge, formation and vocation badges will be issued to you during your ICT. You should not be asked to purchase them before ICT.

            <div class='col-md body'>i also dun have FBO before my first ICT. They will ask u go for some half day briefing before your first ICT.. Then they will ask who dun have this and that.. just give your name. Then in my case, they called us up to collect the FBO several weeks before my ICT. but there are still some who go back to first ICT without any FBO and the CQ have to arrange to issue again..<br><br>Some even went back in Civilians, say that their uniform too small liao. cant wear anymore..<br><br>for the singapore tag and new badges, dun need to bother now.. in my last ICT (last august), they say that they will issue to us when we come back for next ICT which is next year.. Name tags also.. So no need to bother to go do yourself..  just wait till they give loh.. reservist not so on lah..</div>
