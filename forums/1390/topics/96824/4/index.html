LOL is all i can say.<br><br>have u ever seen ur instructors during ur recruit days digging and setting the bloody sandbags for you? or having the specs run to the coy office to take out cough medicine for you? oh. guess what. for live range, they brought along a friggin TV and a DVD player. ( 100% true, had pple from my coy attached to them for reshoot. ) oh, for the 7day field camp, ya, altho now most coys are really quite relak already, for theirs, they had friggin clothes lines set up, and at night, when most other coys would practice rather strict light discipline, to quote my PC here, theirs was like 'deepavali'. saw it with my own eyes. red, blue, green lights everywhere. amazing. seriously ridiculous la. the treatment they get is... out of this world.<br><br>hell, even the current CO of BMTC Sch 1, LTC David Lim, practically admitted the  WH treatment himself during his end-of-BMT talk with my Charlie coy. when something along the lines of this was brought up, he was like 'most coys, there's the good and bad lah, give and take. except for your batch, one particular company, i don't need to say why lah, you all should know.' like wtf?<br><br>oh yes, the bugger got platoon best too, even after numerous reports saying he was practically a resident at the medical centre, and far from outstanding as well. figures.<br><br>anyway, the entire coy was regularly booed by the other 4 'scholar batch' coys during the sch exercises and parades and stuff. absolutely hilarious to hear loads of cheering for every other coy during our POP rehersals, only to hear a resounding chorus of boos and jeers whenever 'lets give it up for the men of Hawk coy!!!' is read out. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>the preferential treatment definitely still exists tho, even after everything was out in the open in the media under the so called guise of transparency. bullshit if you ask me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whoo boy - is this what has become of the army?  When did proper training become tekan?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by joie:</div><div class="quote_body">why is it wrong to set up a clothesline in field camp? FYI, it was done on our own initiative, and nobody said you could not tie your toggle ropes from tree to tree. makes for a neater and better demarcated campsite. </div></blockquote>Why is it wrong to set up a clothesline in field camp?  Because it's completely against field discipline, that's why.  If you can even ask this question, I think you answered your own question about completing the syllabus, because this is as basic to soldiering as the three R's are to schooling.<br><br>All right, since your instructors sucked at their jobs, let me explain the idea of field discipline to you.  The two objectives of of field discipline are:<br>1) to leave no trace of your having been in a location<br>2) to be ready to move at any time.<br><br>Here's a little-known rule that your instructors seems to have left out of the syllabus: if the enemy can FIND you, he can KILL you.  Surprising, isn't it?  Leave traces of your existence in the field, and you may as well lay down a welcome mat for him to come and get you.<br><br>So, how does this relate to laying clotheslines out in the field?  First, you're effectively putting up a flag for the enemy to find.  Second, the toggle rope or comms cord that you're using as the line leaves marks on bark - it's not a natural occurrence, and anybody patrolling will know for sure that another human being has been there.  I may be overly optimistic in assuming that your instructors taught you rubbish discipline, but the same principle applies - a trail of rubbish in the field leads right back to you.<br><br>Second, you need to be ready to move at any time.  The enemy is not going to make an appointment to pop you a new rectum in your forehead.  It's going to happen quietly and suddenly, and if your men are making sure that they get their 7 hours' sleep, the first you're going to know about it is when you feel the pinprick of a stiletto just as it enters your brain stem.  If you're lucky, you won't get one of our guys, and instead get someone who prefers to shoot the enemy.  In that case, you're extermely lucky if you're on your feet before the tenth man gets turned into mincemeat by the enemy's MG.<br><br>Where does that situation leave you?  You've got your rifle and SBO and maybe, just maybe, your full pack - sans clothes.  Chances are that if you're feeling comfortable enough to set up a laundry at your LUP, you've also left all manner of equipment out of your pack.  You have to bug out of there because an enemy company is overrunning your position, and you're left with less than half the equipment that you came in with - equipment that you may just need to get out.<br><br>THAT is why you don't set up a clothesline in the field!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by joie:</div><div class="quote_body">Furthermore, is there such rules saying that range should have no DVD players and TV? that's rather surprising, would like to know the rationale for such a rule. don't you think this is initiative on the part of the commanders, and makes for better use of time rather than just sitting around waiting for your shooting detail. </div></blockquote>Did you have a DVD player in your classroom while waiting for an exam to start?  No.  Why?  Because you were supposed to be focussing on what you were going to do once you were allowed to turn the question paper over.<br><br>Now I know it may be a bit of a stretch of the imagination for you, but here's a crazy idea: maybe you were supposed to be focussing on your weapon-handling technique before your turn on the range.  I know, that makes absolutely no sense - it's absolutely crazy that you would need to practice shooting, right?  Hell, all you ned to do is get up there, squeeze the trigger a few times and get it over with, so that you can get back to your movie.  Who cares if you hit your target?  What?  Oh yes, there was a target 300 metres down range - you were too busy watching your movie to notice.<br><br>Man, these Army rules make absolutely no sense whatsoever!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by joie:</div><div class="quote_body">And what is the point of reveille at 0530 to be doing 5BX and waiting for breakfast? the bloody SAF directive states that the minimum requirement for sleep is 7 hours, but i have never heard of anything that says more than that is harmful for soldiers.

Didn't the whole HAWK Coy complete the whole POP, rather than some other companies, which had a few people fainting in the parade?</div></blockquote>Ah, now we get to the reville issue.  Hmm - guess what's the best time to launch an attack?  No, the enemy isn't as inconsiderate as to interrupt your lunch with an attack - they'll be nice and courteous and do it at dawn.  Gee, is there a correlation between 0530 revilles and dawn?  How bizzarre!<br><br>Tell you what - you go get your 7 hours' sleep - the rest of the guys will have a war to fight.<br><br>Why didn't Hawk Coy have anyone fall out?  It would have been terribly disappointing if you did.  After all, the guys from the other companies were tired from their training, but you were relatively fresh and relaxed, what with all the movies you were watching.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by joie:</div><div class="quote_body">There is a difference between jealousy and truly being concerned about standards.
