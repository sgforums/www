I'm not sure but i don't think the Wing Comd was present at that moment. Rather than block the BG and risk an ugly confrontation with someone who outranks even the Commander OCS, i guess most Wing Comds would probably just salute and write an off-pass on the spot, lending some legitimacy to the 'book-out'.</div>

Really, what amazed me was how he tried to justify himself of all these treatment as "normal".  Its not your fault that you are posted to Hawk coy, and its not your fault if the instructors give you special treatment.  Maybe if you feel bad abt receiving all these special treatment, we might even sympathize with you.  But hey, to say that you deserve all these, man you are totally out.</div>
