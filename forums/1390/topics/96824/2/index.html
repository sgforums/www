Needless to say, none of us bothered saluting.<br><br>Then again, our OC at the time was CPT Lim Teck Yin, who, as Lim Bo Seng's grandson, probably had enough heritage to be a WH.  He was originally a Guards officer, converted to Commandos and is now a Colonel in Armour.  His beret may be black now, but he'll take a little bit of red with him when he gets his star.<br><br>Apparently, there was a President's Scholar with a red beret back in the early eighties who was expected to become the first Commando BG, but I heard he abruptly quit for civvie street as a major or LTC.  Ah well, there might be another one down the track - my last company 2i/c was a high-flyer who made major by the age of 30 and went off to Gombak, but I don't know what colour his beret is now (he was originally an Armour officer who converted).<br><br>That said, I doubt that the structure of the SAF's bureaucracy will allow for our version of PDLB.</div></blockquote>whats IIRC ? and middle of BMT can take the guy home ?? hmm ...then for the following weeks of BMT where did he end up ? or he got posted out ?<br><br>Hmm didn't know converting to CDO was common last time, my fren tried to convert back in 2002, and was refused, and the treatment he recevied there was pretty bad, i heard from couple of his platoon mates that during his attachment at Hendon Camp, he was attached to one of the companys who where in the midst of their BMT field camp in tekong, then following their fieldcamp, the company sat tonners to the pier while he was made to run/walk back ..<br><br>But my OC did tell me that ppl who signed on CDOs back in the early 90s recevied quite harsh treatment from the regulars.</div>
