            <div class='col-md body'>as a cadet in BMT, we were always lead to believe that the guys bmt in tekong very xiong. so we girls train harder at safti, hoping to equal the guys when they join us in TST and so on. after reading the hawk cpy clothesline and dvd and fridge incident, i think bmt for white horse is a joke. even the girls one is harder. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>firstly, no clothesline. i dont care if its your initiative or what the hell u call it, its not tactical. everytime b4 u sleep, u make sure everything is pack and u are ready to go if u are 'attack' at night. this we learnt the hard way. with tekan session and a back to camp defaulter parade. entire platoon. somehow i think your hawk company has enjoyed a boys scout camp. clothesline indeed. what are u going to hang there next?<br><br>dvd players at the range is inapproriate. if u wanna get round the issue by saying that no directives say it cant be possible then fine. afterall we all know that saf can do anything but dont get caught. but the aim of range is sorely missed. arent u suppose to maintain your weapon? granted its clean already but we all know cleaning your rifle is impt, or were u going to bring a maid to war to clean it for u while u watch dvd?<br><br>reville at 530 for others ok. but not so for u precious white horse. cos u are too impt to wait in line at cookhouse for breakfast. so instead of wasting time better to go to sleep hor. cant spend the time area cleaning, drawing arms or anything. cos its all a waste of time. afterall u ppl are bringing maids to camp.<br><br>cornyfish2000. yes i remember the BG bringing out his son incident. i must add that there are times he left for home without marching out to warrior hall like the rest of us donkeys and he was granted nights off more often than the rest of us idiots who had to score top 5% in test to get night off. we were in the same wing. though i wasnt so lucky to be in same platoon with him.<br><br>conclusion. white horse platoon BMT is a joke. shame on you. even girls bmt lagi xiong. we will so kick your ass. haha. i do not deny that there are very outstanding white horses, but the majority of them think they are sooooo entitled.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>kudos to all.</div>
