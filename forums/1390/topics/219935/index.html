            <div class='col-md body'>it highly depends on your unit if they want to send u for guards conversion course. either you carry balls and volunteer, or kenna forced by OC, or you're a regular.<br><br>alright, after signal course (officer, spec or man), you'd be posted to active units (in this case a guards battalion or brigade). from here, if there's a upcoming intake of GCC (for officer and spec is one group), your signal OC might task you to take it up if you're a regular. as for NSFs, if you're on the ball, wanna be garang, wanna hao lian wear guards tab, by all means volunteer. it you've gone thru sispec or ocs, GCC should be no problems.<br><br>after GCC, your vocation will still be under support signal but wear your guards tab with pride. so those combat fellow guardsmen (officer, spec or men), will not look down or make things difficult for you when you do things. coz u underwent the hardship and the rapport comraderie with other GCC coursemates (fellow officers and specs) will help you in future dealings within the guards unit.<br><br>many years ago, i too wanted to go for the GCC course when i first posted to the brigade. saw my fellow sispec mates who were snipers, lightstrike, scout all went for it. but sad lonely me in signal like kenna outcast... somemore i gold ippt run 9min one leh. haiz... kenna discouraged by fellow older signal spec and officers say many things to do in the company, no time to send  me to such "bo liao" course.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>anyway, during my time, the brigade NSF medical officer underwent guards and ranger course. see him wear the number 3 like damn garang.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to pandemonium...<br><br>To my understanding there is no'application' for Sig Offr/Spec/men who are posted to Armour to be armour trained. it's part of the job because the signal aspect in armour is different from the infantry..and in Bn, it is common for Sig offr to know how to operate armour stuff.<br><br>As for Guards, i agree with mad campus. Due to the shortening of NS liability, one can only hope to volunteer for GCC, and not be automatically 'enrolled' should you be from the COmbat Support vocations like Signal. However, it is recommended one tries it out, the pride and the networking from GCC is indeed invaluable for life in a Guards Bn/Bde<br><br>Signal dudes are high versatile ( BHB i know  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ) can be posted to places like Guards, Infantry, Arty, Armour, ADA... just to name a few.

If u're posted for specialist or officer course, it's equallly xiong - both physically (but of course not as xiong as inf) and mentally. Route march is 72km, SBO, rifle and the 840 signal set (dont think there's field pack tho).</div>
