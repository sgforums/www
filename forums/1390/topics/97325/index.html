            <div class='col-md body'>It's all there inside Tim Huxley's book, under the Command &amp; Control chapter. Google around for a MINDEF organization chart too, if you can.<br><br>MINDEF has 2 components, a policy-making side (DPG, DAG, DTG, etc.) &amp; an armed-forces HQ (Joint Staff of JOPD, JID, SAFTIMI, etc; SAF, RSAF, RSN). 2 permanent secretaries generally head the former, while the CDF leads the latter. Together they report to the Defence Minister.<br><br>However, it doesn't mean one individual amassing power. The concern here is less about creating another Saddam Hussein, than to institutionally guard against an untested/inexperienced figure with overriding authority. As such, 3 check-&amp;-balance means were put in place, though overall subservient to PAP direction:-<br><br>- the 1st is long-established: formal control of defence policy resides with the Defence Council (around since '65) &amp; the Armed Forces Council (since '72). Can't recall who does what, beyond one's supposedly for "administrative" decisions &amp; the other for "strategic" ones. Membership consists of Cabinet ministers, senior MINDEF figures, service chiefs (including the CDF) &amp; - for the Defence Council - portfolio-holders of Foreign Affairs/Home Affairs/intelligence as well, if I'm correct.<br><br>- the 2nd is the emphasis on "team" leadership, even as defence planning &amp; spending exponentially increased over the years. Both MINDEF &amp; the SAF were increasingly bureaucraticized; the former "assisted" - some say as training grounds for - by ministers of state &amp; permanent secretaries from the civil-service, the GLC, the serving SAF (scholars &amp; farmers) &amp; more recently reservist ranks. FWIW One indirect result is that there's no hardline/hawkish military niche developing within the local context.<br><br>- the 3rd is the elected president gaining veto power over certain high military &amp; defence appointments. All right, so the PAP still holds all the cards but it's an institutional improvement over the days when the Defence Minister could promote or fire people at will without accounting for it.</div>

The latter is part of a Cabinet, which in turn is a body of persons appointed by a PM to head the executive departments of the government-in-power. The other elected members of Parliament (PAP or opposition) are backbenchers who aren't strictly holders of public office, unless they're Mayors or something.<br><br>The CDF also sits on both the Defence Council &amp; Armed Forces Council as an official adviser; see elsewhere on my debrief on what those are.</div>
