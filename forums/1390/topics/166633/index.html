I think there're cases where BMTC instructors are loaned out to units to be instructors temporarily.<br><br>(for infantry) intake will be like 3 companies of recruits.

Your 'instructors' will be your commanders when your unit goes operational ready..(Sec Comds, PS, PC, OC, CO, etc) Even after ORD-ing, u will stay with your unit for your 10 year ICT cycle. You will hence play a part in 'defending' the country as a man..<br><br>I dun know wat u define as doing something useful and not wasting your time. Some people find being a clerk is wasting their time, some think being a rifleman is wasting their time and some end up wanting to be in the other person's shoes...<br><br>You MAY enter BMTC for Standard BMT, which has NO SIT test which tests your leadership skills, so u will not be able to go to SISPEC or OCS for that matter. Even at the end of BMT at BMTC, u may still be posted to be a rifleman, driver, storeman or anything below vocation grade 25..<br><br>If you are PES C, u will enlist in BMTC and after passing out go on to be in vocations such as clerks, storeman, service medic, driver, etc<br><br>Anyway u won't be able to 'prove' yourself..Your vocation is more or less decided upon enlistment..especially for someone who doesn't have diploma, A levels...</div>
