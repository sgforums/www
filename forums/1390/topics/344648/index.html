              <p>Hi.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have been posted to this particular camp after my BMT and I have developed signs of Depression/Anxiety Disorder. I went to the MO twice, once to state my problems and the second time for Panic attack. I told that I cannot cope with the environment was being refered to MMI PPC ward for appointment with Psychatrist in 2 more weeks for depression.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My problems include pounding or rapidly beating of my heart, shortness of breath, trembling, discomfort of the chest and loss of sleep. I can also feel nervous or worry suddenly. All these can lasts for a long period when trigger and I feel really miserable/uncomfortable during this period. I scared them one day I will lose control of myself and go crazy. Sometime, even slightest things such as going up/down of stair and people shouting can make my heart pound hard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I also do not want to interact with my platoon mate and want to be alone. When people talk to me or my platoon mate jokes around and making noise, I feel very irritated and often ignored them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It going to be my fifth week and it getting worse with no signs of improvement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would like to ask:</p>
              <p>- What will happen when seeing and after seeing the psychatrist at MMI?</p>
              <p>- Will depression and anxiety disorder affect my future?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I understand your situation. SAF is like that. People with geniune reason they wont listen because officers don't want to take up responsibility. Get your parents to talk to your OC or even CO.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I believe your problem is genuine so heres how it works, get your parents to call ur oc first to address the problem. If nth is done after a week, call ur co straight. no use talking to ur pc or csm or those people in the lower chain of command. Its like talking to a dumb cow. Anyway, u can always see a doctor at any Govt hospital or poly, sure theyll stereotype you as chao keng but just tell them ur prob and ask for a referal to see a shrink. Its best not to depend on the medical officer. Anyway, if the Mo doubts your problem is real or stereotypes you, mindef is a phone call away. Once again, get ur parents to do it. <br><br>All the best. <br></p></div>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Refer to first post. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">First thing is that you managed to pass out from BMT. Congratz on that. This meant that there is no history of depression or anxiety before that also. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Your problem arises after you got post to your new unit or camp. I think you don’t really like your new posting (Guards? SIR?). You have problem with adapting to a new environment. Then you should have having some sort of transient depression or anxiety. My advice is to have an open mind and talk to your new bunk mates, even if they are ah-beng or homo, they have interesting life story to share and you might learnt new things and idea from them. Then over sometime things should turn out okay.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Are you taking any drug? For example, Pseudoephedrine can cause anxiety. Coffee, Smoking also can cause depression during withdrawal. Coffee itself can cause anxiety. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Anyway depression and anxiety are different disorder. They can be tested by blood test or other clinical test. They can be treated by drug and can be prescribed by psychiatrist. Drugs have their side-effect too, so beware. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">After seeing a SAF psychiatrist, (I trust their professional skill) they will put you under Medical Board and downgrade and post you out. Please dont try to do stupid thing like taking rifle to orchard road before that. Serious.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Sad to say. One will have to declare mental disorder when applying for any university entry or job in the future. Sad to say, YES it would affect your future quite alot. But before you go to commit suicide, you also can "hide" your problem and not to declare. Beware that you will have to bear the legal liability for doing so. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Actually much of the depression and anxiety problem can be cured by talking to your own self, friends, pets or parents. Practicing self-control would be a more ideal solution.</span></p>
