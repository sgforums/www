            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>1)What shd i expect for NS in SCDF? </blockquote>Lotsa training, with more likely to get activated &amp; deal with real-life crisis situations during NSF (compared to the SAF).<br><br><blockquote>2)Why am i posted to SCDF? Is it randomly chosen ? (btw i m Pes A) </blockquote>I suppose so. Put it this way: direct enlistment to the SCDF, similarly to frontline SAF units, can be generally grouped under the "mono-intake" system (which takes in only enlistees of combat-fit or -equivalent fitness). Tekong &amp; BMTC isn't the be-all for NS.<br><br><blockquote>3)I heard tt ppl who are posted to SCDF mostly are ppl who are blacklisted by the govt. (eg, ppl hu cun be trusted to hold a gun or a rifle) ?</blockquote>No blacklisting. They do screen familial backgrounds of some enlistees, but the Government needn't suspect you if you're at least a 2nd-generation Singapore citizen &amp; has gone through the national education system.<br><br><blockquote>4)Is there ani chance of being a SCDF senior NCO during NS? (coz i read frm sumwhere tt most of the ppl hu hold impt appointment are SCDF regulars)</blockquote>Only junior officers &amp; NCOs for NSF aspirants, I'm afraid - how to get promoted so quickly inside just 2 years? You can advance higher during reservist, usually as KAHs (Key-Appointment Holders, same as for the SAF) &amp; the bulk of SCDF's total strength lies in the reserves (like for Army).<br><br><blockquote>btw is it true tt after mi trainin when i m posted to mi unit, i can go home everidae after mi shift hr?</blockquote>Depends on where you're posted. Unlike other countries, our SCDF version is paramilitary; it's part of Total Defence. So it's not just firemen &amp; paramedics; the SCDF also has DART specialists, Hazmart (Hazardous Materials) experts, rescue COYs &amp; BNs, construction BGE, training schools, supply &amp; maintainence bases, all of them with relevant command structures. Active strength is around 5k but total strength (with reservists &amp; volunteers) number in the tens of thousands!<br><br><blockquote>just wondering cause i've never been in that position.. once you kena scdf can you like ask for a transfer to the army or smtg?</blockquote>National service, what. Conscript where got choice?<br><br><blockquote>hmm y is it that the officers are only chosen frm ppl who went thru bmt? y don't ppl who r posted to SCDF directly hava chance of being a senior NCO? If its it is reallie random tt ppl are posted to SCDF, then does it not mean that they may hav the same leadership skills as compared to those who went through OCS? Life is unfair...sigh...</blockquote>Welcome to the world ~lol~ There's always signing on as a regular if you want more control on your career path, lah.</div>
