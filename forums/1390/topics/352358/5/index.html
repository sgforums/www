              <p>hi ,</p>
              <p>I am currently in ptp bmt now, and i am hoping to get into medic unit after i pop.<br>I heard medic must study alot, which i dont mind, cause i really hate PT lessons. Not say i cant do PT lar, i just dislike it.</p>
              <p>I asked around, but my sergant told me that these vocations are decided by MINDEF and they also dont know. So i am hoping maybe someone can draw some light onto how to increase yr chance to enter medic vocation. I know its immpossible to gurantee yrself in what ever vocation one likes, but i want to try my best to get in.</p>
              <p>Must medic pass IPPT? Will failing ippt increase yr chance of becoming medic as medic is less physical then other vocations?How will the SIT test affect the vocation outcome? can we pretend -pretend, say my buddy got injured then i go to try do first aid on him in front of my commanders?</p>
              <p>I am not trying to chao-keng or what lar, just trying to make my next 1yr plus less horrible for myself. I do know that Combat medic also have physical stuff to do, but its less then other vocations right? beside, i am really interesting in learning medic stuff, rather then learn how to fire more weapons and do stupid exercises all day long.</p>
              <p>Someone asked my OC how to become medic, my OC told him that must go SISPEC then become medic specialist. But my OC is damn siao on type on, ranger guards kind one, and everytime make it sound that OCS and SISPEC is like must go one. so is my OC correct?</p>
              <p>BTW i am PES A, so i know i cant chao-keng and be service medic, like those in Tekong Medical Centre.</p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Singapore Armed Forces Medical Corp (SAFMC) is collaborating with local and international institutions to enhance paramedic education. <br><br>It has signed two Memoranda of Understanding (MOU). <br><br>One is with the Justice Institute of British Columbia (JIBC) and the second is with Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP). <br><br>MINDEF said both are internationally recognised institutions in paramedic education. <br><br>Both agreements cover education and development in paramedical, pre-hospital and post-surgery care. <br><br><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Under the partnership with JIBC, all full-time national servicemen (NSF) medics will undergo paramedic training to become <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Emergency Medical Technicians. <br></span></span></strong><br>The course aims at strengthening their basic medic knowledge and equipping them with skills to provide treatment for complex medical conditions. <br><br><strong>NSF and regular medics <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">with a nursing diploma</span></span> will also be trained as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Emergency Medical Specialists (EMS)</span> who can provide treatment for common medical emergencies such as chest pains, life-threatening allergic reactions and diabetes. <br></strong><br>Servicemen who complete either of the courses will receive <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a vocational certificate</span></em> from the JIBC. <br><br><strong><span style="color: #888888;"><span style="color: #993300;">The MOU with NYP will provide</span></span></strong> <strong><span style="color: #993300;">Operationally Ready National Servicemen (ORD NSmen) medics and regular medics with basic scrub medic and post-surgery critical care training conducted by the Polytechnic's School of Health Sciences. <br></span></strong><br>The training will enable the medics to attend to casualties in an operating theatre and an intensive care unit. <br><br>- CNA/yb</span></p>
