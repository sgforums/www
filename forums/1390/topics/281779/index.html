            <div class='col-md body'>As an "old" soldier from the same period ( i.e. 1980s) , I think it is a very noble idea for the ST to search for the real inspiration behind the logo. Every organisation or society needs small historical facts about itself to make up its full identity. In turn, that inspires loyalty to itself.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>GDSman sounds right, if it's from 1984. Can't really tell if the logo image is depicting a firer wearing camo utilities (eg. tucked out) though the baggier trousers suggest so. He's clearly the old-style steel helmet, though.<br><br>Mass issue of the camo attires only began in 1985, the year I enlisted. In the preceding two years or so, only certain units got to wear them -- non-standardized too, as I understood, as the SAF experimented with different designs. Logically, it must've been the infantry first &amp;, amongst them, the elite troops most of all. The rest of the SAF, still in their tucked-in, starched/ironed Temasek greens, must've then recognized these camo wearers as "special" forces.<br><br>Don't believe? Check the old news photos of the Cable Car Tragedy (1983). I recall, too, browsing through a photo album some retired MAJ donated for the OCS bunk display at the last AOH. It had some early '80s Temburong shots where all the instructors wore "jungle" fatigues &amp; a perm staff in Temasek green. There were also SATO graduation pixs from the period, with different officers from different formations wearing different attire (even different camos).<br><br>Speaking of the latter: Lee Hsien Yang was in it. If I'm correct, he was identified as being from Armour (which I didn't know previously).</div>

The stance of hip is easily switchable to the "on guard" position in bayonet fighting.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>And at that time the camo uniform was of low quality they faded after washing.</blockquote>Those faded uniforms were prized among servicemen. ~lol~ More so the next-generation camo pattern, which had a brighter shade than the version which the SAF settled on later. Everybody tried their best to hang onto both sets, for their "veteran" look. Eventually the faded ones was kit-exchanged out at the Enciks' insistence -- the colour became more gray than green, as the picture shows -- &amp; they even caused MPs to take any still-stubborn wearers' names down at the end (outside Amoy Quee), as I recall.<br><br>But the other design remained popular throughout the reservist days.</div>
