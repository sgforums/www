              <p>Hi, I'm currently a Polytechnic student, I've been granted deferment till April 2015. But I've lose interest in my current course, so I've decided to get into a private school to get my Diploma (something that I've interest in). Instead of 3 years studies, the private school only take 1 and a half years. So, if I do really drop out of my current course and went on presuring for the Diploma at the private school, will my current deferment be denied, and I've to serve the NS first, or could I finish my Diploma and enjoy myself till 2015 then get into NS?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I'm still 19..</p>

              <p>No wonder you are stuck. Tricky question.</p>
              <p>You just started poly this year. Then this would be considered as a transfer of courses or schools. It is normal for some students to change courses or schools in the first year.</p>
              <p>Apply to the private school. And when they approve, transfer to that school.  But do read the fine print, you might be taking a private "basic" in that 1 and half year. This is actually a half diploma cert. You might need to take an "advanced" diploma to complete this cert. Usually for private diploma, (basic + advanced) = one standard MOE diploma cert.</p>

              <p>Apply to the private school. And when they approve, transfer to
              that school.  But do read the fine print, you might be taking
              a private "basic" in that 1 and half year. This is
              actually a half diploma cert. You might need to take an "advanced"
              diploma to complete this cert. Usually for private diploma, (basic
              + advanced) = one standard MOE diploma cert.</p>

              <p>You must continue to study in your old school. At the same time, apply for the new  course in the other school. In fact you can try several schools with the same courses.</p>
              <p>When the new school approved your application. You will have official documentation of your new start and end date. You must then email to contact@ns.sg, with attached document.</p>
              <p>Subjected to Mindef approval, they may allow you to do the transfer. Else you will have to go NS. </p>
              <p>SAF is only concerned about their manpower issue, so they hack care about you.</p>
              <p>If you dropout, without having a secured place in the other school, you will serve NS in the next round.So it is best of you can transfer the similar course with your current school.</p>
              <p>If you cannot make up your mind, I suggest you go NS first. Dont come back in another year's time to say you want to change back to your originial course.</p>

              <p>I guess you are left with 4 choices..<br><br>1) continue your current course of studies and find your way to something you want in the future</p>
              <p>2) transfer course within your polytechnic now that you are in year 1 (fundamental year)</p>
              <p>3) drop out of poly (they will expel u anyway when you fail the attendance requirement, why waste money?) and go to private school, subject to Mindef approval</p>
              <p>4) just serve 2 years first and decide during NS, c'mon, u wanna chiong sua when you are starting to get real rusty?</p>

              <p>Okay, I have called up the Mindef site, they said that if I wanna defer for Diploma in private school, I would have to be 18 yr old or below.</p>
              <p>And according to them, if I do drop out now, I will have to go for another round of medical checkup which I just did recently like oct 2010. Then I'll get enlist into Army/Home Team Acadamy. But anyone know what the duration of this process? How long will it takes?</p>
              <p>Let say, during my enrollment into Polytechnic, I was actually given a choice to enlist into Home Team Acadamy, will I be given the same choice again for this upcoming enlistment.</p>
              <p>Before that I was also ask to go for V.A too (Vacational Assessment). My friend said it was something to do with commando or some sort of things.</p>
              <p>But I were also like to find out if it is wise to Sign on if I get into Home Team Acadamy?</p>
              <p>Hahaha.. Thanks everyone for their reply.. I'm really learning some new things here.. :D</p>
