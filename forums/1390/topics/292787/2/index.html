We are not allowed on ground in number 4 because combat boots are not as strong as safety boots and noone will allow us wear no. 4 with safety boots. I only occasionally wear no. 4 while working if i happen to book in in no. 4 due to parades, interviews or the rare few crap that i need be in uniform. Since i work in office and my relationship with my boss is good, i'm normally the only 1 in no. 4 on those days <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
