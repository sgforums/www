            <div class='col-md body'>All the clerks in my old Arty outfit wore No.4 in my time. Heck, there were only two who wore No.3's in my entire unit, the Chief Clerk &amp; a Sarge in the Medical Centre, incidentally both regulars &amp; females.<br><br>Can't remember if the clerks stayed out. But I reckon so, even though we were operational, cuz HQ BTY occupied only the top floor of the building block &amp; the bunks were arranged dorm-style for the HQ field &amp; rear troops. Some of the cooks were forced to share the 3rd floor with the officers (double-roomed), which was awkward cuz they worked at unearthy hours &amp; were also completely bo-chap with their attire (allowed to wear non-regulation white tees &amp; rubber galoshes). Given the lack of accomodation, there were literally not enough rooms for the clerks.</div>
