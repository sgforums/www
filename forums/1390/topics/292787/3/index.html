In the past we could even attached 1 new tech to 1 ORD tech to learn all the things they know etc as for us different tech we focus on different areas. Eg, I was 1 of the specs who learnt more about 5 ton air system diagnostics, electrical systems and also 1 of the few who know how to programme the 5 ton speedo which fix it at 50 instead of the max speed of 110. However i know nuts about that LR since i avoid that vehicle at all cost : Most of all these skills i didn't managed to pass on to anyone since there wasn't time and i had to train my understudy to take over ES system and not maintainance work. Even that i had only about 10 days or less to pass on my knowledge since the norm as always is PTEs will kanna sai kang and that period we had to have major events like CMEO COC, COC of 1 armour platoon from 6AMB to 9AMB etc etc so i even had to 'fight' with regulars to keep my understudies in camp to continue training. Super piss of during that period, you don't know how many leaves and offs i had to cancel, reschedule to fit their schedule and mess up mine. In the end i didn't even managed to clear all of them...<br><br>Contractors can do work in peace time but you won't see a company of contractors follow you outfield, go overseas for exercise etc. All such maintainance are still done by regulars and NSF and with the recent downsizing, alot of skills are being lost as they leave with regulars n NSF who leave the service before many can fully train someone to take over.</div>

It was only later by the time i was leaving that they applied for a 24hr licence but most of my OT were done by then.<br><br>Normally i go to lunch at 11.30 to beat the crowd and return to office by 12 to continue working. I don't go for tea breaks so i use all these time to finish up my work to try minimise the need for OT unless last minute something coop up or worse system down and suay suay recover before 5.30. Till my last day in camp i didn't have the luxury to just spent the whole day in office sleeping even though i spent the last 2-3 days more monitoring and teaching than really working since i left the work to them and start training after they finish what they need do.</div>

Usually, 1 week I need to go CMPB at least once until abt 1630. Only in my last 6 months when my understudy can handle my job scope, I took early tea break with my 2IC in the canteen. Lunch also start early as we have the previlige to da pao in lunch boxes from the cook house from the officer side and sometime extra dishes due to the good relationship between us and the cook house IC.</div>

Including my own leaves n offs, i had less than 10 days to train them and from someone who dunno the entire ES system and transport/maintainance workflow, they had to master everything in that short time period which i won't say was easy. They didn't learn everything 100% but if they managed to absorb 75% of all the things i taught them i think it would already be gd.</div>

I heard my understudy not doing well as well cos of the 2, the better 1 got posted out and the weaker 1 stayed. However with just 10 days or so of training, i can't really blame them for something i took half a year to self study and practice to learn. Even with guidance, they still lack the experience which is something they need depend on themselves.</div>

That's what happened to my understudy. Did not pick up quick enough also did not ask for advice before I left so I presume he know everything.</div>

The 1 left is the 1 that got problem he also won't call and i need call him to check if hes doing well before i know all the things that is messed up. After i left unit only had 1 call from the better understudy and after he posted out, no more calls liao but is that meaning everything going on smoothly? I don't think so...</div>
