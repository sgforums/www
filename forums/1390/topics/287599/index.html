            <div class='col-md body'>Mine was stay-in, &amp; the signing in &amp; out was done on code of honour. But the COS would remove the book after the cutoff timing, eg. 2359 or 0730. Hard to fake in my unit cuz, on the one hand, everyone was queueing up to sign out (hence plenty of witnesses) &amp;, on the other, the camp guardroom would take note of who arrived after midnight. The company line would usually conduct their first parades by 0745.<br><br>I tio 2 weekend extras before, when in a hurry to report for the latter &amp; forgot to book in.</div>
