              <p>Dear gents/ladies,</p>
              <p>I am currently serving as a commando officer with about 4 months more to my ORD. As the current training programme is kind of low key it allows me time to ponder upon my life after ORD.</p>
              <p>Currently, I'm keen on trying out for a pilot position in the RSAF after my ORD before uni starts in 2012 and I have a few enquiries that I believe the more experienced have answers to.</p>
              <p>1) I'm currently an 'A' level holder with mediocre grades and little flying knowledge/experience. How eligible am I for the acceptance of RSAF pilot training?</p>
              <p>2) How is the pay structure like during before and after pilot training?</p>
              <p>3) What are the chances for <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14px; "><strong>Local Study Award (LSA) - Pilot / WSO(FTR) </strong></span> scholarship and assuming I clinched the scholarship, does the 6 year bond add on to the 10 year pilot bond?</p>
              <p>4) RSAF pilot or SIA pilot?</p>
              <p>Please advise, many thanks! :)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Well, got a friend who's a naval diver and signed on as RSAF pilot trainee aged 27. Then know of people who were commando officers and got in with SIA. The qualities learned in commando training are highly valued by those SIA recruiters, who themselves are senior pilots. Good luck.</p></div>

              <p>@Rednano: Haha I've checked out the website already but the information there is pretty scarce. I believe the bros here has more info than what is posted on the website</p>
              <p>@Lokey: Hmm because I was considering 6 months extension under CDO camp before my uni starts next year Aug vs doing pilot training and start uni later at probably 24? Assuming I qualified for the RSAF interview I would probably start my pilot training next year at the age of 20, do a 2 year training and then 2-3 years operation. Should be ok I guess?</p>
              <p>@Rockstar: Haha bro would you advise joining RSAF or SIA? Cause the travel aspect of being a pilot is kind of appealing compared to the routine lifestyle of corporate, on top of the passion for flying in the skies of course.</p>

              <p>Well based on what I see of friends....I think you may not be the age for SIA yet. Minimum is aged 26 for male singaporeans. This is because SIA does not want to be competing with RSAF for eligible pilot trainees like yourself. Well, having said that, you can give it a shot to see for yourself.</p>
              <p>RSAF life is more regimental (as you already know) and you may be put to become a transport, fighter or helicopter pilot. Wearing the jumpsuits can be pretty cool haha. The places you travel are limited, likely to be Australia, France and the US. You will have to retire at age 45 I think and then again a job in the commerical airlines is not guaranteed too. Major airlines are giving military pilots a miss because somehow, the SOPs of commercial and military pilots just don't co-exist.</p>
              <p>SIA I would recommend you anytime because of the higher package. What's more, you get to see the world. And your aircraft rating of B777, B747, A380 is recognised anywhere in the world. Which means you can become a global citizen should you decide to leave SIA. Then again, the age requirement.</p>
              <p>My 2 cents worth :)</p>

              <p>At the age of 45? I was looking at a ten year term before transferring to commercial. One plus point that draws me to doing RSAF first is the LSA scholarship which funds me monthly during my uni. Can't survive without a nice stable income, especially when it comes to the prime time peak of 25... 'chionging' 3 times a week is gonna be a problem without money :P</p>
              <p>And yes I'm totally with you with regards to the global citizen point. I love Singapore but I love the vagabond lifestyle even more and being a pilot, in my opinion funds me pretty well in that lifestyle. Bachelor ftw</p>

              <p>SIA no more min age limit of 26.</p>
              <p>Choose your path wisely. You are right to say a lotta CDOs end up as pilots, esp Fighter. Need ppl who are aggressive. Trust me. I know.</p>
              <p>If you want to see the world, managing computers on board a Boeing or Airbus, then go SIA. Lifestyle better. If you want to fly fighter jets, then try for RSAF pilot. But be warned, the journey to get there is ardous. The life is not suited for everyone.</p>
