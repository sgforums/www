              <p>Hello! I need some help and advice regarding my problem, so I hope the 'seniors' here can advise me accordingly.</p>
              <p>I'm enlisted in early Feb 2011, into a special unit BMT not located in Tekong (shall-not-be-named). PES status at PES B1 due to childhood + mild-exercise-induced asthma and sports injury, which took me half a year to recover. Before my enlistment, I've always had neck problems for several years (since childhood!); I get strain pains on both side of my neck and shoulder, and the pain is 'on and off'. It does affect my lifestyle to a certain extent, and I've consulted many doctors before in the past. X-Ray results were shown to be normal, specialist didn't offer much aid as all he said was just a postural problem, chinese sinsehs could only alleviate the pain for only a temporary period before the strain pain comes back again. Told MO at CMPB during medical checkup, but he say "NO SPECIALIST MEMO NO TALK".</p>
              <p>During my first week of BMT where we started slinging our rifle and wearing the armor vest (ILBV), the pain became sharper and affected me greatly. I reported to my camp's MO, and requested to be referred to a specialist at CGH.</p>
              <p>Over at the hospital, the specialist did an X-Ray for me. Results also showed that it was normal, but the doctor mentioned that my bones looked rather worned-out for my age. On the memo, his diagnosis was a suspicion that I've Cervical Spondylosis, and gave me 2 months of lights duty and excuse heavy load. I was also scheduled to go for an MRI scan a month later (2 weeks later from today's date).</p>
              <p>Returning to report to my camp's MO, he thinks that I'm malingering. So I told him that I didn't want to take up the MC and want to try continuing my BMT. However 2 days later, the pain became very unbearable and I went back to the MO. He gave me 6 weeks of light duty, as well as excuse from PT, marching, jumping and all sorts of physical activity. In the meantime now, I'm only allowed to sit one side and not be allowed to participate in any form of physical activity. My company's OC is also not willing to post me out, and wants me to wait aimlessly until at my MRI scan is out.</p>
              <p>So my question(s) here is, since I will only participate in my BMT officially for 1 more week, is it likely that i'm OOC and I have to recourse? Since I can't do my IPPT/outfield/SOC.</p>
              <p>Will all the time 'wasted' be part of my service liabilities?</p>
              <p>Will my PES status be changed if MRI scan comfirms that I have Cervical Spondylosis? And what PES would I be downgraded to?</p>
              <p>If my MRI scan turns out normal, what's going to happen to me? And how am I going to deal with this strain problem that affects even my daily lifestyle?</p>
              <p>Is there anything else I can do apart from waiting aimlessly? Because it's a pain seeing people doing PT yet I'm on status, which makes me a 'slacker'.</p>
              <p>So what I should do/not do during this period of 'waiting' time? I need help X.X Thanks so much!</p>
