Any one care to elaborate on the pros and cons of it? i mean besides lack of job exp that is.</div></blockquote>Cons are too many and many are big road blocks<br>1.) U must get into OCS. If u follow the SAF threads, u know by now, unless u are scholar or nerd or white horse, OCS is consider a heng suay thing because till now, I still have no idea how they pick ppl for OCS (judging by the clowns they commissioned each batch) (Ok, maybe I am abit mean but till now I really haben meet an officer I 100% respect, only Enciks)<br><br>2.) Next, u manage to get into OCS, the next step: study. As I said, there are already scholars, nerds and white horses. So what are your chances of securing a scholarship or grant?<br><br>3.) Ok, no grant neber mind, u get no pay-leave to come out study. No need to explain here, one word is enough: Study.<br><br>4.) Uni finish go back SAF, again depending on what u sign-on as, u sign-on as chiong sua type, u think got time to take part-time studies ah?<br><br>5.) Ok, some how to find the time to get out to take part-time MBA, u think u can escape SAF duties one meh? Even officers have duties one, sometimes the CO arrow u liao, u can say u dun one do meh?<br><br>6.) Finally, u get ORD from the SAF, armed with a Uni degree and a MBA at the age of what? 30s? Late 30s? Go ahead, I would really like to see how to sit at manager position interview answering this simple question "What experience you have in so-and-so business operation?"<br><br>And you must remember, u are now competing in a level playing field which means there are going to be people in the same age range, also armed with a uni degree and MBA with tons of real work experience.<br><br>So now you know why there are ex regular officers, with degrees and MBAs driving taxis.<br><br>So the moral of the story, unless u are elite, sign-on is just the same as getting screwed but hey, if u dun mind getting screwed. Go ahead.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Be positive ......... there are cons.<br><br>Age 18 - with reasonable good A levels, get a Local Training Award (no need for President Scholarship).<br>Sign-on for officer corps - sure get into OCS. When signing on, you choose between specialists and officers, so if you choose officer, you must get into OCS.<br>Age 19 - enter University (NUS) after OCS. 2LT (then LTA) pay while studying for 4 years.<br>Age 23 - Platoon Commander appointment for 1-2 years<br>Age 24 - one staff tour in HQ<br>Age 26 - OC for 2-3 years (CPT- MAJ)<br>Age 28 - Staff appointment in HQ<br><br>If you start your part-time MBA programme at age 24, you can complete it by age 28, assuming that you are kept very busy sometimes. As early as you start your MBA programme, indicate that you are leaving the SAF to your superior and your load will decrease. But do your part, be it the minimum.<br><br>You can leave the SAF below the age of 30 armed with an MBA. Your peers will be slogging in the civilian sector all these times, and probably cannot make MBA without a lot more sacrifice than you.<br><br>In terms of work experience, you may lose out a little bit. But you know what ? Most SAF officers are able to do well in studies because there is no financial burden ...... full salary while studying.<br><br>This route is meant for those who wish to be financially independant, or whose family will be stressed to finance their children through University.<br><br>And not to worry too much about the next employment. In the past, there are fewer SAF officers in the civilian sectors, and most people go through NS without making it to Officership, and lack the understanding what these officers are capable of. Now, there are more and more ex-SAF officers who will be willing to employ another ex-SAF officer because they appreciate the values and attitude.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>KoolKool....<br><br>while I agree with your path and route of advancement... I have some nagging doubts about this path...<br><br>for one...getting an MBA is one thing.. but w/o any particular experience in the private sector.. it's really going to be an uphill task finding a job. Commanding men is really different from private sector work..<br><br>and MBA + SAF + duties/outfield means a strain in your social life. But here it's all about what you want to gain in life. Since there is financial security whilst furthering one's studies... i think just 'pia-ing' can be well worth it.<br><br>my personal opinion stands that don't just think of Army as a quick way to 'earn yr degree/Masters' while being a 'part-time' regular. The whole SAF stands to lose out because of such people who are in there just to pass time. And why so many NSFs/Regulars/NSmen have such negative experiences about regulars who are in there 'zuo bo' till pay day.<br><br>Although I hope to see, in the future, more credible schemes for regulars in middle mgmt to be able to find relevant work in the pte/public sector. And not only allow top brass to move on to be Directors or CEOs in the public sector.<br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sir sickolot II:</div><div class="quote_body">my personal opinion stands that don't just think of Army as a quick way to 'earn yr degree/Masters' while being a 'part-time' regular. The whole SAF stands to lose out because of such people who are in there just to pass time. And why so many NSFs/Regulars/NSmen have such negative experiences about regulars who are in there 'zuo bo' till pay day.<br><br>Although I hope to see, in the future, more credible schemes for regulars in middle mgmt to be able to find relevant work in the pte/public sector. And not only allow top brass to move on to be Directors or CEOs in the public sector.<br><br>cheers</div></blockquote>Well, while I can agree with you that the SAF tends to lose out in terms of getting less committed people, but it is a very huge government organisation that can help churn out talents.<br><br>It does not matter to me that the guys leave the Army after their paper chase. Their next contribution in the private sector is also important to Singapore's economy. Its like MOE does not bond you to serve after getting years of 'free or subsidised' education. So, Government bodies are like stepping stones, and if you can make use of it, why not ?</div>
