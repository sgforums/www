            <div class='col-md body'>
              Dear all,
              
              I write in with regards to my PES upgrading. I am currently a perm PES E9L9 due to some psychiatric problems.
              
              I have previously seen a shrink back when I was studied in secondary school. During that period of time, I told my psychiatry I would suffer from hallucinations whenever I feel stress. Hence, I was prescribed with anti-depressants and was strongly advised to consume them daily.Â 
              
              However, I have decided to stop seeing the psychiatrist back in June 2009 as I informed her that my condition has improved. Hence, she put me on an open appointment for the next 2 years. During this window period, she strongly stressed that I would come back to see her if I ever have any stress-related problems. On top of that, she has continued to prescribe me with the above-mentioned medicine.
              
              So, during my poly years back in early 2010 I couldn't cope with my school environment which brought me to see a school counselor. During the consultation, it has brought to my counselor's attention that I have some issues with my classmates that made me wanted to drop out of school. She advised me to continue with my studies as I shouldn't be bothered byÂ these people. I insisted. I told her how much I hate my course and I have zero interest in whatever I was learning there.
              
              During the subsequent counseling sessions, my mother has also been called up for the sessions with me. After a hard time debating on my conditions,  we finally came up with a decision to put a stop in my 2 years of studies.
              
              Â Eventually we discussed about NS. It was then my counselor strongly advised me to downgrade my PES status as she thought that I wouldn't be able to pull through from the heavy workload in army given my medical conditions. 
              
              On top of that, she also added that I could take up some night classes during my NS since I would be going off at 5pm.  Â Â Â  Â  Â Â 
              
              A few months after I stopped my school, I have received an enlistment letter and I was scheduledÂ to report for a pre-enlistee medical check-up at CMPB in late April 2010. As advised, I declared my medical conditions during one of the reviews. I was eventually posted to PES D.
              
              During the long break from Feb 2010 to Sept 2010, I have worked in many places and surprisingly I do not have any relapse despite some harsh times I had during work.
               
              In early Oct 2010, I have finally been enlisted to a 4-week PES E BMT stay-out camp in Kranji Camp 3.
              
              The life in the BMT was rather relaxing as all we were asked to do was to answer some questions from the movies we watched. Occasionally, we would visit some military museums and there was once we were even brought to tour around the NEWater plants! I have made many friends there and I pretty much looking forward to go back to my camp each day.
              
              Finally, it was time to move to a new place. It was then I was designated to a position of an Admin Support Assistant (ASA) at Changi Airbase. Truthfully speaking, I totally hate clerical jobs as it was totally boring and meaningless. 
              
              Well, I do not have any problem communicating with the officers and any of the clerks out there. The thing is, I prefer to be a combatant. I want to stay in as I do not like the idea of traveling daily. Hence, I decided to try my luck to go for an upgrade of my PES status during the first month of my new posting. However, a few words from some of my fellow campmates held back my intention as I learnt from them that only temp PES E serviceman are eligible to do an upgrade of PES status. So, I gave up.
              
              However, things came to a turning point when I received a letter from IMH informing me that they have discharged me from the case as I have reported to have no relapse for more than a year. I eventually consulted my camp MO for an upPES review.
              
              During the consultation, the first question the MO asked me was about the reasons why I want to upgrade my PES status. I told him truthfully that I totally dislike office jobs and how much I prefer to be a combatant. The next question he had for me was, " Do you still have any relapse of hallucination? " I shook my head and gave him a definite no.
              
              He turned to the medic that sat beside him and asked him if I was able to serve BMTC in this case. The medic answered a yes but I would still have to go through a psychiatric review and approval will still have to be given by the Medical Board.
              
              Hence, I was instructed by one of the medics from the Medical Centre to fill up the forms for the Medical Board. On the other hand, the other medic advised me to book a psychiatric review with the MMI and he will accompany me to see the psychiatry during the day of my review. He further instructed me to contact the Medical Centre again in 2 weeks' time as there is no more slots for this month.
              
              Okay, now right I am certainly confused. Hence, I Kindly seek your advices on the following questions.
              
              1. Why does the medic wouldn't just book the review for me in the next month instead of asking me to wait for 2 weeks to book a slot?
              
              2. Why does he needs to come with me on the day of my review?
              
              3. Why do I need to signÂ on the Medical Board form when I have to go through the review. The medic told me that the results will come out in a week's time. The what is the purpose of the medical review. Shouldn't it be the other way round?
              
              4. Is there any cases whereby servicemen have their PES status upgraded for a PERM E9L9?
              
              Thank you for taking your precious time reading this. I sincerely hope that I can get good advices for my conditions.Â Â  Â  Â Â

              Hi Ryantechnology
              
              I was a PES E1L9 perm during my NS but have upgraded and I have now signed on with the Army.
              
              As long as you can satisfy the Medical Board that you have recovered from your condition, I see no reason why they will not give it to you.
              
              Good luck!

              Hi alize, not really. What makes you think this way?
              
              One downside about being PES E is being asked about your NS vocation during your job hunt. Replying that one was a clerk or storeman will raise suspicions!
              
              Although the MO at MCC tells you that you are not required to tell the employer your PES status nor what you are downgraded for, common sense tells us that the employer will definitely feel you have something to hide!
              
               I personally had one job offer retracted when the prospective employer knew about my PES status. I had already passed through all the interviews and was left withe medical check up. Although I was clear of the condition I was downgraded for, and had a doctor's letter to prove it (otherwise how would I have been upgraded to PES B?), the company doctor did not buy my idea and decided not to clear me for the job.
              
              So it really depends what TS wants from his NS. He evidently does not want to serve just as a clerk. I applaud his spirit.
              
              I don't know what's the big deal about IPPT. It's a good way to ensure you keep fit and, as NSmen, get some extra money as well!

              Perm PES E is what many dream of. I rather be PES E if I have a choice. I don't love Singapore from young. My love for country is further eroded when many foreigners come in and further erode my national identity.
              
              In a MRT cabin almost half is Foreigners. They even cause me to stand all the way home. Lastime Jurong east most likely can get a seat not It's no longer the case.
