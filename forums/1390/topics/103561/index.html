This is a good example of poor discipline on the part of the guard commander.<br><br>Firstly, did you brief your guards the standards you are expecting of them? Did you specifically let them know they prowling routes, turn out drills execution and what punishments to be given if standards are not met?<br><br>Or did you simply assume that it's already known? Perhaps not the first time they or you doing duty, so tell them for what? Or maybe that day is your last day of duty, so... what the heck... give them a good one because I want them to be good soldiers?<br><br>Any of the reasons, you are still at fault. Prior to execution of drills, commanders must give detailed explaination of what is the standards to be expected, to the extent of showing himself how you want the drills to be performed. If the men screws up 1st time, then it's still commander's fault, because his briefing is not clear. Brief them again, emphasising the parts they did not achieve 1st time. Before executing the drill again, ensure they know the consequence of not achieving the standards.<br><br>By this time, Singaporeans should already get the point, and execute the drills properly. If you show professionalism and leadership by example, I don't understand why you need 20 x turnouts to bring your point across. If 1 or 2 lazy or rebellious ones still persist, then just recommend extra duties since they display insurbodination. When you give 20 x turnout, you cause misery to the majority of others who are simply trying their best to complete NSF.<br><br>And don't be proud of what you did either. It's as good as using rank or position to bully people. You are just as proud as the commando trainers who dunked heads into water.</div>

Before executing the drill again, ensure they know the consequence of not achieving the standards.<br><br>By this time, Singaporeans should already get the point, and execute the drills properly. If you show professionalism and leadership by example, I don't understand why you need 20 x turnouts to bring your point across. If 1 or 2 lazy or rebellious ones still persist, then just recommend extra duties since they display insurbodination. When you give 20 x turnout, you cause misery to the majority of others who are simply trying their best to complete NSF.<br><br>And don't be proud of what you did either. It's as good as using rank or position to bully people. You are just as proud as the commando trainers who dunked heads into water.</div></blockquote>wow piang, dun tell me what to do as a Guard Comm lah ... and I never mentioned I felt proud about it .... different ppl got different approach ... and please .. what is the title of this topic ... is "TEKAN" ... if you are so sincere to bring your recommendation across this forum, I suggest you create a new topic as in "How to be a good Guard Commander?"<br></div>

I always hated it whenever my PS during my BMT days tekaned people for no good reason (he got tekan us for following OTHER instructors' orders!!!)<br><br>However, when I became a spec myself, I swear to God, I NEVER tekan-ed any of my men. I have never ordered anyone to knock it down or run and touch the tree, or anything like that.<br><br>Sure, I really scolded them like siao when they made ultimate screw-ups. One of my men, for example, ran off while his PS was scolding him. He could have easily been charged for insubordination. I just went to look for him and gave him the ultimate 'hair-dryer' session.<br><br>I hated having to do that, but, hey, he was going to be a spec himself.</div>
