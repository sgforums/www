I thought i was dreaming as it was 0200 hours in the morning so i asked my buddy and he mentionned that he heard it too.  As i was holding onto the walkie, i coms back to guard room to ask for instruction and was instructed to do a area check while the GC informed the BOS and DO.  as the foot steps was inside the shed, i have to leopard crawl in and i ask my buddy to cover me.

Brings to me flash back when i [b]<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ACTUALLY</span></strong>have to load my rifle with five life rounds while on prowling.  That year was 1999, i was only a coporal then so have to do prowling duty.  I was at 10 SIB, Selarang Camp.  So what happen was when i was out on prowling detail with my buddy, nearing the 9 Signal vehicle holding shed when i thought i heard foot steps running.  I thought i was dreaming as it was 0200 hours in the morning so i asked my buddy and he mentionned that he heard it too.  As i was holding onto the walkie, i coms back to guard room to ask for instruction and was instructed to do a area check while the GC informed the BOS and DO.  as the foot steps was inside the shed, i have to leopard crawl in and i ask my buddy to cover me.  However, as i was crawling in under the gate, both my buddy and i heard voices in hokkien saying faster run,  kena spotted already!" also at the same time, i heard tin cans dropping onto the floor.<br><br>Without hestitation, i immediately load my rifle with five rounds and ask my buddy to take cover while i coms back guard Room and report to the GC what has just happened.  Was told that BOS and DO on the way and told to stay put at my location while Stand To was activated.<br><br>Soon later, the BOS and the DO arrived with the GC and together withnthem, we comb the area and found that part of the fence was actually pried open and that there were tin cans on the floor.  As the shed contains some TS equipment(signal Stuff), Do ordered another round of check while the BOS coms the guard room asking them to remain on high alert.<br><br>After about fifteen minutes, nothing else was found to be amiss and stand to cleared.  The BOS cleared both the arms of me and my buddy and we were asked to write a detail report about what has happened.<br><br>ome to think of it now, it's rather fun.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote> empty tin cans? or is it canned food?</div>
