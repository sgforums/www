              <p>Hi guys and girls,</p>
              <p>I recently applied to RSAF as an Engineer. I am wondering if there are anyone working in RSAF who knows roughly:</p>
              <p>How long it takes them to contact you for interview?</p>
              <p>How many interviews are there total?</p>
              <p>What are the job scopes and training like?</p>
              <p>For an aerospace degree holder, what is my pay scheme like?</p>

              <p>Thanks for the link, I have read that thoroughly. It was why I actually posted these questions on every forum I could find.</p>
              <p>Maybe it was the way I structured my questions that made it seem difficult to interpret. Sorry for that.</p>
              <p>Let me try again...</p>
              <p>I would like to know how long in terms of days/weeks/months for them to contact you upon the online registration. I have checked the website however it was not stated anywhere. I even did not receive any confirmation email that you usually receive stating for e.g. " We will contact you within 1-2 weeks".</p>
              <p>How many interviews; when I tried applying for senior tech about 6 years ago before attaining my degree, there were said to be 2 interviews. The first was in a group presentation followed by individual interviews. The 2nd interview would also be individual however with more interviewers.</p>
              <p>Job scopes and training are very different from what can be found on the websites at least from my experience. Website tend to generalize and sugarcoat their descriptions. It is always best to gather info from a few employees.</p>
              <p>Although they gave a range for the pay scheme of 3790-4840 it also applies to other engineering degree holders. It may also apply to masters I assumed. Anyway my point being that I wish to shorten the pay range according to my degree field so I may have a clearer trade-off between other aerospace industries.</p>
              <p>I hope this gives you a clearer understanding of what kind of answers I am looking for. Sorry for the previous post, it was not comprehensive enough.</p>

              <p>Hi bro,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Frankly speaking, don't expect their replies coz they usually won't respond via emails.</p>
              <p>I would suggest you call their recruitment hotline directly @ <span>1800 270 1010</span></p>
              <p>So based on your username, I presume you're a Muslim?</p>
