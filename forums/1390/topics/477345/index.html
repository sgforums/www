              BMT</span></strong><br> This 9-week programme trains combat-fit recruits in the basic
              military skills to prepare them for advanced vocational training.
              The programme includes weapon training with the SAR 21 rifle which
              will teach recruits technical handling and marksmanship skills; a
              Battle Inoculation Course that simulates a real battlefield; a
              Field Camp which develops basic survival skills; progressive
              training to complete a 24-km route march which builds combat
              fitness and endurance; and hand grenade training.<br> <em><span style="font: inherit;">For those who fail to achieve the
              NAPFA test silver award, they are required to undergo an 8-week
              Physical Training Phase (PTP) prior to the PES A/B1
              BMT.</span></em><br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES BP
              BMT</span></strong><br> As evidence has shown that obese recruits are able to achieve
              optimum fitness levels and weight loss in about 19 weeks, the new
              BMT programme for recruits with Body Mass Index (BMI) scores
              exceeding 27.0 will be 19 weeks. This BMT programme is designed to
              help obese recruits improve their physical fitness progressively
              while equipping them with basic soldiering skills and
              knowledge.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES B2
              BMT</span></strong><br> Enlistees who were PES C1 previously underwent a 7-week BMT
              programme. The new 9-week PES B2 BMT programme will be conducted
              for recruits who are medically fit for deployment in selected
              combat and combat support vocations, such as signal operators,
              combat medics and naval system operators. These recruits will be
              given a new medical classification of PES B2, in place of the
              existing PES C1 classification. This is to ensure that the medical
              classification of our soldiers is consistent with their deployment.
              The new 9-week programme will include customised physical training,
              as well as basic combat training to prepare them for their combat
              and combat support roles.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES C
              BMT</span></strong><br> The 9-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES C recruits. This
              programme will include light physical training and vocational
              training to prepare them for combat service support vocations, such
              as service medic, and those related to logistics and
              administration.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES E
              BMT</span></strong><br> The 4-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES E recruits. This
              programme will focus on, vocational training as well as National
              Education, SAF core values, regimentation and discipline to prepare
              recruits for combat service support vocations.</p>

              <h2 class="pageTitle">Enlistment schedule</h2>
              <p>Pre-enlistees will be required to complete pre-enlistment procedures 
                      and medical screening before they are scheduled for enlistment.</p>
              <p>They will be scheduled for enlistment into the respective enlistment 
                      intakes based on numerous considerations such as the medical &amp; 
                      physical fitness and educational qualifications of the individual, as 
                      well as the manpower and operational requirements of the various 
                      intakes.</p>
              <p>In general, pre-enlistees from the same 'A' level/International 
                      Baccalaureate (IB) or polytechnic cohort are enlisted over two intakes 
                      due to capacity constraints at the NS training schools. For example, 'A'
                       level/ IB holders who graduate in Nov/Dec are typically enlisted in the
                       Dec and Mar quarterly intakes. Polytechnic diploma holders who graduate
                       in Mar/Apr are typically enlisted in the Jun and Sep quarterly intakes.
                       ITE certificate holders and pre-enlistees with other qualifications are
                       enlisted throughout the year.</p>
              <p>Pre-enlistees can only be assigned to an enlistment intake after 
                      being certified medically fit for enlistment at the pre-enlistment 
                      medical screening.  Pre-enlistees will receive Enlistment Notices to 
                      notify them of their enlistment date about 2 months before their 
                      scheduled enlistment.</p>
              <p><em>Notes:</em><br>Pre-enlistees who are graded PES A/B1 and who attained a NAPFA
               Silver or Gold award in the 12 months before their enlistment date will
               be enlisted for their 9-week BMT directly. Pre-enlistees with PES A/B1 
              but who have not attained a NAPFA Silver or Gold award in the 12 months 
              before their enlistment date will be enlisted into an 8-week PTP prior 
              to the commencement of their 9-week BMT.</p>
              <p>Enlistment dates are subjected to adjustment, due to operational requirements.</p>
              <p><em>If you have queries regarding your enlistment date or the 
              enlistment schedule, please call 1800-eNSNSNS (1800-367 6767) for

              <p>There are 2 important notices you'll receive from <abbr title="Central Manpower Base">CMPB</abbr>, these are listed below: <br><br><strong>Registration notice</strong>: you'll get this notice when you reach 17½ years old. It will inform you to do your NS registration. <br><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Enlistment notice</strong>: this notice will be sent to you about 2 months before the Date of Enlistment (<abbr title="Date of Enlistment">DOE</abbr>).</p>
              <p>The objective of these tests is to ascertain your medical condition 
              and accord you a suitable Physical Employment Status (PES). Based on 
              your PES, you will be assigned to a suitable vocation.</p>
              <p>Here are the various PES gradings:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>PES A</strong>: Fit for all combat vocations </li>
              <li><strong>PES B1</strong>: Fit for most combat vocations </li>
              <li><strong>PES B2</strong>: Fit for some combat vocations</li>
              <li><strong>PES BP</strong>: Fit for obese <abbr title="Basic Military Training">BMT</abbr> training</li>
              <li><strong>PES C</strong>: Fit for combat support vocations </li>
              <li><strong>PES D</strong>: Temporary unfit for grading and pending further review</li>
              <li><strong>PES E</strong>: Fit for administrative duties only</li>
              <li><strong>PES F</strong>: Medically unfit for any form of service</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Note that if you are given a <abbr title="Physical Employment Status">PES</abbr> D grading, it means that more time/tests are required to confirm your 
              medical condition. This normally takes about 2-3 months. However, this 
              duration may be longer depending on your medical condition.</p>
