            <div class='col-md body'>I do not have a maid in the first place. And also, its stupid for me to employ a maid to serve NS on my behalf. I mean hell...when you guys who have served or are serving bitch about being in there, low pay and all that, and you see those wise ass who doesn't have to serve, you complain. What for? Cuz u want them to suffer what you didn't like in the 1st place?Its plain childish, to be frank it would actually be bad to have those highly motivated ones and those who take pride in their work to be downplayed by the few who have no pride nor faith in the system which has kept us safe for the past 40yrs and 9mths!</div>
