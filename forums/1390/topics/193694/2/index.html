            <div class='col-md body'>Pride can only come about when people do the things they want to do.<br><br>NSF/"reservist" personnel are conscripts - drafted by the law.<br><br>When you are young and have lots of dreams and places that you want to be - it really sucks.<br><br>It is also well-known and quite human-nature to dislike something when there is compulsion.<br><br>I would think that some of the underlying reasons for failure to develop pride:<br><br>1. compulsion by law<br><br>2. Poor distribution of personnel to vocations - you get sent to whatever vocation, ie, no choice and usually little regards for skills and interests<br><br>3. Singapore administrative/government culture - quid pro quo attitudes towards its own citizens. If you have not completed NSF - you have to post bond $75 000 if you accompany your parents overseas or if you go to school outside of Singapore - you are treated like a potential criminal. This attitude cannot engender loyalty/patriotism. Besides, people have to decide for themselves where their own loyalties, values, cultures lie - and may not be in Singapore. Why compel people to be Singaporeans when they don't want to?<br>Anyway, we all pay taxes so that people who are legally in Singapore should be educated, cared for to the extent that they are productive, safe, functional members of a community. So what's up with asking back $75 000?!?<br><br>4. Loss of economic/educational advancement in the time-period of full-time NS.<br><br>To increase pride in service, I would suggest attitudinal framework changes that have to permeate through Singapore society:<br><br>1. Re-enact the National Service law: Amend the Constitution to include a Bill of Rights including a right to bear arms - manifested through satutory organs as the Armed Forces law. Improve education with regards to the issue of "citizen's only" right to bear arms - history has shown that in many countries where group(s) of people that have been excluded from participating in the military or of training in self-defence - they get bullied, massacred, placed in concentration camps. There is a pressing need to show why this is a citizen's right to do military training and bearing arms. You will get pride.<br><br>2. First generation citizens also have to perform NS be it military for age-eligible or SCDF or other community service corps for those who are not fit for military duties. The only pathyway to citizenship is through NS.<br><br>3. Introduce a National Security Tax, say 1% on all income tax for all tax-residents in Singapore. Use the income to re-distribute to active/reservist NS personnel. This does not equal the efforts or sacrifice of NS man but goes a long way to compensate them in a more tangible way. I think if NSF were being paid $1000 to $2000 per month after undergoing basic or vocational training, they will have more pride. Also it will also inculcate a culture of working for income and independence. It will feedback into the economy. For too long our youg people stay close to their parents and do not have a gung-ho, do it yourself attitude. If you can pay young people adequately - they can then also move out, share an apartment with friends etc. Singapore will be the better for it I think. Singapore has too much on a rely on government/parents thingy.<br><br>What do you guys think?<br><br></div>

But true indeed. No matter how slack, fcuk up, or just tiring a vocation is....one should never abandon their job scope. everyone has its role to play. and i think that is the greatest pride one could ever have.

But don't you think its pretty selfish to think that way? The least that can be done is to change their mindset. And yes, this is the military, not some democratic organization, but the thing is, I've seen and heard of people who when tasked with completing an assignment, unless it has some benefits to them, they will have this mentality of "U ask me do, I got do better then never do" sorta mentality. I once spoke to this 3SG from 6SIR, about his duties. Yes, he had great understanding and all, but guess what he said? There are times when it gets totally boring, he justs go off to a corner and nap or chat on the phone while he is supposed to be manning the station. And personally, being in the NCC as a CLT, on certain nights as I rove to ensure the cadets are asleep, I've seen prowlers hiding below the stairwells to smoke and chat. How responsible and how much pride do they have? What if something cocks up?<br><br></div>
