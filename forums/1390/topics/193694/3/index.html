He thinks he wants to give his all to the country, then let him...as I always say, live and let live, and as for us and many others out there, let us make our own decisions as to whether we feel pride or not...heck its just passing time, going thru the motions if you ask me....so as not to get into trouble...<br><br>When all is said and done, we all will find our fortune in our own way, in other countries of course....then again SAF is here also to serve a purpose, to be a client to many companies here in SG...<br><br>Sometimes, I feel so sick and tired of berating SAF, its just best that we go elsewhere after going thru the motions.....its all a matter of personal choice...after all, no one can force us not to love SAF or to just pack up and renounce SG...hahaha<br><br>Anyone got any thoughts.</div>

I do not care what other countries are doing. Do you think those troops like that? Fact: It is not right that there are not enough blanks being issued. It is not right that soldiers have to pretend and shout 'bang bang bang'.<br><br>What other countries? By that I suppose you mean the US army? The brits do not sing when running.<br><br>SAF, at least the Singapore army, does not generally provide 'top notch training'. On the contrary, training is generally of the tick-in-the-box just get it over with variety. Instructors are, as i said before, out of their depth. The exception to this, of course, is when non-SAF instructors are involved. Eg. SAF driving courses. But even these courses are being whittled down.<br><br>How many rounds does the active infantry soldier get to fire in a year? I would say the answer is simply 'not enough'.<br><br>I cited the lack of blanks generally as an example. I cited the lack of range time as an example as well. I will cite another example: How many times have the m203 gunner fired his m203? You do not have to give the answer in an open forum, but all who have served will know the answer - Not Enough!<br><br>What about SAF's survival training? What sort of practical is involved? Do students actually learn survival skills? Do they have enough practice?<br><br>All these point to training not being taken seriously in the SAF. I do not think any reasonable person can conclude otherwise.</div>
