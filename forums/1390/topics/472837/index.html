              <p>My window is closing soon and I've only cleared 7 RT sessions. There's no way I'm going to pass on the 8th. I can always extend my window by a month but as I'll be overseas for the whole of next month it does not make sense to do so.</p>
              <p>Would it be possible to just pay the $50/100 fine and settle this window or will they force me to complete the remaining 13 sessions even after paying the fine?</p>
              <p>Help!</p>

              <p>The enhanced NS IPPT system requires NSmen to pass their IPPT
                   by the first 9 months of their birthday window so that early assistance
                   in the form of RT can be provided. This allows the NSmen to maintain 
                  and sustain their level of fitness.</p>
              <p><strong>Design</strong></p>
              <p>RT training will be conducted for NSmen who (1) failed or defaulted 
                  their IPPT during the first 9 months of their birthday window and (2) 
                  for those who failed to meet the required PPT. RT must be completed 
                  during the last 3 months of their IPPT birthday window. See Figure 1 for
                   illustration. There are two types of RT programs as shown.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>8 sessions of RT for those who completed the 10-session IPT/E1 PEP program but did not meet the PPT.<br> </li>
              <li>20 sessions of RT for IPPT failures and defaulters, and IPT defaulters who did not complete the 10-session IPT/E1 PEP program. <br> </li>

              <p><strong>Applicability </strong><br> <br> All PES A, B/B1 and B2/C1 NSmen (below the age of 45 years for Officers 
                  and 40 years for WOSE) will be required to undergo RT during the last 3 
                  months of their IPPT Birthday Window if they default/fail their IPPT or 
                  did not meet the PPT (for those who attended IPT).<br> <br> <strong>When will I be exempted from RT?</strong><br> You will be exempted from RT under the following circumstances:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Permanently downgraded to PES C2 and below; <br></li>
              <li>On ROVERS/VOLUNTEERS scheme; <br></li>
              <li>Have 4 months continuous or 7 
                  months cumulative medical exemption within the first 9 months of the 
                  IPPT birthday window. <br></li>
              <li>Have achieved the annual IPPT requirement or 
                  IPT/E1 PEP PPT during the first 9 months of the IPPT birthday window.<br> </li>
              </ol>
              <p><strong>When will I be released from RT?</strong><br> You will be released from RT under the following conditions:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Pass ICT-IPPT, any of the IPPT conducted during the RT program, or non-ICT IPPT.</li>
              <li>Complete the full duration of the RT program.</li>
              <li>Meet PPT for those who are attending the 8 sessions RT after completing the IPT/E1 PEP.</li>
              </ol>
              <p><strong>Attendance during RT </strong><br> <br> RT is an NS call-up activity and attendance for every RT session is 
                  compulsory. NSmen who are not able to complete their RT obligations in 
                  the last 3 months will be deemed as “RT defaulters” and will be called 
                  up by their NS Unit/CDMB for investigation, and those without valid 
                  reasons will be disciplinary dealt with.<br> <strong><br> RT Training Schedule </strong><br> <br> There is no fixed RT schedule. NSmen are free to book the days for their training sessions as reflected at the <a href="https://www.ns.sg/nsp/web/esvcs/common/ippt/book-ippt-rt-ipt">NS Portal Booking System</a>. The RT timings are as follows:</p>

              <p><strong>NS Days </strong><br> <br> Each RT session will be computed as a ½ day service and will count 
                  towards the NSman's annual NS of 40 days. Attendance of ICT has priority
                   over RT and only the balance of the call-up days will be used for RT 
                  call-ups.<br> <br> <strong>Pay </strong><br> <br> NSmen will be paid ½ day service pay for each RT session attended. The 
                  respective FCC will submit the attendance list via IRIS, within 4 
                  working days of the session, to NS Pay to process the payment. NS Pay 
                  will then effect the payment on a weekly basis.<br> <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Medical Review of NSmen </span></strong><br> <br> Specific medical certification of fitness for each RT session is not 
                  necessary. However, NSmen who are 35 years old and above must be 
                  certified fit. NSmen who do not have valid certification of fitness for 
                  IPPT will not be allowed to proceed with the RT sessions. NSmen 
                  certified unfit or temporarily unfit for IPPT will also be deemed unfit 
                  for RT for the same duration.<br> <br> <strong>RT Sessions spreading across 2 birthday windows </strong><br> In special circumstances where the NSmen’s RT schedule crosses IPPT 
                  windows (i.e. the NSmen's birthday fall in the middle of the RT), 
                  re-certification of fitness for IPPT for the new IPPT window is required
                   if the NSmen turns age 35 or above in the new window.<br> <br> <strong>What are the disciplinary actions?</strong><br> For our common understanding, the meanings of the names are defined as follows:<br> <br> i.    <strong>IPPT Defaulters</strong><br> These are NSmen who have failed to make any attempt in IPPT throughout 
                  the 9 mth IPPT window and did not qualify for any exemptions.<br> <br> ii.    <strong>RT Defaulters</strong><br> These are NSmen who have failed to complete 20 sessions of RT within the last 3 months of their birthday window. <br> Disciplinary actions will be taken against the defaulters.</p>
              <p><strong>(A)    Graduated Scale of Punishment</strong><br> The appropriate punishment on a graduated scale will be meted out by the
                   Disciplinary Officers (DOs) depending on the NSman’s mitigating pleas, 
                  attitude, service records, previous convictions and performance for past
                   IPPTs/RTs. <br> <br> For recalcitrant defaulters, it may mean heftier fines, custodial 
                  sentences or court martial.  In the event if the NSman is unable to pay 
                  the fine, the DO may order detention in default of payment within 
                  reasonable time based on prevailing guidelines. The detention may take 
                  effect on any date and shall be terminated on payment of fine.<br> <br> <strong>(B)    Central Defaulters Management Branch (CDMB)</strong><br> CDMB was set up as a tri-service shared services structure within the 
                  NSmen Services Centre (NSSC) to manage all IPPT/RT defaulter offenders 
                  on behalf of their parent NS units. The NS Commanders maintain the 
                  prerogative to summary trial the NSmen if they wish to do so. Under such
                   circumstances, CDMB will provide the use of its premises and facilities
                   to conduct the Summary Trial.</p>

              <p>It is essential that you maintain physical fitness and undergo regular training.</p>
              <p>The Enhanced NS IPPT system was implemented on 1 Apr 2011. It 
              incorporates principles of fitness training science to enable NSmen to 
              train more effectively, while offering flexibility in planning their 
              fitness training to stay fit. Individual Physical Proficiency Test 
              (IPPT) is a standard physical fitness test to gauge the basic physical 
              fitness of an individual. The IPPT is a standard physical fitness test 
              designed to test the basic components of physical fitness and motor 
              skills of an individual soldier. In this service package, NSmen can find
               out about policies governing IPPT and book their IPPT dates.</p>
              <p><strong>In the IPPT Gazette under the Enlistment Act dated 26 May 06, if 
              an NSman fails to pass, or fails to take, the IPPT within any IPPT year,
               he will have to attend and complete a remedial training programme at 
              any SAF FCC. <br> </strong>    <br> IPPT can be divided into the followings:</p>
              <ol>
              <li><strong>ICT IPPT</strong><br> This is a requirement for all NSmen participation as part of the ICT programme, unless exempted due to medical reasons.<br> </li>
              <li><strong>Non-ICT IPPT</strong><br> This is conducted at various IPPT test centres and the NSman can make as many attempts at the <strong>Fitness Conditioning Centres</strong> (FCCs). Note that only the first 3 IPPT attempts will be considered 
              towards the NSman’s NS liability and be paid service and make-up pay, if
               applicable.<br> </li>
              </ol>
              <p><strong>SAF Health Screening Programme</strong><br> With effect from 30 May 2011, “IPPT-FFI” was incorporated into the revised<strong> SAF Health Screening Programme</strong>,
               which is the compulsory medical examination for all IPPT-eligible NSmen
               35 years of age and above. There is no need to do a separate "IPPT-FFI"
               if you have already completed the SAF Health Screening Programme for 
              that year.The SAF Health Screening Programme review should be initiated 
              by your NS unit administrator once your IPPT window, i.e. your birthday 
              window is open. <br> <br> If you are IPPT-eligible, 35 years of age and above, you are required to
               complete the SAF Health Screening Programme every year before your IPPT
               attempt. The aim of this medical screening is to detect any medical 
              conditions which may make you unsuitable for the IPPT.Note that if you 
              have not completed your SAF Health Screening Programme requirements for 
              the year, you will not be allowed to take your IPPT. You will be issued 
              with a certificate once you have completed your SAF Health Screening 
              Programme requirements. The certificate is valid for 30 days until your 
              next birthday; i.e. if you are 35 years old, this certificate will be 
              valid until (and including) the 30th day after your 36th birthday.</p>
              <p><strong>Applicability</strong><br> The annual IPPT is applicable to all PES A, B/B1, B2/C1 NSmen and DXO 
              with NS liability, till age 45 and 40 years old for Officers and WOSPEC 
              respectively. The NSman's IPPT annual requirement commences on his 
              birthday immediately after his NSF Operational Ready Date (ORD) and ends
               when he is posted to MINDEF Reserves (MR), or medically downgraded to 
              PES C2 and below.<br> <br> <strong>What is the IPPT Window?</strong><br> <br> The NSman's IPPT window is based on his birthday. The IPPT window 
              commences on his birthday and ends on the day before his next birthday, 
              both days inclusive. NSman who has just ORDed can take his IPPT 
              immediately. The results will be counted towards his IPPT requirements 
              for the first NS year. The IPPT window is divided into two parts as 
              follows:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The first 9 months</span>. <br> Commences on the NSman's birthday and ends on the day before the 10th 
              month of his birthday window. NSman must attempt at least 1 IPPT within 
              this period.</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The last 3 months</span>. Commences on the first day of the 10th 
              month of NSman birthday window and ends on the day before his next 
              birthday. RT must be completed within this period, and will be applied 
              for the following cases:
              <ul>
              <li>20 sessions of RT for IPPT failures and defaulters, and IPT defaulters who did not complete the 10-session IPT program.</li>
              <li>8 sessions of RT for those who completed the 10-session IPT/E1 PEP program but did not meet the PPT.<br> </li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Test Frequency</strong><br> NSmen must attempt at least ONE IPPT within their first 9 months of the 
              IPPT window. They can make as many attempts as they want within their 
              first 9 months of the IPPT window. Regardless of the number of attempts 
              made at the FCC, only the first 3 attempts by the NSman will be 
              considered towards his NS liability and will be paid service and make-up
               pay, if applicable. Notwithstanding this, the SAF will continue to bear
               the responsibility for service injuries sustained by the NSmen whilst 
              attempting the IPPT beyond the third attempt. NSmen will not be allowed 
              to make any more attempts within their annual IPPT window at the FCC 
              after attaining the GOLD standard, regardless of the number of attempts.</p>
              <p><strong>IPPT Requirement<br> </strong>All eligible NSmen must attempt their IPPT once within the first 9 
              months of their IPPT window. They may attempt IPPT during their ICT or 
              at any FCC and may make as many attempts as they want to improve their 
              IPPT results, except for NSmen who have attained the IPPT Gold standards
               for the IPPT year. The best result achieved will be taken as the record
               for that IPPT year.<br> <br> <strong>What are the IPPT exemptions?</strong><br> You are exempted from your annual IPPT if you fit into the following conditions:</p>
              <p>All IPPT-liable NSmen will only be exempted on the following conditions.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Permanently downgraded to <strong>PES C2 and below</strong>. <br> </li>
              <li>Have <strong>continuous</strong> medical exemption (from IPPT) for a period of <strong>4 months or more</strong> during the first 9 months of the IPPT Birthday Window.</li>
              <li>Have accumulated medical exemption (from IPPT) for a period of <strong>7 months or more</strong> during the first 9 months of the IPPT Birthday Window.</li>
              <li>NSmen who are disrupted from ORNS duties.<br> </li>
              </ol>
              <p><em>*The onus is on the NSmen to inform their NS units and present 
              their medical documentation as evidence, when called back to answer to 
              the IPPT related charges. Alternatively, they can request for a medical 
              review by a SAF Medical Officer though his NS un</em>it.<br> <br> The annual IPPT is designed to test your basic components of physical fitness and motor skills.</p>

              <p><strong><strong></strong>Note that if you are pursuing a full-time tertiary education, you are 
              not disrupted from NS. You can still be called up for NS activities such
               as ICT, IPPT and mobilisation manning.<br></strong> <br> In fact, to facilitate your tertiary education, MINDEF has an existing 
              arrangement with the 3 local universities, i.e. NUS, NTU and SMU) for 
              undergraduates, who are also NSmen, in the first 3 years of your 
              studies. If you are a NSman and are studying in any of these 
              universities, you may be called up for ICT only during specific parts of
               the university vacations. You can be assured that there will be no 
              academic programmes scheduled by the universities during your ICT period
               as well.</p>

              <p><strong>What are the disciplinary actions?</strong><br> For our common understanding, the meanings of the names are defined
              as follows:<br> <br> i.    <strong>IPPT Defaulters</strong><br> These are NSmen who have failed to make any attempt in IPPT
              throughout the 9 mth IPPT window and did not qualify for any
              exemptions.<br> <br> ii.    <strong>RT Defaulters</strong><br> These are NSmen who have failed to complete 20 sessions of RT
              within the last 3 months of their birthday window.<br> Disciplinary actions will be taken against the defaulters.</p>
              <p><strong>(A)    Graduated Scale of
              Punishment</strong><br> The appropriate punishment on a graduated scale will be meted out
              by the Disciplinary Officers (DOs) depending on the NSman’s
              mitigating pleas, attitude, service records, previous convictions
              and performance for past IPPTs/RTs.<br> <br> For recalcitrant defaulters, it may mean heftier fines, custodial
              sentences or court martial.  In the event if the NSman is
              unable to pay the fine, the DO may order detention in default of
              payment within reasonable time based on prevailing guidelines. The
              detention may take effect on any date and shall be terminated on
              payment of fine.<br> <br> <strong>(B)    Central Defaulters Management Branch
              (CDMB)</strong><br> CDMB was set up as a tri-service shared services structure within
              the NSmen Services Centre (NSSC) to manage all IPPT/RT defaulter
              offenders on behalf of their parent NS units. The NS Commanders
              maintain the prerogative to summary trial the NSmen if they wish to
              do so. Under such circumstances, CDMB will provide the use of its
              premises and facilities to conduct the Summary Trial.</p>
