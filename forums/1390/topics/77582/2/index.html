So it is no surprise that one of the most common questions asked of signallers is 'Why do we bother with signal equipment when we can use our mobile phones to get communications?'<br><br>Chief Signal Officer, COL David Koh explained:</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/cyberpioneer/images/coverstory_june04_img1.jpg"><br><br>"The military environment is unique. Besides wanting to be connected, the SAF also has specific requirements like survivability and encryption.<br><br>This may preclude the use of commercially available equipment for our operational purposes.<br><br>Furthermore, the civilian network infrastructure is not secure. With the correct equipment, anyone can listen in on the information passing through the network. This is not desirable.<br><br>Also, in an emergency, it is highly possible that the network will not meet the SAF's requirements. For example, during the power blackout at Choa Chu Kang a couple of months ago, the quality of service in that area for mobile phones dropped.<br><br>This was because some connections and base stations might not have been operating at full capacity. And more people were calling to check up on friends and families.<br><br>So traffic increased and this placed more demands on the network, which might not have been able to support all these requirements.<br><br>This is something we cannot allow to happen in our security and emergency services. So we need to have our own military systems to rely on in times of crisis."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh well. GSM networks are popping everywhere....but I guess it's only used as a backup. Try as much as possible to use the signal sets, even when signal is bad w/ interference....then use h/p as second method, cos esp. when you are out in ex, trainers/instructors will look at you using your stuff so....best to use signal sets.<br><br>Or better yet, pretend to talk into a signal set to pass instructions, and sms @ e same time <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This reminds me of the US Army's IVIS terminals.Capable of fast data transmission via an encrypted network, able to provide the FACs and the commanders back at the laager with real-time information on the exact locatio and battle health of their armoured cavalry.Well, of course this network is pretty secure but it also shows the downside when one relies too much on a particular radio band for voice and data transmission.<br><br>Mobile networks are the most leaky, yet they can be used to triangulate the position of stealth aircraft flying over an urban area.That was how the F-117 was shot down in Serbia and Iraq.</div>
