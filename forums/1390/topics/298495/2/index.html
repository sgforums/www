You don't know what store you will get and it might not be so bad that you can't work properly even with sinus.<br><br>If you really got problems, go unit speak to your PC/OC or the paracounsellors and they will try to help you.<br><br>Unit life is very different from BMT, most people in units are normally have a closer relationship. Just see how things turn out when you report next week, its too early to say and for all you know, you might actually enjoy your vocation and unit after some time.</div>
