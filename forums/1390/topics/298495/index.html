My friend who was posted to Nee Soon camp as storeman only went for his storeman course like 2-3 months after he was posted there. Seems like STC is not conducting courses frequently enough or somewhere cockup which leads to the delay in storeman training these days. So far for the past 2 years all storemen i know reports to unit first and only get sent for the SA course sometime later.</div>
