              <p>Yes, I'm really gay. I'm not saying it just to chao keng.</p>
              <p>Here's a brief summary of my story: I wrote down homosexuality in my Medical Questionnaire and submitted it. During my medical check-up, I didn't voice out 'Hey, I'm a homo' because I assumed they would see it and send me for psychiatric tests to ascertain my sexuality(as I read they would). They sent me for tests alright, but they were all for other health related problems which I won't specify here.<br><br>I sneaked a peek at the photocopy of the MQ(medical questionnaire) they had and noticed ticks besides the other health problems that I declared, but the part which had 'homosexuality' written in it was conspicuously left unticked.</p>
              <p>I was just wondering if they actually saw it, because I wasn't sent for any tests or verification whatsoever regarding my sexuality. Unless countless threads and blogs have lied to me and there aren't any to begin with. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/confused.png" alt="confused.png"><br><br>I haven't received my enlistment letter yet, so should I call them to verify? I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could answer my question/explain my situation, thanks! No bigots please!</p>

              <p>I've heard vague rumours of rights (to education etc) being denied, but the latest hearsay is that gays are placed just like every other NSF because they're short of soldiers</p>
              <p>We've discussed what might happen to gay NSFs and why, but have very few answers to our questions. If you have any we would be very happy to hear from you.</p>

              <p>I'm pretty sure that I wrote that I already went for the body check aka medical check-up. Mine was last year, actually.</p>
              <p>My worry is that I'll be stuck in limbo if they don't get back to me. My 'condition' is written in black and white on my questionnaire. I won't know if they've taken note of it if they don't say anything. I can do without additional awkward questions(like 'omg why are you sleeping in my bunk?!?!') when I'm conscripted.</p>

              <p>Okay pal, I'll tell you what I heard but I stress it's all hearsay.</p>
              <p>I heard since time immemorial that gays did not serve at all. Cross dressing at the medical interview was enough to be declared gay. However they would be denied entry to local universities, the right to get married until the age of 35 (to women since gay marriage does not exist in Singapore) and the right to buy an HDB flat.</p>
              <p>I heard a few years ago that gays now have to serve. They are not to reveal to anyone that they are gay or they will be punished. The change was reportedly due to falling birth rates and since the SAF has made many other changes for this reason, I am inclined to think this may be correct.</p>

              <p>Last time, homo is a disease. It can be dowgraded and etc... But now it is no longer a disease. So declaring homo will not affect your Pes status, training, posting or whatever.</p>

              <p>What they do wan to know is, are you pyschologically sick? Are you having depression, ADHD, Axiety or other form of disorder?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The reason is a female and male are treated equally, so sexuality is not a performance indicator now. However, psychological disorder is.</p>

              <p>military homophobic policies never made sense to me. Gay soldiers can serve just as well as straight soldiers. They deserve equal respect.</p>
              <p>The only problem is if a gay person doesn't feel comfortable being in a community shower. Then just voice out, and make them find u a cubicle or something..</p>

              <p>I see the reason why the threadstarter hesitated declaring. Not declaring will only make you suffer.The main problem is that homosexuals and gays tend to find it hard to reveal they are one in NS. It's just like what alize mentioned. There're rumors that if you declared one, you'll be not allowed to get married until 35, denied entry at universities and unable to buy your own HDB flat.</p>
              <p>This set-up a psychological barrier preventing you to declare. If something happened to you, they would say it's your responsibility because you did not declare. It's a lose-lose situation whether you declare or not.</p>
              <p>Who would declare they're gay/homo under these illogical man-made conditions? They're normal humans too. That's why I feel that most of them suffer at the hands of people who made this system. Injustice? Yep, everyone can see. What I feel is that they should have equal rights to study higher and buy house. Women who are butch or lesbian can buy their own house and study degree in sg too. So what's the unfairness between butches and gays? By right around the world, your ns life should not affect your civilian life one bit. Even ns in s.korea (high risk war) exempt those obese/skinny/high-blood pressure men from ns but people here with same condition still have to serve as pes b-e.</p>
              <p>Military should not see everyone as the same. People are different inside. Three men can adapt doesn't mean the fourth man can do the same.</p>
