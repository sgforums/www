              <p>I have a back pain problem for a long time(10months) and I have been going for specialist appointments for check-ups and physiotherapy. All the check-ups and physiotherapy are all on my own and are not referred by MO. So I suppose the camp MO has no records about my problem at all.</p>
              <p>However, I am not exactly attending the check-ups and physiotherapy sessions regularly as the appointments are on the weekdays which is quite inconvenient for me since I am still serving NS. It is not possible to book out as and when I need for such appointments. Hence, the entire diagnosis process took a long time.</p>
              <p>Previously, the specialist gave me a memo which stated down pes and change vocation. The memo wasn't submitted as I thought I would try to see if I can go on with the training. Last month, I went for a X-Ray and MRI scan on my lumbar spine but the specialist could not find out what was wrong. The specialist told me that back problems are often complicated and I could possibly have tight hamstring and weak back that cause the chronic pain on my back. He also gave me another memo stating to excuse strenuous activities for 6 months.</p>
              <p>Recently, I am permenantly posted to a unit and training and exercises are much frequent, which seems to be aggravating the pain on my back but I am still enduring. It is so bad that sometimes I couldn't even stand still and I am feeling that my back is so weak that I must quickly sit down or I may fall. The pain even causes me to have difficulty sleeping. I haven't submitted the 2 memos to the MO yet as I am wondering what would happen next and if my unit commanders would be unhappy as I am newly posted and then the next thing is to have medical conditions. I don't wish to be condemned at the start since I am just posted to there and have another one year plus to go.</p>
              <p>If say I were to submit the 2 memos(1 stating downpes and change vocation, and the other stating excuse strenuous activities 6 months) and with MRI report showing no problem, what could the possible out come be?</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>2)</strong> Consult specialist, and do whatever medical check ups required. E.g. physical exam, blood test, x-ray, CT scan, MRI scan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>3)</strong> Specialist gave a <strong>finalised</strong> <em>clinical diagnosis</em>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>4)</strong> Get the specialist to write you a <em><strong>memo</strong></em> which is to be given to SAF MO. Those who can and are willing to spend some more money can get him/her to write you a specialist report, which is more precise and detailed.<br><br><em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Note: For not to waste time and money, please be more direct yet humble. Request the specialist to write about <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>reviewing of PES and medical board</strong> / anything specific such as any excuses</span> to your conditions.</span></span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>5)</strong> Book an medical review appointment using the <a title="eHealth" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ns.sg/nsPortal/appmanager/nsp/default?_nfpb=true&amp;amp;_pageLabel=nsPortal_EHEALTH_ABT">eHealth</a> module @ <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a> <strong>(for NSman Reservists).</strong><br><br>Just go down to your camp medical centre <strong>(for NSFs).<br></strong><br>Call CMPB @ <strong>6373 1340 </strong>to request another PES review <strong>(for Pre-Enlistees after CMPB Checkup).</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>6)</strong> Make a trip down to the respective unit camp medical centre. Give the MO whatever supporting documents you have in hand. E.g. <em><strong>Specialist memo/report (most usually the case and highly recommended),</strong></em> x-ray films, CT/MRI scan report, blood investigation lab report... etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>7)</strong> MO will decide whether you are deemed eligible for KIV downgrade, according to the criterias set in the "PES Bible" directive. <em>E.g. Diagnosis, Extent of Diagnosis, Degree of Diagnosis/Injury/Illness/Disease...etc.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>8)</strong> If deemed so, you will sign an undertaking note of medical board, whereby your case statement will be prepared for discussion at the monthly medical board meet (usually at the Formation/Division HQ) with another NSF CPT MO, and the Chairman (SAF Regular Medical Doctor of MAJ rank and above). Your Medical Board result will be post mailed to you by your respective NSHRC (Formation NS Hub).</p>

Arrangements will then be made for them to attend a medical review at the SAF medical centre to assess their fitness for NS.<br><br>The NSmen MUST bring along all investigation results and memorandums from his external physician/specialist during the medical review. Depending on the outcome of the medical review, the NSman may be given a medical certificate to defer him from ICT, be scheduled for a medical board to downgrade him if his medical condition is significant, or referred to a restructured hospital for further investigation.

              Yo, TS, you better go to the MO fast and pass him the memo. Three of my friends last time, one got lower spine problem, went to specialists and review outside but never say, and then do SOC, drills etc, then at end of 2nd year, finally resulted in unable to sleep on the bed due to slip disc. When the next day he really cannot get up from his bed, he was warded to hospital, and never able to get up from bed again.
              
              Its not worth it, think SAF is only 2-3 years of your life, and when you finish you are only 25yrs old at most. Do you want it to affect your life after your NS, you still have working life, married life, life with children and 50-60 years ahead of you. Dont be foolish and continue to endure the pain.
              
              I dont want to say too much about the other 2 friends I know.

              And TS, dont worry unnecessarily of getting posted to other units, cause every battallion/brigade's unit got Pes Cs and Ds. They will most likely take you out as infantry men, then ask you become admin clerk with the battalion HQ, or S1, S2, S3 etc. Alternatively, they can ask you to remain in the company, and become assistant CQ, store man, armskote man, etc. You will still be with your friends anyway.

              <p>I am so sorry for your friend. And it sounds frightening.</p>
              <p>Although according to my physiotherapist that if I were to continue my normal activities I may hurt myself again and decondition it, I doubt I will get down pes to allow me to recover since the MRI isn't proving anything about my back pain.</p>
              <p>Moreover, my unit is in need of people and wouldn't let anyone go so easily.</p>
              <p>It is frustrating to have the pain and not knowing the cause to it. Then I am stuck to just enduring the pain...</p>

              <p>Thanks for all the advices.</p>
              <p>I will go ahead and declare my medical condition to the camp MO with the 2 memos and see what is next.</p>
              <p>I am still seeking treatment of course but just that the specialist couldn't find out what is the exact cause to the problem. And that's why I wonder what could the MO do since this is the case.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, I am still trying to get to the bottom of this to find out the cause of my back pain.</p>
