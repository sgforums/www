              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>hello all..i'm currently a pilot trainee with the RSAF and
              perhaps i'll do one for the pilot-wannabes.</p>
              <p>---------------------------------------------<br> <span><strong>The Requirements</strong></span> (from RSAF
              website):<span><br> <br></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li><span>interest in a military career</span></li>
              <li>combat fit (PES A or B)</li>
              </ul>
              <p><br> Your eyesight should be:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>normal colour vision</li>
              <li>not more than 500 degrees per eye</li>
              <li>correctable to 6/6</li>
              <li>not more than 200 degrees astigmatism per eye</li>
              </ul>
              <p><br> Academically, you should have a Degree, Diploma or a full GCE 'A'
              Level Certificate with passes in English, Maths and Physical
              Science at 'O' level.<br> <br> And if you are planning to study in NUS, NTU or abroad, we will
              provide a full scholarship under the Local Study Award - Pilot.</p>
              <p>---------------------------------------------</p>
              <p><br> The selection process comes in 3 stages. The COMPASS test, which is
              a 5-hour computerized test which tests your aptitude as a potential
              pilot, eg. psychomotor skills, multitasking under stress, spatial
              awareness, decision making and so on.</p>
              <p>Following that is the Pilot Selection Board, which is an
              interview with a panel of 3-4 RSAF officers, of which one of them
              would be a pilot, and the main things they're looking for in you is
              your interest in being an RSAF pilot and also leadership
              qualities.</p>
              <p>And lastly comes the aeromedical checkup at RSAF Aeromedical
              Centre, where aviation doctors determine your medical fitness and
              suitability to operate in an unnatural environment which pilots
              do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After passing all the stages of the selection process, you would
              have to perform well enough during BMT to QUALIFY for OCS. By
              qualify meaning that your BMT ranking and performance meets OCS
              requirements, hence if you don't get into OCS through BMT as an
              NSF, it does not mean that you do not qualify for OCS. However this
              being said, all aspiring pilots should perform their best during
              BMT to qualify for OCS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After BMT, you would go to Air Force School to prepare for your
              Air Grading Cource (AGC), which is a 6-week flying course of 15
              sorties at Tamworth in Australia. This assesses your ability,
              aptitude and airmanship in handling an aircraft. The aircraft used
              in this course is the Pacific Aerospace CT/4B, a two-seat aerobatic
              aircraft pictured below. SYFC PPL holders are exempt from this
              phase, the only requirement being having to fly 4 aerobatics
              sorties on SYFC CT/4E before leaving for Basic Wing Course.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.airforce.mil.nz/nr/rdonlyres/b3fc97e2-1b7f-4a91-92e2-a01a495e8927/0/ct4e.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="338"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After passing AGC, you would go to SAFTI MI for the OCS common
              leadership module (2 weeks) followed by the Air Force Service Term
              (7 weeks). This would consist of lectures about RSAF organizational
              structure and other Air Force related topics, and quite a bit of
              physical training.</p>
              <p>All RSAF aircrew are required to go through a 10 day Jungle
              Survival Training (JST) course, hence you would proceed to Brunei
              after AFST. The JST involves lessons about jungle survival,
              followed by a 3 day survival test in the jungle, and navigating 4km
              after that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After completing your JST, you would return to Air Force School
              for a 3 month long groundschool course, which consists of theory
              lessons and examinations regarding flying. Here you would also go
              through G force endurance training, or G-FET, where you would be
              taught how to resist G forces with the use of the centrifuge at
              RSAF Aeromedical Centre.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Following that, you would proceed to Pearce, Australia for a 10
              month Basic Wing Course(BWC), which is a full-fledged course which
              teaches all the basic skills required to be proficient as a
              military pilot. This is currently conducted on the Pilatus PC-21
              aircraft, a tandem 2-seat turboprop military trainer pictured
              below.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/pc_21/images/PC-21_1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="337"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the end of BWC, pilot trainees would be streamed to either
              the Fighter Wing Course (FWC), Rotary Wing Course (RWC), or the
              Transport Wing Course (TWC), to continue your advanced training.
              The FWC is held in France, and outstanding FWC pilot trainees would
              go to Canada under the NFTC (NATO Flying Training in Canada)
              programme. RWC and TWC are held locally in Singapore. These
              advanced wing courses would last approximately 11 months.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Given all that, pilot wannabes must note that at every stage of
              this process, countless people are chopped/phased out/washed out,
              and it is indeed a tough climb to get the coveted pair of RSAF
              pilot wings. If this happens, you would return to the army to serve
              the remainder of your NS liability, and if you have none, then ORD
              loh!</p>
              <p><br> And getting your wings is just the beginning. As evidenced through
              many pilots i've spoken to, and also certain forumers, life as a
              pilot in an operational squadron is no bed of roses. Contrary to
              the 'glamourous' image an air force pilot's life has among the
              public, it also comes with many responsibilities and duties, which
              result in many weekends/public holidays burnt and also odd working
              hours at certain times. Also, it does not mean that as a RSAF pilot
              you'd be flying all your life with the RSAF. After a few years of
              high-key flying and getting your operational status up, most pilots
              end up with staff jobs in the RSAF, flying only enough to maintain
              currency. And not to mention the compulsory early retirement age of
              44.</p>
              <p><br> Bottom line is, make sure this is a career choice you would enjoy
              and not regret before you sign on the dotted line. Do not apply
              just because people think being a pilot is 'cool' and all.</p>
              <p>Hope this guide answers some questions from all you pilot
              wannabes out there. I would be glad to entertain any more questions
              if you all have any.</p>
              <p>Thanks and out.</p>

              <p>i have no idea what are the stages involved in the AOSS selection test, but i know there is a medical. never heard anything about going through the compass test.</p>
              <p>and as mentioned, likewise for controllers, AOSS will also be streamed out to the various units, from the flying support squadrons to the radar squadrons.</p>
              <p>roles of the AOSS includes doing NOTAMs, base operations, ground controllers, local assistants, controller assistants and also other duties.</p>
              <p>same stuff, expect secondary appointments to be a major factor in your career.</p>
              <p>the first AOSS course, the basic AOSS course is known as the 35 course. along the career, you will be sent for the 45, and lastly the 55, where upon completion, you would be entitled to wear the C3 bevret.</p>

              <p>Er... Got a question regarding the OCS part... If let's say I

              cannot get into OCS right?</p>
              <p>Then are there other requirements to get into OCS other than

              <p>basically its all about ranking. NSFs have to meet a higher percentile to qualify for OCS compared to regulars. Call up AFRC for your case.</p>

              <p>I think the diploma would do fine..check with AFRC as always if you're unsure. Yep wear formal.</p>
              <p>The aeromedical checkup consists of a full body check, with blood/urine tests, hearing tests, eye tests, dental check, and ECG.</p>

              <p>hi, i got rejected because i failed the compass test but anyway i called RSAF and they said that i could apply for other vocations that do not require a compass test results. May i know what kind vocations they are as i want to be expose to aviation so that it will help me in my careeer in becoming a commercial pilot as right now, i am unsuitable to be an RSAF pilot and i will have to wait for 2 years if i were too.</p>
              <p>Any advice would be appreciated. And if there are other vocations that i can apply for do they also require us to sign on for ten years?</p>

              <p>well if you fail to meet the OCS percentile for regulars then yes.</p>
              <p><br>The ones you are speaking about are those who failed to meet the NSF OCS BMT ranking (usually posted to SISPEC), but still meet the OCS ranking for regulars. Hence when they signed on, they are converting to regular status hence qualifying for OCS.</p>
