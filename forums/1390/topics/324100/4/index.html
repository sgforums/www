              <p>Good day to fellow friends,</p>
              <p>Perhaps to begin with, I have been a vivid reader of forums in recent months but yet to subscribe and reply to any. I must say however, it is heart warming to have the likes of sgFish &amp; aviator-alien to take time and share constructive views on the many questions.</p>
              <p>Here is one from me though; I was asked to sit for a "mapas test" (academic test they claimed) as I ORD-ed four years back. Meantime, awaiting for the results including "compass" as well. I would like to know the approximate waiting duration from application to penning our signature ie. Application, tests, interview &amp; medical.</p>
              <p>Thanking you in anticipation.</p>

              <p>there's no fixed period or approximate time frame for you to work with, but i would strongly recommend that you give the recruitment office a call once in a while to check the status of your application.</p>
              <p>like. maybe a week after your compass test, see whether the scores are in. if the reply is that they are still processing, be nice and check whether there is any estimate time frame. then work with it, and maybe a call or so a couple of weeks after that.</p>
              <p>i dont think they are being inefficient in processing the applications, but there are too many pilot-applicants and WSOs-applicants that it can get really overwhelming.</p>
              <p>but remember, there is this very thin line with trying to have a update on your status, and being a pain-in-the-ass to the recruitment office.</p>
              <p>its hard, i know. hah.</p>
              <p>have fun!</p>

              <p>Good morning!</p>
              <p>Appreciate the replies mates. Indeed as you said Aviator, to call the recruitment office 'once in a while' on the status. Fortunately, the NSFs (i suppose) were rather polite and obliging to mine calls, matter of fact that I only phone in twice. Almost three weeks since I sat for compass test, however recruitment office mentioned that I had to wait till next month for 'mapas test' result to be out before releasing both results. Well, not keeping hopes high but reckon mine compass result is out which they could share isn't it. Anyhow, patience, as we speak.</p>

              <p><br>i reckon that the compass test results and the "mapas" test results will come together hand-in-hand to determine your status.</p>
              <p>as such, it does not make sense for them to let you know your compass test results, only to have to tell you that the mapas test results is not up to mark.</p>
              <p>that's the best explanation i can gather. so just drop them a call next month or so.</p>
              <p>good luck.</p>

              <p>If I'm not wrong, u wont be able to join RSAF already cos of ur age. I might be wrong, but theres an age cap of them recruiting pilots. If I happen to recall correctly, the cap is 26 yrs old with degree holders. U better check the site for more info.</p>
              <p>Anyway if u really want to fly, be it commercial or military, u might want to consider Silkair. SIA is not an option cos its an all guys job, but Silkair does hire female pilots. U shld preferably have a pilot's license prior to applying though. The female pilots that I know who are in Silkair have PPL (Private Pilot's License) that they got either from syfc or some other flying club. U can always try ur luck as a raw recruit of course.</p>

              The Navigator Wing badge is awarded to Navigators who have successfully completed their specialised training in the RSAF C130 Hercules Aircraft.
              
              A question for current pilot trainees and Ex-Rsaf Pilot or aircrew. What is the main role of the WSO Navigator in the C130 Hercules? Is it just mainly flight planning and radio communications, something like a co-pilot? Would a WSO Navigator be taught the basics of flying just in case the pilot is unconscious?
              It would be better to answer my question with more depth as i have search the RSAF websites but only to find little information on these vocations.
              A Comparision between a WSO Navigator and Fighter would be well appreciated.
              
              Finally both vocations require a personnal to sign on, according to Rsaf they told me that these vocations are unlike the pilot vocation where a 5 year bond is included instead of the 10 year bond. Can anyone Confirm this. Thanks.

He finds himself flying the lone Christmas day mission over war-torn Bosnia. But when he talks pilot Stackhouse into flying slightly off-course to check out an interesting target, the two get shot down. Burnett is soon alone, trying to outrun a pursuing army, while commanding officer Reigert finds his rescue operation hamstrung by politics, forcing Burnett to run far out of his way</p>

              <p><br>CAAS does not recruit pilots, less for flight inspectors, which amounts to a small perrcentage.</p>
              <p>RSAF pilots have a cross over scheme, known affectionately as the "old man" scheme, that allows RSAF pilots to cross over to SIA for further career upon retirement.</p>
              <p>pilots are all regular, with a 12 year bond, so technically, you cannot be a NSF pilot.</p>
              <p>there are instances of pilots crossing over to SIA after their 12 year bond, but before their retirement age of 45, but they are subjected to the interviews just that other applicants, maybe with a bit more leeway.</p>
              <p>remember. RSAF pilots are not licensed civil pilots, and they do not hold PPL, CPL or ATPL. not too sure about the transport guys though.</p>
              <p>so, record set straight. CAAS is not an airline. so. maybe rednano meant SQ.</p>
