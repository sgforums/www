              <p>Thanks so much for the info. Just a few more questions.</p>
              <p>Getting into AFS as spec ain't that slack after all, yes? Does both vocation require outfield, route marches, SOC?</p>
              <p>I've just checked the air force website. The training phase for ACS is much longer than ADSS. Does that mean if I get into ACS it would take a longer time to get my 3SG rank?</p>

              <p>Ok I am not sure about the training phase for ACS but for ADWS I can tell you that outfield, route marches and SOC are needed. Good news is your route marches are only a few km, bad news is you might have to carry equipment weighing up to 40+kg while marching.</p>
              <p>For ACS I am not too sure. Why not enjoy your AOP first and worry later? Lol.</p>

              <p>Best not to listen to this NUS-LSA bumpkin farmer loser who wanted to sign on as an LSA in RSAF..as we all know LSA and ATA farmers, when they get their CPT, people call them bus captains..</p>
              <p>He claims to have been offered SMS, a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">farmer scholarship</span> which he thought would impress his audience but no one was impressed, of which all 3 of us told him it's a farmer scholarship that any tom, dick and harry (in lower case for a reason) can get, the only criteria to which is to pass A levels and profess you want it.</p>
              <p>Truly living up to his farmer DNA, he can't differentiate between 'proof' and 'prove', which explains how he could still get accepted by a farmer university's law school, LOL further reinforcing the lack of any form of entry standards of the farmer institutions. He's deluded and mentally disturbed and truly cherishes the delusions that he could possibly have better results than those who did not end up in farmer universities that accept the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lowest common denominator </span>of Singapore.</p>
              <p>The mentally disturbed poor deluded farmer persists in looking away from the face of facts flying into his face from all directions  (in denial) about the cream of Singapore avoiding farmer universities, something that everyone in Singapore knows. He also says he would 'work his ass off' for the next 20 yrs to show me lol it's so funny. I can't stop laughing.., LSE may accept the odd 2B1C, but guess what far worse monstrosities make up 99% of your farmer universities lol. Who the f looks at 3 subjects and no one considers your measley 3A for farmer law school as the top in Singapore. Go poll the 4A 2 S paper distinctions people. "bumpkins they don't wanna be" lol</p>

              <p>You know for a so-called overseas graduate and a serving officer, you both are fucking immature. Stop spilling your animosity to various threads just to be even. People want to read on threads that can make or break decisions or get some info on SAF stuff. Its kinda fuck up to be opening a thread and to see two fucking juveniles argueing about college education or " i am hard as fuck cos i come from Delta wing" or "I got an overseas education, you fuckers are beneath me"</p>
              <p>I am not taking sides, but this is getting fucking juvenile.</p>

              <p>I didn't condemn him to mediocrity cos he passed out of another wing. It's because of he's a farmer who can put up with slums and has no sense of self measurement. He even confidently said he thinks he has better results than someone whose results he doesn't know, how very archetypal of his farmer status.</p>
              <p>It IS the ability. He could not take the Delta training. You want to try? I only provided the above information so that no one misunderstands and thought he went through it and survived Delta like you seemed to. I know what he's going to say next. That I went OOC of OCS. how lame. I can predict his every word. I guess the only achievement he can put to his name on his deathbed is that he became an officer. </p>

              <p>Haha, i passed out from SISPEC, which i think is tougher than
                  OCS without the JCC. Afterall we did 10 months of officer training
                  and crammed it into 6 months. And without the gay dancing shit.

              <p>for 1st class/2nd upper, starting salary is $4.4k therabouts. its full pay even during training, which lasts for about a year. Its under the new MDES scheme, so retirement is at 60.</p>
              <p>2 years down the road, you'll still be under a bond, so you'll have to accept whatever is given to u :)  3 yrs bond is after the training period. I dint serve my ns under the saf, so I'll have to go to bmt first! bleah..</p>

              <p>Hmm.. i wan to ask if.. there is only 2 ways to become a 'pilot' in singapore right ?</p>
              <p>1)SIA</p>
              <p>2)Airforce</p>
              <p>So which one is easier to get into ?? well.. everyone whose aspiration is to become a pilot.. wants to fly a F15 / F16.. but if they cant.. a commercial pilot for SIA would also be fine to them too.. so which one have the 'higher' percentage to get in?</p>
              <p>IF i fail in airforce pilot... can i go to SIA to try ? or they are link up in 1 system ??</p>
