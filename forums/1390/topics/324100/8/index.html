              <p>its more of like a 10 yr contract la.. since the first 2 years is spent in training i guess. and also the most fun for many pilots..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>well thats basically what i was asking. the career form SAF thingy is what most people do when applying for the 12years contract right? (2years from the start of NS to the 10year career) </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so that means. before taking the compass test. this is the very first step that people take before sinking in to the 12years of service?</p>
              <p>just to make sure i didnt go to the wrong place, can anyone direct me to the application site?</p>

              Hi guys just received my A'levels result. Am currently serving my BMT at CDO TI.
              
              I'm rather interested in a career with the RSAF. 
              
              But may i know what vocations have shorter contract bond lengths? (5 years bond in which i am able to do my uni studies?
              
              Am i required to qualify for OCS in order for me to apply for officer vocations?
              I'm currently not selected for CSLC. So I'm not qualified.
              
              Failed my COMPASS as well. Which are the vocations that don't require it?

              <p>You'll get free university sponsership, a short contract, good pay. And most importantly, theres no need to qualify for OCS</p>
              <p>RSAF needs more AEO. When i was serving in ada, every A levels officer was talking about it.</p>

                           Short contract meaning 5 years? Are there any restrictions as to which course i must take in uni? Am currently considering Business courses, which is not really relevant to AEO job scope.

              <p>Can't rmb how long is the engagement period, but i do rmb it was short enough, and it includes your 2 years of NS. Of course there are restrictions, an engineering degree is a must.</p>

              <p>Basically, other than the pilot contract, every other contract's MTE (minimum term of engagement) is based on your remaining NS liability x 2.5 (i.e. if you have 20 months of NS left, you need to serve 50 months at least before you can get out of SAF).</p>
              <p>As for scholarship/study award, the shortest is 4 years for Local Study Award in a local university (do brace for Gloater coming forward to flame about local uni though). Your 4-years bond commences upon graduation and will run concurrently with your MTE, so you will get out when your 4 years or MTE is up, whichever is later.</p>
              <p>For officer vocation, it's something like if you are in the top 15%-20% of your cohort, you can qualify as regular officer.</p>
              <p>Since you are in CDO, your eyesight is not a problem. Main thing is compass test though. The only 2 vocations with minimal compass test requirement is WSO(ADA) and AEO. However, I did hear rumours that AEO is going to be a non-uniformed job.</p>
              <p>Most important thing, though, is whether your CDO unit will allow you to go take the vocation testing.</p>

              <p>I am not so sure about that. Depends on whether CDO will want to release you.</p>
              <p>But there's one fact I know, if you are needed for pilot course, nothing in the SAF can stop you, not even CDO or NDU.</p>

              <p>C3 has 3 different streams: radar, aerodrome and air defence.</p>
              <p>The exact differences are classified so I shall not divulge them here. All I can say is, simply put, aerodrome controls planes in the vicinity of an airfield, radar controls planes around singapore, air defence control planes outside of singapore.</p>
              <p>Also, radar-trained personnel are cross-trained in aerodrome as well.</p>
              <p>One last thing, if you are scholar material or A levels qualified, you will most likely go to air defence. That one I am pretty sure about it.</p>

              <p>As a dip grad, you can still be a wso(c3). it's just that you are more likely to be streamed to one area than others.</p>
              <p>as for the interview, they will just ask you to read this paragraph of words. they usually reject ppl whose voices are monotonous. otherwise, my interview went quite smoothly. partly i think because i was part of the 'scholar' batch and some of the process was shooed-in.</p>

              <p>Hey folks,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wanna ask if anyone of you have had the same experience as me. I went for the Aeromedical checkup 2 days before I went for the interview. Did not complete the dental and eye check as I was wearing contacts. Was suppose to go for review in one week's time. But the lady called me on the day of the interview and said that the doc said I do not have to go for the review the following week. Pursuing further, as usual, they will say they dunno and ask you to wait.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On first thought I thot it might have something to do with the interview as I've not passed it yet. But I've passed it and called 1 week later to find out that I <strong>do NOT have to go back for any reviews. They said that they have already "cleared" my file and sent it to the airforce. </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can anyone provide any insight on this? Does it mean that I've failed the medical and hence, no need for further reviews? I've called the recruitment side to ask but they have not heard of anyone asked "not to go back for review b4."</p>
