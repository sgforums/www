              <p>No u cant prepare for it. Other than trying to get more sleep. And btw SYFC is free to fly. Being well off or not doesnt really matter. And I find it weird that if ur parents dun c the importance of yfc, y would they think RSAF is important?</p>
              <p>Cos from wat I know, a VERY HIGH percentage of non-yfc people get chopped at the airgrading phase. Its basically the same shit as wat they teach back in yfc so it would give u kind of an advantage. So if u regard rsaf as important, they syfc is also quite important.</p>
              <p>Although u can do anything abt it now, but to all aspiring air force pilots out there, I'd encourage u all to join yfc, albeit just to get a taste of flying, cos it would seriously help u that little bit.</p>

              <p>if i'm not wrong, yfc should be a recognised ECA now right? or rather you guys call it CCA.. oops..</p>

              <p>Haha there are those cases who got through to phase 3 via repeated appeals..and also those who only passed FHT after multiple attempts. Don't know about the current batches, but for mine i guess i can safely say at least a third of syfc PPL holders fall into those categories.</p>

              <p>Anyway syfc PPL also not all that big lah. U compare with flying those big aircrafts in the air force, this piper warrior shit is nothing.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #00ff00;">Given all that, pilot wannabes must note that at every stage of this process, countless people are chopped/phased out/washed out, and it is indeed a tough climb to get the coveted pair of RSAF pilot wings. If this happens, you would return to the army to serve the remainder of your NS liability, and if you have none, then ORD loh!</span></p>
              <p><br><span style="color: #0000ff;">And getting your wings is just the beginning. As evidenced through many pilots i've spoken to, and also certain forumers, life as a pilot in an operational squadron is no bed of roses. Contrary to the 'glamourous' image an air force pilot's life has among the public, it also comes with many responsibilities and duties, which result in many weekends/public holidays burnt and also odd working hours at certain times. Also, it does not mean that as a RSAF pilot you'd be flying all your life with the RSAF. After a few years of high-key flying and getting your operational status up, most pilots end up with staff jobs in the RSAF, flying only enough to maintain currency. And not to mention the compulsory early retirement age of 44.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">1) does the LSA-pilot have any bonds? Does the bond come on top of the pilot contract?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #00ff00;">2) you said if you wash out you'll serve out ur remaining NS liability. but do you have to sign the contract before they send u for training? if so, then if you wash out you'll have to serve the remaining 10 years in the air force in another vocation?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #00ff00;">3) I actually asked this in another post but only got 1 reply. I heard that only ppl with perfect eyesight will be chosen to fly the F16 and that even ppl with lasik cannot fly the F16. Is this true? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">4) how often does our pilots fly nowadays, in terms of hours a year? and when they do not fly what are they normally doing?</span></p>

              <p>I have a few questions thanks.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">1) does the LSA-pilot have any
                      bonds? Does the bond come on top of the pilot contract?</span></p>
              <p>the bond is 4 years but it runs concurrently with the pilot bond</p>
              <p><span style="color: #00ff00;">2) you said if you wash out you'll
                      serve out ur remaining NS liability. but do you have to sign the
                      contract before they send u for training? if so, then if you wash
                      out you'll have to serve the remaining 10 years in the air force in
                      another vocation?</span></p>
              <p>yes the signing is done before airgrading. nope. if you are washed out due to performance reasons your contract is void and you just have to finish serving your NS liability.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #00ff00;">3) I actually asked this in
                      another post but only got 1 reply. I heard that only ppl with
                      perfect eyesight will be chosen to fly the F16 and that even ppl
                      with lasik cannot fly the F16. Is this true?</span></p>
              <p>as far as i know this is false.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">4) how often does our pilots fly
                      nowadays, in terms of hours a year? and when they do not fly what
                      are they normally doing?</span></p>
              <p>don't have the exact figures for the first part, but when they do not fly they have their secondary appointments and other duties to handle</p>
              <p>thanks.</p>

              <p><br>thanks alot. just to confirm, so the contract is void if u drop out anytime between signing the contract and the advance wing course, and even during the advance wing course?</p>
              <p>anyway would'nt the air force make a lot of losses financially if people keep dropping out half way through training?</p>

              <p>actually, PPL does aid in your entry to becoming a pilot. if you have achieve your PPL from SYFC, it does allow you to bypass the air grading, and go straight to service term, provided you fulfil all your requirements such as OCS and medical.</p>
              <p>PPL may not be similiar to flying a real military aircraft, but i am sure the basic aerodynamics is a good stepping stone towards becoming a pilot.</p>
              <p>anyone still in SYFC?</p>

              <p>ah. the irritating CT4Es.  i guess it damn hard to fly especially when you have 3 to 4 other pipers in the circuit because of speed differentiation. </p>
              <p>i seen before a CT4E flying low level circuit while maintaining sequence with 4 other pipers in the circuit. you got to be mad.</p>
