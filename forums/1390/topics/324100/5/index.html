              <p><br>C3 is C3. navigator is navigator. C3-navigator, i have no idea what you are talking about.</p>
              <p>navigator role, being a navigator, helps the pilot in the navigational work, like plotting, the routing of the aircraft, taking into consideration the wind. They deal with both instrument flying and also VFR flying.</p>
              <p>WSO Fighter operates the in flight weapon systems.</p>
              <p>what they do is poles apart. and they are not pilots. they have no flying experience, although i understand that wso fighter does go through a little bit of flying practice, but not in a F16 platform.</p>
              <p>i have no idea whether being a wso fighter or navigator will aid in your cross over to civil aviation, but i am sure with your attitude, it would be a bit difficult.</p>
              <p>i am sure a little bit of politeness will get you a long way. cheers. =)</p>

              <p>This is by no means simple english. Simple english does not involve the using of caps on every other word. And I find it odd that for a person who is asking the question, you are the aggressive one. If u are looking for a fight, go other threads and do it. Not here.</p>
              <p>And regarding your question, I have read somewhere that being a WSO (Fighter) helps a teeny weeny bit if your going over to commercial flying cos some of the stuff that they do is relevant. But as I said, its very little. Might as well try ur luck as a pilot.</p>

              <p>WSO(Fighter) is like your co-pilot on a 2-seater fighter and you are mainly responsible for launching the weapon package. (Correct me if I am wrong)</p>

              <p>A WSO (Nav), as the name suggests, does the navigation and planning of flight routes aboard the C-130 and KC-135. I dunno if they operate aboard the helis. The WSO (Ftr) is the person who sits behind the pilot in the dual seater fighters like the F-16D or F-15SG. He's not exactly a co-pilot, but rather the one who controls most of the A2G weapons and some other stuff while the pilot flies the plane. He's also the overall mission commander, the one who plans the route and stuff. </p>
              <p>As the saying goes, the WSO (Ftr) is the one doing all the work, while the pilot acts as the chauffeur. haha. Not exactly true, but u get the idea.</p>

              <p>Hey man are u getting ur interview on oct 7? Cos initially mine was on Sept 12, then delay and delay and delay until oct 7. Haiz... </p>
              <p>The interview is mainly to gauge ur interest in the career and also on some basic knowledge of rsaf as a whole. Pretty easy to read up. Just make sure that this is what u want. Cos the bond is very very long. If u halfway want to give up, good luck to u.</p>
              <p>The interview 'chop rate' isnt high. It will weed out people who are not interested, or know nuts about the air force. Just dont go there unprepared and u will be fine. About the chope rate of the medical, theres no real percentage. If u are healthy, u are. If u are unfit to fly, then sad for u. Just dont go to medical after u just recovered from a sickness. I did that last time for my syfc medical and I almost failed. haha</p>
              <p>Anyway, I think that if u fail agc, u will be going back to ur unit as a spec, unless they let u go to ocs. I am not very sure about this. Cos its impossible for u to serve ur unit as an OCT. U are either a spec or an officer. The OCT rank is not exactly recognised by saf. </p>
              <p>Anyway, good luck for ur interview, whenever it is. If its on the same day as mine, then c u there. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Thanks for all the information given here, just out of curiousity though, during the 21 months of basic and advanced wings course overseas, will you be overseas for the whole of the 21 month period? Or will there be holidays where you are allowed to fly back to sunny Singapore?</p>
