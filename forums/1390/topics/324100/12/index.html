              <p>*quote from previous post</p>
              <p>*hi all. i am a student doing my A'level this year.i have a strong passion in signing on to be a pilot and serving the nation.yes,i do know about the commitment and hardwork while training to be pilot,and being a pilot is not all just about glory.however,it is still my ambition to be a pilot and fly.</p>
              <p>i have some very important questions and issues that'll need advice from the experienced people here.please help me out.thanks.</p>
              <p>these are information about me. my status was PES A l1 then it got 'demoted' to PES B L1( due to my blood,g6pd). height 181. NAFTA: gold consistently. eyesight: 350 for both eyes (means i cannot qualify for FTR pilot,but i'm aiming for rotary/transport pilot). basically, after reading the basic requirements, i think i can qualify for a pilot in terms of physical aspects.</p>
              <p>however,these are my problems thats troubling me deeply now.after going for the medical checkup, i was invited to take the COMPASS test. after taking it,i still do not have any replies from them( been a month or so already). however,my friend who went also, called RSAF up. he was told that if we did not receive a letter of rejection, means we have passed stage 1,so we have to wait for the interview to be arranged.</p>
              <p>here's problem no.1- is it true that i passed COMPASS test?</p>
              <p>no.2) after passing the interview and medical checkup. i know that i have to go through normal BMT and then OCS. however,i just got my letter of enlistment, it states that i am enlisted to SCDF but no SAF,hence i do not have the chance to go BMT.does this mean that i have no chance to be a pilot or serve RSAF anymore?</p>
              <p>no.3) can i apply to transfer to the SAF and go through normal BMT?which may lead me to pilot training?</p>
              <p>please share your views on this.it will really be appreciated.i am very concerned about my future now and do not know what to do.thanks!*</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>hi all again. i have just learnt that i have passed my COMPASS test and pending for my interview. i was told that i will be transferred from SCDF to normal BMT once i pass my interview and medical checkup.</p>
              <p>however, after doing some 'research' on the course to becoming a pilot. i have some questions that need some advice on.</p>
              <p>let me pen down the following 'schedue'.pls correct me if i'm wrong.thanks</p>
              <p>airgrading course in aust: 2mths</p>
              <p>common leadership module: 2 weeks</p>
              <p>air force service term: 2 mths</p>
              <p>jungle orientation training, brunei: 2 weeks</p>
              <p>ground sch in aviation wing, air force sh: 3 mths</p>
              <p>basic flying phase in pearce,aust: 6-9 mths</p>
              <p>advanced flying phase: 11 months</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>however, before commencing on these phases, i must go through regular BMT and pass OCS before i start the airgrding couse right?or is there things that i may have missed out?furthermore, among all this stages, which stage will be the most crucial or the stage which is most difficult?lastly, must i do very well in order to apply for LSA in local uni?or that as long as i book a place in a local uni,i'm eligible for LSA?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thanks all for your kind advice.</p>

              <p>Nah, in fact for pilots their ocs term is quite different, and you most likely wont commission the same time as the rest of the people who went into OCS the same time as you. You as a pilot who successfully pass out, could very likely be holding on to your OCT rank for almost 2 years before you get your wings. As for the advance flying phrase, its only for fighters i believe. And im not sure whether BWC or the basic wings course is only 6-9 months, normally rsaf is kinda slow with this kinda intakes unless your a scholar.</p>
              <p>But all the best. Being a pilot is a tough job.</p>

              <p>changi west has no FSS because aerodrome control is handled by changi international.</p>
              <p>as for changi east, they do have night flying pretty often. i've met aos from there who said their shifts can be like 11am to 2am kind.</p>
              <p>as for which area i am in, i was trained under air defence control but i am not in H sqn. long story which i don't want to elaborate on.</p>

              <p>all flying squadrons are the same..they can fly early, fly in the afternoon or night.. but changi flying squadrons usually fly later at night because they're away from civilization and their timings are usually deconflicted with changi airport peak periods..</p>

              <p> cannot say heli is bad.</p>
              <p>just imagine, when somebody requires immediate medical attention near sg and where land/sea transport is unable to reach on time, the search and rescue heli is activated. the tech and ops crew will feel some kind of satisfaction whenever a life is being saved. </p>
              <p>and riding on a heli is indeed a thrilling "roller coaster" ride. :D not many people can do the same thing in their lifetime.</p>
