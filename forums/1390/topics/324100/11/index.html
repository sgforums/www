              <p>Hi all.. i am a singapore poly student year 1.. i failed in SYFC interview.</p>
              <p>Its my dream to become a pilot 1 day.. so another alternative is during army..</p>
              <p>I wan to ask whether anyone know the process? what i find out is..</p>
              <p>1) apply</p>
              <p>2)go compass test</p>
              <p>3)go interview</p>
              <p>4) medical</p>
              <p>5) BMT</p>
              <p>6) start pilot training.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is this the order? and.. where do i apply in the first place? if i pass the interview and medical and compass.. and after BMT i was been sent to pilot training.. isit possible that they will kick u out just like what syfc did ? then what do u do after that.. as to be a pilot u have to sign on... if they kick u out like that.. which means they have to forgo the signing on?? can anyone enlighten me thanks..</p>
              <p>How many SAF pilots made it to the end per year?? O.o</p>
              <p>what is the percentage of failing ?</p>
              <p>Another alternative is to add me to msn prefered a SAF pilot.. because i have tons of questions to ask =)  </p>

              <p>sound so impressive here...all our future RSAF pilot....but tell me one thing....how many singapore pilots are combat experienced and flown into life and death situations like dessert storm or patrolling over iraq.........so much talk about the glory of our RSAF.....dont be surprise if one day our forces get sent to iraq and get shot down by 18 year old weilding stinger missles.......</p>
              <p>why does singapore not take part in such patrols ,even secretly or participate with the present americans using there planes.....at least we can be proud of being trained under combat experienced pilots rather then electronic simulators.........so sad......</p>
              <p>if singapore was to go to war, can you garantee us winning? malaysia has sukov fighter planes my fellow singaporeans which are as compatible as what we have now in our air force.....</p>

              <p>Yupp whatever u say is quite true.. but well it may be someone's dream to become a pilot... Everyone will have a dream...</p>
              <p>Like what u say... if someone dream is a doctor.. and they have to face live and death situations too.. just like SARS.. a doctor sacrifice his life just to help to cure the patient. Everyone remembers it.</p>
              <p>Same in here.. Pilots are the Elite forces in SAF.. There are definately mistakes which they make... but all these makes them perfect.. as well as.. they are prepared for those that is been implement.. but what happens when they face some situations that they did not face before ? thats where the time where they learn.. So that others do not make the same mistakes too..</p>
              <p>=) i am just saying in my point of view... <br>Everyone will have different views... but just.. dun influence people on the bad aspects of the defences of Singapore..</p>
              <p>If u live in singapore... u will feel proud and safe as we have enough defence getting prepared for the worst.</p>

              <p>have u read through the respective online forums for rsaf and sia? it's a good place place to start to get your questions answered :)</p>

              <p>sia pilot--&gt; <a href="http://www.pprune.org/south-asia-far-east/185397-sia-cadet-pilot-all-batches-merged-79.html">http://www.pprune.org/south-asia-far-east/185397-sia-cadet-pilot-all-batches-merged-79.html</a></p>
              <p>since you're still in poly, dont apply for sia as yet, until you're about 24 or older.</p>
              <p>and yes air force can kick you out anytime during the training stint. if that happens, you continue serving the rest of your ns term until ORD. If im not wrong, a lot of people do not make it to the final phase.</p>
              <p>i applied to rsaf about 8 years ago, and sia early this year. I dint make it to both but maybe im not meant for flying :)</p>
              <p>read the online forums, there's a wealth of information that will help you out.</p>
              <p>gd luck!</p>

              <p>If you pass all your tests etc and are eligible to sign on as pilot, they will transfer u over to SAF when u sign on since a SAF regular cannot be serving in the SCDF</p>
              <p>4 may is still over 6 months away so should not be too late. Enlistment date will obviously change since SCDF and SAF have different enlistment dates.</p>

              <p>AOS, otherwise known as Air Operations Specialists, are the specialist equivalents of controllers (who are exclusive officers). They assist the officers in handling the day-to-day controlling and functioning in the squadrons.</p>
              <p>For the route of AOS, I will address the NSFs ones first. For an NSF AOS, you will undergo a few weeks of training at AFTC after your BMT. After you finish your course, you will be posted either to a flying squadron as an ops assistant (help to file flight plans, do admin work etc etc), to a flying support squadron (FSS) as an ops assistant (flying support squadrons are basically the squadrons which do the controlling operations at the 4 air bases. the BCP, base command posts, are the nerve centres of each base and they are under the supervision of the individual FSSs) and of cos back to AFTC as a simulator operator (or more affectionately known as pseudo-pilots for those there). I am not too sure if they post NSF AOS to 203 sqn but H sqn is definitely for regulars only. You will graduate as a PTE after your Basic AOS course but you should get your 3SG at least 6 months before you ORD after attending the Intermediate AOS/AOSS course (compared to 3 months before ORD under the prior system).</p>
              <p>For regular AOSS (Air Operations System Specialists), they will be posted to one of the 4 FSS, 203 sqn or H sqn. Before they start their AOSS training, they will be promoted to CPL and to 3SG after completion of their AOSS training.</p>
              <p>I hope that answers your questions.</p>

              <p>NSF AOS do get posed to 203 squadrons. Now the promotion criterias has been changed, promotion to 3SG is 9 months before ORD. And fighter squadron Ops assistants has the most busy and stressful lives among all. This i can assure you. And btw, im from the 82nd batch of AOS ording in 5 days time..LOL</p>
              <p>As for working hours, Squadron Ops Assistant is most of the time a mon-fri basis except on the occasional exercises on weekends, working hours is not fixed, but its not overnight either, you just work during the flying durations. As for BCP and 203 squadron, you're on Shift duties which means weekend and public holidays are counted, and for FSS the tower specialists, its also mostly mon-fri occasional weekend duties and hours not fixed. Actually the only fixed working hours are those simulator pilots in AFS or FSC, purely mon-fri and 830 to 530 i believe +/- 1 hour.</p>

              <p>Stellazio, Congras... Back to civilian life soon.. I guess ya in ATC rite... Is it fun there... Which base ya in... If u get to choose again, where wld u go.. How wld u rank the different places...</p>

              <p>Im not sure how to explain it to you, but i can tell you, its definitely difficult in a fighter squadron due to the number of sorties they fly each day and the amount of pilots.. Transport squadrons have it slightly easier, cause there're specialists there to help them too.. And no, im not in FSS, im in a fighter squadron and thats why i can tell you this. If you want a good experience by all means, but its a hard job. On the positive note though, fighter squadrons tend to go for many detachments like thailand and australia and the chances of you going is very high since there're only 2 of you.</p>
              <p>Simulator pilots gain nothing useful out of their tour in my opinion. But the life is relax and good. Squadron lifes, you get to meet many high ranking personnel, in my tour of duty, i've met people like chief, dy chief, cmd adoc etc all of whom are generals.. I dont think you'll get that luxury elsewhere.</p>
