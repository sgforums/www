              <p>2 years to get your pilot 'wings' and your LTA rank. After that you still have to go for ops conversion in the squadrons.</p>
              <p>As for the passing percentage, let's put it this way, out of those people who pass the COMPASS test + interview + medical and go into OCS, it's rumoured that 90% of them get chopped along the way over the 2 years.</p>
              <p>Besides, pilots do not only fly fighters. There are transport and helicopters as well.</p>
              <p>As for A levels vs diploma, diploma will command a higher pay than A levels but the difference is not that great compared to diploma vs degree.</p>
              <p>No questions are too stupid, though.</p>

              <p>one of my friend who is at police, said his colleague who was a NSF clerk at the Police academy managed to get selected for pilot. He pass all the three requirements. Now he is a pilot trainee already. </p>
              <p>My question is he didnt qualify for OCS yet can be selected for pilot? Im asking this question because i didnt qualify for OCS during my bmt, now im a specialist at artillery unit. I passed the WSO(FTR) test already. AFRC didnt call me up for medical and interview. </p>

I have an interest in aeroplanes and but was hesistant in signing on due to peer pressure during BMT. I did averagely well for my A level (not all As though. mixture of As and Bs).
