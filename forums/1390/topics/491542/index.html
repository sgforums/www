              <p>There are currently 3 <a class="mw-redirect" title="Armoured infantry" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armoured_infantry">armoured infantry</a> battalions in its operational structure: 40 SAR, 41 SAR &amp; <a class="mw-redirect" title="42 SAR" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_SAR">42 SAR</a>. A fourth battalion, 46 SAR, was deactivated in Jan 2011.</p>
              <p>There is another additional tank battalion, 48 SAR. There are also a 
              number of NS Reserve battalions that are activated during reservist 
              recalls. NS SAR units are numbered in three-digit formats(i.e. 442 SAR, 
              453 SAR, 485 SAR) to distinguish them from active units. These 
              three-digit designations are given to each active battalion's mono 
              intake when they complete of their 2-year mandatory service with their 
              respective active battalions and then form a reservist battalion.</p>
              <p>An armoured infantry battalion is made up of 5 companies: HQ coy, 3 
              Combat coy and Support coy. (The name of each company/coy differs across
               battalions and may start with other letters i.e. H(Hawk) coy &amp; 
              J(Jaguar) coy.)</p>
              <ul>
              <li>The HQ company encompasses the battalion's Intelligence Branch, 
              Manpower Branch, Training &amp; Operation Branch, Logistics Branch, 
              Signal Branch, Quartermaster Branch, Motor Transport and Tracked Vehicle
               Maintenance Branch.</li>
              <li>The A, B and C Companies are also known as combat companies, and they are made up of three platoons and a company HQ platoon</li>
              <li>The Support Company encompasses the following elements: Mortar, Pioneer/Engineer, ATGM, and Reconnaissance.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>While on operation, each combat team will be attached with a vehicle 
              maintenance and Pioneer section. The ATGM &amp; Mortar elements can be 
              attached to either combat company at their commanders direction 
              depending on mission profiles.</p>
              <p>Armoured Infantry (A.I) battalions shared similar traits as compared 
              towards their regular Infantry counterparts (roles such as Advancing 
              towards an opposing force, Assaulting an opposing force dug in positions
               and Delaying an opposing force advancement) but the differences are 
              each section in an A.I of an A.I platoon have their own individual 
              armoured tracked platform, A.I platoon carry more firepower on a 
              dismounted role as compared to regular infantry and A.I platoons 
              specialise conducting water bodies crossing with their armoured 
              platforms through flotation devices.</p>
              <p>During training or operations, external units can be attached to 
              armoured battalions as needed. Examples of such units are the Combat 
              Engineers' <a class="mw-redirect" title="Armoured vehicle-launched bridges" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armoured_vehicle-launched_bridges">armoured vehicle launch bridge</a> and mine clearance vehicles, or the Artillery's self-propelled 
              howitzers. When required by the nature of operations, heavy tanks can be
               attached to the armoured infantry battalions, either to the unit or to 
              specific companies.</p>

              <p>For all combat personnel who either join Armour as a regular or by 
              being posted to Armour after basic training, there are two main combat 
              vocations within Armour: a Tank Operator and the other is being an 
              Armoured Infantry. Vocation varies depending on the unit that the 
              personnel are being sent to.</p>
              <p>Tank operators will be trained to maintain and fire the tank, while 
              Armoured Infantry will be trained in basic infantry and armoured warfare
               tactics</p>
              <p>The Armour formation's main training institute is called the Armour 
              Training Institute (ATI) located in Sungei Gedong Camp which trains and 
              evaluates all active and NS Armour units.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Armoured_Regiment#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup></p>

              <p>Armoured troopers are basically infantry soldiers who have an armouned vehicle to sit in.  They fight as a team from the vehicle as well as dismount to protect the vehicle or perform the role of ordinary infantry soldiers.</p>
              <p>However, armoured troopers are more of attack-role soldiers.   For this reason, they seldom have to dig shellscrapes
              .  Because they have a vehicle to sit in, they also hardly have route marches.</p>

              <p>The Singapore Army's first armoured unit, 40 Singapore Armoured 
              Regiment, SAR for short (then known as 40 Singapore Armoured Battalion),
               was formed in November 1968. In that year, the Army decided to purchase
               both the <a title="Cadillac Gage Commando" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_Gage_Commando#V-200">V-200 Commando</a> vehicles and the <a title="AMX-13" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMX-13">AMX-13</a> tanks. 41 SAB was formed to operate <a title="AMX-13" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMX-13">AMX-13</a> tanks in 1969, and was the first armour unit to be equipped with the tanks.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Armoured_Regiment#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> The <a title="Cadillac Gage Commando" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_Gage_Commando#V-200">V-200 Commando</a> vehicles were divided between 40 and 41 SAB to form a mixture between the tanks and armoured infantry.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Armoured_Regiment#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
              <p>That same year, 40 SAB thrilled the crowd at the <a title="Singapore National Day Parade" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_National_Day_Parade">National Day Parade</a> in a drive past of 18 tanks to salute the President of Singapore.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Armoured_Regiment#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> HQ Armour has since organised armour column drive-pasts during the 
              National Day Parades in the years 1978, 1982, 1984, 1993, 2002 &amp; 
              2010. In addition to this, during every National Day Parade, men of the 
              formation are given the honour of the Presidential Lance Guards who will
               form up upon the President's arrival and departure. They carry lances 
              with a <a title="Pennon" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennon">pennon</a> that features the insignia of the Armour formation attached beneath the
               spearhead. This tradition is modelled after the knights in armour of 
              old who would form up to protect their king.</p>
              <p>The AMX-13 which was acquired back in 1969 was upgraded to the AMX-13 SM1 in 1988.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Armoured_Regiment#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
              <p>In July 1970, with the creation of 4th Singapore Armoured Brigade (HQ
               4 SAB), 40 &amp; 41 were re-flagged as 40 SAR &amp; 41 SAR 
              respectively. 2 further armoured units were created: 42 SAR was created 
              in 1971 &amp; 46 SAR in 1976. With the inception of full-time national 
              service in 1967, 40 SAR received her first mono intake in March 1970 
              &amp; 41 SAR received her first intake in July 1970.</p>
              <p>In 1973, the formation acquired the M113 to replace the V-200 Commando, which was further upgraded to the <a title="Variants of the M113 armored personnel carrier" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variants_of_the_M113_armored_personnel_carrier#Singapore">M113A2 Ultra IFV</a> in 1993 to keep up with the modern age.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Armoured_Regiment#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup></p>
              <p>The Regimental Colours of 40, 41 and 42 SAR were presented by 
              President Sheares at Selarang Camp on 6 September 1977. 46 SAR 
              Regimental Colours was presented to them on 29 October 1991.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Armoured_Regiment#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> 48 SAR's Regimental Colours was presented by President Tony Tan on 1 July 2013 at the year's SAF day parade.</p>
              <p>In 2006, it was announced that the AMX-13 SM1 Tanks would be replaced with Germany's <a class="mw-redirect" title="Leopard 2A4" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard_2A4">Leopard 2A4</a> <a class="mw-redirect" title="Main Battle Tank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Battle_Tank">Main Battle Tanks</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Armoured_Regiment#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup></p>
              <p>The formation also adopted the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Black Beret" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Beret">Black Beret</a> as its official headdress in line with other armour formations worldwide.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Armoured_Regiment#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> The black beret is recognised as a traditional symbol or identity of an armoured unit.</p>
              <p>In the Singapore Armed Forces Best Unit Competition, Only 5 Armour 
              units have won the title of Best Combat unit: 41 SAR (1978 &amp; 1984), 
              42 SAR (1979 &amp; 1982) &amp; 40 SAR (2002).</p>

              <p><strong>Mechanized infantry</strong> are <a title="Infantry" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry">infantry</a> equipped with <a class="mw-redirect" title="Armored personnel carriers" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armored_personnel_carriers">armored personnel carriers</a> (APCs) or <a title="Infantry fighting vehicle" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry_fighting_vehicle">infantry fighting vehicles</a> (IFVs) for transport and <a title="Combat" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat">combat</a> (see also <a class="mw-redirect" title="Mechanized force" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanized_force">mechanized force</a>).</p>
              <p>Mechanized infantry is distinguished from <a title="Motorized infantry" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorized_infantry">motorized infantry</a> in that its vehicles provide a degree of protection from hostile fire, 
              as opposed to "soft-skinned" wheeled vehicles (trucks or jeeps) for 
              motorized infantry. Most APCs and IFVs are fully tracked, or are 
              all-wheel drive vehicles (6×6 or 8×8), for mobility across rough ground.
               Some nations distinguish between mechanized and <strong>armoured infantry</strong>, designating troops carried by APCs as mechanized and those in IFVs as armoured.</p>
              <p>The support weapons for mechanized infantry are also provided with 
              motorized transport, or are built directly into combat vehicles, in 
              order to keep pace with the mechanized infantry in combat. For units 
              equipped with most types of APC or any type of IFV, fire support 
              weapons, such as <a title="Machine gun" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_gun">machine guns</a>, <a title="Autocannon" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocannon">autocannons</a>, small-bore direct-fire <a title="Howitzer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howitzer">howitzers</a>, and even <a class="mw-redirect" title="Anti-tank guided missile" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-tank_guided_missile">anti-tank guided missiles</a>, are often mounted directly on the infantry's own transport vehicles.</p>
              <p>Compared with "light" truck-mobile infantry, mechanized infantry can 
              maintain rapid tactical movement and (if mounted in IFVs) possess more 
              integral firepower. They require more combat supplies (ammunition and 
              especially fuel) and ordnance supplies (spare vehicle components), and a
               comparatively larger proportion of their manpower is required to crew 
              and maintain the vehicles. For example, most APCs mount a section of 
              seven or eight infantrymen, but have a crew of two. Most IFVs only carry
               six or seven infantry, but require a crew of three. To be effective in 
              the field, mechanized units also require large numbers of mechanics with
               specialized maintenance and recovery vehicles and equipment.</p>

              <p>The <strong>Singapore Armoured Regiment</strong> is a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Formation (military)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_%28military%29">formation</a> of the <a title="Singapore Army" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Army">Singapore Army</a> responsible for armoured warfare.
