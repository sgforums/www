            <div class='col-md body'>Operationally-Ready National Servicemen (NSmen) can focus on completing their In-Camp Training (ICT) with the understanding of their families.<br><br>Outstanding NSmen also owe their excellent performance during ICT to supportive employers that encourage their efforts.<br><br>On 28 Jul at Suntec City Convention Centre, the contributions of NSmen and companies were recognised at this year's Total Defence Awards Ceremony, which began in 1986.<br><br>Minister for Defence Teo Chee Hean, in his opening speech, praised NSmen for being "the backbone of our military defence".<br><br>"As citizens," said Mr Teo, "they contribute to our economic prosperity and our social and psychological defence."<br><br>In addition, Mr Teo lauded employers that allow NSmen to "go for their In-Camp Training and mobilisation exercises without having to be concerned that this will adversely affect their careers".<br><br>Civil-resource owners, too, were acknowledged for making "essential resource assets and services available for SAF operations and during national emergencies".<br><br>This year, the SAF NSmen of the Year Award was given to 12 individuals, who were chosen by a committee chaired by Chief of Defence Force Lieutenant-General Ng Yat Chung.<br><br>This award, introduced in 1994, distinguishes deserving NSmen for their expertise and commitment beyond the call of duty.<br><br>One of the recipients of this award was First Sergeant (1SG) (NS) Toh Chee Boon, Company Sergeant Major of 441st Battalion, Singapore Armour Regiment (441 SAR).<br><br>Winning the award caught the 32-year-old project manager off guard.<br><br>"I was surprised to win the award," said 1SG (NS) Toh. "I think it is a form of recognition for my unit as well."<br><br>He added: "National Service is a commitment for all Singaporeans, so I encourage my men to attend their ICT."<br><br>While 191 companies received Total Defence Awards this year, 10 of them won the Minister for Defence Award, the highest honour for firms that provide exemplary support for national defence.<br><br>Among the winners of this award was City Developments Limited, which rewards its employees for excelling in ICT.<br><br>The National University of Singapore, another award recipient, helps its staff do well in the annual Individual Physical Proficiency Test by holding training sessions.<br><br>Minister of State for Defence Associate Professor Koo Tsai Kee was also present at the ceremony.<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/publications/cyberpioneer/news/2006/August/02aug06_news.-imindefParsSub-0001-TextImage.imindefParsSubtextimage.gif"><br>Minister for Defence Teo Chee Hean (left) mingling with some winners of the SAF NSmen of the Year Award and their families.</div>
