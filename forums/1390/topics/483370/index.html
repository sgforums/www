              <p>Hi, I'm currently on temp PES C2L2 for <strong>Bilateral Patellar Tilt</strong> (Slanted Knee Cap) and <strong>Runner's Knee</strong> (Wear &amp; Tear of the knee). Before I enlisted, I was diagnosed with <strong style="line-height: 1.231;">Bilateral Patellar Tilt, </strong><span style="line-height: 1.231;">but after a specialist from the SAF checked my knee during the CMPB checkup, the specialist gave me the green light to enlist with a PES FIT status.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> But during my BMT, due to my slanted knee cap condition, my knee pain further aggravated and later I went to see a specialist after I POP-ed and was diagnosed with an additional condition, the Runner's Knee.</span></p>
              <p>SAF had accepted the responsibility of my injury and issued me an Service Injury Card which covers part of my medical cost for my knee beyond my ORD.</p>
              <p>Currently, my concern is that I know for myself my knee will never recover even being on physiotheraphy for almost 1 year. The pain is still there when I try to jog beyond 2km and when I do jumps. I would want to make my PES Status permanent, but the MO at my camp insist that their guideline states that for my injury, the maximum they can go for my downgrade is between 6months - 12months. No permanent PES C for my condition.</p>
              <p>I feel that the MO in my camp is too "by the book" and he die die wouldn't want to send me for medical board for a permanent down pes with a case-by-case basic kind of treatment.</p>
              <p>My PES C2L2 ends when I ORD, and my service injury card only covers part of my medical expenses when I ORD. I do not want to use my own money for my treatment after I ORD to continue seeing specialist for their memo to keep extending my pes c status. I would want to go for a permanent down pes as with my condition, there's no way I could participate in combat fit vocations ICT and IPPT.</p>
              <p>Any ideas what should I do? Thanks in advance.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am facing similar problems as you. I was in pes A initally and I overworked in the gym so got slipped disc even before I enlist but I thought it's normal back pain though since the polyclinic and private clinics said it's just muscle ache and told me to do lower back strenthening exercise.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I just completed my slipped disc l4/l5 disectomy operation and when I report back to the sungei gadong camp, they said it's a stay in unit so they want me to stay in?! So I definitely requested for stay out and I live at woodlands, so to travel to that camp requires 1 hour of my time. My wound still haven't fully recovered then I requested to post to a nearer camp and I suggested chong pang or sembawang since it's not that ulu. Lastly, it's my pes is just temporary down pes and I thought operation already will get permanent down pes?</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I am seeing my specialist to write another memo for me in a few days time so I hope he will give me excused stay in and prolong walking distance so that I can get stay out and post to my nearer camp! hopefully he will write for me.</span></p>

              case statement is prepared for review
              discussion at the monthly medical board meet (usually at

              the Chairman (SAF Regular Medical Doctor of MAJOR
              rank or above). Your Medical Board result will be post mailed

              fitness condition for NS.<br> <br> You <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MUST</span></em> bring along all your investigation results and memorandums from
              your external physician or specialist during your medical review.

              scheduled for a medical board to downgrade you if your medical
              condition is significant, or be referred to a restructured hospital
              for further examination depending on the outcome of your medical

              <p>Hi, the MO in my camp was indeed an anal person whereby he's lazy. I heard that he do not want to push people for permenent PES status as he has to fight for you during medical board that's held once a month that would make him more troublesome. Therefore he would always just follow the book so that it would be clear cut for my case, no need to waste time.</p>
              <p>Lucky for me, the MO just ORD-ed and this new MO is looking into my case currently and recommended me for medical board on a case-by-case basic promising to fight for my case as it was dragged for too long.</p>

              problem that need to be addressed, do let the officer know—he may be 
              able to give you some advice or time off to settle your problems.</p>
