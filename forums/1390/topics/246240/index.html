Most regulars will serve their school tour as OCs. Besides, their isn't enough of regular 2LT or LTA from each cohort.<br><br>Btw, no offense to any 2LT or LTA who were posted to BMTC after commissioning, they are not exactly the "cream of the crop" per say (Based on their ranking during OCS days at least). You guys may not agreed but that's what i gathered during my days in the mid-ninties.</div>
