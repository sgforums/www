I understand that flat feet people occassionally have pain after prolong standing or walking but still it is not downgradable. But torn ligament is at least a Pes C2 that's the reason why many of our national soccer players are at least C2 as torn ligament are common in a sport like soccer. Btw you guys should understand that the MB follow strictly to Pes grading red book, if the board should give a Pes grading not stated or lower than the book suggest, the CO of MCC will rejected the case and the case have to be reboarded. Also even jonalim was downgraded for flat feet, he would still have to go through BMT again regardless he is Pes A/B or C, ps Flat Feet definitely no Pes E. He still have to endure the pain of prolong standing or route march. Suggestion to jonalim is that maybe u can ask MO to excuse you whenever you needed for certain activities. You also can also ask the board to suggest to let you avoid certain vocation.</div>
