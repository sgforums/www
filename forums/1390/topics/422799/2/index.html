              <p> </p>
              </dt><dt><strong>M</strong>any individuals whose Kundalini has been unexpectedly unleashed DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING, and the prevailing social ignorance about this multidimensional transformative process makes it hard to find medical or alternative health practitioners or spiritual advisors who recognize the symptoms, particularly when they are strongly physical. Many people know that the risen Kundalini flings open gates to all sorts of mystical, paranormal and magical vistas but few realize it can also dramatically impact the body. A large percentage of <em>Shared Transformation</em> subscribers have reported long bouts of strange illness as well as radical mental, emotional, interpersonal, psychic, spiritual and lifestyle changes. Over and again we hear stories of frustrating, sometimes desperate visits to doctors, healers, counselors, etc. who neither understood nor were able to help with the myriad pains and problems catalyzed by raging Kundalini.
              <p><strong>The following are common manifestations of the risen Kundalini:</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Muscle twitches, cramps or spasms. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Energy rushes or immense electricity circulating the body </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Itching, vibrating, prickling, tingling, stinging or crawling sensations </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Intense heat or cold </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Involuntary bodily movements (occur more often during meditation, rest or sleep): jerking, tremors, shaking; feeling an inner force pushing one into postures or moving one's body in unusual ways.  (May be misdiagnosed as epilepsy, restless legs syndrome, or PLMD </li>
              <li>Alterations in eating and sleeping patterns </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Episodes of extreme hyperactivity or, conversely, overwhelming fatigue </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Intensified or diminished sexual desires </li>

              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Hearing an inner sound or sounds, classically described as a flute, drum, waterfall, birds singing, bees buzzing but which may also sound like roaring, whooshing, or thunderous noises or like ringing in the ears. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Mental confusion; difficulty concentrating </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Altered states of consciousness: heightened awareness; spontaneous trance states; mystical experiences (if the individual's prior belief system is too threatened by these, they can lead to bouts of psychosis or self-grandiosity) </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Heat, strange activity, and/or blissful sensations in the head, particularly in the crown area. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Ecstasy, bliss and intervals of tremendous joy, love, peace and compassion </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Psychic experiences: extrasensory perception; out-of-body experiences; pastlife memories; astral travel; direct awareness of auras and chakras; contact with spirit guides through inner voices, dreams or visions; healing powers </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Increased creativity: new interests in self-expression and spiritual communication through music, art, poetry, etc. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Intensified understanding and sensitivity: insight into one's own essence; deeper understanding of spiritual truths; exquisite awareness of one's environment (including "vibes" from others) </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Enlightenment experiences: direct Knowing of a more expansive reality; transcendent awareness </li>

              <p>Some simple ways to calm kundalini awakenings</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) take long walk , especially in nature, hug trees, let your  feet touch the earth.</p>
              <p>Pass your energy to the nature</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) soak in warm bath with aromatherapy oils</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) drink herbal tea, rose, chrysanthemum to soothe nerves</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) exercise, jogging, long walks and swimming help. Especially swimming in the sea with the high salt content.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) eat more vegetables</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6) sleep long hours</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Stop any meditation / yoga/ spiritual chanting that you are doing if your kundalini is very overwhelming.</p>
              <p>2) Listen to your body, what it wants. If your body craves for raw vegetable, just eat more.   If your body is very light and you often feel like you are floating, eat some meat to ground yourself</p>
              <p>3) Visit a transpersonal psychiatrist to talk about your kundalini awakenings. A transpersonal trained psychiatrist is more accepting of your strange encounters.</p>
              <p>The keyword is "transpersonal" .</p>

              <p>Kundalini and Chakra is well accepted in the West.  It's a very traditional knowledge for hindu and the Indians.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The West has even started a transpersonal psychology school for these kundalini experiencers. They deal with it in a scientific manner, including out of body, seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and using hypnothesis to recall a person's past lifes.</p>
              <p>Kundalini can happen to anyone.  Just share the information and less people will live in fear of being mocked at for being going crazy.</p>

              <p>My dear friend,</p>
              <p>I absolutely understand where u are coming from, because I had a similar problem a while back - while no hearing voices - but it was also an adjustment disorder.</p>
              <p>You need to get yourself out to a camp that gives you more space to breathe, more space to be calm and think.</p>
              <p>NS is always so hectic. do this do that. yell here yell there. While yes, it toughens some people up, it makes some people go into a different state of mind. We are all individuals.</p>
              <p>Try to talk to your MO, see what the SAF ward can do for you. Prescribed medication will help to keep your emotions under regulation and control, until you can post out, and then you will find someplace better, someplace you fit in, can function perfectly and BACK to your old self of constantly being funny, talkative, adventurous.</p>
              <p>I am an NSF too, and i downpesed for beta thalessemia minor as well, but now I am completely back to being myself and while I am ashamed of what happened to me, you have to understand we are all different.</p>

              <p><strong>Kundalini and The Chakras:</strong><br><br>When the chakras are cleansed and emotions have healed one may feel open, clean, wonderful joy and balance. Sometimes this may be mistaken as Kundalini rising, which in fact, is a part of the whole. If you look at the Kundalini as flowing through water dams of the chakras, as the Kundalini rises there is an activation of the properties of that chakra. Many gates are opened at this point so there are numerous symptoms that accompany this transition: emotional, physical, mental, spiritual and increased psychic abilities. Also I might add, when we undergo any spiritual change, or there is a cosmic flux, regardless of the Kundalini, we will experience nearly the same symptoms. So going with the flow of things and being energetically aware is important.<br><br>Some report the Kundalini being activated at different chakra points other than the root/base chakra. As in the above mentioned, the Kundalini is part of the whole. So if a chakra is "more clear" the Kundalini energy could be more "prevalent" in that sector and eventually will start spreading to other points, as in the example of the Kundalini coming from the top chakra down to the lower ones. From the "top down" is sometimes referred to as Grace and embraces the concept of a spiritual awakening. Kundalini primarily concerns itself with the root chakra with the energy moving upward along the spine.<br><br>The action of the "top down" also coincides with the "descension and ascension" process. In "descension" energy is coming down through the spheres passing into your auric energy, ultimately permeating your body. The Life Force is an amazing "creature" and is a gift from Spirit, no matter the way, form or circumstance it becomes activated.<br><br>Ki, Chi and Prana are synonymous as the same Life Force in which some people seem to get confused. You're not alone. Swami Shivom Tirth said that "the difference is not in the nature of the activity but in the consciousness that observes it." Perhaps Ki, Chi and Prana are merely part of the whole making up a common set of experiences that connect them. The Kundalini is hallmarked and documented as dealing with the central channel of the spine directly. Whereas, Ki, Chi and Prana are "more" all pervading, they are your Life Force regardless of the Kundalini rising. However, when the Kundalini is activated is does increase your awareness of Ki, Chi and Prana in all things.</p>
