              <p>  Actually not for me lah, I nearly going to complete NS le (3 more months) but I read about the old topic of this and was thinking it could be something really useful for people who want to Down Pes or see no point in working hard for the army. Most of all, it's for people who know they cannot afford to go through the army without loosing all they care for.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>  I'm not endorsing people to 'chao keng' with this topic, I just want to let people know what lets them downgrade Pes and identify it within themselves -because I know that CMPB doesn't do a through job and some problems that you ignore will catch up with you later in NS. So it's good if you can identify and tell them the problem during your checkup, they won't know anything unless you tell them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> <img src="http://hbcprotocols.com/malfunction/depression.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'll start:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First thing you need to know, what they do during medical checkup. They will take blood test 2-3 vials worth, so if you are squeamish: be prepared.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>  Then a pee test where you have to go into a cubicle and pee a sample for them, don't worry privacy is allowed here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>   Then a ECG heart test, this is where they failed for a friend of mine though, he has heart problems but when they tested him, they said he was fine. Despite his outright declaration that he had heart issues, they said he was fine solely based on his specialist appointment being after his enlistment date. He went in BMT, three days later he collapsed from heart attack and was sent to Alexandra hospital; downgrade to Pes E. So, beware.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Later they will take your photo, measure your size blah blah blah then all done.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly,</p>
              <p>  The following is a true story on how an NSF got downgraded to Pes E. I'll call him Mr. X because I don't feel like betraying him. Mr X was Pes B (or A, I can't remember but he was in Tekong Leadership batch) when he was enlisted but halfway through his BMT, barely even a week, he had a breakdown in the middle of the night where he went up to his PC and declared depression.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He spoke about anxiety, not being able to sleep at all during the past week, fascinations with killing himself to end it all, financial problems, family issues ...basically everything leading to one BIG FAT DEPRESSION. He was sent to IMH whereby they evaluated him, basically make him stay in a room seperated from the officially crazy people but he told me he felt even less stressed with the crazy people than he was in tekong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So after a day, they called his parents down. Talk to them, talk to him. Then met up with another session with him at SAF Ward, he just described what he told his PC over and over again. Which is tekong's culture shock, the people yelling profanities at him all the time without him retaliating back and the absolute lack of civility in there was too much for him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After about a month of dilly dallying or so, they gave him permernant Pes E. I don't think he chao keng one, smart guy but overanalyzes things (seriously, talk to him is like talking to an encyclopedia sometimes) ...maybe that's why depression? Moral of the story is, if you can't stand the army, don't ge kiang and go through it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Take this chance to share the problems people might face that might downpes them. For those "garang" people or just want to talk big only ah, stay off this topic. I don't welcome you. This is supposed to be a helpful topic to those who know they can't go through NS like everyone else and to prevent more deaths in NS (prevention is better than cure), once again I don't endorse chao keng so I don't encourage people to use these as methods to bluff till you Pes E.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S Bluff till Pes E also no use one, Pes A you go through physical hardship. You will hate army but you will like a few friends you have, seriously you will be so close to them + the fact that you won't see a female officer (unless you heng heng like me) will make you wonder about proper conduct.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pes E you go through social hardship, you won't like the people you are working with and you will hate the army for it. But you might like the job you have there, clerical work counts for experience after you ROD. Expect office politics. Lots of it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Both also suffer, unless you become Pes F then I nothing to say. :X</p>

              <p>I know it sounds very weird. But in the directive it is written in such a way that it is YOU who volunteer for NS. And willing to serve the nation wholeheartedly. That's why people who volunteer for NDU and commando will tend to be selected. Cos they wan it. </p>
              <p>So the idea is you volunteer and they select the best able-bodied men to serve.</p>
              <p>Then, it becomes your responsibility to "inform" them about your medical condition. And not for them to find out and check up your problem.</p>
              <p>It know it does not make sense but it is so.</p>
