              <p>1year 4mths+ later go surgery and MC until ORD (try to fight for pes F but failed)</p>
              <p>Last day of NS: Come back sign clearence and i heard no job scope but i also heard My mdm last min change mine to storeman but with my leg case is impossible to be storeman =D and failing the clerk test (act dumb) means cannot do clerk also. </p>
              <p>Was also told by my senior that my unit section (secert) very rare/no one have to do reservist but dunno how true. </p>
              <p>ORD: 14 sept 2011 as E9L1</p>
              <p>Heard got some rumor that all pes can come back reservist (mostly clerk in Pes E kinna) </p>
              <p>Until now i didnt get any letter for unit posting etc. (i want to keep it that way) </p>
              <p>Also didnt go to the sg portal dunno do what status update or what shit (dun want to get detected) (dunno how true if dun do will not get call up for reservist)</p>
              <p>Problem now: i intend to go oversea at the end of this year to do my uni for 3 years. but i dunno who or what to do or where i should go to apply to go oversea for a long term exit permit (i fuking dun like this country and i intend to imgrate in a few years time) (yes i do travel quiet a lot so dun shoot me down for saying i havent seen the other side)  </p>
              <p>I got no posting so cant tell them too and i dun intend to let them know that i got no posting. (fly under radar) </p>
              <p>How should i go about this? i do not intend to call back my old secert unit and ask them what to do NOR DO I INTEND TO CALL CMPB is like stiring up a hornet nest. </p>
              <p>I belive i fell into the forgetten list and i dun want them to revive it. </p>

              <p>1. Apply for overseas uni. When success, get a enrolment letter.</p>
              <p>2. Apply to contact@ns.sg, fax or email the enrolment letter, for overseas exit permit.</p>
              <p>They will shoot the email around SAF, but it is none of your concern (full stop)</p>

              <p>The universities dont accept psychotic students. Besides, can you handle such stress?</p>
              <p>Every year, plenty of NSF downgrade before ORD. They dont have an assigned vocations. And yet, we have never heard of such a problem.</p>

              <p>It's actually very common for people, especially in non combat jobs, to wait years just to be assigned to a unit and to have their first reservist call up.</p>
              <p>You have not slipped under the radar. Your PES and how useful you are affect when and whether your unit wants to call you up. But if there is any directive to be satisfied, your unit will have to call you up sooner or later.</p>

              <p>Lokey: I was already accpected into the uni under the condition that i must clear certain papers first and currently working on it. </p>
              <p>No im not some psyco i know what i'm doing and i wouldnt go round killing professors. </p>
              <p>I have the natural ability to "let loose" and let my mental side come up when in army. it works perfectly. but it wasnt serious enough. I have full control over myself and been trained to do that ever since getting discovered with this problem since Pri 2. </p>
              <p>I want them to think i'm some crazy unless person that can't walk when i'm not =) and well in term of getting away from the army, my leg case was real and was a total surpise to me that it was that serious. My leg is fixed but it's not 100% ok. doctor advise was that if i were to do the full treatment, it would be terrible pain with some risk and take a long long time to recover. maybe 2-3 years. (they had to break my ankle bone into 3 section per leg and reconstruct from scratch. </p>
              <p>Alize: what do u suggest? i got another friend from the same unit and it been more then a year that he got no posting. and he is pes B. </p>
              <p>About the portal thing. i heard u got to go online to the goverment site and login after u ord to change your status on your own. i forgot which site already. so far my friend in that unit i came from didnt go online and non of them got any posting =D</p>
              <p>and yes i intend to stay as useless and as retard in the eyes of the amy. =) the problem is that who do i request for permit to head overseas and GTFO?</p>
              <p>anyone who is reading this. please feel free to reply and assist. i thank you all for the time =)</p>

How do I apply for disruption for NS if I am staying overseas for a prolonged period?</strong><br><br>You
                           can apply for exit permit online. You must obtain your NS unit's/

              <p>Tell you what. Read up on these:</p>
              <p>There's scheduled callups like ICT. If you are resident in Sg, these will be served on you way in advance and going overseas on exit permit won't save you. If you are long term overseas, these wont be scheduled for you. Go get an exit permit you'll be fine.</p>
              <p>There's also mobilisation. If you were out of Singapore and were not specifically told to be around for them, you're okay.</p>

              <p>I have the natural ability to "let loose" and let my mental side
                  come up when in army. it works perfectly. but it wasnt serious
                  enough. I have full control over myself and been trained to do that
                  ever since getting discovered with this problem since Pri

                  army, my leg case was real and was a total surpise to me that it
                  was that serious. My leg is fixed but it's not 100% ok. doctor
                  advise was that if i were to do the full treatment, it would be
                  terrible pain with some risk and take a long long time to recover.
                  maybe 2-3 years. (they had to break my ankle bone into 3 section
                  per leg and reconstruct from scratch. </p>
              <p>Alize: what do u suggest? i got another friend from the same
                  unit and it been more then a year that he got no posting. and he is

              <p>So you just scan the "letter of acceptance" into the computer, go to ns.sg and apply for exit permit. What is so difficult? It is only click, click, click only.</p>
              <p>There is no such thing as "no posting". No matter where you are, you are under the huge umbrella of your previous unit. Mine is navy.</p>
              <p>Your old unit is the current unit you are in. You would only change unit until you are post out, in which, the clerk will physcially take your personal portfolio and medical docket to the new unit and store in the new metal cabinet.</p>
              <p>Some1 will settle the exit permit for you. You dont need to know who do it, how it is being done and etc. Just provide them the letter of acceptance for the uni, the start and end date.</p>

              <p>You talk about your story of downgrading ... and etc. BUT... you only just want to apply for exit permit to go to oversea to study. So why bother telling us the old grandmother  story. It is very irritating to listeners.</p>
