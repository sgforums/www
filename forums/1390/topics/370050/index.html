              <p>Let me enlighten you, in the current specialist cohort, most are Diploma and more are going for the degree course sponsor by the Army.</p>
              <p>Yes, you can quit school and join the specialist cohort, but do you think that promotion will be so easy for you and beside that, you can count your chances to become a Warrant Officer..very limited. Why dun you carry on with your study, that will gif you both knowledge and employment opportunities in near future.</p>
              <p>Btw, to survive in Army is not so easy then wat you thought.</p>

              <p>For people who are not interested in studying, they naturally would not do well in ITE, Poly, JC. After staying in school get the lousy result, he may not even graduate. Even when they graduate with a just can-make it result, which employer would hire you? Which further education insitiute wants you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can assume that the guy can study, but in fact he cannot, not interested, not motivated and ... he cannot go far. Even getting the "O" level cert might be difficult already. Hence signing on is GOOD. Prehaps even SAF might not wants you, because now they are looking for techinical professional, best with engineering cert or something.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Getting qualitfication is one thing, able to get the qualification is another. I think out of all the jobs for O level, SAF specialists are paid the best. Holding that vocation for 5 -10 years, allow you to start a business or go for course when complete.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I remember my friend stop at A level, sign on as a NDU diver, why? He replied, even if he grad as a Uni he cannot earn as much as what he is now. And he cannot get into Uni in the first place. I think he is a private diving instructor now, earning good $$.</p>

              <p>Signing on use to be good when the bowl is made of gold. But since they decided to change the golden bowl to a wooden one, it is no longer as good as it was before.</p>
              <p>Your friend is an abnomaly, most people who comes out of SAF ( and are below Maj/WO ) find themselves out of job and with "no job experience". If you add on "no "O"-lvl cert" to that, I seriously can't see how a 30+ can survive.</p>
              <p>He has leave the books for too long to continue his studies, and yes, he can try starting a business, but odds are it is going to go down due to his lack of experience.</p>
