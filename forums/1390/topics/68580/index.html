It should be the same as other combat units.<br>During my BMT,i was selected for the MP interview and they will choose according to your height.<br>Regarding training, After your BMT(of course you ahve to go thru BMT!) you will have to go thru a MP basic course abt 3 months,and if u're coming from SISPEC, you will have to go thru a SPEC 2 course(3 months). During this course, you will learn military law,Unarm combat,roles of the military police(how to arrest people....Things that MPs do...),basic drills,FIBUA, how to handle a P226 pistol...<br>After that ,you will have to go thru a 3 D 2 N summary exercise. After that u will get your posting. There are 5 coy...they are Zone provost(Law enforcement), Active provost(drills,drills and silent precision drills,parades,SAF day and NDP), Special Investigation Branch ,Security branch and Dog unit. If u kenna external posting, it'll be doing guard duty at mindef or being the guard commander there. If u sign on as a regular, you will  go thru your tour, which means that u will have a chance to be posted around the companies in Provost.<br>About the interview that u mention, i dont really know what are the questions. just be confident and show your interest and desire in becoming a MP. If you kenna my company after the MP basic course, you will be doing drills,drills,parades,parades....ironing of uniform....silent precision drills.(difficult to master)..Need anymore info just email me.</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> Clear cut info about MP</div>

During my batch,there were about 100 over people coz NDP is coming and we need the people for the Silent Precision drill performance. but recently there are only 30 to 40 people posted to provost. If u can sign on here b4 ur enlistment would be the best.<br>Regarding the investigations, it's mostly AWOLs,Deserters(people who AWOL for a very long time), any issues that has to do with military stuffs(crimes that are committed by military personnel). I'm not from SIB so i'm not really sure. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When browsing the recruitment website,i realised that unlike the other vocations, MP do not have a so-call officers direct entry where uni graduates will enter the force as officers.so does this mean that uni grads who want to join MP will still join them as specialists.Also is there a chance for MP specialists to be promoted to MP officers?</div>
