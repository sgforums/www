            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, there could be some truth to the statement that WO BMT Coy are normally quite efficient. Have heard of cases whereby a Coy can finish their night shoot and send arms by 2130hrs!! (the norm of night shoots is to finish and send arms by 2300hrs.... sometimes even 0100hrs...)<br><br>However, i would say MOST WOs are experienced, but this can differ as we are all still individuals and humans. We assume that because someone has 20-30yrs in the service they are "experienced", but if they have been doing the same old shit the same way since Day 1... then really they have just gone through 1 years X 30 times instead of experiencing 30years. Don't know if i'm explaining this correctly.<br><br>I guess what i'm trying to say is, look at each individual and don't assume that "Officers don't know their dicks from their arses" &amp; "WOs are GODS cos they are MWOs/SWOs".</div>

They could single-handedly bring down the SAF, in my opinion.<br><br>To be honest, I've just left Tekong last year (2004) December. And I think much has changed. We're only training "nua peng" nowadays. Thinking soldiers? My cute-perky-bottom. And from what I've heard before I left, BMT no longer has so-called confinement. They will book-out on the 2nd weekend, correct me if I'm wrong.<br><br>I was still around when LTA Luqman was Foxtrot OC. And yes. He was one "garang" officer. But personally? I think he's a sneaky one. But that's just my own personal opinion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>And oh yes.
