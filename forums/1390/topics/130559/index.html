Perhaps when u start out as a combat medic u will be a 3SG medic with some other medics under u at the medical centre. I think most you can get is to Senior Medic at Battalion, Brigade and Division level. Of course, the higher level u get the higher rank u get.<br><br>I've seen Battalion Senior medic 1SG, Brigade SSG, and maybe Division is Warrant Officers??<br><br>2. i think combat medics are Specialist vocations, much like Section Commanders.<br><br>3. Senior Medic<br><br>4. This sure depends on performance. And as combat medic, i think you're in for one hell of a time. Sure, if everything is good and well and peaceful, you won't have much of a stress or whatever but think abt this:<br>once there's a medical incident, emergency happening in your unit amd you as the medic is of course called upon as the first line of aid, and then at this crucial moment somehow u kan cheong and screwed up the casualty and something serious happens to him, then u can kiss goodbye to your career. it just need this one time.<br><br>even failing to administer the standard first aid procedure will kana jialat if something bad happens because of that<br><br>i've seen experienced medics trained so hard and are so proficient with the drills and procedures and stuff but jus at the moment he failed to deliver and then thats it. the real thing is always different from normal day practices.<br><br>Stress management and ability to work under extreme pressure is of utmost importance i reckon. sometimes i really pity those combat medics especially the NSFs. and dun forget on top of all that u still need to carry weapon and cheong sua.<br><br>Kudos to the combat medics of the SAF!</div>
