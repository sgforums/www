Many are still injured seriously due to the impact of the bullets. Unless the person hit you from a faraway place, the bullet-proof vests don't really help.<br><br>On the other hand, it is better to wear one because bullets shot faraway still can hurt you, and bullet-proof vests can prevent that.<br><br>But one wonder the practical side towards those vests. I don't think in wars the bullet-proof vests can prevent you from blowing up into pieces if a grenade blows up right in front of you. And machine guns as well as rifles are used as well. Nobody would use a gun for practical reason, because the range isn't as far.<br><br>My 2 cents.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, Bulletproof vest are infact bullet resistence, but they do stop most ballistic round up to 7.62 standard round... with a level III rating.<br><br>But the current US army vest can only stop one Round or one hit, then it is useless. Because the ceramic plates would fracture and dissipate the force. Any laters hit would penetrate Kevla or not. And you can drop it at waist level, it will be destroyed.<br><br>The best Vest seemed to be the DRAGON SKIN, like the ancient chinese armour used. it is also flexiable and dissipate force and can take multiple hits (repairable), but heavy.<br><br>Actually it's not heavier, it just that it protect more area.<br><br>In my opinion, Singapore should provide more body armour to the soldier. I think it's the maintainants and hot environment that the Gahment hesitate. But the Dragon Skin is an OK investment. I mean it's more durable.</div>
