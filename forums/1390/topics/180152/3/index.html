Artillery dpicm rounds will kill exposed infantry regardless of body armor. Covering an area of football field, u think u can run in time with or without body armor?<br><br>I don't see the logic in quite a lot of the arguements here.  If we are at war, and I have to be in a hostile environment, I'd take every bit of protection I can get to get OUT OF IT ALIVE.  I'm not gonna outrun a bullet without body armor. So I'd take body armor and make sure my movements are tactical and economised.<br><br>New generations of body armor, bullet proof vests HAVE shown that they are capable of stopping rounds out right.  Even if they dont stop rounds outright, anything less than a magnum/AP round is ain't gonna cost much tissue damage. Chances of getting wounded and surviving is at least higher.<br><br>The best light weight solution to  bullets now, is still non-existent.  Ever heard of an inertia dampening field?  Its still theoretical, but its gonna be as light as the unit can get.  </div></blockquote>Yes, wearing body armour keeps you from bullets on the body. The best way to keep bullets from the body is actually not to stick your head in a firefight but stick it away.<br><br>If you're making a run, a long distance run, after you had been recalled to war when you're working ten to twelve years in office work. I wonder if you can run faster with body armour or without.<br><br>And if you've read about warfare. Most died from injuries, than being shot to death immediately. That's true. Body Armour keeps you alive, yes, more unlikely to get killed but it doesn't help if your constitution is expected to be horrible after so many years had passed.<br><br>I wondered if you realised more than half our army are out working. It's easy to say wear the armour and run but it's really hard since our constitution was never the same as we were back during ns.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think this is showing up the shortcomings in having a conscripted army.<br><br>Look at how the British Army is mostly volunteer professionals, with career soldiers. Even the reservists are 'voluntary'.<br>Look at how Russia is scaling back its (once-massively) conscripted numbers to rebuild with professional soldiers.<br><br>With a force composition of (apparently, going by the threads in this forum) so few professionals, perhaps it is time for sg to look at what the advantages and disadvantages are of a conscripted v professional military force.<br><br>With a professional volunteer force you always know that they would be at the peak of their abilities at all times (ergo, be able to operate under harsh conditions with all types of gear, without complaining incessantly to their mothers).<br>Those that can keep at their peak even after service, often retain their skillsets via the Reserves (Territorial Army - British equivalent).<br>This means the Military always has a pool of very highly skilled and capable forces, and they do not have to worry about 'skinny, doctors-note-carrying lambs' that do more to hinder (or, indeed, embarrass it) the service than to augment it.<br><br>Conscripted armies are good for cannon fodder and paper tigers.<br>A professional, full-time force is much more of a imposing image on the battlefield to any conscripted army that dares oppose them.<br>Time for sg to have a rethink?<br></div>

We have someone saying that sticking your head up is stupid, better to scoop... then how objectives are to be achieved. You can flanked, but are you saying enemies are stupid ?<br><br>Some of you prefer moblility, true... that does not mean you wouldn't be hit. As I say, many BA can stop rounds up to 7.62.

If you see your enemy all armoured up, that will certainly hit a nerve - WTF am I not wear a BA.</div></blockquote>Agree.<br><br>But if protection and mobility can go together, it would be the best protection one can have.

On the other hand, having a vest that provides minimum protection but offers maximum mobility is not good either because all it takes is a few shots to kill you.<br><br>For everything, one has to strike a balance. In warfare, although it can be quite impossible to do so, one can try to find a compromise somewhere. An alert mind and sharp thinking still matters in warfare. No point having everything to protect you but you aren't alert and sharp enough. There's a limit to what things can do for you and you have to help yourself after that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now that we have heard from various replies.<br><br>We can conclude that The Use of BA is mission specific. Well, because the govt cannot provide BA for everyone.. due to cost. Also depends whether the immediate zone you operate is a Hot zone. REMF of course, do not require BA most of the time.<br><br>If you're the MO in a hot zone where gun fire are sometimes a block away. The CO would definately require you to armour up. On Lrrp mission, the objective to scout the area, then mobility is crucial, since you are expected to scoot from the AO. I have seen US troops wearing their BA in the Iraqi Desert for hours on end, so what make them able to take the heat that we asian in tropical environment can't.<br><br>So, gentlement ... BA is a useful, If it is require for me to hump 20 km than moblity is key. But in urban and security detail than BA is good.<br><br></div>
