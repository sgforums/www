And if I remembered correctly - the Brunei instructors were a little bit pissed with us (Regulars arguing with regulars).  Imagine - the battalion, moving with jungle hats only for jungle warfare. Helmets were strap to the SBO, until the actual attack (to satisfy the instructors). Our CO was really a great officer, went on to be the CCO right after.<br><br>The jungle hats were not issued officially - we paid for them, given a big discount for battalion level purchase. It was a long time ago, I suspect we may be the first, but not the last unit to do so, I think. This was done only in Brunei but the hats remain with us for unofficial use in the field for the rest of our NS (provided other people don't complain).<br><br>I still have the jungle hat somewhere in my house.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nah BA is not some secret-squirrel controlled item like our NODs. They ARE a store item, and FOR UNITS THAT NEED THEM, they are issued en masse. When I got mine, it was just handed over to me, and I kept it in my room. No need to return to store after every exercise or OP or whatever. You keep it and take care of it, and when you're posted out, you return it.<br><br>Some other units who dont need it as much use it ONLY for specific OPs. Like 4NTM (Alert Red) etc. So yes, theirs would be considered a controlled item, but only because they dont use it for every exercise, unlike others who have to, like I did. But controlled only because their storemen are tight-arses and wanna have more paper work but less items missing!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Sorry for folks in the rear with the gear like Oxford Mushroom, you will never get to fondle BA. And thank God for that too. I would rather the front-liners get better kit, than REMFs get a new toy they would get all excited about for ten minutes, then throw in the corner and never use.<br><br>And I think Gedanken has earned his lumps as a front-liner.

Like getting ur vehicles back in working order for u to use it.  SAF is not gonna be so cost ineffective by issueing every storeman, driver and mechanic with body armor.  Agreed, save those for the guys at the front.  Instead, give the mechanics better tools, and storemen better systems to work with.<br><br>In the end, every bugger in green is still a soldier.

And if I remembered correctly - the Brunei instructors were a little bit pissed with us (Regulars arguing with regulars).  Imagine - the battalion, moving with jungle hats only for jungle warfare. Helmets were strap to the SBO, until the actual attack (to satisfy the instructors). Our CO was really a great officer, went on to be the CCO right after.<br><br>The jungle hats were not issued officially - we paid for them, given a big discount for battalion level purchase. It was a long time ago, I suspect we may be the first, but not the last unit to do so, I think. This was done only in Brunei but the hats remain with us for unofficial use in the field for the rest of our NS (provided other people don't complain).<br><br>I still have the jungle hat somewhere in my house. </div></blockquote>Ha ha ha.. the instructors were probably pissed that someone else was wearing the jungle hats besides them.  But the if CO say of, I guess they didn't have much to say.<br><br>Well, I guess if your CO says ok and everyone bought theirs..  Still never heard of wearing jungle hat for movement until FUP then put on helmets. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  What happens if you are contacted or worse ambushed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But hey, spent much of army life in jungle hat and man, loved every minute of it.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
