You have to keep with the times, and body armour is constantly evolving.<br>Since its deployment in Afghanistan and Iraq, the US military has had at least a couple of generations worth of upgrades in issued body armour, each improving on both level of protection and weight than those before.<br>Outer soft body armour is now below 7lbs and large SAPI inserts are perhaps 8lb.<br>You can also get smaller hard plates that can cover your sides, so you get all round protection - ESAPI and better protection on front, level iiia on sides.<br>And dont forget that body armour is just that - it is not called bullet-proof armour for no reason - it helps protect against multiple hits and blunt trauma but no one has ever said it'll make you invulnerable on the battlefield.<br><br>If you look at what the modern soldier can purchase today in terms of gear, they can get plate carriers and modular systems that are much better than those issued, sometimes lighter, sometimes heavier, and all capable of differing types of plate carrying loadouts from just soft to all out combined hard and soft plates as mentioned before.<br>You also have the ability for quick release, so quick shedding of the plates and all armour is available should you require it [ie. if you happen to ditch in the water.]<br>Current US issue outer soft body armour shells [as of 1998 onwards manufacture and revised and upgraded in 2005] are supposed to stop multiple fragments and 9mm rounds, with hard plates you get additional protection from rifle rounds along with increased protection against blunt trauma - with the soft armour helping to cushion any blows to the hard armour [and any untoward backface deformation], adding another layer of protective comfort.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Shotgun:</div><div class="quote_body">Bullet proof vest useless?

The old flak vest system of the Vietnam war weighed at 25lbs.<br>Todays [standard] issue vest is 6.8lbs. The hard plates are an extra 8lb.<br>Throat, shoulder and groin protection is another 5lb.<br>Still alot less weight for alot more protection than ever before.<br>Your generation should count yourselves lucky that you have access to this level of comfortable protection [IF sg government buys into it of course..]<br><br>The problem is if you procure it all for your forces in one go. If you do that, and the time comes to get deployed - how long ago did your government buy that armour? And who from?<br>By the time you get issued it, it could be obselete and not worth much against modern projectile technology.<br>So only ordering when you know you are going to require it makes sense.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MobyDog:</div><div class="quote_body">No the ballistic test were done on soft/light body armour and not military grade Body armour. The Dragon Skin is most effective and will stop typical round.  </div></blockquote>Military issues both soft and hard type armour, at varying levels of protection.<br>Soft is for 9mm, blunt trauma [both in itself as well from any hits to hard plates] and fragmentation.<br>Hard is for 9mm, 7.62, blunt and fragmentation.<br><br>Dragon Skin type is the most effective at this time, protective even from M993 and M995 AP rounds, as well as being more flexible than combined hard and soft plated carriers.<br>It exceeded level iiia and iv level protection and afforded better back face deformation, which was always an issue with hard plates [and a big issue with the older PASGT style plates that were brittle and could cause injury because of this, even protecting you from the actual round]<br>Dragon skin was originally for protection on vehicles, seaborne and airborne equipment, upto 20mm calibre projectiles.<br>Dragon Skin type also has better breathability characteristics which means less overheating for the human body.<br>The drawback of the Dragon Skin type, as ever, is cost.<br><br>Still, with current issue protection against standard fielded ammunition [anything likely fielded by current opfor as experienced in the Middle East] is considered better protection than none at all.<br><br>Is it only the NSmen who complain of weight when training with BA?<br>is it because the BA is old and heavy, or is it because NSmen are considered too.. soft..?<br>I know everyone complains about BA but when they get deployed, they are happy to be with it, mission dependant of course.<br><br>Yes, amen to train as you mean to fight - many foreign forces adopt this approach, why not sg?<br></div>

However, in a scenario where we will be facing heavy firefight, such practise not only harass movement, it constitutes other minor problems which will affect a soldier's well-being in warfare.<br><br>Moreover, the protection given by such vests is nearly negligible, considering the weapons that the army are using. Yes, it protect the body but it has its limitations. We're all well aware that explosives, high-penetrating bullets (yes, rifles and machine-guns) are deployed in war and these armour does little but give a false sense of security and lumber down movement of all sort.<br><br>It's a good piece of equipment in peace-time, no doubts, but practising it in warfare is definitely not recommended and our dearest oxford mushroom is suggesting having that for war.

Artillery dpicm rounds will kill exposed infantry regardless of body armor. Covering an area of football field, u think u can run in time with or without body armor?<br><br>I don't see the logic in quite a lot of the arguements here.  If we are at war, and I have to be in a hostile environment, I'd take every bit of protection I can get to get OUT OF IT ALIVE.  I'm not gonna outrun a bullet without body armor. So I'd take body armor and make sure my movements are tactical and economised.<br><br>New generations of body armor, bullet proof vests HAVE shown that they are capable of stopping rounds out right.  Even if they dont stop rounds outright, anything less than a magnum/AP round is ain't gonna cost much tissue damage. Chances of getting wounded and surviving is at least higher.<br><br>The best light weight solution to  bullets now, is still non-existent.  Ever heard of an inertia dampening field?  Its still theoretical, but its gonna be as light as the unit can get.</div>

Same goes for soft armour.<br>If you are standing in one location and receiving multiple hits in exactly the same spot, it might be suggested that you were already deceased.<br>Given that youre more than likely to have moved out of the direct line of fire by the energy transfer from the first round that hit you, its unlikely you'd be in the same spot anyway.<br>To state this as a reason for not wearing BA is a little on the short side of common sense.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Nelstar:</div><div class="quote_body">I remembered an old saying regarding body armour when being issued with helmets.<br><br>"We are a mobile unit, not stationary targets."<br><br></div></blockquote>This may well be true of older generations of body armour - for example flak vests during the Vietnam War that were said to provide only the most basic of protection against low levels of fragmentations and weighed half as much as full loadout on its own.<br></div>
