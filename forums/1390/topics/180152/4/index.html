            <div class='col-md body'>Of course it has to be mission specific. But in today's climate, if we go to war, FIBUA and peace keeping looks almost certain. Does that not justify training combat soldiers in the use of BA? You do not need to wear it EVERYWHERE, but I think combat soldiers need at least some experience of operating whilst wearing BA.<br></div>

It probably just added too much weight, too much heat and restricted movement.<br><br>Perhaps if you are on a peacekeeping mission, patroling in an urban enviroment after you supposedly have control of the city, i.e. Iraq, Northen Ireland, etc or fighting from a fairly fixed position i.e. river boat patrol, then the BA is a great to have.<br><br>But since the majority of SAF training is still jungle geared...

Let's face it, everybody with half a brain puckers up when the rounds start flying, BA or not.
