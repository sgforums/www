            <div class='col-md body'>The chamber is just to expose you to some of the possible effects of chemical warfare. (Also let you know how bullshit movies are... tear gas come, everything also start flowing, how to continue shooting and rolling around man...)<br><br>It also allows you to test if you've worn your suit correctly, allows you to note where you're likely to oversee (once you feel the sting...)<br><br>Actually now they've got a Gas-Mask shooting programme at the rifle range and its being practiced for infantry guys as well. Funny thing i had perfect score at night but not in the day lol...<br><br>Engineers from various units out of the formation are also encouraged to attend the Chemical Defence Package training that SCE conducts, for these personnel to become kinda like the SME for their unit and to advise their Commanders subsequently on how to improve the know-how and effectiveness of the Chem-def gear they have.<br><br>Hope this is useful ^^</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh jumping jacks not tekan... is to make u go through full range of bodily movements and see if any leak occurs (from not wearing properly). If u want you can do push ups and sit ups  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Its true, don't wash your face immediately after you come out. Just air your face and body... let the tears and mucus flow. If you wipe or scratch, your skin's gonna get contaminated even more and its gonna really burn then. The sensation shouldn't last long in the air, especially if got a nice breeze going on.<br><br>Make sure you clean your equipment thoroughly after the chamber tho... any residue of that powder's gonna make u burn on contact again...<br><br>Cheerios~</div>
