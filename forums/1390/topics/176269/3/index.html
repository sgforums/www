            <div class='col-md body'>I used to be a platoon medic. Now the company I attached to now stepped down I return to HQ. The shiong part while being a platoon medic was going for exercises and standby. During exercises, platoon medic had to stick with the platoon sergent and walking behind the platoon. I had to carry the MOP and stretcher over my shoulder with SBO and rifle. The walking seem endless. Especially at oversea exercise like Crescendo. At Crescendo, I had to climb the Eagle Hill with the platoon. I strapped the MOP and stretcher securely to the man board and carried it like the fieldpack with SBO and rifle. You have to climb with both your hands and legs. The weight of combined MOP which has two fulled water bottles and stretcher tends to pull you back. Talking about standby. I have to carry the FBO, rifle , stretcher and MOP with 2 full water bottles. When the siren sounded, I have to run down from level 5 to the parade square.

Not all medics are slackers who sleep on stretchers and message their girlfriends while everyone else is sweating it out.<br><br>For every medic who doesn't give a shit about BMT recruits going for range, there are many other combat medics out there who rough it out and fight alongside the men out in the field.
