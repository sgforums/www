            <div class='col-md body'>the main obstacle to learning swiming is the fear of water.<br>I taught a couple of friends, including my son to swim by telling them to get into the pool, hold on to the edge of pool with both hands, squart down and submerge their head into the water.<br>Hold breath as long as possible. repeat it until they've no fear of getting head totally submerged in water.<br>After the that the swimming part becomes very easy... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I couldn't swim either before I enlisted. The monkey bars on the SOC course was also completely alien to me, come to think of it. Poor familial background, mah. Couldn't afford to play anything except with marbles when growing up ~lol~<br><br>But don't worry; it'll be like learning to walk. Also, keep in mind that it's very acceptable to be able to swim &amp; yet have a phobia of water, like the CDO guy who drowned recently. The training should be quite systematic in BMT (basically treading water, then mostly learning the breast-stroke technique.) Dunno how tight the timetable is nowadays, but in my time we non-swimmers had to attend extra night classes &amp; also burn a long weekend or two. But there's a plus side, in that you can usually watch your fellow swimmer recruits kena tekan banyak on the pool deck (circuit trainings)!<br><br>But, at some point, you'll be ordered to jump into the deep pool &amp; swim the requisite length (whatisit, 50m?). It'll really be a personal test of will on your part then. Just focus on your strokes &amp; resist all temptation to panic. They'll probably let you swim next to the pool edge, to gain initial confidence. The journey of a thousand miles begin with one single step, etc.<br><br>You know, I almost drowned in BMT too. Some stupid PTI was angry at somebody else &amp;, next thing I knew, kicked the next detail man (me) into the deep pool. Of course, I went down like a rock ;-( But I also learnt from that incident, in remembering the underwater sensations &amp; keeping faith with my rescuer once he got a hold on me.<br><br>Frankly, most of us managed to swim one complete length .... in the test itself. Thus we passed. I never swam again the rest of NS, always quietly volunteering to do guard duty or something whenever I saw the training programme. My unit treated it as a "fun" PT activity BTW, with minimum tekan except I didn't fancy swimming in No.4s or trying the front-crawl stroke (something I still can't do today). But breast-stroke, definitely no problem anymore, even though the water phobia is still there.<br><br>I just realised I couldn't spell b-r-e-a-s-t stroke here ~lol~</div>
