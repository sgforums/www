            <div class='col-md body'>i from infantry unit last time<br><br>1.yeap, you cant go home unless there's public holiday. even for night-offs u normally need to book-in by 2359 or eariler.<br><br>2.depends on how u define siong.Unit training is definitely not as demanding as in training school likes sispec/ocs. But the no. of field camp is numerous until u become numb. When there's no outfield, most of the training would be some PT or running. Dring my time, 12-3pm  normally nap time.<br><br>3 most are downgrade personals back in my camp. a lot depends on the csm whether they want to put u into rp or not. for mp not so sure.<br></div>
