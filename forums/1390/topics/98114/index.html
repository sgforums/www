Similarly, the Logistics arm of the Army seamlessly delivers material as needed to sustain the ArmyÂ’s effort, harnessing state-of-the-art technology in this area. The timely delivery of Integrated Logistics Support, to the forces in the battle field, across land, sea and air, will be a key to the success of the ArmyÂ’s mission.<br><br>Army Logistics will allow the Army to transit from peacetime to war footing seamlessly and in the shortest possible time. Through greater assets visibility, they can deliver the right material that is critically needed by the combat forces at the right time and right place. Army Logistics will be able to optimise all available delivery systems to deliver the 'punch' Â– The Combat Multiplier effect.<br><br>The Army Logistics is made up of <strong>HQ Supply &amp; Transport (HQ S&amp;T)</strong> and <strong>HQ Maintenance and Engineering Support (HQ MES).</strong><br><br><strong>HQ Supply &amp; Transport</strong><br><br>The primary role of HQ S&amp;T is to plan, command and provide the Supply and Transport support to the Army during peacetime, transition to war and during wartime. HQ S&amp;T is to act as Senior Specialist Staff Officer (SSSO) HQ as well as Vocational Advisory Authority (VAA) for Supply &amp; Transport Vocationalists in the Army.<br><br><strong>HQ Maintenance and Engineering Support</strong><br><br>The primary role of the Maintenance and Engineering Support Formation is to monitor and control the available maintenance resources within the Army and facilitate optimal utilisation of these resources on the maintenance of all vehicles, weapons and electronics systems in the Army. It also ensures that equipment are repaired as quickly as possible with the available maintenance resources and achieves this through establishing the appropriate maintenance policies and by constantly applying information technology (IT) and system engineering.[/img]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>THE HISTORY OF ARMY LOGISTICS</strong><br><br>A reorganisation of the Logistics formations was carried out in 1994, resulting in the closing down of HQ Army Logistics Command (ALCOM) and the formation of the HQ Supply &amp; Transport (HQ S&amp;T) and HQ Maintenance and Engineering Support (HQ MES).<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>History of HQ Maintenance and Engineering Support (HQ MES)</strong></span><br><br>HQ MES was first formed in Sep 1984 as HQ Maintenance. In Mar 1994, HQ MES was officially inaugurated as a SSSO for maintenance and engineering matters in the army. Units under MES are 3, 6, 9 Direct Support Maintenance Battalions (DSMB) and Ordnance Engineering Training Institute (OETI). HQ MES actively looks into harnessing IT to enhance her responsiveness and effectiveness. It is the first army formation to attain the prestigious ISO 9002 award in 1995, therefore it is committed to provide quality service to her customers.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>History of HQ Supply &amp; Transport (HQ S&amp;T)</strong></span><br><br>Before 1990, 4 logistic formations, namely: Supply, Transport, Maintenance and GS Command, were under the command &amp; control of G4-Army. In the year 1990, the Supply formation and the Transport formation were integrated to become the Supply &amp; Transport Formation and came under the command and control of HQ ALCOM. A reorganisation of the logistics formation was carried out in 1994 where HQ ALCOM was declared defunct while HQ Supply &amp; Transport (S&amp;T) and HQ Maintenance &amp; Engineering Support (MES) were formed to come under the command of G4-Army.</div>

Hungry, tired, unbathed and still full of camo and dirt, we are still need to queue long long for the food. Those lobos are still choosing their food and making stupid jokes with the cooks.

Hungry, tired, unbathed and still full of camo and dirt, we are still need to queue long long for the food. Those lobos are still choosing their food and making stupid jokes with the cooks. A man from my platoon shouted "Nabei cheebye, chao ahguas can hurry up or not!!!" The lobos and HQ guys all immediately moved one side and we all got to eat.<br><br>Even the BOS and COS presently also smile smile..<br><br>But anyway after i gotten in reservist and have more responsibilites as PS, i started to realize the values of logisitics ppl more and more.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div></blockquote>There's always black sheep in every force.I downgraded from combat, so I know how it feels.</div>
