              <p>Hi guys, I'm new to this forum so pardon me if I say anything I shouldn't say or something like that you guys get the point.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I'm a Temp Pes E ASA, PES has expired, but I'm still an ASA pending medical review.</p>
              <p>I used to take lotsa MCs and MAs (Stuff like that) and apparently my boss a first warrant isn't happy with me.</p>
              <p>He had a nice talk with me during an interview two months ago and I've decided to stop taking MCs and MAs from den... so its been like a few months since I last got any MCs and I've been trying to behave as best as i could. </p>
              <p>Today, there was an event outside camp, I'm a rider. But yesterday my Sir told me not to ride to camp. He told me that there is a bus service provided and asked me to take that bus. However, I checked with my colleagues and I found out that the bus service was for trainees and not perm staffs. Perm staffs are required to make their way down by themselves, so i rode to the destination myself.</p>
              <p>(one more thing) so i was in the office yesterday and my Ma'am (CPT) walked in. I heard about the event out of camp but apparently some of the ASAs had to stay back in the office so I decided to ask if I was required to stay back as well. So when my Ma'am walked in I decided to clarify and so I asked her something like "Ma'am, I have to be there tml as well right?" blah blah blah fast forward to the morning of the out-of-camp event.</p>
              <p>My sir saw me, and immediately gave me a scolding, not wanting to hear any of my reasons and accusing me of not following instructions, even threatened me that i would be put in DB. He told me that there were clear instructions not to ride my bike there and take the bus. But the thing is, I didn't know if I was allowed to board the trainee bus at all and I preferred riding there because then I dont have to travel all the way back to camp and then go home from there. So what I did was to check with the rest of the ASAs (all travelling there themselves) and head there myself.</p>
              <p>Other than riding there myself, he scolded me for asking my Ma'am that one simple question (if i needed to be there) and asked me why I didn't go to him. </p>
              <p>Fact was, At the point I was wondering if I needed to be there there was no one in the office and at that moment coincidentally my ma'am walked in. So i just asked her, I mean, is there something seriously wrong to make sure so as to not make any mistakes? </p>
              <p>I'm sorry guys, for the longggggggg thread. I'm pissed off but haven't talked back or anything like that to my superiors, I'm just unhappy that he seems to pick on every small little matter, making it into a big fuss. </p>
              <p>What should I do? I called my parents to sort of whine after gettin the scolding, and they are ready to talk to my superiors or do anything to help me.</p>
              <p>But i need ur experiences and advices guys. I'm not sure if complaining is the right thing to do. Can anyone maybe drop me an advice or something? </p>
              <p>Anyway, really appreciate your time and effort in replying. thanks guys. </p>

              <p>and because i asked my cpt a question without asking him first. </p>

              <p>Most ocifers and enciks when got event outside camp, as long as 
              he/she see ur face there, happy liao, they couldn't be bother if you go 
              there by car, taxi, bike, walk, fly there, etc. If for some reasons, ur 
              encik and ocifer tell u not to go there by own transport then u listen 
              to them lah.</p>
              <p>The point is, u check, u know bus is for trainees, u 
              not sure u can take or not. Instead of going back to confirm this and 
              get permission to ride down, u rode down anyway....huh? Dude, like this 
              how to cover ur backside? No case to argue anymore, ur encik can always 
              shoot back "Why didn't u check with me first?", u LPPL one.</p>
              <p>Besides,
               this kind of thing, happen liao just face it lor, next time be a bit 
              smarter. As an ASA, u will face alot more unnecessary office politics 
              compare to other vocations and each unit is different, understand the

              <p>true.. for bmt at least. but when posted to unit after completing vocational/school training post-bmt, there's more stuff needed to help in survival. for instance, know which ppl working on the same ground as u [not exactly your enick or officer] can be trustable and friend and know how to fight for your rights, ESP when unreasonable bias is detected.</p>
              <p>while it is impt to be obidient, do not always be a sucker to rules. understand why certain things/systems are there in the 1st place and from there work out solutions that suit everyone around the place if there is smth that any1 feels is unreasonable. but for the simple matter listed above by TS, he should just follow it 1st and if got any doubt along the way b4 the event day, get back to his encik.</p>

              <p><br>During my time, it is really a waste of time.</p>
              <p>Learn what? Keng, act blur, look here and there, smoke, what else?</p>
              <p>One thing I learn: discipline and mature.</p>
              <p>Other than that, NOTHING. Wasting my yrs.</p>
              <p>I wonder now, is it still the same practices? If so, I strongly suggest the ns reducing to 12 - 15mths. Dont waste the boys time.</p>
