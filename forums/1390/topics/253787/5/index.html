            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.imghype.com/data/154a9f6dcdsalute.bmp"><br><br>Request is for Fan's NS-bound younger brother<br><br>Lee U-Wen<br>u-wen@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>Before 21-year-old polytechnic student Fan Yao Ren enlists for National Service (NS) next year, his family plans to make a special request to the Ministry of Defence. Their plea: Don't send him on any overseas missions.<br>.<br>The Fan family does not want to risk losing another son. His older brother, Private Fan Yao Jin, 24, was one of two Singaporean soldiers killed when a fighter jet crashed into a Taiwan military base on Friday.<br>.<br>At the wake at Toa Payoh East Road yesterday, the private's eldest brother Yao Zhong, a 25-year-old regular with the Singapore Navy, said: "My parents and I would prefer (Yao Ren) to remain in Singapore and not fly during NS. We've mentioned it in passing, and Mindef has said they will look into it closer to the date."<br>.<br>Asked how his parents were coping, he replied: "I think we can only use one word: Devastated."<br>.<br>About 80 people paid their respects to Private Fan, whose body arrived home yesterday at 8.30pm. Former classmate Daphne Seah told Today she was still in "a state of shock". Recalling their last conversation on his birthday last Wednesday, she said: "I told him, 'I haven't seen you in over a year', and we made plans to go out when he came back. Now, we'll never get the chance to meet up."<br>.<br>Meanwhile, the two badly-burnt Singaporean soldiers Â— Lance-Corporal Calvin Chow and 3rd-Sergeant Ramakrishnan Karthigayan Â— have undergone several operations at Singapore General Hospital's Burns Unit.<br>.<br>Lance-Corporal Chow remains in critical condition with 50-per-cent burns and respiratory burns, while 3rd-Sergeant Karthigayan's condition is serious but stable.<br>.<br>Blamed on ageing jets, the accident injured seven other Singaporean soldiers and killed the two Taiwanese pilots.<br>.<br>According to Taiwanese newspaper United Daily News, aircraft pilot Wei Tze-yuan was last heard shouting "Up!" before the accident occurred.<br>.<br>As the aircraft lacked a black box, investigators looked for clues in accident debris, evidence and conversation with the control tower. However, from the pilot's single word to the ground, nothing more could not be deduced. A military source told the Taiwanese newspaper that, due to security reasons, the use of wireless communications is minimised in such air force activities.<br>.<br>Like 3rd-Sergeant Isz Sazli Sapari, the other SAF serviceman killed in the accident and buried on Saturday, Private Fan will be accorded a full military funeral. He will be buried at Bright Hill Crematorium tomorrow.</div>
