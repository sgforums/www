              <p>SINGAPORE - Declining birth rates and its impact on Singapore's 
              population represents a "big challenge" facing the Singapore Armed 
              Forces (SAF) over the next decade, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen.<br><br> From 2016, enlistment rates for full-time National Service (NS) 
              will begin to fall. And in 2025, NSF enlistment is expected to dip by 25
               per cent, from about 26,000 last year to about 19,500 in 2025, said Dr 
              Ng during an interview to mark SAF Day which falls on July 1.<br><br> The SAF, however, has been preparing for the impending drop in 
              enlistees by modernising itself to be able to "do the same, if not more,
               with the same number of people".<br><br> Dr Ng cites the army's 
              High Mobility Artillery Rocket System - manned by three people, instead 
              of 12 previously for the older howitzers - and the air force's Heron-1 
              unmanned aerial vehicle as examples of how SAF harnesses technology to 
              overcome the demographic challenge.<br><br> "Moving forward, we 
              have to continue to find ways and we are looking for ways to optimise 
              the contribution of each national serviceman," said Dr Ng. "It is not 
              only in terms of the skills and capabilities for which we have to 
              enhance our systems to be able to train them, it is also about the way 
              the SAF functions."<br><br> An integral part of the transformation 
              to a third-generation SAF was the move towards "flatter" command 
              structures, he added.<br><br> When asked if NS durations would be 
              relooked given falling enlistment numbers, Dr Ng ruled out such a move. 
              The reduction of full-time NS from two and a half to two years in 2004 
              had factored the drop in enlistment numbers and projected "very far 
              forward", he said.<br><br> Dr Ng also ruled out expanding the SAF's
               standing size force of 300,000, noting that "the size of the regular 
              army now is capable and able to fulfil our missions".<br><br> Steady defence spending which "removes the vicissitudes of cycles" will also continue, he added.<br><br> <br><br> COMMITMENT TO DEFENCE "REASSURING", DR NG SAYS <br><br> <br><br> As to whether the perception of the SAF will change with the 
              projected decline in enlistments, Dr Ng said SAF has now established 
              "ourselves as a modernised, capable military". "I think that impression 
              will continue to be maintained with our defence spending and our ability
               to get more from our national servicemen and the SAF," he added.<br><br> One way would be to leverage on more educated servicemen entering 
              SAF. Another would be to tap on to Singaporeans' commitment to defence.<br><br> As the 45th anniversary of NS is commemorated this year, the 
              Defence Minister pointed to periodic surveys which showed more than 90 
              per cent of respondents - comprising full-time national servicemen, 
              civilian soliders and the public -consistently affirm that NS is 
              necessary, that Singapore is where they belong and they would defend 
              Singapore should it come under threat.<br><br> One civilian soldier
               who is on the voluntary extended reserve scheme, Major (NS) Jimmy Ng, 
              said that despite NS taking time away from his job and family, he 
              believes in serving national service "for passion" and "enjoyment", and 
              "not for fame or honour or anything else". Mr Ng will transit into the 
              Volunteers Scheme when he turns 50 next year.<br><br> The Defence 
              Minister said, "I do not think there had been a reduction in the will to
               defend this place. I think people recognise that there is more to 
              defend but at the same time we also recognise that there are also added 
              demands of work and family, and we are also trying to help our NSmen do 
              things more efficiently so that they can meet these demands."</p>
