            <div class='col-md body'>Me not sure what Taurus coy now, but during my time, me had my fair share of spooks also. Me was from BMTC 3 Jaguar Coy Pl 33 Sect 1 Bed 10. It's the old bunk where 33 recruits slept together on double-decked beds. Mine was on the upper deck. During the initial weeks of my BMT, every morning my buddy would KBKB saying that me always rocked the bed while sleeping. Remembered that our training was very shiong till the fact that we would drop dead sleeping upon reaching back the bunk, plus 300m ATP we needed to do for our range. And this rocking bed issue went on for four weeks, and my buddy had enough, he kicked my mattress off the bed and guessed what we found. We found a talisman pasted on the plywood on the bed. The talisman wasn't like those which triangularly folded but like those used in Chinese Vampire movies. Curious, we asked our Pl Sgt about the talisman and he told us that in our earlier batch of trainees, the previous recruit who slept on our bed had passed away during a IPPT test and even since, there were people who saw the spirit on the recruit rocking the bed as he would have done before he passed away. Instantly, both our hair stood with shock and fear.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another spooky tale that happened in Tekong during my BMT was that at the parade square of BMTC 3, on every 1st Thursday night every month, there will always be fog surfacing on the parade square for no reason. There was once me and my bunk mates were studying for our first aid test for the next day on the balcony, it was just past midnight and suddenly we heard distinctive footsteps coming from across the parade square and soon the fog appeared. We thought it was from our Pl Sgt coming to spot check but the footsteps sounded very distantly. We looked up and we saw very vague and shadowy figures in the fog. We stayed and looked for quite a while. The footsteps became louder and louder and it wasn't the Malay commands that we were trained on, it was British! As we looked at the figures, we became frightened as more and more clearly we could see the British WW2 helmets, khaki uniforms. For about 15 minutes or so, we looked shocked and bewildered as the fog slowly disappeared and the figures went away with the fog, with the distinctive footsteps getting fainter and fainter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>During my fieldcamp in BMT, we were topoing through a rubber plantation with rubber trees neatly grew in straight rows in spacing of 5m apart. My sect leader who was following us in the excercise was very garang type who liked to cheong. When we reached the plantation, he began to fall backwards and soon he was behind the platoon. Suddenly, me heard a very familiar sound, the corking of rifle! Me turned back and saw my sect leader pointed up his rifle and his face was visibly pale under the moonlight. We quickly took prone positions as we thought to be an ambush by our Pl Sgt to test our reflexes. But my sect leader didn't, he still held his rifle up pointing at one of the rubber trees which was about 30m away. Me looked up and spotted that there stood a shadow with red eyes looking at us! The vision of that shadow struck fear in me! Suddenly that shadow flew and started jumping from tree to tree. At this instance, my sect leader shouted "Run! Run back to camp!" We quickly picked ourselves up from the ground and started running as fast as we could back to camp. Along the way, me could hear a very sinister laughter. Once reached back camp, we did a roll call and all accounted for. My sect leader talked to Pl Sgt on what happened in the plantation and Pl Sgt gave us early timeout.</div>

My sect leader who was following us in the excercise was very garang type who liked to cheong. When we reached the plantation, he began to fall backwards and soon he was behind the platoon. Suddenly, me heard a very familiar sound, the corking of rifle! Me turned back and saw my sect leader pointed up his rifle and his face was visibly pale under the moonlight. We quickly took prone positions as we thought to be an ambush by our Pl Sgt to test our reflexes. But my sect leader didn't, he still held his rifle up pointing at one of the rubber trees which was about 30m away. Me looked up and spotted that there stood a shadow with red eyes looking at us! The vision of that shadow struck fear in me! Suddenly that shadow flew and started jumping from tree to tree. At this instance, my sect leader shouted "Run! Run back to camp!" We quickly picked ourselves up from the ground and started running as fast as we could back to camp. Along the way, me could hear a very sinister laughter. Once reached back camp, we did a roll call and all accounted for. My sect leader talked to Pl Sgt on what happened in the plantation and Pl Sgt gave us early timeout.</div></blockquote>confirmed. my commando friend encountered it before back in 99'</div>
