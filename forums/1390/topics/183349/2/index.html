My sect leader who was following us in the excercise was very garang type who liked to cheong. When we reached the plantation, he began to fall backwards and soon he was behind the platoon. Suddenly, me heard a very familiar sound, the corking of rifle! Me turned back and saw my sect leader pointed up his rifle and his face was visibly pale under the moonlight. We quickly took prone positions as we thought to be an ambush by our Pl Sgt to test our reflexes. But my sect leader didn't, he still held his rifle up pointing at one of the rubber trees which was about 30m away. Me looked up and spotted that there stood a shadow with red eyes looking at us! The vision of that shadow struck fear in me! Suddenly that shadow flew and started jumping from tree to tree. At this instance, my sect leader shouted "Run! Run back to camp!" We quickly picked ourselves up from the ground and started running as fast as we could back to camp. Along the way, me could hear a very sinister laughter. Once reached back camp, we did a roll call and all accounted for. My sect leader talked to Pl Sgt on what happened in the plantation and Pl Sgt gave us early timeout.</div></blockquote>ah... field camp at the rubber plantation...

            <div class='col-md body'>From media corp: Author unknown<br><br>Story 1<br><br>This is a true story...<br>One of my reservist buddies pass this mail to me. The author is unhappy<br>that the Mediacorp version, shown last week on TV, was inaccurate (as far<br>as he is concerned). I`ve heard my own version of course. Dunno which one<br>is true. But for sure, I can vouch the incident really happened.<br><br>My Story: It is a well-known fact that Pulau Tekong has a number of ghosts.<br>Some of you readers may have read or heard about the ghost at Charlie<br>Company at the old basic military camp I. Unfortunately, some versions<br>that I read or heard have been distorted over the years.<br><br>Here, I hope to set the record straight. Instructors and trainees of<br>Charlie Company, Infantry Training Depot during the March-June 1983 period<br>can vouch for my version of the story. It is NOT my intention to revive<br>hurtful memories especially for the bereaved family or to blame anyone, but<br>purely to narrate facts as they had happened.<br><br>The starting point of this true story should be the 16 Km route march about<br>18 years ago. Before the march, the Officer Commanding of the company<br>asked the trainees whether anyone was sick or not feeling well. No one put<br>up his hand. But there was a trainee among the company, Recruit Tham W.K.,<br>who was down with flu but did not put up his hand.<br><br>Then the route march started. The platoons took turns to lead the company<br>after each break during the route march. Sometimes, the pace of the march<br>became too hot for some trainees, who could not keep pace and had to fall<br>out. They became stragglers and had to be picked up by a few instructors<br>walking at the rear of the company. The landrover with the medical orderly<br>was also supposed to be at the rear.<br><br>Somehow, Tham fell out and managed to slip out of view by taking cover in<br>the forest. He was not to be seen alive again.<br><br>During subsequent rest breaks, there were head-counts. He was presumed to<br>be with the medical orderly. It was only in the evening after the route<br>march, when the the rifles were due to be returned to the armoury, that<br>they realised Tham was missing. They went to the medical centre but he was<br>not there. The instructors feared the worst. Overnight, they organised a<br>night-search party for him, re-tracing the 16-Km route taken earlier in the<br>day. They could not find him.<br><br>The next day, the entire Camp I ceased training and batches of instructors<br>and trainees were dispatched to find Tham. It was only about 5 p.m. that<br>his own platoon commander (PC) found his corpse. Near a forest track<br>junction, the PC noticed a half-pictched tent. He called out but there was<br>no response. As he neared the tent, he noticed many flies buzzing around<br>and detected a foul stench. There lay before him his dead trainee, lying<br>with one hand holding his rifle and the other hand outstretched with a<br>water bottle, with its cover opened. The PC broke down in tears and wept<br>openly.<br><br>A subsequent post-mortem showed that Tham had apparently died of stomach<br>rupture. When his body system was still hot from the heat of the route<br>march, against the advice of instructors, he had apparently gulped down<br>massive amounts of water suddenly. It was like pouring ice cubes into a<br>thin glass of hot water, which can cause the glass to crack. But the post<br>mortem also found puncture marks on his body, which could not be<br>satisfactorily explained to this day.)<br><br>It was left to the Company Sergeant Major and his landrover driver to<br>drive the corpse back to camp for transfer to the mortuary. It was twilight<br>at that time. Inexplicably, the engine could not start. The thought of the<br>two of them spending the night with the corpse unnerved them. But<br>eventually, they somehow had the engine started and returned safely to<br>base.<br><br>The late Tham was promoted to NCO and cremated at Mount Vernon with full<br>military honours. As the company trainees lined the road snaking up to the<br>crematorium to salute our late comrade, it was a heart-breaking sight to<br>see a distraught mother being supported by two daughters following the<br>hearse.<br><br>A few instructors returned to the site where he departed from this world,<br>to offer incense and prayers. One instructor asked the late Tham not to<br>come back and haunt us, but rather to express his last wishes in a dream so<br>that his soul could rest in peace after his wishes were fulfilled.<br><br>But Tham did not listen.<br><br>Incident 1: One of the instructors came to the Platoon 9 bunk to remove his<br>personal effects. When he opened up his metal cupboard, there was a foul<br>stench from inside that could not be explained.<br><br>Incident 2: In the dead of the night, some trainees of Charlie Company<br>heard Tham`s voice shouting for the platoon or company to fall in at the<br>common company compound.<br><br>Incident 3 (more scary): One of the platoon 9 section mates woke up in the<br>middle of the night and saw the white figure of Tham`s ghost standing in<br>front of his former cupboard ! He bolted to the next double-decker bed,<br>grabbed to share his blanket and said "ghost!" The next morning, the<br>platoon mates could see two trainees pale and ashened by the encounter.<br><br>Incident 4: During one of the subsequent route marches (by Golf Company),<br>the company noticed a figure of a soldier in full battle order standing in<br>the distance among some trees. The OC (a former Commando Captain) dashed<br>forward to take a closer look. He quickly ordered the whole company to<br>double past without slowing down to see what he saw. Subsequent route<br>marches were diverted to avoid that area of sighting.<br><br>It`s been a long time since I last set foot on Pulau Tekong in June 1983.<br>But I heard that the bunk in which the late Tham used was converted into a<br>lecture room and subsequently into a store room. The room was installed<br>with padlocked doors for obvious reasons.<br><br>Over the years, generations of trainees who became instructors passed down<br>their version of Tham`s story by word of mouth, which unfortunately got<br>distorted in the process.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Story 2</span><br><br></div>
