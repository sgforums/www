Mp after basic course is a very "xing jiao-lao jiao" environ, so beware. Anyway my batch get a slip of paper each to choose 1st chice,  2nd choice, 3rd choice of sub-unit to go to. Den all ur commanders will sit down, look at ur picture in the orbat chart and discuss where u shld go. But I heard subsequent batches of MP dont get to choose anymore. So depends on manpower requirement of various sub-unit. And wat I know just b4 i ord is APC nid ppl, so many of u will go there.<br><br>ya and I was frm gombak, u get to see all the big F of the SAF there. but gets very boring after a while. u get to learn how to serve the sometimes demanding staffs of mindef, as u man the MPcounters.

Respect and greet all seniors if you want a good time.<br><br>You will learn MP wartime and peacetime roles and operations like body search and escorting, building PW cage and firing GPMG.... You will need to master your Military Law ( SAF ACT, CAP. 295 ).<br><br>Basically after you pass out, you will be posted to the different coys.<br><br>Some coys will need to work in mount dismount support styles, so forget your weekends.<br><br>The best coys around will be ZPC and DB.<br>ZPC is the most interesting and exciting coy as they went out for Ops and raids.<br><br>DB is the best place where you learn good interpersonal skills and there are many friendly MPs there! They organise a Happy Hour session every month!!<br><br>Enjoy your stay in MP Command... Its the best formation around... they organise runs every week to maintain your fitness level.
