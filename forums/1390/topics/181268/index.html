            <div class='col-md body'>This incident happened to my friend. He was doing guard duty at Tekong with another guy and it was pretty late, close to 3am. Then, they saw a speed boat approaching towards Tekong island and slowing down (some rich, curious buggers).

His buddy then corked his rifle (with an empty magazine) and pretended to aim. My friend then began counting down, "5, 4, 3..". The speed boat sped off immediately.

Because whatever threat the rider is posing to you or to the camp will already have passed by the time you aim and fire. To fire at them then would be revenge rather than self-denfence and would, I think, breach the ROE. That is assuming, of course, that the bugger has not turned around and made another pass.</div>
