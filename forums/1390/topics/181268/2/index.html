            <div class='col-md body'>You must fully understand your ROE card before firing any shots. ROE card is to protect you not confusing you. I know some rules stated in ROE card is confusing. Like the situation that thread starter stated just now. What happen if the "handgun" is real? ROE card says that "You may use lethal force if you or your buddy or your camp is under hostile threat." In the situation mention above, pointing a handgun towards your direction is a already a "hostile act". You felt threaten, you felt your live is in danger, you may shoot.<br><br>But please take note above the threat level. I believe ROE card also states that "Use ENOUGH force to stop the threat." Lets say a guy is holding a parang charging at you from 50 meters away. You are threaten but NOT live endangering although "hostile act" has taken place because he is still 50 meters away. You may fire at his legs or choose to use you CCT which your have been taught. But pointing a handgun at you from 100 meters is a totally different case. Thats why you must act accordingly to the ROE card.<br><br>Also take note about "hostile act" and "hostile intend". A guy holding a parang strolling around aimlessly is a "hostile intend" because he hasn't take any action against you or your buddy or the place you are required to protect. In this situation you should comms back to your higher HQ at the same time gives a proper warning. Point your weapon (DON'T CORK) and challenge him by shouting "STOP" if he stops, ask him to put down his parang, move 10 steps to either left or right and prone down. If the suspect didn't stop challenge him again and if he fails to comply, you MUST give a final warning which is "STOP OR I'LL SHOOT" at the same time cork your weapon. If he fails to comply and RUN away, YOU DON'T SHOOT. Running away means that the threat is gone.<br><br>If suspect is pointing a handgun, there isn't a need to give a warning because the situation doesn't allow you to do so.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I remember at one camp I was at, the rifles used for guard duty, the magazine catch was set in such a way that it would not, well, catch any magazine. That is, if you tried to load a magazine, the magazine would just drop out. Imagine if something really happened. The guard had to remember to push the catch back into position to load a magazine. That's an example of "wayang" guard duty.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The 5 rounds are just for a very very rare instance. But still, if things happen, proper ROE should be followed. Also, the ROE is simply a guide, and its the sentry/guard on duty has to interpret the rules. Even if a guy comes by with a gun and points it at you without shooting, you may fire a warning shot and if he persists, fire at him.<br><br>But curious about the warning shot issue, my Air Force RP friend told me that if confronted, they will have to fire off one round 1st as warning before engaging the target. If the Investigative unit finds that only one round has been fired, the sentry/guard would be in for trouble. But was wondering, if the sentry/guard fires at the intruder first, and then fires a second shot, how would that count?</div>
