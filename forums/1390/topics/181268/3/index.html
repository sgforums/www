But without proper witnesses (those present are month old recruits), I am scared during inquiry there is just lack of evidence to back me up.<br><br>So i decided (at this point of time, motocycle far far away liao), that no action to be taken. But it is this incident, where even as a guard comd, i don't think my words will ever be taken seriously if i were to fire those shots and justify my actions.<br><br>Anyway, i am very confident that those 5 shots will miss.<br><br>So you guys, what would you have done? Shoot or don't shoot?<br><br>Or you see one person down already then confirm shoot back?</div></blockquote>How about giving verbal warning first, then maybe fire at the sky? before you even think of firing at his non-critical limbs etc.<br><br>If not enough time, you can always fire at the sky first. Anyway, you can let him fire first, ofcuz ask everyone to stay and dodge in the guard room/house.

But still, if things happen, proper ROE should be followed. Also, the ROE is simply a guide, and its the sentry/guard on duty has to interpret the rules. Even if a guy comes by with a gun and points it at you without shooting, you may fire a warning shot and if he persists, fire at him.<br><br>But curious about the warning shot issue, my Air Force RP friend told me that if confronted, they will have to fire off one round 1st as warning before engaging the target. If the Investigative unit finds that only one round has been fired, the sentry/guard would be in for trouble. But was wondering, if the sentry/guard fires at the intruder first, and then fires a second shot, how would that count?</div></blockquote>Think your Air Force RP told you the wrong thing. That rule only apply to certain situation.<br><br>Yes there is situation which 1 shot will be fire off as warning first, like if a group of people trying to use force to break through the gate.<br><br>But if someone put a gun (the act itself is hostile), the procedure is to take cover and ready to engage.  Warning shot will just instantly create a shoot out, sometime it is better if everyone is already undercover and ready to engage to issue verbal warning for him to put the gun down.<br><br>But the moment he is about to point the gun to anyone, you shoot, don't even want to be wasting a warning shot, you will need every single rounds, if the target is armed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dork3d:</div><div class="quote_body">Me had one near-firing situational encounter before when me was serving my fulltime service. It happened in a NS Camp in Clementi area in 1996. Me remembered that me was the only rifle-trained guard on duty that day and the rest of the guards were on truncheon-and-shield. There was an armed fight within the camp between a SSG and 3SG as the SSG used a 20cm blade knife to attack the 3SG.<br><br>DO called up Guardroom and activated Guard Cmdr for Riot Turnout. Me so sway, been the only rifle-trained guard to draw 5 rounds and load into rifle (but never cocked yet) and ran all the way to the Specialist's Mess while trying to fix my bayonet to the muzzle.<br><br>On arrival, me saw the 3SG on the ground and the SSG with the weapon in his hand. DO instructed Guard Cmdr to execute, shouting at the SSG to drop his weapon, or else he will be shot. The SSG didn't heed the warning and charged towards my Guard Cmdr. Immediately, DO shouted: "On guard! Shoot at limbs!" Me stunned for a while and quickly cocked my weapon and "Bang!". One shot out and my shot hit the SSG's thigh, but he still charged towards my Guard Cmdr. DO shouted again: "Shoot at body!". Another shot was fired and the SSG dropped onto the ground. "Guard! Move forward and secure!" DO said.<br><br>Me moved forward and kicked the weapon away. The SSG was moaning in pain as my shot hit his right shoulder. When me looked back, me saw my Guard Cmdr was still in shock, maybe due to the sudden turn of event.<br><br>2 rounds out of 5 were enough to earn two months of regular visits (almost became a daily event for me) to SAFPU and MINDEF Gombak for statements and investigations!</div></blockquote>Sorry but I don't know if your story is believable or not. It is because there are a few things which needed to be clarify. Firstly, what happen to the other guards carrying the truncheon and wickershield? There are different levels of force which should be used accordingly to the degree of threat in the situation. Using firepower is the last and extreme level of force, and I strongly believe the other guards with the truncheon and wickershield should be enough show of force to overpower ONE guy with only A KNIFE. Secondly, its logical that unless the DO is a very high ranking and very experienced officer, he is definitely unable to issue such exact accurate orders calmly under such intense pressure. It would probably be something like, " Oi, block the guy! whack him and pin him down!" Yes, guards on duty always have to undergo riot drills everytime the are on guard duty but under such immmediate pressure, everything can forget. Its true. Also, I would not think one would have time to cock the rifle, unless the guy is far away. Lastly, I strongly believe if you really shoot the guy, your first shot would have immobilise him as M16 is a very powerful weapon and if I'm not wrong, the shot that hit his thigh would have rip his thigh apart and he would not be able to move anymore. Correct me If I'm wrong. Also, I went for provost course and I have never heard of the people at provost citing such a real life example of ROE before. Sorry, just doubtful about some information you were saying thats all.</div>

It is up to the court to decide. And the court has ruled many times in the past on self-defence. IE you can use necc, reasonable and proportional force to react to a danger to life, limb and property.<br><br>And the threat need not be real. The issue is whether you honestly believed that there was a threat and that it was neccessary for you to react in the way you did.<br><br>Now, putting aside the law for a moment, and looking at the issue from a commonsene angle. Is it logical and commonsense that a soldier on guard cannot engage someone outside of camp? The answer is clearly, no. What if the person has an RPG and is taking aim outside the camp? By your version of ROE, no one can engage him and all we can do is take cover.<br><br></div>

And he is talking about 1990s, duty briefings were taken more seriously than nowadays. Just the right DO and the right day. just speculating for this though.<br><br><blockquote> Lastly, I strongly believe if you really shoot the guy, your first shot would have immobilise him as M16 is a very powerful weapon and if I'm not wrong, the shot that hit his thigh would have rip his thigh apart and he would not be able to move anymore.

We are using a FMJ, at short distances, the bullet will just penetrate, though i think it is dangerous to shoot a 5.56 indoors.<br><br>Anyway, i am just commenting... so if you want to hear the real story..  wait for the poster. haha.</div>
