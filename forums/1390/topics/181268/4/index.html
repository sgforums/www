            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dinky1409:</div><div class="quote_body">Sorry but I don't know if your story is believable or not. It is because there are a few things which needed to be clarify. Firstly, what happen to the other guards carrying the truncheon and wickershield? There are different levels of force which should be used accordingly to the degree of threat in the situation. Using firepower is the last and extreme level of force, and I strongly believe the other guards with the truncheon and wickershield should be enough show of force to overpower ONE guy with only A KNIFE. Secondly, its logical that unless the DO is a very high ranking and very experienced officer, he is definitely unable to issue such exact accurate orders calmly under such intense pressure. It would probably be something like, " Oi, block the guy! whack him and pin him down!" Yes, guards on duty always have to undergo riot drills everytime the are on guard duty but under such immmediate pressure, everything can forget. Its true. Also, I would not think one would have time to cock the rifle, unless the guy is far away. Lastly, I strongly believe if you really shoot the guy, your first shot would have immobilise him as M16 is a very powerful weapon and if I'm not wrong, the shot that hit his thigh would have rip his thigh apart and he would not be able to move anymore. Correct me If I'm wrong. Also, I went for provost course and I have never heard of the people at provost citing such a real life example of ROE before. Sorry, just doubtful about some information you were saying thats all.</div></blockquote>Just to clarify your few pointers posted:<br><br>1. The DO was a Major (who happened to be my BDE S3) on duty that night. He was a formerly a Provost officer before posting to my BDE.<br><br>2. There were other three guards holding the truncheon and shield on that night, all were taking position in a semi circle around the SSG. Me was standing next to Guard Cmdr.<br><br>3. Threat had already been defined as there were a casualty on ground (the 3SG). At the same time, he was charging towards the Guard Cmdr for further possible assault. Weapon was identified as the 20cm blade knife.<br><br>4. Remember the fact that all M16 rifles used for Guard duties are not zeroed, high chance that there will be misses or if lucky, bullet gazes wound. Me believed that my 1st shot probably gazed past his thigh. Or if not, at close range, the velocity of the shot could just simply went through his thigh.<br><br>5. Why it wasn't published in the GOMs or circulars could be because after the investigations, it was found that the SSG was reprimanded by his superior as he had done something against the SOP which the 3SG reported on. Could be the fact to hide the incident.</div>
