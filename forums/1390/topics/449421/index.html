              <p>Fellow mates! </p>
              <p>I am almost done for my Year 12 studies in Australia and most probably be getting an offer from the university to study my LLB (Law). I left SG when I was in Sec 2E and did my Grade 10/11 in Canada and Year 12 in Australia. <strong>Will my 'education background', in anyway, affect my posting like SPF/SAF/SCDF?</strong> (I hope to get into SPF though!) </p>
              <p>Recently, I contacted CMPB regarding my return to SG for this coming May and the personel there booked me for 1/June/2012 medical check-up. Here are the questions that I have got: </p>
              <p>1. I am planning to declare that I have got depression in the past and is not confident in holding guns and that I'm a very impulsive person. I will have my specialist to write a memo to CMPB. I've got medical/police records in various hospitals and institutes. Will it affect my PES and 'land' me into Pes E or something?  (Is it true that PES E are filled with sissies/gays?)</p>
              <p>I am not trying to 'keng' NS, don't get me wrong. My parents are worried about my past medical condition and just want things to be 'safe' for me. Although I am just fine with anything.</p>
              <p>2. I will be traveling around Europe for 1.5 months (late June - early August). However, I understand that my declaration for my past medical history will require me to go for extensive medical check-up and this will take up a lot of time. Since I am doing my medical check-up on 1/6 and be leaving SG by late June, is it possible for me to still enjoy my holidays? (Like if they refer me to govt hospital, I can delay it right? Furthermore, public hospitals normally will have a long waiting list (?) ) </p>
              <p>3. I am slightly obese (just 3-5kg over the borderline) and is hitting the gym recently with my private trainer. That will land me in Pes BP despite my medical condition? If I am 'overweight' during my medical check-up but manage to lose it before my enlistment, will it be of any help (as in to avoid that 'fat' training)? Or should I just trim down my fats before the medical check-up? &amp; what if I failed?</p>
              <p>4. Am I required to go for NAPFA if I'm graded PES E? If no, then they'll put me in PTP?</p>
              <p>5. Possible to get an easy life in NS? And do fellow mates here recommend that I reveal my education background to my to-be buddies or just stay low and say that I graduate from technical education or poly-technics? I am worried that my accent might 'disassociate' myself with the locals here. Hope I don't get sterotype there. </p>
              <p>6. Roughly, how long will it take for me to complete my NS and the possible enlistment dates? (say next year?) I , somehow, need to inform the university about my deferment. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Once again, thank you mates for your time in answering my questions. I appreciate your input and I wish you the best of luck.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Best Regards,</p>

              <p>i think sometimes mindef should be more flexible about getting those who return from overseas studies one. if they don;t wanna serve just allow them to air their choice and declare them unfit. maybe come up with a new pes 'g' for 'girly' or something.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>really i seen this time of people serving in my time before - their mind are not here and there and alwasy during fallin or something fast they alwasy comes in last, bring the whole platton and company down. PC and sergeant punich thos who come turn in early and not the last slow guy. so this time of people really go army is sarbo the whole platoon 1. i rather SAF down taeke them in, or just assign them to store clerk or 302 or something.</p>
