Usually, a unit environment can be slightly better.<br><br>Next time before you report sick, ask the medic if your unit MO is in. Just pressure the MO and show them your skin conditions.<br><br>Sigh, I know some MOs are willing to give the benefit of the doubt on most medical matters, so they also don't want to play play. But in this case, I guess they figure it for only a skin condition and is not life threatening, so they don't bother.</div>

If he gets charged he is the one who will sign extras..<br><br>There is a legitimate way to bypass your PC and unit S1....call the SAF Counselling Centre and tell them your story. They will make enquiries with your unit especially if you sound as if you are about to jump off a building. External pressure from MINDEF will be quite effective and you are certainly within your rights to call the Counselling Centre for help..</div>
