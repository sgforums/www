The CC during my time, was an absolute stonewall.OETI is infamous in my eyes for slowness in dockets.<br><br>It took me half a year to get a Medical Board done at OETI in 2003. I'm not surprised it takes that long now. There were a lot of nasty things going on in that place, with regards to upper management. But I shall not go into details here.<br><br>For the threadstarter, the only way now is for you to report sick at the Medical Center whenever you feel unwell, and continue to press your case to the MO.<br><br>I assume you are in AVTW, try speaking to the CSM too?Your PC is a WO right?I guess he might feel unable to do anything, as do most WOs posted there to be PCs. Try talking to the 2IC or OC too. There's still a chain of command even for your condition.<br><br>But don't blindly go about doing your tasks if they put you in injury and sickness' way. If the MO sees you long enough, I'll think your docket will appear. Somehow, OETI still used paper dockets then..not sure about now though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yep, as what the others have said, go and endorse your specialist letter. Just report sick but find out first what timing the MO is "free" to make the appropriate visit. This is because the MC is ususally flooded in the morning, typically in camps all over sg.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> (Funny but it is true) So if u go in this period, the MO may hack care u one.<br><br>Let the MO do his job first but if he fails to take appropriate action, go to ur  specialist (with ur family,if can employ ur hordes of relatives and bombard ur specialist), request him to write a more harsher letter or ask him to call the MO. If ur specialist is respected figure in the medical community it would be better.<br><br>Ya, it may be extreme but most MOs I come across are the bo hiew and hack care types  so must use the rod against regardless if there are the good ones.<br><br>Ususally, going to the MO shld be enough liao because he can put ppl OOC but if u want to talk to ur PC, S1 or CO. Please go via proper channel hor dun skipped and go directly CO.<br><br>My view on this is simple, if ur medical condition is geniue, is backed by specialist (in ur case shld be from NSC) and continue in ur current working enviroment will worsen ur condition then u must take action liao. It is ur life dun let 2 years of NS make u suffer the rest of ur life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>bro,<br><br>what i can say is that, with the specialist letter, it is not enough. you must be persistent. by that i mean,<br><br>1. see the MO <span style="text-decoration: underline;">constantly</span> and tell him the seriousness of ur condition. for eg, what irritates u and aggrevates ur condition to the point of u (almost) "dying".<br><br>2. yes, return to ur private doctor (specialist) and let him/her understand what has been going on in camp. explain how things are plainly and most important relate matters truthfully but giving grace (benefit of doubt) to ur superiors. ask for another stronger worded letter from the specialist which may allow u to excess the Medical Board sooner. in this letter, hopefully ur specialist will be kind enough to excuse u from uniform etc. especially from dusty, oily, greasy and metalic environment. u really need an air-con environment.<br><br>3. seek out ur MP's advise together with ur parents. meet ur MP and discuss how this can be resolved quickly as it is health matters. i'm sure if u convinced ur MP that u r genuinely not trying to avoid NS liability but rather due to poor health conditions, he/she will help out. but use this as one of ur last resolve ultimatum).<br><br>4. and lastly, stay positive, bro. nothing beats u down than urself. keep ur spirits up and perform whatever tasks that's tasked to u or ur team in ur best know-how. don't isolate urself bcos of ur illness but associate and bridge relationships to the best of ability.<br><br>dun be fearful bcos no one wishes themselves to be sick. eczema is truly a "rich-man's" illness...no cure (as yet), needs constant air-conditioning (depending on ur kind of eczema) and not to mention sometimes it itches like !@#@#%$$^%$^*<br><br>take care bro!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I also have eczema and it's in a sort of on-off good-bad condition. But my vocation in NS is as a PES B signaller in an armour unit and I'd never had any problems with outfield in the 'A' Vehicles. But whenever my skin gets quite bad I'd go to the MO to get excuse uniform. But I've never downgraded. Perhaps your condition is caused by different things from mine. It'll be helpful if you can do allergy test to determine whether your eczema is aggravated by exposure to dust or grease. If so then your chances of downgrading or re-vocationing is higher.<br><br>As for writing to your MP, I suggest that you exhaust all possible avenues within your unit first before doing so, as I've heard that you can be charged for going to your MP without passing through the chain of command first.</div>
