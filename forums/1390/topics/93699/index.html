            <div class='col-md body'>From www.miw.com.sg<br><br>What if I fail my IPPT within my 1-year window?Â <br><br>A:<br>NSmen who failed to pass their IPPT at the end of their 1-year window will have to book for a 8-week Remedial Training Program within 2 months after the closure of their IPPT window. The booking system is the same as the IPPT Booking System. Failure to book for RT within the specified duration may result in the NSman being disciplinary dealt with for Absence Without Official Leave (AWOL).<br><br>The RT will be conducted at the same 3 FCCs, i.e. Khatib, Bedok and Maju Camps. The 8-week non-residential RT program comprises of one weekday and one weekend session weekly.<br><br>IPPT will be conducted at monthly intervals at the 8th and 16th sessions. NSmen who pass their IPPT are immediately discharged from the RT regime. Only IPPT Passes will be taken as the IPPT result for the current IPPT window. The NSmen will also be entitled for monetary incentives during the RT IPPT if they meet the required standards.<br><br><strong>Attendance Attendance for all RT sessions is compulsory. NSmen who are absent from any RT session without a valid reason will be summarily tried for AWOL and given a make-up training for the session. Absentees are liable to be fined or sentenced to detention.</strong><br><br>Make-Up Training NSmen who are unable to attend a scheduled session regardless of the reason will be required to attend a RT make-up session the following week, e.g. NSman who misses a weekday session will have to attend 2 weekday session and 1 weekend session the following week.<br><br>Deferment Applications for deferment from RT are to be sent to your parent unit at least 3 weeks before the commencement of RT programme.<br><br>We hope that the above answer meets your queries.<br><br>Should you require further clarification, please contact MINDEF eServices Centre at 1800-3646333. Alternatively, you may also drop us an email at esc@miw.com.sg.<br><br>At MINDEF eServices Center we are here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to render our assistance to you.Â </div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just wanna check with you guys, is it possible to go for voluntary RT before the IPPT window closes? For example, if my birthday falls on 30 November and I know that I won't clear the test, can I go for an IPPT session now and immediately book the RT? Or will the system accept RT bookings only from 30 November?<br><br>This is not a joke; I'm serious in asking this question.<br><br>SQ22</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SQ22, give your best shot in the IPPT. If you are working full-time, U will find that the RT will disrupt your work flow and it'll takes up your weekend time too.<br><br>At least try for a pass. Although no incentives but at least u dun have to take RT lor. To pass, u can only take IPPT at Safra Toa Payoh and Safra Tampines. Not sure abt the Tamines one... check at miw.com.sg</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To clarify further, the "LOCATION" address on the letter isn't at the SAF Court-Martial Centre, isn't it? It's either at your reservist camp or at one of the Formation units - correct?<br><br>If so, then I think you'll kena a summary trial, with the matter to be resolved "internally" rather than outsourced to the Court Martial Centre (which involves a real life district judge-cum-NSman). Don't quote me, but I don't think you'll be formally charged as AWOL either. Instead, it'll probably be along the lines of "failing to attend IPPT" or equivalently more minor - esp. since the latter offence is fairly frequent with reservists.<br><br>Prepare a persuasive mitigation - work overload, family burdens, recent injury, overseas trip, et. al. - with preferably documentary evidence &amp; then be mightily penitent on the day. Maybe they'll hear your plea even before convening the trial; you'll hopefully cop a fine (or just a formal warning) as a resolution. Whether it's $50 or more will depend on the weightage of the evidence, your military rank (higher rank = bigger punishment) &amp;, I guess, your disciplinary officer's "kind" heart as well. He has the discretion powers; the SAF rules decree only "summary trial &amp; then redo RT" for IPPT offenders.<br><br>Cheers.</div>

Somemore, dun even need to run 2.4 to have considered done. So i have no idea what's so hard. As for ways to get out of the charge, mm, so far what seems to work are usually due to medical, overseas employment or in rare cases admin cock up.

I never managed to pass my IPPT all through my BMT and reservist (I've gone through 3 ICTs already). In fact, I never passed my NAPFA in school too. I've gone for two RT sessions, so I know what I'm in for. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>My question is, technically, is it possible to book an RT session before my window closes? Does the system allow me to book it before the window closes? Or do I have to "die die" wait till November before I can start my RT?<br><br>SQ22</div>

At least the online system doesn't have such an option. You are only liable for RT if you fail your IPPT. And understand the new system, I believe that you are only considered to have failed your IPPT if you did not clear it by the time your window closed. SO technically speaking, I don't think you can book RT before your window closes.<br><br>Maybe you can try calling one of the FCC and enquire about this?<br><br></div>
