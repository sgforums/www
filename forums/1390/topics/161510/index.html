They say that the best self-defense style is grappling, as popularized in Brazilian Jujitsu seen in Ultimate Fighting Championship matches. Other mixed martial arts claim to be the best for the street. But is there one "best" art for the street.<br><br>For the sake of this discussion, "street" refers self-defense situations that common people may have face on the street, not street fighting or other supposedly no-holds-barred (NHB) fighting. In NHB fighting, there are written rules that help prevent serious injury, such as no eye gouging, biting, or weapons. In street fighting, there are also rules, unwritten, but still strictly enforced. Street fighters like to street fight, so they have to have rules to prevent serious injury so they may keep street fighting.<br><br>So is grappling the best self-defense style for the street?<br><br>What does a grappler do when attacked on stairs or on a subway or in knee deep snow or on a crowed street?<br><br>What about an attacker with a knife or other concealed weapon? A person in a submission hold may not have an empty hand way of getting out of the hold, but a knife in the kidney will end the hold, and the holder. Thugs do not walk around with just one weapon. You may control the arm with the gun, but the other arm may pull a knife.<br><br>When dragged into a broken glass filled alley, do you want to grapple on the ground?<br><br>Do you want to get into a test of strength with an attacker who is high on psychoactive drugs.<br><br>What does the grappler do when the attacker has a friend? Do you want to be on the ground holding an attacker, when a friend comes to his or her aid? While you are holding down one attacker, what will the other attacker be doing with your spouse?<br><br>An attacker may not be able to escape from your hold-down, but he or she will bite and spit.<br><br>If you are a law enforcement officer, do you want to grapple with a suspect and give him or her an opportunity to grab your firearm or other weapon.<br>Karate and its Korean counterpart, Taekwondo, were developed as a civil system of fighting. They were never intended to be used on a battlefield or in competition. In their truest forms, they did not include ground fighting. Patterns contain locks, arm bars, chokes, etc. but no ground fighting. Why? Was it a mistake, or was it intentional?<br><br>When the civilians designed the original techniques, the techniques were for use against violent and unprovoked attacks. There were no sparring competition techniques and, since there were no attackers that were planning to grapple with you, ground fighting was not needed. In a self-defense situation, you goal is not to win, but to safely protect yourself and escape.<br><br>Most modern ground fighting techniques were derived from competition fights. Even Judo, which was designed as a sport, did not originally have ground fighting techniques. In 1882, Jigero Kano founded Judo. It was based upon the Tenshin-Shinyo-ryu and Kito-ryu systems of Jujitsu that were well known for their striking techniques and throws. These were battlefield arts that were designed by samurais who would probably be decapitated by another opponent if they remained on the ground very long while on the battlefield. In 1900, Kano arranged a competition against a Fusen-ryu-Jujitsu school. In a strategy developed to confuse the Judo fighters, the Fusen-ryu fighters fell to the floor when the matches started. The confused Judo fighters joined them on the floor and were quickly overcome by the locks and chokes of the Fusen-ryu fighters, bringing the first losses for the Judo fighters in eight years. To help regain Judo's superiority in competition, Kano added ground fighting.<br><br>As demonstrated in the movements in patterns, karate and Taekwondo were developed as brutal martial arts. There are few controlling techniques, some throws, and virtually no pins. The techniques use kicks, punches, gouges, pokes, crushes, etc. that were designed to end a fight quickly and efficiently. When a fight went to the ground, the strategy was to kick and punch until you could get back to your feet.<br><br>Until recently, no modern military fighting system is based upon ground fighting. Captain Fairbairn, who developed a system of unarmed combat that was used by the Shanghai Municipal Police, British Commandos, U.S. Marines, British Special Operations, and American OSS during World War II, wrote in his 1942 combat manual "Get Tough!" that, "You will have noted that no holds or locks on the ground are demonstrated. The reason for this is: THIS IS WAR." No soldier wants to go to the ground where rocks, mines, or bobby traps may be present. Visibility range is limited and one is helpless against another attacker.<br><br>Beginning in 1995, the U.S. Army began a revision of its combatives (hand-to-hand) training program. The program begins with the basics of Brazilian Jujitsu ground fighting and progresses into the throws and takedowns of Judo and Wrestling and the strikes of boxing and muay thai. All this training is combined with marksmanship and contact weapons training from Kali and the western martial arts into yet another integrated system of close quarters combat. I have not seen the entire training course, but from what photographs that are available on the Internet, the program seems to stress ground fighting. For details on the new combatives program see the U. S. Army field manual at  http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-25-150/. See the following link for other links to U.S. Army Combatives articles: http://www.moderncombatives.org/pages/5/index.htm.<br><br>I find it difficult to believe that ground fighting would be effective method of combat for a U.S. Army soldier, wearing full-combat equipment, who is attacked by an Iraqi insurgent who is wearing practically nothing. Due to the combat equipment, the soldier's movements are very limited, especially while on the ground. When in a combat situation, who would want to be on the ground fighting one attacker while other enemy are all around. If taken to the ground, a soldier needs know how to fight from the ground, but a soldier would rarely choose to go to the ground.<br><br>As in other types of military training, soldiers train for a short time in combatives and then rarely train in it again. When ground fighting is stressed during training, especially during the beginning stages, a soldier in a hand-to-hand combat situation would tend to revert to the techniques that were first taught, and stressed the most, during training. If these techniques were ground fighting, then, during an individual attack in a combat situation, the soldier is most likely to go to the ground. I for one would not want my fellow soldiers on the ground grappling with the enemy during an attack. In combat, the goal is not to kill one enemy to protect yourself, but to kill as many of the enemy as possible before you are killed.<br><br>Remember, a good grappler knows how to grapple, a great fighter knows when to grapple. Grapple when you have to, but on the street it is strategically safer and wiser to remain on your feet.<br><br>So what does an ordinary person do when attacked on the street, usually by a thug who has no rules and would just as soon kill you as not? Thugs do not grapple, they attack in the quickest, easiest way they can, usually with a weapon. In this case, you do what your art has trained you to do!<br><br>Grandmaster Jhoon Rhee, the 10th degree black belt who introduced Taekwondo to the United States in 1956 was asked in an interview "What types of martial arts training will get me in shape and boost my confidence?"  He answered "If you had asked me this question 30 years ago, I would have said Taekwondo was the best to keep you in top shape and build confidence, but now I say the differences are not in the styles but in the individual instructors. If an instructor as the knowledge, integrity, and takes the students sincerely, the results will be good."<br><br>So which martial art is best? According to Walter Eddie, the United States heavyweight Taekwondo champion in 1981 and a 6th degree black belt, "Under proper instruction, an individual develops the key elements of focus, balance, coordination, speed, and power." As long it is learned from an experienced instructor, who is respected amongst other local, regional, or national martial artists, and is accredited by some legitimate organizations, any martial art may be the best.<br><br>Extracted from http://tkdtutor.com/</div>
