I was posted to 40 SAR as a mortar specialist after my trade course in school of armour prior to SISPEC.<br><br>In unit life, its much more on working together with your men as a team, because whatever mission you are executing, the sucess of it depends largely on your men. If you treat your men like garbage, they will lose respect in you and whatever mission exercises you are doing, they will execute to the least of their abilities and your mission would be jeopardised.<br><br>Of couse, when you are required to be firm with them, you should, because some of them might step over your head if you are too nice to them. But overall, treat them with respect and they will return it with favour.<br><br>Towards the end of your NSF stint, always remember, it is YOU who will affect their mindset on what they thought of their 2 years in the army.

Speaking for Arty, if things haven't changed: you'll join the surviving mono-intakers for their trade course &amp;, once everyone else is posted in too, the unit shall train together progessively (i.e BTY EXs, then BN Exs) to pass the FATEP test &amp; obtain REDCON status. After that, the unit becomes operational for standbys &amp; mob mannings, etc. Cyclically, this is done twice in active time (&amp; every ICT during reservist).<br><br>For the old 120mm SP mortars (21 SA), individual BTYs were forever attached out post-FATEP to support infantry EXs so plenty of weekends burnt (usually dry runs on Fri &amp; Sat &amp; live firing on Sun). Dunno how the 155mm units were kept busy, although they've got their own annual live firing overseas &amp; thus their own schedule momentum. On the whole, arty &amp; armour also do a lot of vehicular &amp; equipment maintainence -- even officers are expected to come down to the garage &amp; help out. On &amp; off, the unit may also be arrowed to participate in parades/GOHs, to set up static displays, to do blind clearance, etc. Of course, the training programme won't neglect regular PT, SOC, unarmed combat, swimming, etc. either.<br><br>The 3SGs shall take turns doing duty DI during these activities, while also doing COS &amp; guard commander, etc.<br><br></div>
