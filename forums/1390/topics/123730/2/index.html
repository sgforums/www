            <div class='col-md body'>hmm strange.. i thought i replied to this post.. bah anyway..<br><br>seancannot: we gave the hijackers a deadline, they refused, too bad. and they were weilding knives (hell look at 9/11, he had a penknife!). So let this be a warning to all other potential terrorists who are thinking of doing another 117.<br><br>specops87: i may be wrong, but i think that the SOF was already 'engaged' ever since the hijackers demanded things. Their orders were direct; -shoot to kill. as for peace-keepers, hmm, i think the standing order for ROE is that no one fires unless fired upon or they feel threatened by an opfor. someone correct me if i am wrong.<br><br>well anyway i'm sure that the saf has alot of operations under it's belt lah but it just doesn't get de-classified.</div>

Every time when the cage is unlocked,and men like them go to war,it is them who keep SG safe and it is them who so willingly put their lives on the line for us.So that the future of Singapore remains free.NO matter how many tangos the guys who saved the day during the SQ incindent,they are still heroes worthy of our salute. You may label them as killers as they were shooting men who are amred with butter knives etc.but the point is,these men tried to harm the lives of many others on board.And that the troopers are simply doing what they have been trained to do,what they have been paid to do,its their job.I belief it would be unplesant for anyone to point a gun at another human being and shoot with the full intention to kill.But they did it,not because they were cold blooded murderers,but they were simply stopping those who want to harm the majority of the others.<br><br>Thus said..It is the rough men who are willing to do violent acts on our behalf that we sleep safe at night.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>re: the Pakistani UN peacekeepers incident in Somalia - there were quite a few deadly incidents, probably resulting in a total of 20-30 dead Pakistani soldiers - any of these couldve had their weapons and equipment stripped off them when they were dead - look at what happened to the downed crewmen in Somalia in the October operation in Somalia..<br><br>i dont know how many of you have done tubular assaults - ive only done one highly-intensive training period on them - but its probably one of the worst/hardest missions you could ask for.<br>[7 secs on a 747 is quite good apparently <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ]<br>Regardless of what the hijackers actually had, at the end of the day, its down to you to do your job, protect the hostages and take down the hijackers. end of story.<br>hostages get priority, hijackers are somewhat further down the list.<br>You get in, you dominate and consolidate your position, move towards your objectives and take them down.<br><br>Give credit where its due gentlemen. Those SOF did their job and did it well.<br>I always give kudos to professionals.</div>
