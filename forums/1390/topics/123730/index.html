            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/pixhistory/sq117resc01.jpg"><br><br>On 26 Mar 1991, Singapore Airlines Airbus flight SQ 117 took off from Subang Airport in Kuala Lumpur with 129 passengers and crew onboard at 1815 hrs. Four passengers who claimed to be Pakistanis took control of the plane when it was enroute to Singapore. The plane landed and parked at Changi Airport's Runway One at 2215 hrs.<br><br>Even as the plane arrived, an Executive Group of high-ranking officials from various organisations including MINDEF, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Information and the Arts, the Singapore Airlines and a negotiating team were activated.<br><br><strong>Demands</strong><br><br>The hijackers claimed to be members of the Pakistan People's Party. They wanted the release of former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's husband and other PPP members detained in Pakistani jails. They also wanted the plane refuelled so that they could fly to Australia.<br><br>On 27 Mar 91 at 0230 hrs, the plane was moved to an outer tarmac. The hijackers pushed two SIA stewards out of the plane, injuring them. The injured stewards provided vital information, which assisted the eventual storming of the plane.<br><br><strong>Countdown and Rescue</strong><br><br>The hijackers issued a five-minute deadline at 0645 hrs after which they threatened to kill one passenger every ten minutes if their demands were not acceded to.<br><br>On the countdown to three minutes, the order was given to storm the plane. Elite Commandos stormed the plane, killing four Pakistani hijackers and freeing all 118 passengers and 9 crew. The rescue of SQ 117 was over in just 30 seconds and ended at 0650 hrs. None of the passengers and crew were hurt.<br><br><strong>PM Goh's Commendation</strong><br><br>Prime Minister Goh expressed his appreciation to everyone involved in the rescue, the officials from various ministries, statutory boards and SIA. He praised them for their swift and efficient handling of the crisis.<br><br>CPT Stanley Lim, the pilot of SQ 117 and Supt Foo Kia Juah, the leader of the Police negotiating team each received the Public Service Star for their role in the rescue. The SAF Commandos were awarded the Medal for Valour while the members of the unit and members of Police negotiating team were awarded Presidential Certificates of Commendation at a separate ceremony.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It was a long time ago, my company was on standby that week. Got turned  out - thinking it was another drill. But it was a live one.<br>Can't remember the details, but we went thru the usual routines of checking everything was in order and ready to go. Some briefing about securing the parameter to prevent interference. Anyway - nothing happened for us, waited until everything was over.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry dun flame me!!!I am not degrading the SG SOF  but the commandos massacred some men with butter knife and proclaimed ' bomb'. Of Cos they cant take any chance in this kind of situattion. But it not really such am impressive operation. Compare to what happen to israel ops when their liner got hijacked to Africa their commandos flew thousand miles  to storm the enemy airport and wipe out part of their Army and air force in the process!!and brought the hostage back .. all this done in the enemy territory</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With all due respect, Sean, your view is problematic in that it not only is based upon 20/20 hindisght, but it also attempts to compare apples to oranges.<br><br>First, of course, we have the hindsight issue.  Yes, we now know that they had firecrackers and knives, but what would you have been thinking at H-Hour, standing outside the aircraft door and not knowing what you were going to find in there?  That, I propose, makes the difference between the force line boys and the rest of us.<br><br>Second, SQ117 and Thunderbolt were entirely different missions altogether.<br>- 117 took 55 seconds to complete; Thunderbolt took 58 minutes<br>- 117 took place entirely within the confines of the aircraft; the Thunderbolt hostages were in Entebbe airport, where there was more space to work with<br>- 117 took place within the space of a day; Thunderbolt stretched over 8 days, during which the terrosists had time to grow complacent, especially since they had the support of the Ugandan troops<br><br>It therefore would not be appropriate to say who did a better job since the two missions were vastly different.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>another very important difference. the SQ mission had no hostages or rescuers killed during the rescue, while the Entebbe raid, 3 hostages were killed during the rescue.<br><br>most notably, the elder brother of the Israeli PM Benjamin (Binyamin) Netanyahu(96 - 99), LTC Johnathan (Yonatan) Netanyahu was one of the 2 KIAs. He was the leader of the assault force.</div>
