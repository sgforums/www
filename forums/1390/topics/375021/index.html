              <p>nonono...don't get me wrong. The Great Barrier Reef is not called by that for nothing...it's the biggest reef in the world...What I meant was, if they can't prevent pollution within their own continent how can they prevent it from being brought into their country. Anyways, if they can prevent one type of pollution/contamination through this kind of ways(foreign checking of equipment), they can never prevent all of it. An example would be carbon monoxide from cars...are all their cars CNG?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Just to take note, I'm not against them being environment friendly...Just that I find it too exaggerating.</span></span></p>

              purposes other than porn searches,  will help you understand how
              contaminants and parasites are not universal.</p>
              <p>The very fact that
              you could ask that question shows that you lack the education to
              operate at the policy-making level, so you may as well just shut up and
              follow the policies made by the people who do have the education.  Mind
              you, it's the policies of the powers-that-be at Gombak I'm talking
              about, not the Aussies'.</p>
              <p>The bottom line's simple - if
              you don't keep that crap out of Australia, it could cost billions of
              dollars in crop damage. Any nonsense you spout about the love of
              nature, pollution or the reef is irrelevant.</p>
              <p>Wallaby is
              Australia's playground, and it's up to them to let people in.  If
              Singaporeans like you don't want to play ball,it's no skin off the
              Australians' noses.  It just means that MINDEF will have one less
              training area because Australia's DoD isn't going to want to answer for
              your stupidity causing untold damage.  Guess whose problem that becomes
              then?</p>
              <p>Crop damage probably doesn't mean shit to you, and
              that's just fine.  It does, however mean something to MINDEF, so when
              you get that tingling sensation of your CO's boot up your arse, you may
              as well know why.</p>
              <p>If all that's too much for you to wrap
              your little head around, try something simpler: how is any of the
              Australian reasoning different from Singapore's justification for
              banning chewing gum?</p>

              <p>Simple. Banning of chewing gum was to solve the internal problem of finding gums underneath almost anything that has a bottom surface, although it doesn't really help much. Singaporeans still try to bring it in for their own enjoyment and sharing.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the initial starting of this thread was about sharing of pre and post wallaby, and wallaby itself experiences. Not about debating over some environmental issues over Australia being vulnerable to crop damages through foreign contamination. I just shared my view and dont know why the title was changed, and I would appreciate if the title would be changed back and get the thread back on track if possible. If not, just lock it.</p>

              <p>And I find it quite disturbing that
                      the Australians are so strict about cleaniness of our equipment.
                      What really offended me was the dummy granade thing. For my unit we
                      are supposed to clear out the sand, bring it there, and put in the
                      Australian sand. This is like so discriminating.</p>

              <p>did you not?</p>
              <p>Now you may be the sort to treat things at surface level, but that's a fatal assumption to hold if you're trying to worm your way out of a tight spot.</p>
              <p>The fact is that you've already shown your ignorance by not knowing how soil contaminants and parasites vary across regions and countries.  Despite that, you have the temerity and unmitigated gall to to hold yourself fit to question the instructions of your superiors (in every sense of the word).</p>
              <p>We ask for thinking soldiers and we get you instead - the unthinking un-soldier.  Guys like you are the reason why the Yanks got their asses whupped in Vietnam, in contrast to the Poms were the ones opening up a can of whup-ass on the communists in Malaya.</p>

              <p>Once again you show your inability to think.  The gum ban was a specific solution to an identified problem - same with the quarantine regulations of Australian customs.  The only difference is scale - Singapore wanted to save a a few grand in maintenance fees, a contamination problem applies on a much larger scale.</p>
              <p>Now if something that simple doesn't sink in, I don't know what it's going to take to educate you out of being an ugly Singaporean.</p>
