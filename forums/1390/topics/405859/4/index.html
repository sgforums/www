              <p>You even went to the extreme of going stomp where I'm at, to message me how do I get PES F, worth it or not seriously, Just bear with the remaining 18 months, It doesn't kill seriously, Just bear in mind that now you serve NS, you may have a chance of getting a better job in future. For me I just concentrate on how to tackle how the HR asks me whether or not I did serve NS.</p>

              <p><br>got NITEC. anyway, we are side-tracking here, TS, I say just continue, because if you are a PES F holder, you may get a pay reduction, employers may ask. Last week I went for a factory job the first thing HR ask is NS, if you failed that round that's it for you. and it happened to me.</p>

              <p>dont worry. it is a kind of adjustment problem, in a normal distribution curve, you will have people who can adjust very well and on the other end, they cannot.And this is normal, usually people and animals will migrate or move to places that they are comfort with. But in this case you are forced out of your comfort zone to a foreign area.</p>
              <p>You probably speak English differently and also peers might also find you oddward.Just go with the flow and see how, throw the problem back to SAF as they are the one who ask you to come back.</p>

              <p>I do think it's something of an adjustment issue as well. When I was a clerk during my NS days I came across a very old file of an NSF who went AWOL during the unit's first few years of existence. It was back in the 1970s. When I looked at the serviceman's particulars I was very surprised to see that he was a degree holder whom was educated in the U.S. and also had some adjustment problems. Mostly it seemed people expected more of him because he was a degree holder so people thought he should be "smarter" and "faster" than the bulk of his batch whom were likely O levels or even lower. That guy then went AWOL and never got caught.</p>
              <p>I also know from personal experience in the army that people can discriminate against you just because you look or sound different, maybe with a foreign accent. I had a friend whom was continuously bothered in his bunk just because he looked small and vulnerable. Every night someone would throw slippers at him and no one would own up. You can guess that if he chose to report such behaviour to this superiors that he might be in for a "blanket party" the next day. Even if they don't do such things if you can't fit in the army your very own section mates can make life difficult for you. Sometimes they think you're being deliberately obtuse because they believe someone with a degree should know better. They don't know what its like inside.</p>
              <p>I'm not telling this story because I'm encouraging the TS to do the same thing (go AWOL). But I just want to point out that the adjustment problem is more of an issue when you're coming in from a world of freedom (like in the EU or America) to a world where individual freedom is greatly suppressed (conscript). That's a major reason why conscription was abolished in the US back in the 1970s. Apparently they didn't like the idea of being enslaved to the state and robbed of their freedom, even if the state was democratically elected.</p>

It's simple, and you'll probably be rife with questions... <br><br>Just endure.<br><br>I, despite hating my service and the organization responsible, have gone through a year and four days, without taking a single MC. I used to feel the anxiety every time I'd step into camp. I'd also feel the stares from all the people who saw me as one of the few (probably five of us in the entire camp) foreigners.

              <p>@Mal ganus</p>
              <p>I certainly didn't see your thread. I'm not a frequent visitor to these forums, at least not till recently. Well I guess you and TS have a lot in common. For the record, I should say that I've always been a Singaporean citizen, was born and raised in Singapore my entire life and have not spent any extended period of time overseas.</p>
              <p>Reason why I could sympathise with you guys was because I held certain views of liberty which are alien to most people. Probably a consequence of reading too much Western news and writings. Of course I had some difficulties adapting to NS as well, but I ORDed 3 years back having served the 1 year 10 months as a clerk (was PES C9L2 due to a physical injury). I can tell you personally I believe conscription is a complete waste of one's time. But one thing that kept me going was that I didn't want to make life difficult for my superiors and colleagues/camp mates.</p>
              <p>One thing I learned was that even some of  the regulars there hates serving as well. They do so sometimes because they need to raise funds for their studies, or because their family ran into hard times and they had no choice. Like us, these servicemen have a job to complete and they're only doing so because they've got mouths to feed at home. I've witnessed how even some of my immediate superiors got into trouble with their superiors for being too lenient with us at times. Of course among them you'll find all kinds of a**holes, people who tekan (bully) others or throw weight around by virtue of their rank, but I'm fortunate enough that none of my immediate superiors were like that. I agree that it gets easier to adjust once you realise we're all in this deep sh** hole for 2 years.</p>
              <p>But most importantly, what I knew none of them was responsible for passing Enlistment Act 93. That's why I never made life difficult for them by being deliberately uncooperative. And lastly, for much the same reasons above, I never played office politics by backstabbing others by badmouthing them to their superiors. Such is much more common amongst the service vocations (clerks especially) than amongst the combat ones. I often find that the guys in combat vocations are truly brothers you can depend on in times of need.</p>
              <p>So I can't offer the TS or anyone who reads this thread any advice on how to get out of NS, since I've never done so myself. But please remember, no matter what you do or think of doing, don't make life difficult for good people. No matter how much conscription sucks, remember there are always good people out there who can make this 2 years of hell more bearable.</p>
              <p>P.S. I guess the moderators of this forum does have some kind of an attitude problem. I don't see why they should see fit to mock various TS by changing thread titles.</p>

              <p>Think it's only fair if I list down what TS has done to land himself into this state, so that everyone reading this forum will have a balanced perspective on what's happening.</p>
              <p>- He refused to mingle with the mono-intake people</p>
              <p>- He cried during trainings e.g. at the training shed, at the company line etc.</p>
              <p>- He adamantly refused to do area cleaning and other duties assigned to him</p>
              <p>- He began to take Attend Cs of increasing durations beginning from the first book-out, eventually OOC-ing from the Trades Course as his attendance was too poor</p>
              <p>- After he OOC-ed, he refused to sleep in his bunk and spent the night in the commanders' office</p>
              <p>- He refused to participate in all company activities e.g. 5BX, Cohesion etc.</p>
              <p>- When people were listening to the RO/doing 5BX, he would be dressed in another attire (e.g. long No. 4 when people were doing 5BX), sitting in one corner by himself and emoing</p>
              <p>- He shouted at the OC and CSM thinking that they caused his depression and eventually got posted out to 6 SIR as a clerk.</p>
              <p><br>All I can say is, TS mostly brought all of these on himself. His stubborn refusal to help himself has brought about liabilities on others.</p>
              <p>And since he dares to come out with such ridiculous ideas on a public forum, thus making a mockery of the SAF, I shall expose him right here, right now.</p>

              <p>There is no doubt that there is something wrong with TS. Not every1 is adaptable like to group together when it come to socialise with other people.When you view at him, he seems to be weird to you. And this eventually cause him to be depressed.</p>
              <p>Yes, there is something wrong with him to you. But not every1 group together in comfort. </p>
              <p>Try teaching a CAT to fetch a stick, or expect a CAT to herd together.  Dont train cat to be dog and expect it to guard your house. It is JUST CAT.</p>
