              <p>The counsellor and the powers-that-be have done as much as they possibly can for you, so now you have to do your part. There's only so much the counsellor can say unless you tell him <em>everything</em>, short of taking truth serum.</p>
              <p>You may want to find someone you can bitch to after work hours, be it someone here or back in the States, who can give a listening ear more often than the counsellor can. I know what it's like to have your heart somewhere else, and I found that useful. Meanwhile, you need to persevere and drag yourself to camp if you must. The only way you can get used to this quickly is to tackle it head-on.</p>
              <p>The sense of accomplishment that you'll feel in Feb 2012 will be second to none. But if you choose to run away, remember that you'll bear the consequences, intended or otherwise.</p>

              <p>I invaded his privacy. As we were working partner, we were not friends, so I was not supposed to ask where he stay, how was his wife, what book he was reading, what he did after office hours and related personnel matters. Of course I could ask him about quantum theory, fluid dynamics, he was happy to explain but not his personal matters. It was just a culture thing. </p>
              <p>To him, it seemed like I was invading his personnel life, which he would automatically say when he was willing to share. But not when I asked. Even asking was forbidden, especially about the "race" and "religion". </p>
              <p>I got another friend (&lt; this is a friend &gt;) who said that he felt so offended when he was filling up the personnel particulars in a form in Singapore. He felt so awkward, as this was forbidden in his country. </p>

              <p>Don't listen to those guys. What is this crap about being SELF-RELIANT and looking for answers inside you? This is NOT a self-esteem convention, people!<br><br>My suggestion is simple. Just find a guy that looks like you. Then pay him a decent salary each month. His job is to just come to camp and pose as you.  Maybe he might have to do abit more like taking rollcalls or pretending to do work - doesn't matter you can negociate that later. Win-win situation for both. Guy gets easy money doing an easy slacker job (with free meals as bonus) and you can continue lying in bed with mom&amp;dad while playing with pokemon cards until you ORD.<br><br>No need to thank me, dude.

              <p>Don't listen to those guys. What is this crap about being
              SELF-RELIANT and looking for answers inside you? This is NOT a
              self-esteem convention, people!<br> <br> My suggestion is simple. Just find a guy that looks like you. Then
              pay him a decent salary each month. His job is to just come to camp
              and pose as you.  Maybe he might have to do abit more like
              taking rollcalls or pretending to do work - doesn't matter you can
              negociate that later. Win-win situation for both. Guy gets easy
              money doing an easy slacker job (with free meals as bonus) and you
              can continue lying in bed with mom&amp;dad while playing with
              pokemon cards until you ORD.<br> <br> 
              No need to thank me, dude. Just happy to help.</p>

              <p>I wrote that a couple of weeks ago… And right now, it’s not better, it’s only getting worse. I’m already a clerk but each time I come into camp I feel this overwhelming sense of fear and anxiety.</p>
              <p>I don’t know what to do. Life’s become very motivation-less and I feel so lethargic and tired all the time, so much so that it takes me a lot of energy and will to move around in the early morning when I gotta go to camp.</p>
              <p>I still have 1.5 years left and I am struggling to stay afloat here. I think currently I have only three options in order of possibility: 1) Change citizenship, 2) <span>PES F 3</span>) join <span>MDC</span> where at least I have an creative outlet for me to work with and allow me to perform, something I’ve always done since I was 6.</p>
              <p>Can someone advise me what I should do?</p>
              <p>It’s really difficult right now.</p>

              <p>I think most posters here miss the point of TS original post. The life of a conscript is definitely not comparable to any real world job. In the real world, it's illegal to compell someone to do something against their will, even if your boss tells you to do something you strongly object to, resignation is always an option. But of course that's not the case in the army. Over there if you don't listen, it's insubordination and it's a crime to not obey your superiors standing orders. It's likely the lack of freedom in the army, not the lack of privileges such as staying out.</p>
              <p>Having said that, I see no way out for TS. I don't know of any way someone could get a discharge from the army apart from a medical evaluation one is unfit. Perhaps someday a future Parliament will repeal Enlistment Act 93. For those males born in SG, you are all cursed for the 2 years you have to waste in NS. It's not your fault that you're born here, but certainly your fault for staying on to serve NS thinking it's nothing big. If you love your freedom, and if you adhere to libertarian ideals the West  (especially the US) is the ideal home country for you. A communitarian country like Singapore will always be anathema to you. Not telling you to leave SG if you don't like it, but unless some Parliament repeals that Act, there's no way around it.</p>
              <p>PS. And I do agree with some here that the thread title shouldn't be changed for the worse. In this case, it looks as though whomever changed it was mocking the TS.</p>

              <p>You even went to the extreme of going stomp where I'm at, to message me how do I get PES F, worth it or not seriously, Just bear with the remaining 18 months, It doesn't kill seriously, Just bear in mind that now you serve NS, you may have a chance of getting a better job in future. For me I just concentrate on how to tackle how the HR asks me whether or not I did serve NS.</p>
