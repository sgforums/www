              <p><br> I think I can adapt very well to living in USA. I am NOT dependent
              on my counselor - haven't I already said that he doesn't do much?
              But apparently I should try to MAKE him do more for me? Now the
              posts are just getting confusing. I do not think people who liken
              the army life to the outside world have a point - because the
              factors are so vastly different. I have studied in USA before, and
              I have enjoyed myself extremely well. I did not rely on my parents.
              Which is why i find myself so shocked that i am suddenly so
              dependent and depressed.</p>

              <p>Problems in the Army may be different from problems in the civillian world in terms of type, but when you look under the surface, the basis is really quite similar.</p>
              <p>You are not used to the culture in the Army, and neither are you used to the culture in another country. There will be bound to be adjustment problems either way. The key here is not about not having those problems, but how you deal with those problems. You can (and should) take it like a man, sit down, and think things true like the rational, educated man you make yourself out to be.</p>
              <p>So far, though, all you are doing is whining in one corner and coming up with 'solutions' that will never work. Seriously, what were you thinking when you thought of getting PES F, renouncing your citizenship, or joining the MDC? </p>
              <p>It is true that you seem to be overdependent on your counsellor, and it is also true that you should get more help from him. There is no paradox here. All it means is that you should be more proactive in helping <em>yourself</em>. Counselling is not a one-way street. <strong>You should be helping the counsellor help you. </strong>You should help yourself more by finding out about the cause of your problems and asking for better ways and means for the counsellor to help solve your problems instead of waiting for the counsellor to spoonfeed the answers to you. </p>
              <p>At the end of the day, if you don't want to help yourself, and you expect others to just spoonfeed the answers to you, you can't expect a lot of help. The army is not giving you problems; the problems are coming from within yourself. So the solutions to your problems have to come from within yourself.</p>
              <p>Think about it..... do you seriously think people are going to spoonfeed you on how you're going to live overseas on your own?</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>People have been giving you lots of good advice already.</p>
              <p>People have been telling you to be more proactive by finding out for yourself exactly what it is that is troubling you and how to get help to solve those problems.</p>
              <p>People have been telling you that this is all just a test of your ability to deal with a bad situation and making the most out of it.</p>
              <p>Seriously, what do you want people in this forum to do? Advise you on how to chao keng to get PES F? Advise you on how to jump ship and get foreign citizenship? You're the one who raised the points of PES F and foreign citizenship in your first post.</p>
              <p>As Bear has said, it is not just about 'lan lan suck thumb'. It is about dealing with problems that you cannot get rid of in life. If you cannot change your circumstances, then you have to change your <em>mindset</em> to those circumstances. Lots of people have it worse than you. If you think you are weaker in the mind than they are, then you have to get yourself to strengthen your mind.</p>
              <p>You cannot just expect people to spoonfeed you on how to do this. What do you want them to do? Bash you in the head and hope that your brain will reset its settings? You yourself have got to learn on how to be mentally stronger. If you have to, be proactive enough to <em>ask</em> your counsellor on how to be mentally stronger! By whining non-stop in here and trying to shoot down everyone's points, what do you hope to achieve?</p>
              <p>If you really cannot be proactive enough to change your mindset, then good luck to you, there is nothing anyone can do to help you. If you don't want to help yourself, even the biggest expert on earth can't do anything to help you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S. Problems in the Army are really just small stuff. No matter how much you plan your future life, there will be far worse problems than this. No joke.</p>

              <p>FYI, i served NS as an Infantry section commander in a
              battalion, and i encountered lots of guys with the same problems
              from trooper to clerks. Some hacked it out and served their 2
              years, some decide to beat the system by downgrading or AWOL. End
              of the day its their choice and not anyone else. They dont need
              chickenhawks who try to give them an enema of pro-military answers
              to which they dont need.</p>

              <p>1. It is not my policy to change topic titles. That would be the work of one of the other mods.</p>
              <p>2. People in here are not asking him to chop his dick off or anything like that. Rather, the TS himself raised the idea of getting PES F or jumping ship in his very first post.</p>

              <p>I see what is going on. You cannot adapt to the army culture and also the Singapore culture.</p>
              <p>I understand what is your problem as I have worked with US partner before.My US partner is screaming like hell when I ask him what book he is reading. As to him, it is considered private matters which is forbiddened to be asked. So I sort of understand, what the US is thinking and their culture. It is the tiny little things that build up. </p>
              <p>THere is alot things going on there.</p>
              <p>I think you need to voice out more to your boss on what you need as you 
                  have more problem than you have.And  there is no way, you change or you 
                  take it within a few months time or even a few years time. It is a culture thing.</p>
              <p>It is just like, people adress their parent/boss by their name in US, Singapore it is considered dammed rude. </p>
              <p>Very difficult and Challenging.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I agree dont anyhow change the title it will twist the meaning this thread,.</p>
              <p>I will take up the green card. if I was you, as there is nothing you have that is in singapore.</p>

              <p>seriousl speaking take everything more positive, you'll find NS more bearable. Everywhere had it's problem.</p>
              <p>I met people coming back from US to live in Singapore stating that the home insurance there is murderous so she decide to come back for good.</p>
              <p>NS is a part of life for all males whether you like it or not. Some people find it enjoyable some not. Well it's like that when army is one of the biggest organization in the world, the system cannot satisfied everyone. Even in big corporate some like it, some don't. That's life.</p>

              <p>Well, if the TS cannot be a PC then too bad...not everyone can be a PC. Mind you from what I heard from lot of the americans the home insurance can be very very ex. to cover lot of things. You/I never stayed there that long so u and I will not understand how much. But from what I heard it's cover everything. </p>
