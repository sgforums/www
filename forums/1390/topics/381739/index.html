              <p>Should NS be Reduced or Scrapped <br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>NATIONAL SERVICE<br><br>Introduction <br><br>National Service, or army conscription in Singapore, was first introduced in 1967 due to pressing issues such as national security after Singapore's "forced" independence in 1965. In 1971, the British completely pulled out of Singapore. It has been 41 years since the introduction of NS. <br><br>Since then the world and Asia has changed significantly in terms of security and economic arrangements. But has Singapore's conscription policy kept up with these changes to reflect and cope with the new geopolitical landscape?<br><br>First let us review the service that all able-bodied 18-year-old male Singaporeans have to undergo. Basic Military Training, or BMT, is the "boot camp" for all new recruits. This lasts for three months whereupon the soldier then gets posted out to other units for further specialised training. <br><br>The conscripts then serve the remainder of their two-year stint polishing up their combat skills. Following the two years of full-time service, NSmen are required (for up to 40 days a year) to serve in a part-tme capacity until they are 50 years old for commissioned officers and 40 for others. <br><br>Reduce the two-year full-time service<br><br>In an age where warfare has turned to "smart" technology, is it still logical and necessary for Singapore to insist that its National Servicemen undergo 24 months months of active, full-time service? Such a policy is rare among countries that maintain a conscription policy. Below is a list of countries with periods of full-time conscript service: <br><br>1.Austria (6 months) <br>2.Bolivia (12 months) <br>3.Brazil (9-12 months) <br>4.Denmark (4-12 months) <br>5.Estonia (8-11 months) <br>6.Finland (6-12 months) <br>7.Germany (9 months) <br>8.Greece (12 months) <br>9.Guatemala (12-24 months) <br>10.Moldavia (12 months) <br>11.Mongolia (12 months) <br>12.Paraguay (12-24 months) <br>13.Poland (9-12 months) <br>14.Serbia (6 months) <br>15.Switzerland (18-21 weeks)<br>16.Taiwan (12 months) <br>17.Tunisia (12 months) <br>18.Turkey (12 months) <br>19.Ukraine (12 months_ <br>20.Uzbekistan (12 months)<br><br>From the above data, it can be seen that for all intents and purposes a conscript army training programme need not be as long as the one we have in Singapore. The more advance countries like Austria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, and Switzerland all have full-time services limited to one year and less. <br><br>Even Taiwan, which has an identifiable enemy in the form of China, limits its active service to 12 months. Only countries like South Korea and Israel have conscription periods that are longer than Singapore's. These countries are, however, in a state of war.<br><br>Given the situation in Singapore there is no reason why we cannot employ more efficient training methods and reduce full-time NS from the present two-years to twelve months or less.</p>

              <div id="post_message_2483078">Reservist training<br><br>The current period of reserve training for NS men of up to 40 years old is also a burden on the servicemen and, by extension, the economy. Not only does the serviceman have to contend with the influx of foreigners, they are disadvantaged in terms of employment, remuneration and promotion when employers compare local men who have to be away for weeks in anyone year with foreign workers who have no such obligation.<br><br>The span of a serviceman's reservist training should not go beyond 30 years of age. Men tend to settle down and start families around this age and job stability and carreer prospects are essential during this period. Unfair competition from foreign nationals would handicap local males and add to their already stressful lifestyles. <br><br>In addition, the human body goes into a physical decline after the age of 30. To keep our military personnel in top condition, it makes little sense in keeping men over the age of 30 in the frontline if military conflict does indeed breakout. <br><br>Increase volunteer, professional army<br><br>To compensate for the decrease in the number of active and reservist NSmen, the Singapore Armed Forces should expand volunteer army recruitment to complement the reduction in the number of conscripts.<br><br>In fact, the number of countries that have scrapped conscription are on the rise: Argentina (1994), Belgium (1994), Czech Republic (2004), France (1996), Hungary (2004), Italy (2004), Netherlands (1996), New Zealand (1972), Portugal (2004), and Spain (2001). <br><br>While Singapore may not be ready to follow suit, it would be prudent for us to reduce NSmen in favour of a professional military outfit <br><br>At the moment, NSmen are exploited for their services to glorify the PAP during National Day parades. The energy and time of these men can be put to more productive use than as entertainment for the PAP regime. <br><br>Conscientious objectors <br><br>What about people who do not believe that it is right for them to do military service due to moral, religious or ethical grounds? At the moment such conscientious objectors are charged and imprisoned for the length of their service. <br><br>In some of the countries that have compulsory military service, there is also a provision for conscientious objectors to serve in non-combat roles. There is an argument that this would open the flood gates for men to opt for non-combat positions. Such a loophole can be plugged by increasing the length of active service by, say, six months. The experiences of other countries like Germany and Sweden have not been negative in this aspect where males try to avoid combat service by claiming to be conscientious objectors. <br><br>Tranparency and openness <br><br>Obligation in Singapore seems to be a one-way street. While the Government holds the people accountable for their NS liabilities, the Ministry of Defence remains non-transparent and non-accountable in their dealings with the public. <br><br>The recent deaths of National Servicemen have opened a can of worms on training safety. In addition, the number of training fatalities and injuries are not made known to the public as a matter-of-course. The Government which compels the people to give their lives for the country are obliged to be absolutely transparent with information pertaining to safety issues. Compensation for deaths and injuries must also be reviewed and revised upwards.<br><br>The Government must also not exploit NSmen as cheap labour during major events such as the WB-IMF meeting or, possibly, the upcoming Youth Olympics. In must be remembered that the Enlistment Act was enacted for a specific purpose and any detraction from that purpose must be shunned.<br><br>Conclusion <br><br>When citizens are forced to serve in the military with the possibility of being killed if called to war, it is imperative that the government is a democratic one where citizens can hold the government accountable for its decisions and actions. Otherwise we may end up in a situation where wars are waged for the ruling elite rather than for the security and sovereignty of the nation.<br><br><a href="http://forum.yoursdp.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #22229c;">http://forum.yoursdp.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=3</span></span></a></div>

              <p>Reservist IS a liability.</p>
              <p>No matter how the govt emphasizes that it recognizes the NSMan, and how companies participate willingly in the programme, it will always remain a problem for foreign organizations who pay lip service to this participation.</p>
              <p>A management personnel in the US firm that I served previously once questioned the need of having to lose personnel to reservist. Especially in an era where redundancy amongst workers' roles are falling (due to cost cutting measures), at a certain level, personnel no longer have backup when they go on their reservist training. As such, the tendency to want to hire foreigners (or 1st generation PRs) become stronger for organizations with minimal redundancy amongst workers.</p>
              <p>This is especially so for high-value positions, where organizations can ill afford to hire multiple highly-paid personnel with coverage of each other's roles.</p>
              <p>I ever was involved in a political tussle between the Europe office and SG office of an organization, where there were disagreements on which location to hire certain positions. So much so that reservist becomes a liability in such arguments.</p>

              <p>Surely men over the age of 30 still can fight at the front-line (30 is not that old can? In a few years I will be 30 :/ ). And volunteer recruitment is bound to fail.</p>
              <p>All in all I think this article is badly reasoned and justified, but I'm neutral to adjustment of the NS period. To me, the only negative point of NS is the huge economic cost; but the article didn't really elaborate on it and I am not prepared to comment further. My NS experience was fruitful and pleasant; in hindsight I am glad I experienced it.</p>

              <p>I am an NSman now. I'm not exactly an advocate for NS, but for Singapore, we really got no choice.</p>
              <p>Defence is always very important. I'm very sure every knows the boardgame "Risk"; No matter how friendly you are with other nations, if there is a moment of weakness, other nations will just eat you up.</p>
              <p>Big fish eats small fish. Its a cruel fact.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying that our neighbouring countries will invade us now, but being a Chili Padi, it makes them think twice before they do anything.</p>
              <p>You might ask, what's the reason forÂ any countryÂ to attack us? What I say, if there's any single benefit, I will attack, but depends on how costly.</p>
              <p>SAF invest so much, yet many people complaint if the forces are effective at all.</p>
              <p>Yet we never thought of that one thing, "Its the man, not the machine."</p>
              <p>"Machine" provided by the SAF gave us confidence that at least we got something decent to fight with against out enemy (although I am not supportive of all weaponries in the SAF).</p>
              <p>"Man" on the other hand, requires training. Yes, our training may be long. But when you are fighting against really professional armies, which trained 5-10 full years dedicating to military; you better think twice of what we are really against.</p>
              <p>With 2 years NSF, and 10 years part-time (amounting less than a year of training!) NSmen training, itsÂ  nothing at all. And remember, sometimes you slack most of the NSÂ times.</p>
              <p>Most countries have conscription, although not always active.Â Any nation can just drown us with their quantities of men in their armies. But training of men and technology makes a difference.</p>
              <p>We are in a strategic point between India and China, when trade passes.</p>
              <p>From history during Temasek, we know that, even ifÂ  they can't have us, they would simply destroy us.</p>
              <p>That's how "vunerable" we are.</p>

              <p>My suggestion is to build a good regular army where soldiers get paid in full and to shorten the NS and reservist training period for the rest.The SAF could easily think up a good recruitmentÂ programÂ that should include educational packages and otherÂ benefits to enlisteesÂ while expanding a professional army.</p>

              <p>Reservist training is important to make sure you stillÂ maintain someÂ reasonable skills you had learned when you were active.I have seen soldiers not knowing how to strip weapons or forgotten how to use them.Cant really blame someone who has been away for several years cuz these things do happen.</p>

              <p>I think should make those cannot study one, go FT NS for 5 years, teach them discipline and make them be more useful for the society.

              <p>Those who can study one, let them go on to the uni and forgo the FT NS. Waste our time only. We can contribute to the society more if we grad two years earlier.Â </p>
              <p>Image SAF to be a professional career,Â recruiting technical expertise, to fill up the need for technical specialist. &lt;- actually SAF is already doing now but need to do more. SAF have been giving a image that sign on is for those who cannot make it.</p>
              <p>Forgo reservist, it is not useful anyway. we will be moreÂ economicallyÂ useful at work.Â </p>

              <p>NS basically serves as a deterrence, something crucial esp in a small country like SG. However, the duration of NS can definitely be reduced.</p>
              <p>In modern warfare, everything is abt efficiency and power. With the amt of money dumped into the drain, to provide for the free healthcare in SAF, i'm sure that it can be put intoÂ better use.</p>
              <p>Srsly, the number of people/parents asking for specialist reviews/referrrals in SAF, is completely ridiculous. The reason? FREE healthcare system. Not to mention the fact that the money used is from the taxpayers. You, me and even the old uncles and aunties are paying for such referrals.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself, what's the point of NS? deterrence? Then, why do youÂ need it to be 2yrs? Ultimate waste of resource.</p>
