Anyway, the story goes that a recruit had a hard time sleeping due the hot weather so instead of sleeping on the bed, he went to sleep under the bed on the cold floor. Then early in the morning, he was awoken by the bed above sinking down and the springs touching on to him.<br><br>Thinking it must be his bunk mates coming to sleep on his bed, he wanted ask him to get off his bed. Before he could speak he heard<br><br>Girl "Ah ma, all the ppl sleeping liao"<br>Ah Ma "No still got ppl not sleeping."<br>Girl "Where?"<br>Ah Ma "The one under us"<br><br>As usual the recruit fainted.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway, I believe all the ghost story may be a simple strange ones that someone encountered such as seeing a shadow, hearing strange noise but over time, add spices, add oil, a simple "I heard strange noise" will become "someone saw a potianak flying all over the place"</div>
