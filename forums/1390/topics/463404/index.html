              <p><br>Your Employees as NSmen<br><br>People are the assets of Singapore. Our NSmen, your employees, make up 80% of our military defence and form the backbone of the Singapore Armed Forces. Every male citizen in Singapore is enrolled into National Service around the age of 18. They represent the collective will of our nation to stand up for itself and to ensure the security of the nation.<br><br>Within 6 months after an NSman ORDs, he will be assigned to a NS Unit. As an Operationally Ready NSman, your employee is required to undergo regular training to ensure that he is in optimal condition when called upon for the defence of our country. He is required to continue his active unit training cycle, for which a typical time frame will be 10 years, in appropriate areas deemed by Singapore Armed Forces.<br><br><br>Support for Employers<br><br>MINDEF/SAF relies on partnerships with employers in enhancing the operational readiness of the SAF. Your support for our NSmen does not go unnoticed and is important to us. In appreciation of your continual support, MINDEF introduced the Total Defence Awards (TDA) in 1986. This is one of our ways to recognise your strong support for our NSmen in fulfilling their NS commitments.<br><br><br>Be A Supportive Employer<br><br>Whether as individuals, corporations or organizations, we all have a part to play in Total Defence In committing to playing an active and constructive role in our society, you are demonstrating not only corporate social responsibility, you are showing commitment to and action for Total Defence.<br><br>We appreciate your partnership with us and encourage you to publicly pledge your support for National Defence.

At the same time, it allows NSmen an opportunity to rededicate themselves to the defence of Singapore.<br><br>This ceremony can be held either in-house, where you can gather with fellow NSmen colleagues and  pledge your commitment to defence together.<br><br>Or it can be a combined effort with other supporting employers, where all NSmen from different companies residing in the same area, namely CBD and South, East, North/North-East, and West, pledge your commitment together.<br><br>In recognition for your company’s efforts to organise the ceremony, MINDEF will provide you with the necessary items, which include:<br><br>    A Singapore flag and the National Anthem CD (on T-loan basis); and<br>    A copy of the SAF Day Video and SAF Day Message.<br><br>For assistance, please contact:<br>Tel: 6373 3208<br>Fax: 6373 3215<br><br>To see more details of the CRC, visit our Events section.</p>
