              <p>I hope this is relevant.

I've also heard from seniors, or see some people who recently enlisted into NS being quite slack/free after half a year (or maybe several months). They are able to take stuff like driving etc..</p>
              <p><br>Basically I'm asking this because my parents has allowed me to start learning cello after my Alevels. Which means, I learn for one month and then enter NS. Will I still have ample time to practice in this case? do I get to book out to practice? I'm not learning for leisure and I hope to achieve competitiveness as soon as possible. Though I am not aiming to be a musician in future and never will be, I hope to achieve grade 5-6 and above in one year. And grade 8 by the 2nd year. I will need about 1 hour of practice daily at least. <br><br>Also, I am also one of the freak cases who is taking grade 8 piano after one year of study in the instrument. I am preparing for my gr8 right now, along with my diploma repertoire which I intend to take the year I ROD from NS (2 years from now) and in my first year, I am taking my grade 8 exam. (2nd half of the year). I require about 2 hours per day at least.<br><br>So mainly my questions are 1) is booking out at a consistent basis possible? Like say after 5-6 Pm everyday? And after when do I get to go home daily? 2) do leaves for exams normally get approved? <br><br>Assume that I have enough interest to get me going.

              <p><br>More a case of being grossly misinformed and hearing opinions from only a small grp of people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Scape_Goat_Token,I suggest you read the stickies in this forum,especially those on BMT.Follow Redano's guidlines too.No,bmt is not 2 weeks only unless you happen to be PES E then you go for a one week air-con induction programme.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no fast and hard answers to your questions like what redano said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In short:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1)If you only count booking out on the weekends as consistent,then yes it is possible unless you are on guard duty or major exercise.If you mean consistent as in everyday,then it is VERY subjective as it depends on things like your vocation,superiors and unit's policy.BMT wise,you can forget about booking out everyday.In fact,you can consider yourself lucky if you manage to book out on Friday in BMT,I always book out on Saturday 1.00pm and book in Sunday 7.30pm during my batch.One important point to remember.....staying out is a PRIVILEGE not a RIGHT.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2)Another very subjective matter.If you do your job well and have a good working relationship with your bosses,they might even let you take off to go for the exam.In the end,it is up to your superiors as going for such things is NOT A RIGHT but a PRIVILEGE. They do not have to care if a person has studied hard for a particular exam as the servicemen is supposed to be serving full time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I remember got one clerk study some kind of accountancy course part time,his boss usually allowed him to go off earlier everyday to go for lessons but he did not allow him to go for final exam is it fell during a major exercise period and he needed manpower.Actually I think his boss might have let him go in the end if he had not said this to him "But Sir,I already told you I had exam during that time wa,even before you told me that there would be an exercise during that time.It is not fair,you should let me go."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>His boss face turned <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"> next.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One more thing,unless you are PES E,you don't ROD after that 2 years,it's ORD.</p>

                                          after half a year (or maybe several months). They are able to take

              </blockquote>
              <p>actually, after your BMT and you get post to unit, after like 8 months or so when you become lao-jiao, generally will be quite slack and free most of the time, unless your camp is those super-garang camps everyday training non-stop etc.....</p>
              <p>and those people who take stuff like driving do it in their spare time, and these guys are usually those stay-out ones.</p>

              <p><br> Basically I'm asking this because my parents has allowed me to
                                          start learning cello after my Alevels. Which means, I learn for one
                                          month and then enter NS. Will I still have ample time to practice
                                          in this case? do I get to book out to practice?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>after you first enter NS, which is the 2 - 3 months BMT, you will rarely get the chance to practice. Sure, you can practice after you book out (Sat), but the time is short, because u need to book in Sun.</p>
              <p>plus, the training will already tire you out.</p>
              <p>if you wanna practice, the only time would be after your BMT, where hopefully u get to stay-out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I will need about 1 hour of practice

              </blockquote>
              <p>not very possible to me, at least during your BMT.</p>
              <p>but if you get posted to stay-out camp, u can go home practice every night.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><br> So mainly my questions are 1) is booking out at a consistent basis
                                          possible? Like say after 5-6 Pm everyday? And after when do I get
                                          to go home daily? 2) do leaves for exams normally get
                                          approved?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>1) it's possible only if you get posted to stay-out units after BMT. For such units, you get to go home everyday like office hours, unless you got guard duty where you need to stay overnight.</p>
              <p>2) leaves for exams usually get approved, unless you always give OCs or superiors a lot of problem, but even then, it has a very high chance of getting approved.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Will I be fine with the work load in NS?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>i doubt you can even stay awake while practicing cello during weekeneds after all the BMT crap. it's way more tiring than any school workload and after all, NS is NOT school!!!!!</p>
              <p>basically, for your case, just hope that you get posted to stay-out camp.</p>
              <p>actually, you should have kenged a bit during CMPB check-up.......see lah......now get PES A, god also cannot save you.</p>
              <p>PES A usually is get posted to combat units, and combat units 99.999999% always stay-in.</p>
              <p>of course there's a chance you might get posted to stay-out units, but it may not be very high.</p>
              <p>the stay-out units are mainly the logistics units (supply and transport, ammo etc).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway, also cannot blame TS lah.......before i enter NS, i don't even know sergeants got different ranks and i didn't even know there's officers in the army......all i knew was sergeant, corporal, private, recruit......</p>
              <p>it was only after i got posted to my unit that i started to know what is 2LT, LTA, CPT etc.....</p>
              <p>if TS is good enough, he can apply for this......errr.......SAF Drama and Dance Company (if i remember the name correctly).</p>
              <p>that COY can excuse marching and everything and all they need to do during NS is perform on stage. :D</p>
              <p>good luck.</p>
