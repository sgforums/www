            <div class='col-md body'>I was surfing the net when I came across this steaming pile of crap. Worse, the title says "BCCT". I had thought that SAF unarmed combat training has moved on since its UC days, but apparently not.<br><br>Katas, One step sparrings, selfdefence against knives, board breakings, and general all round BULLSHIDO.<br><br>These guys have not been taught to fight. What they have been taught is ballroom dancing in camouflage fatigues.<br><br>Without further ado, I present <strong>SAF BULLSHIDO - THE NEXT EVOLUTION</strong><br><br><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=g74_0buoeG0&amp;search=SAF" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/watch?v=g74_0buoeG0&amp;search=SAF</a><br><br>I fear the SAF is beyond help now. Anyone care to tell me that the SAF takes training seriously?<br><br>Edit: Looks like 4 SIR.<br><br>Here is the depth of the problem:<br><blockquote>So besides the punishment, we learned many things.  Learned how to punch, block, kick, combinations of both or all 3.  Learned where all the vital points we have to hit.  Every Punch, Kick, or Block, we had to yell.  Then at the last 3 sessions we had to use our rifles.  We learned Side Butt Swing, Low Butt Stroke, High Butt Stroke, Forward Butt Smash.  Sounds painful when getting hit by them.  Also learn how to hit people while they are on the ground.  Basically BCCT taught us how to kill the enemy with our hands and rifles.</blockquote><a href="http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=zhong_cheung" rel="nofollow">http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=zhong_cheung</a><br><br>People are passing the course thinking they are now proficient in unarmed combat. That is, however, clearly far from the truth. As i said in an earlier post, the first time I had to spar with boxing gloves on in my Uni MA class, I was hit squarely in the eye. Why? Because I did not recognise the virtue of keeping your hands up. Because I was not taught the proper way to block a punch.<br><br>The SAF really really needs to be given a kick up its arse. This sort of shoddy training reflects very badly on the SAF as a whole. If the SAF cannot be bothered to train its soldiers properly in this instance, I think it is reasonable to conclude that the SAF does not train its soldiers properly period.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, keeping the hands up is VERY VERY important.  I learnt that the hard way too.  ANd they definitely did not teach me that in the BULLSHIDO CLOSE COMBAT TRAINING.<br><br>Agreed, the basic jabs, reverse, forward kicks, and sidekicks taught in BCCT is not enough to defend one self.  Its more like kick boxing aerobics to me when I attended it.  Fortunately, my batch still covered bayonet fighting.  Being on the service side, and still issued with the M-16S1, it was the most important yet most siong part of the syllabus (rubber tyres are invincible against bayonets).  Again, it may not be totally enough for real combat, but it beats trying to , punch, kick, trip another person to death.<br><br>If there is one thing I felt they didn teach enough in BCCT, it was staying mobile. Getting in and out of a person's hit distance.  All i remember was, standing, punching, kicking, taking one step, rinse n repeat.</div>

That is, however, clearly far from the truth. As i said in an earlier post, the first time I had to spar with boxing gloves on in my Uni MA class, I was hit squarely in the eye. Why? Because I did not recognise the virtue of keeping your hands up. Because I was not taught the proper way to block a punch.<br><br>The SAF really really needs to be given a kick up its arse. This sort of shoddy training reflects very badly on the SAF as a whole. If the SAF cannot be bothered to train its soldiers properly in this instance, I think it is reasonable to conclude that the SAF does not train its soldiers properly period.

It covers more or less what you will learn in your first 5-6 lessons when you just pick up any martial art (BMTC teaches this "course" in around 7 lessons). It just covers basic kicks and punches. Obviously, it's not meant to make anyone a kungfu master and from personal experience absolutely no one passes out from BMTC expecting to fight with just these skills.<br><br>More advanced techniques will be taught in Intermediate CCT &amp; Advanced CCT and even then SAF still encourages personnel to take up Taekwando (hence the Taekwando badge)</div>
