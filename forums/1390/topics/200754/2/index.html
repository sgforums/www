This sort of shoddy training reflects very badly on the SAF as a whole.

            <div class='col-md body'>I disagree that the rifle is all u need for modern combat.  In urban environments, contact may get so close that ur primary weapon, the rifle may be rendered inefficient in combat.  Or in some circumstances, firing the weapon may result in hitting civilian or wounding ur own buddy.<br><br>Hence proper close combat training is needed as a basic infantryman tool to overcome the situation when required.<br><br>Even in jungle combat, trenches when overrun become a testing ground of close combat training.  Similar to the reasons given above, enemy who overwhelm  your position and into your fire trench maybe in between u and ur buddy.  Shooting him may result in over penetration and wounding your own buddy.  The south koreans demonstrated how TKD was useful in such a situation during the vietnam war.  In some reported incidents, the korean infantrymen would engage the enemy in close hand to hand combat, attempting to gain the upper hand or pin the enemy down for his buddy to finish him of, with a rifle bullet.  More than often, the NVA or Vietcong, not as well trained as their Korean counter parts, were quickly overwhelmed and killed.<br><br>The ability to fight hand to hand is of utmost importance in soldiering.  The current BCCT package which I went thru (first few batch, we were told) , i see it as inadequate even as an introduction package.<br><br>Perhaps recruits passing out from BMT need not know how to break a person's neck in 1 swift and silent move, but they at least need to learn how to recognise, avoid or escape from such a move.<br><br>My philosophy is this. Learn to recognise before u learn to strike.  Therefore, u will learn the importance of the strike, and learn how strike effectively.  Perhaps i am being too critical on the training i recieved, (altho free also cannot like that wad), but I feel that punching and kicking air does not teach one how to fight and protect one self.  It needs to move into choreographed sparring initially, and in advanced packages, freestyle sparring with safety equipment.<br><br>If the SAF cares for its soldiers, it shud care to train them well to survive in combat. At the same time, telling those CCT instructors that they are to teach them how to fight hand to hand, not tekan them.  I remember spending half the time of our 1 hr lessons facing the floor... wtf.</div>

One of the things many martial arts practicioners face is that no matter how higly skilled we are, we just don't have that "killer instinct" needed in an all out street fight, much like what actual hand-to-hand combat will be like.<br><br>Hence the padded sticks was meant to train us to fight with aggression.  Altho I do agree that maybe shortening it to M16 length might give it an added dimension to the training.
