That is, however, clearly far from the truth. As i said in an earlier post, the first time I had to spar with boxing gloves on in my Uni MA class, I was hit squarely in the eye. Why? Because I did not recognise the virtue of keeping your hands up. Because I was not taught the proper way to block a punch.<br><br>The SAF really really needs to be given a kick up its arse. This sort of shoddy training reflects very badly on the SAF as a whole. If the SAF cannot be bothered to train its soldiers properly in this instance, I think it is reasonable to conclude that the SAF does not train its soldiers properly period.

It works in boxing because they do not have to worry about grappling and kicking.<br><br>Since this show how shallow is your proficiency in fighting, I believe you should leave it to those who KNOW what self-defense is all about.

            <div class='col-md body'>funny how our armed forces teach a whole lot of crap to our poor soldiers.<br>The few factors i find that why our soldiers learn crap is<br><br>One factor i guess the the budget they set aside for unarmed combat training is small.<br><br>Second factor is i guess they emphasize too much on the gun. Not handy when you become a prisoner of war.<br><br>Third. The people running the department do not specialize in the martial arts thus having limited knowledge.<br><br>Fourth. The man up there makes the decision, even if you ground men do not find the martial arts useful.<br><br>Lastly. Marketing. They choose martial arts that are marketed well. That doesn't prove that the martial art is effective.<br><br>Think about it, what martial art tournamnent is the closest you will ever get to a real fight. the answer MIXED MARTIAL ARTS or VALE TUDO or ULTIMATE FIGHTING.<br><br>So what this crap about learning other martial arts when mixed martial arts is the way to go.<br><br>If other arts were so effective then how come you never get a Wing Chun, Tae kwon Do or even a Krav Maga guy winning a fight.<br><br>Instead you get a Mixed Martial Arts guy who cross trains and win...........<br><br>So i conclude that mixed martial arts is the combat are of the future.<br><br></div>

If u get kicked in the ribs cos u keep ur arms up, it means u are standing too "square" to ur opponent.  Always the side, and arms up. Never present ur shoulders square to the opponent.

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, at the end of the day, we need to compare apples with apples.  We can't compare our martial arts training with professional arms like the US Marine Corps, Korean army, etc.  We are a conscript army, and most of us serve 2 years (or old birls like me) 2.5 years.  Hardly enough time to train up in unarm combat effectively.<br><br>Heck, I trained in TKD for 10 years (3 - 5 times a week), and still think I have a long way to go (altho I stopped a while ago) when you talk about kill or be killed situations.<br><br>Maybe more realistic is we ask, what about the other conscript armys, what do they train, and are they really that good as well?  Anyone know what the Swiss do and how good they are at it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A lot of people keep trying to justify the nonsense taught to soldiers on the basis that there is a lack of time.<br><br>As I noted above, that is a very flawed argument. It is precisely because there is a lack of time that the SAF needs to be given a boot up its arse. Let's say, for eg, that the SAF UC package consists of 16 * 2 hr lessons (It is more in reality - I think).<br><br>Take away the katas, take away the wrist locks/takedowns, take away the asinine emphasis of how loud soldiers can holler, and you will have much more time to concentrate on what works.<br><br>The SAF has a great advantage here in that its soldiers have a reasonable level of fitness and flexibility. Yet, imo, the average student who have trained in a civvy mma gym for the same period of time would slaughter the average UC graduate. Why? The answer is that the civvy gyms employ superior training methods.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br><br>I used to be a UC instructor during my army days (loooong ago).<br><br>I fully agree with you that what's taught in UC class is mostly bullshit. Most of the stuff will never work in real life.<br><br>There were 2 directives, or priorities in why soldiers are trained in UC, and this is what instructers had to keep in mind.<br><br>First and foremost, the most important reason why soldiers train in UC is to help develop aggression and a fighting spirit in them. The ability and desire to want to close with the enemy. After all, if you have your rifle and a bayonet, why the hell will you want to fight empty hand.<br><br>The second, and less important goal, is to learn how to fight hand-to-hand.<br><br>The only things I found workable in the UC syllabus was the reaping throw (osoto-gari in judo?) and perhaps the hip throw.<br><br>Selection for instructors was mostly done from people who studied TKD. And we all know how good TKD is for actual fighting (its useless in case you're wondering). Even I as an instructor cannot make it work for myself, I don't want to talk about the students.<br><br>I'm sure the korean TKD people can probably kick some butt, but I've got a black belt in TKD and I can't kick my way out of a 7-11 full of old grannies to save my butt. It just doesn't work for me. My training consisted of 98% punching/kicking the air, doing katas and other silly 3-step sparring drills that had little resemblance to real life, and 2% sparring.<br><br>I have several theories on why this bullshit continues to be taught in the SAF.<br><br>1) The govt. does not want to train all male citizens in a skill that can really work to maim, kill or hurt. The majority of us become civilians after our time in service. If all of us are trained killers, we're going to have a social problem on our hands.<br><br>2) The people in charge of this don't know any better. The regulars I knew who ran the show during my time were all bozo deadbeat losers anyway. They were good in TKD, but I don't think many of them has ever been in a street fight, not to mention in a kill or get killed situation. Those that do may not have the gumption to go the way to see things change, or are not in the position to effect this change.<br><br>3) To train people to be effective in a fight, you're going to need to let them fight full contact regularly, or at least train effective drills over and over and over. It's as simple as that. If you let people go at it, you're going to get injuries. And the mamas and papas don't want to see boy boy going home with a black eye or a broken nose do they? And I'm not talking about no punching to the head, no kneeing to the groin bullshit. I mean everything goes, but with guards and protective gear of course (perhaps to the exclusion of eye jabs). And we know how SAF feels about injuries and accidents.<br><br>4) It's going to cost a lot of money to buy gloves for every soldier, mouth pieces, head guards, shin guards, belly guards and groin cups. Not to mention you'll need a lot of trained instructors to supervise the full contact sparring sessions.<br><br>Any kind of "martial art" that is not tried on a trained, fully resisting opponent in a full-contact, anything goes situation just isn't going to work squat in the streets. That is why I read in another thread about someone who learned TKD? but will just "anyhow swing" in a real street brawl. This is because what you're learning is not realistic or applicable to real life.<br><br>Let me just take boxing for example. Boxing is actually a highly scientific art. A good boxer will beat an "anyhow swing" untrained person any time. A seasoned boxer's head is hard to hit, because first, he covers up, his chin is down so you can't knock him out easily, and he's always moving his head. Even when he's punching, his punching arm is covering his head, and you can't hook him easily. He's trained to always keep his hands up, and has good reflexes. He is also used to taking shots to the head and body. He's going to be able to beat most of the untrained people out there in a fight. Most importantly, his punches are going to pack knockout power.<br><br>Full contact sparring teaches you two things.<br><br>First, it teaches you to be down to earth, and forget about all your fancy hollywood moves you see in the movies or you're going to get your butt kicked. It may work on an untrained person, or your training partner who's not very good at fighting, but it sure isn't going to work on someone who's good at stand-up fighting.<br><br>Second it teaches you the vital timing to make your tools (punches, elbows, knees, kicks, chops, palms, etc.) work for you. Third, it gets you used to getting hit.<br><br>The third point is very important. If you're training and living in a make belief world, and in a real fight you get socked in the head a couple of times, you're not going to be able to continue unless you can take a hit and go on.<br><br>I know this is politically incorrect, but all the akido and TKD guys (I was one of them in the past!) if they ever get into the unfortunate experience of landing themselves in a place where they have to defend themselves are going to wake up to a really shocking truth. I've been in a fight before, so I know what it's like. Your opponent is definitely not going to stick his hand out for you to grab.<br><br>Any fighting art that has full-contact, uncorporative sparring as 90% or even 100% as its core curriculum is going to beat everything else that is done with a compliant partner. These are the arts that will really work. Kyukoshin karate, muay thai, boxing, BJJ, shan shou, etc. Add to that some dirty street fighting techniques and practical weapon counters, and you're good to go.<br><br>I spent a long time finding out what works and what doesn't. My advice to fellow martial artists interested in real self defense is this:<br><br>Don't waste time arguing with people on a forum. Put on some boxing gloves, mouth piece, groin cup, some body protection if you like, shin guards, and invite people from other martial arts for a friendly full-contact sparring session and find out for yourselves. You'll find out very quickly if your "art" works, or is just pure bullshido.<br><br>If you're doing it because of excercise, beauty, etc. its fine, but if you're doing it for self defense, you've got to test it out before you need to use it.<br><br></div>
