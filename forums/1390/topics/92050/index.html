            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">from the straits time interavtive, 020904</span><br><br><strong>Improved combat system weighs less but is more rugged, has more lethal firepower and comes with voice recognition instead of buttons.</strong><br><br>By David Boey<br><br><img src="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-09-02/h6.jpg"><br><br>THE Singapore Armed Forces' (SAF) vision of transforming each infantry soldier into a warrior of the future - armed with lethal firepower and sensors that allow him to fight at night - has moved a step closer to reality.<br><br>The SAR-21 rifle now uses sensors that are 3 kg lighter.<br>The Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA), which manages weapons programmes for the Ministry of Defence and SAF, said yesterday that initial trials of the Advanced Combat Man System have shown key reductions in weight and improvements in reliability over previous equipment.<br><br>The improved system - which includes weapons, sensors and equipment that future soldiers may carry into battle - will be showcased at the Safti Military Institute at this weekend's Army Open House, said the Ministry of Defence yesterday.<br><br>Lieutenant-Colonel Jason Lim from Headquarters Armour, which is organising the event's Army Transformation exhibits, said: 'The soldier of the SAF's third-generation fighting force must be able to see better, sense better, shoot better and survive better.'<br><br>The public got its first glimpse of what future SAF infantrymen will be armed with at the last Army Open House in 2002.<br><br>DSTA project manager Choo Hui Wei said two years of development have allowed DSTA to cut down the weight of the load that soldiers have to carry by some 20 per cent.<br><br>'The weight of the system will not only affect the mobility of the soldier, it will inevitably affect the soldier's fighting capabilities,' he said.<br><br>Mr Choo added that a challenge was to provide soldiers with enhanced capabilities to communicate with one another and deliver more lethal firepower 'without adding extra weight, and where possible, even taking weight off the soldiers'.<br><br>The project team's target: to keep the weight of weapons and equipment a soldier has to lug around to 'less than one-third of an average soldier's body weight'.<br><br>To do so entails a balancing act, Mr Choo said, as the team has to design the whole system so that it is compact and yet its fighting capabilities are not compromised.<br><br>Weight issues aside, Mr Choo said the improved system uses 'voice recognition in place of buttons and keys' to exchange data with other soldiers.<br><br>'It has made it more intuitive for the soldier, as he can now use it just like talking to his buddy.'<br><br>He added that the system has also been made more rugged to withstand stresses on the battlefield and rough handling, and more user-friendly.<br><br>One of the key areas where weight has been cut is the Singapore-made SAR-21 assault rifle, which is the standard rifle that infantrymen now carry.<br><br>Back in 2002, sensors and weapon sights were added to the rifle to improve its accuracy, but this raised its weight to more than 8kg.<br><br>The new version is 3kg lighter as it uses sensors which are less bulky and lighter, Mr Choo said.<br><br>The additional sensors fitted to the weapon allow soldiers to shoot around corners with the help of a TV camera attached under the gun barrel. Night-vision equipment allows soldiers to fight in complete darkness without using visible light.<br><br>'With enhanced superior knowledge and precision engagement capabilities, our future warrior's situational awareness is raised and their survivability is enhanced,' he added.<br><br>'Given the knowledge of the enemies' whereabouts, the soldier will have the ability to execute precise tactical engagement before being engaged by the enemy.'</div>
