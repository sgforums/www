              <p>I don't know where you got your info about PES E NSFs shredding
              paper in the army. we do real work and that means actual hands on
              clerical work. Most of the times it's even more than what you see
              the camp DXOs and chief clerks doing. so 'mental' problems don't
              just trigger while we're 'snoozing' at camp. When you have clueless
              Officers and WOs overworking you like you are cattle and then at
              the same time treat you like some lesser human being, you try to
              imagine what that does for your state of mind. I've seen perfectly
              able minded people breaking down in that kind of environment.</p>
              <p>I'm sure employer would ask in which case just be honest. which
              someoen earlier pointed out is the best thing to do rather than
              hide it. at the end of the day it comes down to what your value is
              in the real world.</p>
              <p>i think too manny people have been brainwashed into thinking
              taht if you are highly regarded in NS you will be equally
              'big-shot' in the real world. I know more officers who are working
              in handphone shops and hawker centres than fellow PES E enlistees
              most of whom are doing well. I know one who is a lawyer now.</p>
              <p><br> With so many FTs around you think superior NS status has any value
              in your job prospects? imagine ur an employer who has to lose your
              employee for several weeks in a year for reservist etc. you know
              how detrimental that is to productivity? What are your thoughts on
              this?</p>
              <p>I think realistically it's time to reduce NS to just 1 year or
              6mths. 2 years is not helping our men stay competitive. for us guys
              who enter university it's even worse cos we go in feeling like
              sotong having forgotten everything we learnt. then by the time we
              graduate and start working and stabilise our career we are nearing
              30. how to even think of marriage?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>well, I suppose if your "perfectly able minded people" were to be placed in a combat unit, they would probably blow their brains out at the next live fire exercise already. Remember kid, while you're sitting behind your desk in an airconditioned office, being stressed out by "clueless clerks and warrants" others are out there sweating in the sun and mud and rain, sleeping on the ground, feeding mozzies, running around shouting bang bang bang for days on end, all the while under a cloud of shouted instructions and hokkien expletives. You think you're stressed ?</p>
              <p>And of course, you are absolutely correct, being a big fark in NS doesn't mean you'll be a big fark in the real world, it is certainly true that plenty of NS small farks made it bigger than the NS big farks of their time too.</p>
              <p>However, you've totally missed the point. What, do you think, are the real ingredients that enables people to make it big outside, in the real world ? Do YOU think you have it ? You, who've cracked under the strain of an NS office environment ? Do you think you've got what it takes to survive out there in the real world jungle out there ? Office politics out there are played for real stakes you know, your job, promotion, salary, bonus, career, etc. And you're right, how can you even think of marriage ? A relationship can be a very stressful thing too you know, would you crack under the strain ? And I've always imagined that women would want, if not a physically tough man, then definitely, at least a mentally tough one, cos which woman would want a feeble minded partner that needs taking care of, instead of taking care of them in turn ?</p>
              <p>So really, if that's your real condition, my sincere condolences to you, I think you're pretty screwed.</p>
              <p>However, just in case you were chao kenging, let's look at things from another perspective shall we ? You are PES E9L9 now, which means you're already excempted from IPPT and reservist duties, the two biggest bane of NSmen. So what, really, do you want to downgrade to PES F for ? Just for the sake of a few months off your remaining time left in NS ?knowing how slowly the wheels of the SAF turns, it would probably be around your actual ORD date before you'd get your PES F anyways. So it would be a waste of time anyways. But meanwhile, you'd get no certificate of service, and you'd have to deal with uncomfortable questions from employers in the future. Of course, that means no civil service jobs for you as well. Do you have this feeling of being taken for a ride ?</p>
              <p>so think about that kid. who's really having the last laugh here ? ...</p>
              <p>good luck on getting your pes F.</p>

              <p>but I think I can certainly assume that my points have hit home, haven't they ? Especially about you wanting to get married, perhaps it's best that you remove yourself from the gene pool. I mean, c'mon dude, for sure, you'd not hesitate to proclaim that you have "mental problems" to the SAF to keng from your service,  but YOU know, that this would not be something you'd proclaim to the outside world, no ? If a girl you've just met knows you're a bit of a mental whacko, do you imagine that she'd want to take things further with you ? And of course, YOU know, that this would be something that may just bite back at you in the civvy street, don't you ? Isn't that why you've started this thread in the first place ? To seek affirmation for yourself, to want other guys to tell you that hey ! maybe "my future employers won't find out I was discharged from NS with mental problems", no ?</p>
              <p>of course, NS is nothing like the real world outside, just as an internship with some goverment linked concern, is nothing like a real job my boy. And since it's the goverment sector you seem interested in, here's a further point for you. the pay scales are different for those who have completed NS and those who haven't. </p>
              <p>envy ? lol, no dude, I feel sorry for you. You're the one with "mental problems" after all. But have you given some thoughts to my second point ? You have already served two years before you disrupted your service. Under the new service scheme, you'd have ORD'ed already. But no ! You'll be getting discharged from NS after serving same length of time as the newer batches of kids, but you won't be getting a certificate of service for your time, you won't be marked as having completed your NS, and you'd be marked as someone with "mental problems" in your records ....all that despite having served the same two years as the other kids ....  it's your own life boy, but like I said, who's really being taken for a ride here ? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>So, are my words aggravating your mental condition ? Are your bananas going off ?</p>

              <p>TS is having social stress disorder. That is in layman terms prefer to be alone, does not like to interact or socialize with other people. Some people is in fear of being alone, so they like to stay with friends, they express themselves, and feel comfortable with others, like herd animals, such as school of fishes, horses. On the other extreme, some people like to be alone, dont like to interact with people, cannot work in team, like praying mantis. </p>
              <p>So the combat stress/working stress as a clerk or soldier has nothing to do with the problem that TS is having or facing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Social stress disorder can be corrected slowly is not a terminal illness. It is just that some people like to be loner, hermit living in a mountain.</p>
              <p>Most saints, seers, great wise man, high level master usually have this problem. They like to live in the high mountain.</p>
