            <div class='col-md body'><p>hi just need some advise on my situation.<br><br><br>im pes E9L9 and completed 2 years of service. but i disrupted to go studies and now have few more months left to serve. im about to be downgraded to PES F. im ok with that since its very disruptive to go back but im worried about future job prospects. i have uni education (ntu/nus/smu) and come from top school and i have work experience too including internship at govt linked places. ironically none of those places ever asked of my NS background then. just a small box asking for my status which i usually tick deferred and write pes E9L9, or sometimes i write exempted. no one even follows up on it and asks me whats wrong.<br><br><br>i saw some of the other postings and there are ppl saying its impossible to get job etc. is this true or just rumours? anyone knows of this happening first hand whereby someone with PES F is rejected for a job due to med condition? i would think with so many foreigners around no one really goes into details abt NS matters anymore. unless ur PES F is a very serious case. mine is actually due a form of anxiety disorder/social stress disorder. its not severity of it but rather SAF environment is not suitable for me. anyone who's served NS would know why. some advise will help. thanks.<br></p></div>

              <p>It is not impossible to get a job with PES F..... it's just that it <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">may</span></em> make it more difficult for you.</p>
              <p>A prospective employer would want to know why you got PES F, and you can't blame them for that. If the SAF, with all of its manpower constraints, doesn't even want to take you on as a low-cost clerk, then prospective employers would want to know why.</p>
              <p>Take note that you should fill out any and all employment forms as honestly as you can. While they may not necessarily conduct full background checks, any wilful dishonesty in your application that is discovered later on can be grounds for instant termination.Â </p>

              <p>humm it does. If you are Pes F or E, you cannot declare your medical history with "NO" all the way your application form.</p>
              <p>So you see that there is a conflict there in your application form. AndÂ obviously, people dont want to hire a "siao" one into their team. And this medical history and pes status, affect the insurance policy -&gt; the cost of individual employee -&gt; the department medical cost and .... so it is very important. It affect alot of things.Â </p>
              <p>So good luck. "siao" one.Â </p>

              <p>wouldn't you suppose the employers would be interested in knowing why ?</p>
              <p>frankly, if you're a PES E NSF lobo shredding papers or snoozing in a storeroom somewhere, and that triggers some anxiety or mental disorder in you, how would you survive a real boss in the real world outside ?</p>

              <p>I don't know where you got your info about PES E NSFs shredding paper in the army. we do real work and that means actual hands on clerical work. Most of the times it's even more than what you see the camp DXOs and chief clerks doing. so 'mental' problems don't just trigger while we're 'snoozing' at camp. When you have clueless Officers and WOs overworking you like you are cattle and then at the same time treat you like some lesser human being, you try to imagine what that does for your state of mind. I've seen perfectly able minded people breaking down in that kind of environment.</p>
              <p>I'm sure employer would ask in which case just be honest. which someoen earlier pointed out is the best thing to do rather than hide it. at the end of the day it comes down to what your value is in the real world.</p>
              <p>i think too manny people have been brainwashed into thinking taht if you are highly regarded in NS you will be equally 'big-shot' in the real world. I know more officers who are working in handphone shops and hawker centres than fellow PES E enlistees most of whom are doing well. I know one who is a lawyer now.</p>
              <p><br>With so many FTs around you think superior NS status has any value in your job prospects? imagine ur an employer who has to lose your employee for several weeks in a year for reservist etc. you know how detrimental that is to productivity? What are your thoughts on this?</p>
              <p>I think realistically it's time to reduce NS to just 1 year or 6mths. 2 years is not helping our men stay competitive. for us guys who enter university it's even worse cos we go in feeling like sotong having forgotten everything we learnt. then by the time we graduate and start working and stabilise our career we are nearing 30. how to even think of marriage?</p>

              <p>it is nt v correct to say clerk in SAF do not have stress and they just shred paper.</p>
              <p>Most of the combat fit soldiers will think this way but it is not true.</p>
              <p>Clerk is just like working in office, and they do have to deal with politics and some have to deal with heavy workloads</p>
