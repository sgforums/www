Come on, SOC training is a small taste of what soldiers are to expect out there in the jungle during wartime. Running and clearing obstacles in SBO attire just isn't the same as running a few rounds around a bitumen track.<br><br>While the level of training in the SAF should not have questionable safety standards, surely there must be minimum standard for our soldiers to be lethal and competent enough for war..... It just seems that this 'minimum standard' is dropping all the time.... at the expense of lethality and competency, I fear.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why i think SOC is good for soldiers:<br><br>1. It teaches soldiers to clear obtacles and lets them practice the range of motions needed to clear said obstacels. Now, it is true that you won't see those obtacles outfield, but the things that SOC teaches (balance, gripping power, proper landing, rope climbing) is still valuable. Eg. in brunei, you will need to cross rivers using a log placed across the river .<br><br>2. It is a great workout! And imo, more realistic than 2.4. If your gonna scrap somehting, scrap 2.4.<br><br>3. coz i did it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You cannot always pander to the lowest common denominator.Scrapping SOC is just wrong.BMT is about basic military skills, and SOC is a obstacle course which may reflect common urban obstacles.In the event of disaster, some form of SOC awareness may save your life too.It's alright if a person is not physically able to do SOC, but it should never be scrapped from the curriculum based on some misguided notion that it's a waste of time and manpower, defence organisations were never meant to be profit-oriented, be it manpower wise or monetary wise.<br><br>Why the Army is increasingly run like a corporation with all the office politics is something that we laymen may never know...</div>

Maybe its part of the SAF 3G restructuring.I don't really think the removing of SOC from BMT (if it was true) got to do with the incidents back in 2003. It might just more quicker that people who don't need to learn SOC or other essential skills like fieldcamps to just learn the rudimentary details of army and get posted to their respective vocations. The majority of us will still get posted back to combat vocations and we just train from then on.Like most of you ppl said that after BMT, those earmarked for commander school, be it SISPEC and OCS, they will spend 1 mth in tekong doing some leadership training to observe them closely ? They can still run SOC during this period right ? 1 mth ..2twice a wk, wk 4 will be the test..lagi xiong  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Just like Log PT and Bayonet fighting that were replaced with other forms of training.</div>

KILL!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Anyway, regardless of whatever rabbits the SAF may be pulling out of their magic hats, the bottom line is that I sure hope they know what they're doing (assuming that this news regarding SOC is true). Sure, SOC may cause injuries, but come on, what activity in the SAF doesn't?<br><br>You can still get heat stroke while doing IPPT. You can still break a few bones while doing unarmed combat. Heck, I literally got a concussion when one of my commanders whacked the back of my head with a pogo stick during UC. (It wasn't that serious, most people just lost respect for him after that.) Are we going to sacrifice all that as well?<br><br>The plain and simple truth is that BMT training is getting wimpier and wimpier. Admit it everyone, that's the truth. Just as I thought that the SAF has scratched the bottom of the barrel by implementing the 'maximum 20-push ups' rule in Tekong, they HAVE to punch through the base of the barrel with this. Sheesh.<br><br>Someone please tell me that this piece of news isn't true.....<br><br></div>
