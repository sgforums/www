            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys<br><br>I have ICT coming up from Dec 11th(next Mon)-Dec 22nd. Today, I was offered a job and was asked to start tmr. I told my boss abt my reservist n he said that he will write a deferment letter for me. So I`ll still be starting my new job tmr. But I understand that it will take 2 weeks for the deferment process to complete. So seeing mine as an urgent matter with 1 week to ICT, will it be possible to get deferred on time? Tmr,I`m faxing my supporting docs to CMPB..hopefully something gd will come out of it.<br><br>This job I got..I consider myself lucky cos I have not been able to secure a full-time job for the past few months until NOW. And I cant let this opportunity slip thru my fingers. I`m worried that he will nvr let me wait till my reservist finish and will give it to sumbody else. It has been so bloody difficult to find a job.<br><br>Do I still stand a chance of getting deferred? Or is there anyway I can fax it straight to CO himself?</div>

If your deferment process is not complete by the time of your ICT, request time off from your work and go report for ICT in the morning. Meet up with your CO and explain it to him with the relevant documents and proof.<br><br>Most of the time, CO will allow you to leave. Unless the ICT is super important.</div>
