Everytime I put it on I start to perspire.. whether it's a cool breezy day or a hot humid one.<br><br>As for patents (actually it should be copyrights since it is actually a designa nd not strictly speaking an idea) and property of SAF tags, our uniform is pretty easy to distinguish versus others.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think its about time SAF do something about this. There is once where one of the Chinese National construction workers who sat behind a small lorry wore a top No.4 uniform. At first the guard comdr thought he is one of our people but later recognise him as a foreigner. Sometimes these construction companies want to save time and avoid changing pass. Imagine if he is a terrorist!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
