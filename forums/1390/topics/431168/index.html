              Hello all,
              
              I'm a second year NSF, a corporal Signal Operator. I have been thinking of a career with the Navy since my polytechnic days but decided not to pull the trigger until I experienced BMT and unit life. The two years spent has been fruitful in experiencing the SAF culture and despite all the problems and issues with the system, I find that I can cope. 
              
              I would like to find out from the forum about life in the Navy, especially about the dirty work, what is expected of you and what skills is a must have to excel in that environment. I will be looking to enter at the Electrical Engineering role. (I have a EEE dip, looking to further my studies first) 
              
              Please, no embellishments. I have enough of gloosy posters and sweet talking recruiting officers to know most of it is talk. But, I also would like to know the high points in such a career. 
              
              Any relevant inputs will be much appreciated and I thank the forum-er in advance.

              <p>Signing on with an EEE diploma, you'd most likely be under the MDES scheme as an Electrical and Control Specialist. There are two main groups on a ship - the "techs" and the "seamen" - and you'd be firmly in the former.</p>
              <p>As a tech, you'd be spending lots of time in the engine room making sure things work. The engine room is a noisy, warm and humid place when you're actually working in it (though you may spend your watches in an air-con control room when everything is running smoothly). Expect to have to get sweaty and grimy whenever a job needs to be done. The upside is that you don't often have to go out and melt under the sun like the seamen do.</p>
              <p>As an ECS you're responsible for keeping electrical systems running - this means everything from the generators and switchboards up to fixing domestic lighting, air conditioning and electrical supplies to weapons and combat systems.</p>
              <p>Techs are expected to be at the forefront of shipboard firefighting and damage control, so expect to train a fair bit in the DCBA suit (imagine the chemical defence suit, if you've ever worn that before, but with air tank instead of filter mask).</p>
              <p>Like anyone else in the SAF, you have to do duty. This includes weekends and public holidays. There's also sailing, which may sometimes burn your weekends and holidays too. When not sailing or on duty, you will definitely be stay-out.</p>
              <p>The high points in a navy career would come from being out at sea (dolphins, stars, and the like, which as a tech unfortunately you'd be seeing less of) and shore leave when the ship travels overseas.</p>

              Thank you for your reply, it was informative and helpful. Does anyone know about shore duties / shore postings and the criteria to get into the silent service (submarines)?
              
              I'll be taking up a degree before entering the service, would that qualify me for an engineering officer (ME4) role as opposed to a technician (ME1) post? 
              
              Thanks again for the help.

              <p>a good and recognized relevant diploma results coupled with good O levels, especially in maths and science would be the pre-requisite for career as engineering officer...degree is not necessary but it must first of all be NUS/ NTU degree and not any part time distance learning sort...</p>
              <p>most importantly is your integrity, leadership and physical stamina qualities that differentiates you from the rest</p>

              <p>Base duties are essentially the maintainence engineers, logistics or ammunition squad.</p>
              <p>Criteria for submariners, just ask the CO. It might help if you know how to play floorball. </p>
              <p>If you are taking the degree? then wait until you grad then you ask.You dont get back the 2 years of NSF pay if you sign on after uni.</p>
