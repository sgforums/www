During my time, Transit Road had those "mama" shops selling cheap goods. A year or so after my ROD, they built better shophouses for those guys. I think they are still there, as during my reservist in the 1990s, I went to a camp nearby to draw ammo and passed by Nee Soon.<br><br>I was in SBMT 2nd Wing and my office was in Echo Coy near the Muslim cookhouse. I wonder if it is still there?  Facing the Officers' Mess.  One day, when I was in the platoon office, gazing out of the balcony, I saw a old British couple (man and wife... around 60 years old). They were walking along looking at the buildings. I guessed he was an ex-British army serviceman. I went down to say "hello" , since they were already loitering outside the company line. He told me he served there in the 1950s and actually  Echo Coy barracks was the cookhouse staff barracks,  which explained why we had some stuff we found in the building.  He was quite amazed that in the 1980s , very little had changed. Some new training sheds were built but not much changes.</div>
