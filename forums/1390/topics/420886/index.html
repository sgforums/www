              <p>Hi forum , new comer here .<br>I have several questions regarding Napfa Test. I have read several posts regarding the stated topic but i still have several doubts.</p>
              <p>Written below , it mentions that i need to take my napfa 2 weeks before enlistment date. What does the enlistment date mean ? Im a poly DASE student graduating this year and from what i heard, i need to attain a silver for my napfa by the end of feb ? Does it mean enlisting date is around 2nd week of march ?</p>
              <p>Im afraid i don't have enough time to get a silver for my napfa.<br>Reaching goal of 2.4km but pull-ups are my weakness.<br>Again, the question is, napfa 'deadline' = feb ?</p>
              <p>Hope the forums can enlighten me on this issue :)</p>

              <p>u can choose not to do ur napfa as it isnt really compulsory.. except that if you don't do it, or fail to get a silver, you'll be enlisted in the Physical Training Phase (PTP) batch, where the first few weeks is mainly focused on physical training to get your fitness up to a satisfactory level.</p>
              <p>as for enlistment date, you'll know it when you receive your letter. usually ur enlistment date is 2 months after receiving the letter, but it may vary.</p>

              <p>I think if you miss your napfa, can take at toa payoh stadium also? Not sure about that though but you can call cmpb to double check.</p>
              <p>They will send you an enlistment letter, eg enlist 24 july 2011. The latest you can take your ippt is 2 weeks before 24 July 2011.</p>
