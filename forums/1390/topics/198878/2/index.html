            <div class='col-md body'>I personally think we should review the way we vocation the soldiers into the various vocations. We should stop the "any how take, one size fits all" type of selection. This have serious caused many people from being misplaced into vocations inwhich they are not suitable for, either mentally or physically. i have read from the other military forums and have notice this interesing topic.<br><br>There was this guy from Finland, in which their country practices conscription, and their pool of professionals are reality similar to Singapore. He was from the Guards Jaeger brigade, which is like our Guards formation which is like a RDF fromation. He says that his unit selects soldiers from the reservist or soldiers whom have served for quite some time. The selection criteria is not mainly on physical strength but more on how mentally matured the individual is.......<br>I think this type of selection is better. I think we should get the CO personally down to BMTC to choose the ppls that are suitable for the vocation, not based on some lame PC interview or CMPB computer psycho-analysis system. Units should also choose peoples based not on how fit they are, but rather, how interested or committed he is in a particular vocation. Honestly speaking, I feel that some peoples are veri immature and mentally unfit for some vocation.</div>

THAT would be pure stupidity.<br><br>We're just saying that there is a issue with the process that promotes so many people to be 3SGs or above based on their education, when there are many people who would make better combat or technical leaders who might not have that "pre-requisite" A level or polytechnic certificate when they are conscripted.<br><br>I'm glad that your unit is good enough to recognize its men and promote them.  The other issue raised here is <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>not enough</strong></span> units do so.<br><br>Sure there are lots of people there who might not want to promoted to take on more responsibilities.  But then how many guys if given a choice would willing do NS in the 1st place?  We are talking about who would make better leaders for the sake of the military.  Not about who wants to.</div>

However the standard of most regulars are disappointing.<br><br>Another point to note: It would be hard for a non A leve/poly guy to be able to grasp AOP/Topo/Technical stuff on top of doing things like safety planning, RMP/RAWR, write out lesson plans and design exercises, conduct training and write admin instructions. Remember, there is a training/administrative side of army, not just the exercise/warfare side.</div></blockquote>You don't need to go through BSLC to become a CPL.  Hence I don't see a problem promoting sect 21/cs to CPL.<br><br>As for the safety planning, and all that.. a lot of O level grads can also do it.  Heck, how many 3SG sect comds write lesson plans, design exercises etc.  Even more so when in the reserves?<br><br>Lastly, there is a decent number of people who still get their university degrees, polytechnic diplomas after NS.  Just because the didn't get their A levels of polytechnic diploma prior to entering NS means that they don't have smarts.<br><br>My whole point is that we need a better way of choosing who gets selected for appointments better than our current (stupid) system of basing it on education.<br><br>And we should look at actually rewarding LCPs, PFCs and PTEs who do well in the reservist, instead of giving lip service that we do.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most units who did not promote NSmen to the next higher rank is because of all the paper work. There is a 5 years service medal for NSmen after 5 years of ICT, but how many of them got it? It is because the unit dun wish to handle all the paper work, so they pretend not to know about it. I know it is because my unit did promotion for 3/4 of my unit Nsmen to the next rank, plus the 5 year medal for those who can have it, during my NSF days. The paperwork that my work colleague who handle the promotion is a lot, cause you need to check if the Nsmen is eligible to be promoted, whats their grade for their last few ICT and have they pass their IPPT etc. So just think, if you are in a unit with few hundreds of NSmen, how much paperwork you need to handle.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ur..just wanna add my own comments....not all NSmen (i mean those going back periodically for their in-camp training) are keen to get promoted. for those regulars in the force it would be a good idea to look into the grading system but for reservists we just wanna go back and serve our time that's all. its not that rewarding to get promoted as compared to a regualr in the force. thouh in times of a real war then its a different story. however there are reservists who are siao on during ICT and those that can lead and produces results usually gets promoted. others just go along with assigned duties and clear the training as 1 IcT.<br><br>a good start to look into promotions other than lookin into an individual's educational level.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by insouciant:<br><strong><br><br>Buddy, no one is saying that ALL LCPs should be promoted to 3SGs if you read the thread carefully.  THAT would be pure stupidity.<br><br>We're just saying that there is a issue with the process that promotes so many people to be 3SGs or above based on their education, when there are many people who would make better combat or technical leaders who might not have that "pre-requisite" A level or polytechnic certificate when they are conscripted.<br><br>I'm glad that your unit is good enough to recognize its men and promote them.

But then how many guys if given a choice would willing do NS in the 1st place?  We are talking about who would make better leaders for the sake of the military.  Not about who wants to.[/b]</blockquote>i understand that not ALL LCPs should be promoted. my bad in writing the word ALL.<br><br>i also understand that Army has undergone changes where the process for promotion to a higher rank is rather "screwed". I am for one that has been left out of this promotion since the Army take education as a priority for promotion rather than capable field leaders/commanders. then again, its all abt pressing buttons n more buttons this present day, isn't it? thus, we can see really good people in terms of leadership and so on being side-tracked for promotion.<br><br>and in the first place who suggested education to be a better criteria in promotion in the Army? we've those "crabs" n seafood chain on top...<br><br>if u are talking abt who will make better leaders for the sake of the military and not abt who wants to then its pretty ironical for ur statement. this is because, if there is a desire/want to, they will make better leaders, be it natural leaders or through much training.<br><br>and for me, i'd say for those who wants to be leaders in the Army, they will want to and have the desire to. and let's also bear in mind that politics/boot-licking are much more wayang in the Army in order to attain a promotion. no offense to any regulars here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like others, I've seen first hand, the ability of privates and lance corporals leading sections during exercises. For combat units (non-technical vocations), it does not really matter if the person is O or A levels, or diploma holders. During fulltime NS, we were trained from privates to officers, on reaching objectives during a mission. And we knew the high possibilities of commanders being made casualties. The lance corporals and privates were taught to take over and complete the missions (this I observe, varies from unit to unit). And some have shown to have talent for it. This carries on into reservist training as well. NS is not just 2 years - its 2 years plus another 10 years in reserves. During that time, some of the lance corporals would have gained the experience to take over as section commanders. During ICTs, I've seen commanders' briefings, missions planning, etc, whereby lance corporals would turn up in place of the usual commanders for whatever reason (commander downgraded, excuse, defer, etc). From experience, they knew what to do for each mission.<br><br>I think the SAF should promote these lance corporals to sergeants - some of them have stood in as section commanders for years because the regular commander could be on a long-term excuse. As to why sergeants and officers get promoted - there maybe a need for experienced reservists to carry on beyond the 10 year cycle. Sergeants move on to platoon sergeants or CSM, officers to OC, battalion staff officers and brigade level officers. I'm sure some lurking in this forum have the experience of being "persuaded" to carry on after their first completed cycle.<br><br>Of course - promotion should be for those who have the ability, experience and would not mind taking up the appointment.<br><br>The SAF is unique in the sense that it determines a person's ability by education level at the point of enlistment. Many have said we are based on the Israeli conscription system. However, from what I gathered, the IDF has a different system (based on ability) of selecting leaders. They have more time (3 years, fulltime), but with the coming reductions to their conscription service as well in the coming years, perhaps we should revisit and relearn from them again.<br><br>I won't go into how some commanders have failed, but I have to agree that there should be a better selection method. Considering that NS is now 2 years fulltime for all ranks, I'm quite sure these things are being looked at and considered.<br><br>Typing all of this reminds me of Thailand - even the drivers there were ranger and airborne trained, much, much older, seen counter-insurgency border action, and would give you a "I don't give a flying fcuk" stare about your rank look. The face says it all.<br>At the end of the day - we are in the army, it does not matter to an enemy if you had straight As for your exam if he is determined to kill you.<br></div>
