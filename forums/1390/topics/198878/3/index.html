PLSgt that outperformed the PC?? promote to PC level? or even to OC level? and so on.)<br><br>what should a unit or rather how should a unit handle these cases? surely, some will lose that jest, whatever it may be during their span of NS fulltime duty, right?<br><br>where reservist is concerned, there's much more free-play now for the unit's commanders (OC, PC, CSM n PLSGTs). they can determine and propose for promotion for those section 2ICs and even LCP that handles admin for the coy. as for whether their performance in reservist is indeed better or otherwise, we've to take into account their personal life activities (families, work and others) outside of the Army reservist commitment. not all that report back for ICT come in the right frame of mind.<br><br>education is somewhat down-played during reservist period when it comes to promotion.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually, who really cares about promotion? I hope to serve less, 6 mths of service for some rank is really not worth it..<br><br>I was a 3SG (technical) but I did a lot of storeman jobs, basically, just a high class storeman with better pay. I don't anyhow push my jobs to ppl of lower rank because we are all NSFs..<br><br>basically, when it comes to cleaning, I do with them... coz I cannot stand sitting ard doing nth.. bores me to hell...<br><br>with the rank, your superiors expects you to know everything and you men expects you to know everything too... we all learn through experience, not the rank and thus, you get tekan or taunt very often...<br><br>there is nth abt rank, sure, with a 3SG, you can ask a 'man' to do some sai kang but those are for the 'I'm so superior because i have rank' shit guys like those in BMT or whatever... in real life, you have to do the jobs too... and you are in middle of nowhere...<br><br>I rather be a man and not only serve lesser, when bad things happened, push it to the 3SGs and said you don't know because u haven learn... like what have happened to me...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it is a universal general understanding that people with paper qualification make better leaders. there is no doubt about it. you take 100 soldiers with degree holder and another 100 with PSLE qualification, give them tough challenging missions. I bet you the degree holders will outwit, outrun the psle ones.<br><br><strong>GRANTED</strong>, there are always a handful of good leadership capability soldiers in the lower qualification, but by how much is that justifiable to amend SAF's enrolment system to SISPEC, OCS system? previously during the early days, NSF was listed into units as men before selection for sispec/ocs. but that system has since changed, it is now direct from bmt to sispec/ocs then to unit. given the short period of time to access individual standing on leadership and qualification, it has to be done in the current way.<br><br>for every 10 "A"/diploma holder officers, i dare say the least 7 will turn out befitting an officer. but for every 10 "O" level or below holders, only 1 or 2 may have great leadership skill. it's just SAF's loss to marginalise these few good men year after year. but to change the current system? very unlikely.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i'm concern about how normal A levels and diploma enlistees are promoted to CPLs now.<br><br>in the past some units only promotes them to CPLs after nearing 2 years of being in the army, as A levels and diploma needs to serve 2.5 years. thus by giving them the rank, they will have to serve the additional 6 months.<br><br>now that NS have been shorten to 2 years, are A levels and diploma enlistees rightfully promoted to CPL after 1 year in service?<br><br>have seem units that are lazy to do all the paper for promotions of NSFs. many A levels and diploma soldiers are still PTEs even after more than 1 year in service.</div>

Unless leadership's been added to the A-level/polytechnic syllabus as a core subject, it's got bugger-all to do with education.</div>
