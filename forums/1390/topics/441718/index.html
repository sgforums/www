              <p>Why the word "combat"?</p>
              <p>I read in Army News about thne Skyblade mini UAV that is manpacked by 3-man teams. They come under intel. Maybe you are one of these, I don't think they will let a reservist be any other kind of intel officer.</p>
              <p>They need someone expendable enough to hump it and command the other 2 guys in the jungle, yet responsible enough to fly it without damaging it or other property.</p>
