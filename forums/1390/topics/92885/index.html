It's very messy and inefficient, that's why people in NS will laugh at you at wasting your time doing NCC when u can spend your time doing some other things.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   That's m y view anyway.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Being a cadet LTA, I guess you have the enthusiasm and interest to participate in NCC activities. Keep at it but do not let your NCC achievements get to your head during BMT.<br><br>Why?  Let me tell you from first hand as a former BMT instructor.... and as a friend of a former NCC officer. If you let it get to your head and get into your BMT instructors' bad books, you will be in for a lot of shit. Furthermore, you may dash your chances going to OCS or even SISPEC, to get the rank you actually deserve (i.e. 2LT or 3SG).<br><br>My friend was a NCC LTA, he thought he knew a lot and was (as I heard from another friend in the same BMT platoon) sometimes was arrogant towards the NCO instructors. Bad practice ....  He was not even chosen to go to SISPEC or OCS because of bad reports from the instructors and peers, but instead went straight to one of those support vocation school and had to work from private to corporal... the hard way !!!<br><br>Luckily, his family was rich, they migrated but also funded him to do dentistry overseas. He is now in Singapore, and because he is a dentist , he is now a captain in a reservist medical BN.<br><br>Well done for getting your "bars" in the NCC but trust me, it will not count. You have to prove yourself all over again.</div>

We know the standard required. we look at them wear the uniform, totally not up to standard. you see their behaviour, its out of line when wearing that uniform. people compare because humans like to see what is better. Why do we compare? because of pride of wat we have.<br><br>Another thing, maybe you see a NCC cadet, higher rank than you... first thing that comes to your mind? "so young rank so high", yes i know its NCC. But going through the military, you know the value of the ranks. So once again, pride comes in. People go through bmt, exercises... and they get PTE, LCP, CPL, 3SG. And you're walking along the street and you see a boy with a SSG/MSG rank... and pride creeps in and you wonder, what the hell did he do to get that rank? Yes its just NCC but in your head, the rank structure and procedure to get it is already instilled in there.<br><br>I may speak for some, NOT ALL... but if you look at the big picture, many may say they hate the SAF... but at the end of it all, most are quiet patriotic and proud singaporean men who haven't really looked inside them... they may have hated it, but it has given them pride in something they have done which some never have the chance to experience, the pride of saying "I've been through it, the training, the exercises and the tons of sh|t".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well said.  i totally understand what u mean. sometimes i felt that way too.<br><br>but come to think of it, we are paid for the rank we get, while NCC might have rank up to MSG,  but they are not paid any money and they don't hold any responsiblities of a MSG.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was in NCC (Land) during my sec school days, and like kopiosatu mentioned, we were wearing the temasek green uniform those days. Most of us would change out of the uniform after the activity on Saturdays.<br><br>To align with the SAF, NCC decided to change to the camo uniform. Conveniently, they wear the uniform out of school as it is not that different from that in the SAF. This is where the problem lies, they are not aware that being in the uniform and the way that they behave will create a certain impression to the general public.<br><br>Do you see NPCC cadets wearing their full uniforms and hanging around shopping centers? Most of the time, they change their tops.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For the record, MINDEF has promoted closer ties between the school units &amp; SAF formations under the NCC 21 Masterplan (from, I believe, 1998 or 1999 onwards). It's already a milestone to see your HQ being located inside Amoy Quee camp, as my recce team saw when we last drove around inside there.<br><br>I don't deny such uniformed school-cadets being better physically &amp; mentally prepared for military service for the various branches. You guys do have a headstart for the Best PT or Best Marksmanship awards, if not Best Soldier, during BMT. That said, it's not an entitlement &amp;, if anything, it's also a tradition for BMT instuctors to accentuate the NCC as an antithesis instead - i.e. that Tekong is the "real deal", &amp; not just an extra-curricular activity. If a recuit has the quality, he'll naturally emerge past the tekan-ing.<br><br>The other negativity the average SAF soldier has for the NCC counterpart is - as evidently suggested by the posts here - the common sharing of the camoflague uniforms. On the one hand, IMO we haven't quite moved on from the generation that still sees the school cadets in Temasek Green. On the other, it's also downright off-putting to see a lot of cadets-in-uniforms lack an military cutting or bearing: from haircuts (touching collar or ear or past eyebrow), to appropriately-folded sleeves (for smart No #4), to the dragging of boots, to even opening up an umbrella when raining (try doing that in front of a grouchy RSM)!<br><br>You can't really blame our NSF's either, cuz the armed-forces culture everywhere is such that you have to toil to initially earn the PTE rank, otherwise recruits wouldn't need the POP parade. Believe me, you'll feel the same affront after you've gone through your own BMT, with proper SAF indoctrination &amp; eradication of "civilian" habits.<br><br>[FYI I don't mind 16-year olds with "senior NCO" rank as much - it certainly beats the NPCC or scout version with one arm massively overloaded with badges &amp; awards!]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Appendum: The NCC/Temasek Green days also saw an arguably stricter sense of military dress. The shirts had to be starched (sometimes overstarched to the extent that white streaks showed post-ironing) &amp; tucked in, the belt buckles must be well-polished, the trousers suitably tailored if they're too loose, &amp; the boots spit-shined. In fact, so prevalent was the fear of premature apparel wrinkling that the cadets preferred bringing them to school in hangers - &amp; only wear them prior to forming up.<br><br>The desired effect was mostly cosmetic, but the resultant "kilat" impression also signal to the rest of the school - as well as the general public -  how dedicated the cadets were on individual sense of discipline &amp; decorum.<br><br>Of course, it's usually mothers who ended up ironing the uniforms ~lol~ but I think the emphasis on primp attire also permitted many bonding sessions between the different secondary batches on late-afternoon, post-ECA Saturdays. It's during those occasions that tips on personal maintainence were passed down - eg. lightly Kiwi-ing the boots after cleaning 'em - &amp; ditto the more bawdy cadences/songs.<br><br>Thereafter everyone headed straight home. By contrast, nowadays you see occasional baggy-attired NCC cadets from neighborhood schools hanging out in town centers during the early evening.</div>
