            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Moxie:</div><div class="quote_body">Appendum: The NCC/Temasek Green days also saw an arguably stricter sense of military dress. The shirts had to be starched (sometimes overstarched to the extent that white streaks showed post-ironing) &amp; tucked in, the belt buckles must be well-polished, the trousers suitably tailored if they're too loose, &amp; the boots spit-shined. In fact, so prevalent was the fear of premature apparel wrinkling that the cadets preferred bringing them to school in hangers - &amp; only wear them prior to forming up.<br><br>The desired effect was mostly cosmetic, but the resultant "kilat" impression also signal to the rest of the school - as well as the general public -  how dedicated the cadets were on individual sense of discipline &amp; decorum.<br><br>Of course, it's usually mothers who ended up ironing the uniforms ~lol~ but I think the emphasis on primp attire also permitted many bonding sessions between the different secondary batches on late-afternoon, post-ECA Saturdays. It's during those occasions that tips on personal maintainence were passed down - eg. lightly Kiwi-ing the boots after cleaning 'em - &amp; ditto the more bawdy cadences/songs.<br><br>Thereafter everyone headed straight home. By contrast, nowadays you see occasional baggy-attired NCC cadets from neighborhood schools hanging out in town centers during the early evening.</div></blockquote>man... i remember those times... starching my uniform...!!!<br><br>but my mother didn't iron it for me... i had to do everything. back then it wasn't just kiwi your boots, it was POLISHING it... i loved the way i could see my teeth on my boots!<br><br>And I remember our footdrill was really really good! This year at the NDP, i saw the NCC and NPCC... footdrill, totally crap... can't even march smartly...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Naturally, as an officer of the corp, I really hope that our guys could really stand proud in front of others... rightfully protraying NCC as the younger counterparts of SAF....<br><br>But based on the current situation, i think it would be hard to see it... NCC has really evolved throughout the years, it has become a CCA points generating machine, students joined NCC because of the higher CCA points that it offered, rather than the usual military passion that we older cadets are after... rather than the strong bonds and camaraderie in a platoon, people are fighting among each others for key appointments, backstabbing each other are common... where have the spirit of the olden days gone??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> , furthermore, the famous tekaning that is seen on the older cadets are no longer there, commanders are encourage to instill discipline by talking them round... and leading by example... (which i think is only useful to a certain extent, corporal punishment should still be used to complement it). true, some of them may see u as an example, but wat about those hardcore?? I think this is naive, who gives a damn to ur rank if you have no practical power to punish them...<br><br>however, apart from the above, there are also a group of students that really join the corp due to the love for the military, the wanting to know more about the SAF... no offence, some of the words above has really done injustice to them...<br><br>overall, i don't deny the fact that what we learn is nothing compared to the NSFs, however, the spirit of some cadets should still be give credit... hope that u people would not juz laugh becos we are NCC... pls try to think deeper....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now training end too late parents complain liao loh. One, two years back, when there was still no news of training the next day we want to sleep also afraid later telephone call come and we don't know. When we were informed of training the next day at about 10pm at night we also no choice have to prepare our uniform and I have to pass the information around even though I feel like sleeping. But sometimes also our fault for passing down the message too late through telephone and cadets are sleeping after we took over last year. My mother don't help me to iron my uniform since she forced me learn ironing and sewing since pri 4.</div>

Some cadets just ignore your orders and continue sitting down and talking when you tell them to fall in.<br><br>However, I agree that forcing cadets to dissappear within 10 seconds is kind of harsh because the 10 seconds is actually less than that when I timed with my watch and sometimes, this will cause some minor accidents to happen especially when they are tired.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LazerLordz, Frankly I agree wif you, as a commander I think that it is important to lead by example... rather than just by punishing to get the message across to them... unreasonable punishment would only instill fear into them instead of respect... punishment like what wuming have said, should be supported with vaild reasons... to foster better relationship between commander and man, effective communication is essential, the commander should try to understand each and everyone of your man... be their best friend, mentor... when there is time to be serious, a commander must be serious, but when it's time to relax and play around, a commander should'nt be stern... In my point of view, to do the right thing at the right time is essential... just my thoughts though... guys pls share....</div>
