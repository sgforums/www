              <p>I read with sadness the passing of Private Lee Rui Feng Dominique. I am 
              also an NSF having seven months left to complete my national service. My
               view is that such deaths can definitely be prevented. I feel that the 
              medical board in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) does not take the 
              health and welfare of soldiers seriously. Sometimes, when soldiers 
              report sick, they can even be reprimanded by the medical officer (MO). 
              It is also common for the MO to simply prescribe painkillers without 
              ordering further investigations such as X-RAYS or MRI scans. This is not
               the way that the SAF should operate. <br> <br> It should take the health of its soldiers much more seriously. If PTE 
              Lee had a asthma condition, why was he still declared combat fit? Let 
              those who are medically well serve as combat soldiers. For those who 
              have medical conditions, they should be downgraded to an appropriate 
              Physical Employment Status (PES). I feel that medical board in SAF is 
              too strict with their PES grading and often tries to give servicemen the
               highest grading possible, instead of the safest or most appropriate 
              one. For myself, I have both serious heart conditions as well as asthma 
              which require me to use inhalers multiple times a day. However, I am not
               being assigned an appropriate PES status by the medical board. I can 
              only imagine how the parents of PTE Lee are feeling. <br> <br> It is not easy to bring up a child from birth, through primary and 
              secondary school, pre-university education and then national service, 
              only to see them lose their life in NS. Every Singaporean Son’s life is 
              precious. Although I may not know the full details of the case, I feel 
              that commanders’ attitude towards soldiers also need to change. Some 
              commanders tend to instil fear into their charges from reporting sick, 
              threatening to punish them with weekend duties and confinement. As a 
              result, even when the soldiers feel terrible and ought to seek medical 
              attention, they tolerate and bear with the pain and discomfort. If 
              attitudes do not change, I believe that we will continue to see more 
              deaths of servicemen in our armed forces. MINDEF should also look into 
              the way its training is being conducted, as sometimes the commanders do 
              not follow the training program and ask the soldiers to do more than 
              they are supposed to. Commanders need to understand that soldiers are 
              only human and are not robots. They have physical limits, which if 
              pushed too far, may result in permanent injury or even death. There is a
               large opportunity cost to our NSFs to serve two years of national 
              service. They lose out in terms of tertiary education, job experience, 
              freedom and family time. <br> <br> I salute all current serving national servicemen as those who have 
              served since the beginning of national service. PTE Lee is a hero, 
              having died for Singapore. But more should be done to review the safety 
              procedures in place, the safety of the equipment used, the quality of 
              food served to our soldiers, as well as the medical classification 
              system, so that such events will not happen again.<br> <br> Yes, perhaps people might say that the soldiers today are weaker 
              compared to those in the 70s, 80s and 90s. Some even call us the strawberry generation. However, these are different 
              times. People in the past led less sedentary lifestyles. However, the 
              system should adjust to fit the people and not the other way around. 
              Training can be tweaked to take into account that the soldiers of today 
              are physically and mentally different from soliders of the past.<br> <br> In addition, I feel that the duration of national service should be 
              revised as NCMP Mrs Lina Chiam has suggested. Yes, I understand that 
              there are operational requirements and that it is important to ensure 
              that the soldiers are sufficiently well trained. I feel that it is 
              possible to reduce the duration of national service to 22 months for 
              officers and 18 months for specialists and enlistees. Especially for 
              NSFs who are serving in service support vocations such as medic, 
              storeman, clerk. Most of the time, we are not doing much or anything 
              productive in unit and are just wasting time, waiting for Operationally 
              Ready Date (ORD). <br> <br> It is not necesarry to waste resources to pay us and feed us to do 
              nothing when we could better spend this time studying or working to earn
               a living outside. I am sure many NSFs who have ORDed will have 
              experienced what it is like to be behind others in terms of jobs, 
              promotions, salary, experience, etc. And with the influx of foreigners 
              coming to Singapore to compete for jobs, we should be placed at a lesser
               disadvantage so that we are better able to compete in the workplace. <br> <br> Also, the reservist cycle of NS men should be reduced to 8 cycles. The 
              number of days a year that NS men can be called back should be reduced 
              from 40 days to 28 days. Training should be efficient, short and 
              concise. What sense does it make to call reservists back to camp and pay
               them to sit in bunks to do nothing? I am sure many NS men dread the SAF
               100 as it disrupts their work. Many bosses would probably prefer to 
              give priority and favour to the foreign talents who do not have any 
              reservist liability. Singaporean men who work in the private sector do 
              not enjoy higher salary for having served NS. The least the goverment 
              could do is to minimise the inconvenience and disadvantage caused to 
              them. Last but not least, I feel that more benefits should be given to 
              all who have served or are currently serving national service. The 
              National Service Recognition Award (NSRA) introduced in 2010 consisted 
              of $9000 paid out over three milestones. 1. $3000 into Post Secondary 
              Eduction Account (PSEA) at 20th month of NSF, 2. $3000 into CPF After 3 
              high key ICT or 5 ICT, 3. $3000 into CPF upon completion of ORNS cycle. 
              There is also the $3000 tax relief given to NS men. <br> <br> However, I feel that these measures are not enough. More can be done to 
              show the government's appreciation towards us who have served the 
              country. <br> 1. ORD Bonus: NSFs will get paid $2000 upon completion of their full time NS<br> 2. ICT Bonus: NS men will get paid $2000 upon completion of that year's ICT.<br> 3. ROD Bonus: NS men will get $4000. <br> Those who have RODed should also be given the awards. I am sure that the
               government is able to afford it. There are a lot of issues bugging 
              Singaporeans now. Issues such as competition from foreign talent, 
              housing, inflation, income inequality, immigration, just to name a few. <br> <br> The PAP promised us change in the last election. But it seems that after
               being voted into power, they have forgotten their promises and 
              obligations. Now, they just sit on their bums and are not doing their 
              best to improve the various aspects of life of Singaporeans. I feel that
               if this continues on, more and more Singaporeans will develop a 
              resentment towards the goverment. And when the next elections come, I am
               sure that the results will be different from the previous ones. But for
               the next few years, the 40% minority have to suffer due to the decision
               of the other 60%. Can the government please, wake up your idea?</p>
