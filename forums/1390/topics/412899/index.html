This allows our NSmen to regulate their own fitness training regime," he added. <br><br>Under the enhanced programme, servicemen will also be given health and fitness education, which will cover topics like managing sports injuries and exercise principles. <br><br>It is meant to be a holistic attempt to encourage a healthy-living culture among Singapore's citizen-soldiers.<br><br>However, if performance targets are not met when the programme ends, NSmen will need to go for eight additional fitness sessions over three months.<br><br>The moves are aimed at preventing fitness levels of NSmen from dipping significantly in between taking their yearly test. - CNA /ls</span> </span></p>

              <p>After seeing so many fail-ers reporting for RTs, Mindef finally admit  defeat to make guys fit for Military Service...</p>
              <p><strong>NSMen have 9 months to clear IPPT</strong>  <br>  <br>Tue, Oct 12, 2010<br>my paper  <br>   <br>By Kenny Chee</p>
              <p>NATIONAL servicemen who have completed their active service can expect greater flexibility in preparing for their Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) soon.</p>
              <p>From April 1 next year, operationally ready national servicemen can extend their IPPT training with the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) over longer timeframes, said the Ministry of Defence yesterday.</p>
              <p>NSmen typically have to pass their IPPT once a year. If they fail it, they must go for SAF remedial training. This entails 20 physical-training sessions over two months, They are paid for attending these sessions.</p>
              <p>NSmen who know they have problems passing the fitness test can also voluntarily opt to attend an IPPT preparatory training comprising 10 sessions over five weeks. They are not paid for this.</p>
              <p>They are exempted from remedial training for that year if they complete the preparatory training.</p>
              <p>But, with the new IPPT training changes, the remedial training period is extended to three months, and the preparatory training period spread over nine months. The number of training sessions remains unchanged.</p>
              <p>For the preparatory training, fitness specialists will assess the NSmen and allocate personalised and intermediate IPPT targets for them to meet.</p>
              <p>The specialists will look at factors such as fitness levels and the IPPT passing grades based on the NSmen's age.</p>
              <p>These targets can be lower thanthe IPPT passing grades. Focused training will be given to NSmen in areas they are weak in. They will be given health and fitness tips too.</p>
              <p>However, if they are unable to meet the targets during the nine-month training period, they must go for an extra eight training sessions in the next three months.</p>
              <p>They can apply for the preparatory training only within six months of their birthday.</p>
              <p>Another change is that NSmen have to take the fitness test within nine months from their birthday. The next three months are reserved for those who need remedial training. The IPPT window opens again on the NSmen's next birthday.</p>
              <p>Currently, more than 50 per cent of NSmen pass their IPPT every year, according to Mindef.</p>
              <p>Minister of State for Defence Koo Tsai Kee said the changes were made after a review earlier this year. "Recognising that our NSmen are citizen soldiers who will have to balance the demands of work responsibilities, family commitments and NS duties, the revised system will give them greater flexibility in planning their fitness training and help them stay fit," he said.</p>
              <p><strong>Remedial Training</strong></p>
              <p>From April next year, if he fails his IPPT, he must attend paid remedial training of 20 sessions of 3 hours each over 3 months, instead of the current 2 months.</p>
              <p><strong>IPPT preparatory training</strong></p>
              <p>He can volunteer for unpaid IPPT preparatory training of 10 sessions over 9 months from next April, instead of the current 5 weeks.</p>
              <p>As long as he completes this preparatory training, he does not need to do remedial training even if he fails his IPPT for that year.</p>
              <p>Personal IPPT targets will now be set for him during the preparatory training. If he cannot meet the targets, he must attend 8 more, paid training sessions over the next 3 months.</p>

              <p>Offer $1,000 or more to those who pass IPPT every year.</p>

              <p>precisely PTIs are mostly NSF, those lao jiaos (some even kl) NSmen, won't even bother to listen to these young fit buggers who got their bods from training during their free time in camp.</p>
              <p>if those NSF PTIs scold, NSmen may complain. also, its not very nice for a junior to scold a senior (in terms of age).</p>
              <p>of course there are still exception cases which NSmen sincerely want to train.</p>
