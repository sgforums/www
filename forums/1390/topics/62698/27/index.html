              <p>a few quick qn<br><br>do we need to bring items that were not listed under their BMT issued items? such as the transparent water bottle, slingbag and PT kit etc?</p>
              <p>Can we bring handphone chargers in?</p>
              <p>I've read through the thread, but I'm afraid the infos are outdated as most of the info were posted many years ago and for some qn i couldn't find the answer so Im gonna ask a few qn here, sorry if it irritates you.</p>
              <p>-How long is the common leadership module? I heard some say 2 weeks and some say 4 weeks. Normally cadets undergo what kind of training during common leadership module?</p>
              <p>-If I sign on Navy/Airforce during the recruitment talk, will I be transferred to Navy Wing/Air Wing immediately or must I be commissioned as an officer first before joining back Navy/Airforce?<br></p>
              <p>And the instruction from OCS says that we need to provide the particulars of our family members, the name and address of the employer, what if we aren't able to provide the details? Or does it mean the name and address of the workplace?</p>
              <p>Plus they need the original copy of our edu transcripts, will they return us after that?</p>

              <p>Hi everyone, stumbled upon this while online.</p>
              <p>I am currently serving as a Sit-Test assessor as my NS vocation, previously from Artillery. by the grace of God, i managed to acheive platoon best in BMT and SOM in OCS. It's quite heartening to know that there are still individuals out there who strive to get into OCS and not just downgrade to chaokeng their NS days away.</p>
              <p>Hope to clarify some queries here for the best of my ability:</p>
              <p>1) it's not impt to have a gold to get into ocs, i was silver from enlistment to ord. though without a gold, it is impossible to get the sword of honour (SOH)</p>
              <p>2) sit-test, peer appraisal and instructors appraisal is very important to get into OCS</p>
              <p>3) try to volunteer as much as possible in BMT, don't be lazy and try to siam from doing saikang. your peers and instructors can see if you are chaokeng</p>
              <p>4) if you didn't manage to get appointed as an appointment holder in BMT, i.e. platoon / company IC, chances of you getting into OCS is very low. how they choose appointment holders is based on your leadership track record (at least for the first few weeks). for the 2nd half of your bmt course, appointment is based on daily performance</p>
              <p>5) intellect matters, for getting into OCS. if you anyhow do the IQ test at the Mindef assessment centre, forget about going into OCS.</p>
              <p>6) if you retained in JC or repeated a module in poly, don't worry, still can go OCS. most impt is to do the IQ test at the assessment centre well</p>
              <p>7) for OCS training wise, can bring HP charger. quite a bit of tekkan during my time, especially during the first few weeks, 5 mins for lunch tops so please be prepared. physically &amp; mentally very pressurizing also. do not expect your mandatory 7 hours of sleep as per BMT. During the first few weeks, i had a few platoon mates who dropped out not because of the physical tekkan, but cos they just couldn't take the mental pressure. other than that, it's quite fun and fulfilling.</p>
              <p>Yup, this is my 1 cent worth, hope it helps. do note that not everyone is suitable to be a commander. if you try to wayang your way into command school, you will be pretty miserable there. that being said however, do try your best in BMT and adopt a positive attitude towards this 2 years of mantatory NS. i had one of the best years of my life ;)</p>
              <p>cheers and all the best to those trying to get into OCS</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hey guys, just a curious question. Does the IQ test at the assessment centre include the leadership survey at the end?</p>
              <p>*as in does the survey affect your chances of going into OCS. </p>

              <p>well, the SISPEC, or now known as SCS topic has expired and i can't post there.</p>
              <p>i'd just like to contribute my army story to this forum. whether it affects and help you individually or not, that's not my problem. all i seek, all i want, is for motivation to envelop the eventual and current NSFs serving.</p>
              <p>i entered SISPEC through a circuitous route (think about manpower deployment and PES status). It was a place i never wanted to be. all along, it was either OCS or nothing. but then again, when the SAF wants to fuck you, hell, even if your uncle is a Col/Gen you gotta LLST. if true, kee chiu :p</p>
              <p>so i went back into SISPEC. met really inspiring (and this may shock you) sect leaders, plt leaders, plt comd and coy comd. it's sad that my plt sgt left the force, my sect comd probably won't make the assessment. its enough however, that my PC and my OC has gone further along the route. i trust they will shape things up as they go along.</p>
              <p>so anyway, Golden bayo. SOM in OCS. all from someone who fucked things so badly in NS, but got a redemption shot along the way.</p>
              <p>I am not bragging nor do i want to. the only thing i want to impress upon (what i hope to be impressionable minds here) is this,</p>
              <p>NS is 2 years give and take that you've gotta serve. you have your family, you have your friends, you may even have a girlfriend! those are the people you are serving for. make them proud, and make the extra effort they put into making your bookout enjoyable worthwhile. (the most touching thing i came back to was after BMT and my mom was cooking my favourite dishes and my bed was freshly made by my maid).</p>
              <p>these people love you and they want you to try your best. where you go doesn't matter. what matters is you do your very best in an institution where everybody has served.</p>
              <p>if you are here and you see this, all of us have served our time. for good or for bad, that is the little bit we have done for this country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: if i've gone off track, let me get back on it. SISPEC is physically siong. OCS is physically + mentally siong. they will fuck you up so badly through sleep deprivation and punishment and then ask you to do an ops order. SISPEC is good training. i feel, (not that it matters), that SISPEC should be a route that all potential OCTs should go through first before entering OCS. [fuck CLM la.]</p>

              <p>More or less in Service Term and Pro Term. IPPT Gold "medallists" usually book out on Fridays when there isn't any outfield exercises. The rest will stay for RT and then book out.</p>

              <p>One of my section mates asked ARC that during their recruitment session.</p>
              <p>The answer was that if selected to be a CDO officer, he will go through the whole Infantry Officer Cadet Course and subsequently posted to a CDO unit as a PC, but still wearing the green beret. After a period of time, he will be sent for a course to earn his red beret.</p>
              <p>For NSF CDO officers, they are trained from CDO mono-intake all the way up to section leader level, and subsequently, those who make the cut will crossover to OCS and join the Infantry cadets for the rest of the course.</p>

              <p>Hi, I wonder if anyone is in the same situation as me. I was born in Singapore, but my parents were not so I was a PR until recently. Will that affect my chances of going into SAF OCS? Cos I heard that PRs are often relegated to SPF or something along those lines.</p>
              <p>And another qn, I am planning on signing on if I become an officer. And the thing is I'm an arts student, so I aim to major in History in NUS. Will any problems arise from this, especially if I want to get the SAF scholarship?</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I got posted to armour infantry and will be undergoing the spec leadership course. Any suggestions on how to crossover to being a OCT? It's my first week in ATI! Oh and my wing commander said only two specs managed to crossover... Since year 2005. OMG. </p>
              <p>Need a few suggestions on working towards it. Thanks!</p>
