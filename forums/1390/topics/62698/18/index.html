            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Scholars seem to be in D. The training very xiong, but they seem to be happier than in BMT Facilities also OK. Got cadet mess(nice), food better than Tekong They were told that they will have to fall in at 3am for....?<br>It seems that F is support and S and T are infantry. Is that correct ? Visiting day is April 8.[/b]</blockquote>Hi, I ORD in 2000 so I am a bt old now. Here's my 2 cents for your info on Delta Company.<br><br>I was in the January BMT intake. I got called up to some SAFOS presentation while I was in BMT before I got my A level results. I suspect SAF knew the results and called in everyone with 3-4As plus what were then called S Papers, because the talk was before the A Level results were released.<br>All the botak recruits at the SAFOS presentation went to OCS.<br>All the botak recruits got 4As.<br>All of us were put in Delta Company.<br><br>Delta Company is definitely the scholar platoon. You would also get people who sign on to be army regulars, but the majority are lined up as potential SAF scholars. This is where they will assess and tekan until the scholarships candidate emerge. It was brutal and draconian for us. No $hit. Other companies had it better.<br><br>By the end of Tri Service Term, 20% were OOC. There are about 20 SMS and 5 SAFOS scholars every year and they will be gone too. Oh and they will be commissioned as LTA immediately once they are awarded the scholarships. Another 50 Public Service Commission OMS scholars will leave as well. All those who applied to Medical school will have left for university. The treatment didn't change either.<br><br>By the end of Service Term, And another 20% OOC due to injury or failure. Cadets will leave to join Supports Arms - Artillery, Signals, Armour, Combat Engineers. If you don't like infantry, now is the time to leave if you still want to be an officer. The cadets going to Support Arms came from D/S/T/F companies so it was a mix. Not true that one company will supply the rest.<br><br>By the start of Pro Term, Delta Company 31/98 was down to a single platoon of original Delta boys. It can be tough and depressing to see so many people leave for (sometimes) better things.<br><br>I didn't get the scholarships and I got into law school instead. By Service Term my OC wanted me OOC for screwing up a patrol mission but my PC saved me and sent me to Support Arms.<br><br>The first 3 mths in Delta was quite brutal from my point of view. But do your best, pass your IPPT, know how to read a map and compass and don't <strong>ever ever</strong> get lost. Remember, being a good officer is about being a good people manager too. Don't be a by-the-book pain in the ass.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all<br><br>Had some time to surf and came across this interesting thread on OCS. I was feeling nostalgic and want to ask some questions. By the way my cadet training was in the 80s'. Very old man now.<br><br>During my time, in the old safti, there was some virtual physical punishment; like being knocked on the helmet, instructors pull your SBOs, etc. But I don't recall there was any actual direct-contact-physical punishment, like instructors kicking you.<br><br>However, there were a lot of time-wasting, non-military-training activities. Instructors always gave trainee tasks that were impossible to complete due to time/knowledge constraints. Thereafter we were tekaned like hell; push-ups, star-jumps, running, etc and lots of extras, stand-by-everthing. Time could have been better spent on training.<br><br>Is officer cadet training more senang now as far as punishments are concerned ?<br><br></div>

Read the requirements of the question carefully and understand it before you start. My time there was 1 section i click too fast and didn't read what was required so i ended up cocking up the entire section since i didn't know what i was supposed to answer and it was those type of question that give u a diagram and ask you choose form the list base on some criteria which i didn't read...<br><br>These are the only advices i can give from what i can recall abt that test. By the way, maths questions are done with pencil and paper so hopefully you aren't too used to calculator that your mental sums is gone :p</div>
