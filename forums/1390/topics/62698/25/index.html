              <p>It depends. Some batches have as low as roughly 75%, meaning 1 out of 4 does not make it, while others have nearly everyone making it.</p>

              <p>Thanks, 75% seems kinda low considering they were all selected based on a host of considerations including IPPT etc etc. Dont they have some sort of minimal quota after-all there will be a minimal level of officers they have to replace as each NS batch ROD.</p>

              <p>75% is more or less accurate from my experience too.</p>
              <p>And regarding the minimal, quota, if they need a large numbers of offficers, the intial intake will be proportionally larger. From BMT there are alot of people who show initial signs that they will make good officers, but since there is only a limited number, even those with the aptitude to make it as an officer may be not selected for OCS on account that SAF only will take the numbers from the top.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So those who are shaved off as OCS takes place are those who prove that they are unsuitable despite showing initial signs of promise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I.E If there are 10 Cadets, and they need 10 Officer slots that need to be fullfilled. Maybe only 8-9 will commision even though there is a need for more. Cos i dont think they'll commision a cadet who is undeserving.</p>

              <p>OCS - Officer Cadet School.<br><br>"To Lead, To Excel, To Overcome"<br><br>Situated within SAFTI MI, the SAFTI Military Institute which is the home of the officer corp. There are several other advanced schools there like the SAS (SAF Advanced School). So one can expect alot of big shots (even officers from other countries) within the SAFTI compound. Cadets beware!<br><br>Anyway the top percentile from BMT gets to go OCS. Of course for those who signed on as officers they will likely go there too. And its not the case that you must ace your IPPT, SOC and range to get there.<br><br><strong>Intakes</strong><br>There are four intakes into OCS per year, each comprising of around 250-500 cadets. These intakes are in April(delta, foxtrot, sierra, tango), June/July(bravo, echo, golf), September/October(alpha, sierra, tango) and December(charlie, hotel). Each intake is denoted by the batch number / year, e.g. I was from 45/01 OCC, which means the 45th batch of Officer Cadet Course, 2001 intake.<br><br><strong>TIP</strong>: to get to SAFTI, its recommended to take mrt to boon lay and take a cab. if u take the bus 193 frm boon lay bus interchange, it will stop outside safti, and u (cadets) will have to MARCH all the way in - its really quite far in! at least 15 - 20 mins walk. taking a cab means u get to drop at carpark I within the compound. u still have some marching in to do depending on which wing u r in, but it saves half the journey. the normal cab fare frm boon lay to safti is about $4.50<br><br>Anyway the <strong>structure of OCS</strong>:<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/safti/ocs/about/map_structure.gif" alt="image"><br><br>So there are basically the army wings, the air force wings and the navy wings. (Coys are known as Wings in OCS. Dun ask me why. Prob to follow some US fashion)<br><br>The <strong>Structure of the Wings</strong>:<br><br>Wing Commander<br>Wing 2IC<br>Wing Sergeant Major<br>Platoon Commanders (usu 3 Pl; known as flight for air force and something else for navy)<br>Section Commanders (OCS recently changed back to the fixed instructors for each wing structure, rather than the roving instructors)<br>TCO - training coordinating officer: plans ur trg prog and other supporting stuff<br><br><strong>Culture</strong><br>Discipline is the cornerstone in OCS. Cadets are expected to either march or double from point to point, and do so in step, and sing at the same time. And they have to greet everyone else they meet along the way - even older cadets - as the officers there would have told you, cadets are the lowliest creatures, even worse off than recruits! Be prepared to be punished for every mistake made.<br><br>Punishments range from push up, defaulters' parade, confinement, extra duty (cadets need to perform CDO - cadet duty officer, and CDS - cadet duty sergeant - duties), RP or restriction of privileges - which is when a cadet gets charged for e.g. misfiring (so DONT misfire!). A cadets outlook shows one's discipline and hence it is essential to always look smart. One will need to iron and even starch all uniforms and shirts.<br><br>Parades are commonplace - within the wing there are change of command parades for cadet appointment holders, muster parades, and within the school, monthly Commander's Parade at the parade square. These are drilled into you by the daily first and last parade. No movement in the file, no standing on one leg, position of arms when holding bottles, reciting of officers' creed and core values, etc etc.<br><br>"Stand-bys" are common too - at least in my time - and ANYTHING can be asked for standby - bunk, bed, area, fieldpack, SBO, smart 4, and the worse being UNIVERSE when instructors can ask to see anything and expect them to be in "stand-by" condition. There are ppl who have 2 sets of everything: one for use and one for standby. I personally do not think tt is necessary unless u r damned rich.<br><br><strong>TIP</strong>: always have a "smartest 4" prepared ONLY for parades - ironed, starched to its best. and normal smart 4 have to be done properly too. make sure there are visible iron lines on your pants, and no cock hair anywhere! and learn how to wear the cap, the beret and the peak cap properly! have one pair of chiong sua boots and one pair of drill boots - its worth the trouble changing between them between lessons!<br><br><strong>NOTE</strong>:btw, one gets to wear the peak cap - by far my favourite headdress - when one's wing is the next to be commissioned!<br><br>An integrity is critical - cadets can go out of course (OOC) for displaying a lack of integrity. Some cadets had been made out of course for playing with their ceremonial swords.<br>Standardisation is also very important - to emphasise the importance of teamwork and cooperation.</p>

              <p>The Admin attire and the PT attire will change as you progress in seniority. Basically all will be issued to you from the get go, but you're only allowed to wear certain combinations depending on which phase of the training you are at.</p>
              <p>Basically the PT Attire is Red/Red which you will probably wear throughout, but you'll wear the BMTs grey shirt/black shorts (then) brown shirt/black shorts (now) until this is issued.</p>
              <p>For Admin, the initial bit you have to wear the BMT Admin, then progress to the White Shirt and Black Shorts before you progress to White shirt/White Shorts.</p>
              <p>White/White is a bitch since it dirties easier, but denotes seniority.</p>

              <p>I'm a pretty new officer, commissioned in March this year only.</p>
              <p>Current batches of OCC training no longer have changes in Admin or PT attire already; everybody dons red/red and white/white regardless of seniority, just to clarify.</p>
              <p>There are a lot of Out of Course cases... when I first entered OCS the platoon had roughly 50 people. Subsequently, 7 of the guys left for Arty Institute in Professional term and 13 were OOCed. The bulk of them have sustained injuries/discovered that they have general reactions to certain conditions e.g. bee stings. The issue with OCS is that training is on a very tight frame; if you sustain things like a torn ligament, the chance of being put out of course is 100%, because you have to miss out on so many trainings. Many of those who still can recover are retained in OCS as storemen until the next batch catches up and they subsequently join in. Of course, there's always the occasional integrity issues popping up, and Performance Review Boards for cadets who are deemed to have competency issues (most of them don't make it if they reach this stage)</p>
              <p>But yes, it is possible to get through and get out with minimal appointments. That is if you stay out of the instructors' range and remain a low profile and decent performing cadet (so called hiding under the radar). I won't dwell on further to prevent breaching anything.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>does anyone know whether I will be able to get into OCS with a conviction. I have heard that with a conviction on record, the chances of getting into OCS is significantly dimished. The conviction is not having an exit permit, so it is a very minor conviction. Apart from that, my record is entirely clean.</p>
              <p>However, I have a degree in law and I train and go to the gym often. Please advice.</p>

              <p>Its kind of difficult to say. It depends on your performance during BMT and the SITTEST especially.</p>

              <p>That would depend on the reason they OOC. Maybe recourse, maybe some other course.</p>
              <p>It really depends. Some OOC for health reasons or due to injury, some due to performance.</p>
