            <div class='col-md body'>I think you might have been mistaken about the savers contract.<br><br>Savers contract simple means that if you serve till 42 or 45 years of age, you will be getting the full retirement amount that the organization (&amp; you) have been saving up for this period.<br><br>That doesn't mean that you must serve till that age. You can still leave if you want, of course, the amount that you would be getting would be much less than if you had stayed till retirement.<br><br>I would like to qoute from one of the Army recruitment officer: 'This is like a loyalty scheme, the longer one serves, the more one gets back in payment'.<br><br>I think this is what the recruitment officer meant when he told you that you can sign on for a short term (5 years).</div>
