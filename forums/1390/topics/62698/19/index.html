              <p>agreed. but the OCS-first route is for ppl who were initially selected to OCS for other army duties...and then they choose to sign on as CDO officers. if not, usually CDO get their officers from their own pool of CDOs who qualify for spec training, and from there they choose the best handful of them to go OCS. their ocs is conducted at safti. if i rmb correctly from wad i read in mindef, they train with infantry in ocs. if u can tahan cdo training, ocs training is peanuts. =)</p>
              <p>i had an arti officer fren who commented tt in his batch, the cdo officers were in a world of their own. they run damn fast, do everything damn well...so ya lor.</p>
