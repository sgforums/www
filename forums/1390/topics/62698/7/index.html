            <div class='col-md body'>To all officer wannabes,<br><br>when you're in BMT, it's good to want to excel. But please don't wayang.<br><br>Just be yourself.<br><br>If you are suited to be an officer, then you will be chosen for OCS and from there, prove that you are worthy of a commission.<br><br>Sometimes wayang may get you somewhere in BMT, play a lil' politics here and there, and you might get selected for OCS. But tell you, 9.5 months not the same as 2.5 months. Wayang will not get you through OCS easy, for the simple fact that the everything you will go through will test your mettle, in every area. And if you are not up to it, you will suffer. It's as simple as that. And it's even tougher after you pass out from OCS, that's when your responsibilities really begin. Being an officer is not about wearing that rank; the two pieces of cloth you wear on the shoulder will NOT automatically earn you the enduring respect of the men who will depend on you to take care of them. You will be constantly under scrutiny, from your superiors and the men you are leading. You must have the right attitude and disposition, and the ability. They augment each other, but they must add up to make you worthy of holding command.<br><br>So guys, just be yourself. If you're officer material, then you will enjoy being an officer. If you are specialist material, and specialists are the backbone of the army, then you are better off being a spec. If you are not chosen for command position, then it's nothing to be ashamed of, you're still serving the country same as the others. It does not mean you are less capable than your friends who're going to OCS or SISPEC, your talents lie elsewhere, and military leadership is a little different from its civilian counterpart. Does not mean you are no good, remember that.<br><br>For all yall soon-to-be enlistees, and those in Basic right now, just enjoy your BMT. Make friends, help each other. Don't try to upstage one another. It's not about out-doing the other guy, alright.<br><br>Important: be yourself.</div>

I guess the standards for ATA should be lower? Not sure abt the latter.. but the underlying msg is, qualifying for ocs alone is not enough to secure you a SMS scholarship.<br>Personally if i were you i'd at least wait till i'm enlisted first b4 applying.. cos what makes you think that you'd like army life??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
