Not neccesarily gold. Of course you got to finish your BMT completely, ie field camp, range, SOC etc.<br><br>But the most important part in BMT about going into OCS is SIT Test. Or Situational Test. It is a 3 day field camp where you will be tested on your wits, situational problems, leadership capabilities and so on and so forth. Oh yar, the situational problems is military base ar. Not jigsaw puzzles.<br><br>After POP, if you can't make it into command school, you may still have the chance to be a Specialist in logistics or transport.<br><br>If you really wanna go OCS, talk to your PC about it. His words will add a little more weight in the admission. But of course you got to show him your potential.

            <div class='col-md body'>OK.. Tips and Info for all those Officers-aspire to be<br><br>1) Signing on before enlistment or in BMT to be a Officer does not garauntee you a place in OCS, I known quite a number of people who signed on but did not make it to OCS in the end and their contract was terminated, but it does means your PC will pay more attention to your performance in BMT so in a way you are likely to have a better chance to go in if you have the qualities they are looking for in a Officer.<br><br>2) You must have a 'A' Level or Diploma to qualify, for JC students, that means passing your prelims if your results are not out yet. It is not true that good results will get you into OCS, I have seen many students who like got CCD or CCC in OCS and also known of many who got 4As and not make it. Although I must say if you got 4As and 2S papers and been invited to have Tea sessions to recruit SAFOS scholars, the likelihood of you going into OCS is high.<br><br>3) Passing your IPPT is a must. Silver and Gold are not nessacery although it will be good to have them.<br><br>4) Be yourself in BMT and dun 'Wayang', your peers can see thru you and the peer appraisal matters in your selection.<br><br>5) The pre-enlistment computer test is also a factor, so take it seriously when you do it.<br><br>6) Your BMT PC/OC recommendation matters as well, so it really depends on how you perform in BMT, so dun slack and give your best in everything. But that does not mean sucking up or doing it at the expenses of others, integrity and pride are the key values in a Officer, if you dun value those, forget about being one.<br><br>7) You must be PES A/B, dun worry if you are overweight and PES BP, as long as you pass your IPPT, you are eligible.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> I will not deny that the selection is not perfect and alot of those who do not deserve the slot in OCS due to bad character or attitude got in anyway cos they are good ACTORS in BMT.<br><br>9) And dun worry so much in BMT, enjoy your time with your platoon mates, give your best in everything you do and dun be lazy in BMT and you will do alright. remember, even if you dun get in at BMT, you can still go to Sispec where good ones are still taken out to go OCS, or even after you go unit, and your CO recommend you greatly. In fact, some of the best junoir officers i seen around are those who go to unit, got recommended by CO to go sispec then go OCS from there. (Although you most likely have to extend your NS libility beyond the 2 years to about 2.5-3 years.)<br><br>I hope this helps in all those hoping to be Officers!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I heard about the new change to the selection being in Sispec,<br><br>10) Generally everything I say before still applies, except its ur peer apprisal and Sispec PC/OC Recommendation that matters more rather then your BMT PC/OC.<br><br>11) For Navy/ Airforce Hopefuls, there will be interviews for those they select to be navy/airforce NSF Officer. This will only happen after you get into OCS.  From what I know, this selection is based largely on your Pre-enlistment Computer test.<br><br>12) If your sign on as Pilot, that is the only contract that ganrauntee you a place in OCS, and if you fail your flying course and got your contract terminated before you commission as a officer, you will still be allowed to go through OCS and commission as a Army Officer. All other Vocation require you to get into OCS of your own merit, if not they will terminated your contract.<br><br>13) Getting a SAF Scholarship is not as easy as many people thinks, especially the overseas ones and the higher allowance Local ones. There are a number of interviews you have to go through, they look at both your academic and CCA background, and of course your military performance up to the point of interview.<br>Academic results are the baseline, you need to mean the requirements stated under each type of scholarship/award first before they consider you, after that its up to your performance.<br>SAFOS - 4As and 2S papers<br>SMS - 3As and 1Spapers<br>SAS - 3As<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok... shed a bit of light for the pilot applicants.<br><br>pilot is a very special vocation in the SAF.<br>it is the only vocation that accepts pple from any unit n any vocation (provided u pass their tests n interview etc...)<br>yes... even if u r a regular already n u wanna try apply for pilot, yes u can.<br><br>some of the pilot cadets go to AFS after their BMT.<br>but there r cases of pple who go to AFS as pilot trainees after BSLC or ASLC or even after they commission as officers.<br><br>yup... if u fail the Air Grading Course (AGC), u will likely be posted to either OCS or SISPEC for those who only completed their BMT.<br>i have 2 frens who extended their NS liabilities so that they can go to OCS after they failed their AGC.<br><br>for those who wanna sign on as pilot,<br>be prepared to be an officer cadet for 2 yrs while undergoing all the training.<br>additional info, if u r an officer b4 u enter AFS, u will retain ur current rank.<br>but if u r a spec or man, u will be "demoted" to Officer Cadet, u have to take out ur hard-earned chevrons n put on the Officer Cadet rank.<br><br>Gd Luck guys...<br>Above All~  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Failing AGC will usually put u back on course to OCS or SISPEC depends on where u supposed to go after BMT.<br><br>But for some reason if the waiting period drags, and that you lobo at AFS too long after you go thru AGC and failed it, you do not get posted to OCS or rather serve as an admin trainee in army/rsaf to finish your term.<br><br>For those who passed AGC, they go OCS to do CLM and AFST then go back AFS for Pro Term. Usually it takes very long waiting to start BWC. If during BWC u fail, usually u ORD immediately cos your 'ORD Date' would have already passed during the 'wait'. That's why its quite painful to be a pilot.. all the waitings...<br><br>Yup, at least 2 yrs of OCT before you get 2LT in australia and then come back few weeks get LTA to go unit for advanced wings course.<br><br>Yup^^</div>
