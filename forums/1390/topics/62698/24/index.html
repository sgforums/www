              <p>The chance is very very low since to go to command school, you need to go through BMT in tekong which ITE and O's students rarely go to and poly halfway dropout have limited chances.</p>

              <p>Hi all!</p>
              <p>During my medical checkup, I was told by the MO that due to my eyesight, I do not qualify for Commandos. But MO said that during my BMT, i can request for a review at MMI to see if i can go for eyesight correction surgery. PES B now due to eyesight.</p>
              <p>Lets say i enter BMT leadership batch, manage to get into OCS and somehow manage to fix my eyesight before/during/after BMT/OCS. Is it still possible to get into Commandos after my OCS?</p>
              <p>Sorry if i post in a wrong thread but i figure it pretty much about posting after OCS so i post here.</p>

              <p>Eh guys, dont be so obsessed going into OCS. If you think its all glitz and glamour in there, then you are wrong. Training aside, there is so much more politics in the OCS environment, especially since you're there for a full 9 months. </p>
              <p>And then there are all the burnt weekends, cos the HQ cannot get training ground on a weekday, cos priority always goes to combat unit and such. Notwithstanding all the confinements, duty, Restriction of cadet priveledge. And how the officers make you sign extra like making you go water parade.</p>
              <p>Then when you come out, you're an officer. Glamour? not really. Its good cos people will give way to you cos you have the rank, but every mistake you make have heavier consequences. You also have to behave properly all the time, cos once you fuck around in front of your men, your specs, they'll take it as a permission for them to fuck around. </p>
              <p>But it is still a rewarding experience. You'll learn a lot. </p>

              <p>Restriction of Cadet Priveledges or RCP can be awarded because of whatever means the commanders are creative enough to come up with.</p>
              <p>Not having a properly packed field pack, unclean rifle, untidy room, failure to meet the (sometimes ridiculous) standards of stand-by, unfilled water bottle during water parade and what nots.</p>

              <p>If you get RCP the guardhouse personnel are known to make your life difficult sometimes. And they can extend your RCP too, a right that they like to exercise sometimes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also if the commanders feel that your overall performance (or even performance in only one aspect) is bad enough, they can just recommend that you go for Performance Review Board (or the PRB). If the board feels that you're not fit to be an officer, they will OOC you, or more acurately, throw you out of OCS.</p>
              <p>But then PRB is weird. I have heard that if you know the principles of defence and attack well and they ask you, they will retain you or maybe only recourse you.</p>

              <p>They skip the obstacle that require them to land from a height. (There is a reason behind this!)</p>
              <p>Like the Ramp and Balancing Beam. I think thats all.</p>

              <p>Ok, I've been out of OCS for like slightly over 2 years now.</p>
              <p>The Mental Training, there isn't really a mental training 101 in OCS. Basically what happens is that they put you in stressful situations and give you decisions to make and they will assess you on how you respond. Once you're done, you should be a good cadet and take the initiative and get feedback from the instructors on how you fared. Some of them won't volunteer this information outright, you should take the initiative for self development.</p>
              <p>The physical training is very much a part of the mental training. As you probably know, as fatigue kicks in, some people's ability to make sound decisions really plummets. Some people just cannot function under stress.</p>
              <p>But some feedback, self reflection, i find really helps you to improve yourself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AS for that person who you met who probably coasted through OCS and thus didnt find it stressful, then thats his perogative. </p>
              <p>OCS is not the end all and be all of leadership development. Some people who have made it into OCS feel that, that is it. They have arrived. And it is possible to keep your head low dodge appointments and responsibilities and still commision to be an officer. I found many of my platoon mates and section mates who did just that. I had received 3 field major appointments, some minor ones and the highest administrative appointment, some of my platoon mates escaped with none!!! Maybe some minor admin appointment like armskote IC or toilet IC or maybe SectCom (if you find that being a Section Commander is enough for your development then i pray for the men under you in future).</p>
              <p>So it is possible to coast through OCS. But for every coin, there are two sides. You will notice that there are some who step up to the challenge, these people will ofcourse shine, especially in comparison to the other shit that is around. Generally, they will be noticed more and be given more important appointments. If you find yourself overlooked, dont be shy, ask your platoon instructors for bigger more demanding appointments (this almost never happens, most are happy to get away with as little as possible) and maybe you are one of those that shine when burdened with bigger responsibilities.</p>
              <p>You'll meet many types in OCS, some you'll be ashamed to be associated with, some you will be proud to call comrades and even some in between. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are the type to actively use your brain and if you enjoy a challenge then i wish you the best in OCS. </p>
