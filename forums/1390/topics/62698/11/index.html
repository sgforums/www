These Â“leadersÂ” were officers-to-be but sleep with the men at the same quarters. They act as a link between the men and the officers of the ship hence the word Â“mid-ship manÂ”)<br><br>If you choose to join the navy, you are not just joining a vocation but a whole new culture all together because a lot of the practices are based on ancient traditions.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Curriculum (After Tri-Service) &amp; Core Activities</strong></span><br><strong>BNT (Basic Naval Term) Â– 3 months</strong><br>- Navigation (Huge Chapter!

The team will always be led by only 1 officer, known as the Officer-of-the-Watch (OOW). The Watch Team will also comprise of Radio-Operators, Radar-Plotters, Navigators, Look-Outs, Helmsman and an Engine Room Team (Lead by an Engineering Officer). One Watch usually last for 4 hours.  </span><br><br><strong>MSTD (Midshipman Sea Training Deployment) Â– 2 months</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Basically, you will go onboard 1 of SingaporeÂ’s self designed and made LSTs and make that your home for 2 months. A typical route may consist of 3-6 port-of-calls. E.g. 2 ports @ Indonesia Â– 2 ports @ Australia Or Indonesia Â– China Â– Russia Â– S. Korea - Japan  </span><br><br>- Ocean Navigation<br>- Port Pilotage<br>- Practical Lessons on BNT Curriculum<br>- Gunnery (OTO Melara 76mm Super Rapid Gun)<br>- Ship Engines<br>- Emergency Procedures (Life Jackets, Life Rafts, Buoys)<br>- Intensive Watch-Keeping Training<br>- Port Presentations***<br>- Crossing Â– Equator Ceremony (If Any)***<br>- Home Sweet Home Event***<br><br><strong>ANT (Advanced Naval Term) Â– 3 months</strong><br>- Narrow Channel Pilotage<br>- Watch-Keeping Training (Mostly onboard Ships)<br>- Fast Craft Course (Can be conducted during BNT)<br>- In-Depth Lessons on BNT Curriculum if necessary<br>- Comex (More Intense)***<br>- Commissioning Parade Training<br><br>Note:<br>1. There will be an Exam towards the end of MSTD testing all your naval knowledge<br>2. ROR Tests are frequently carried out during all 3 Terms. (Basically, prepare to burn and drink)<br>3. Morse Code Tests will be carried every morning during the MSTD Term (E.g.  [Â… Â– Â– Â…] = [s m s])<br><br>***These are important events where Appointment Holders are usually judged very closely.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Physical Tests (Must Pass)</strong></span><br>- IPPT (No Gold No Rest)<br>- 8 or 10 Km Run with Time Limit (CanÂ’t remember if itÂ’s 8/10 and the timing)<br>- SEOC (SAFTI Endurance OC) with Time Limit<br>- IOC (Indoor OC) with Time Limit (Used to have...

Sign-On</strong><br>Most Midshipmen are regulars. There are 2 main vocations to choose from.<br>a. Naval Combat Officer<br>b. Naval Engineering Officer<br>Some Intelligence Officer Cadets go through MIDS Training also.<br><br><strong>2. Get Selected from BMT</strong><br>Quite rare. Usually less than 5 in a term. They are usually quite good in the water. E.g. National Sailors, Swimmers, Water Polo players.<br><br><strong>3. Get Selected from NDU</strong><br>These people are usually quite good performers also having gone through the NDU course.<br><br>Note: If I'm not wrong, I believed only the regulars will get posted to ships at the end of the day. NDU Officers are of course posted back to NDU. NSF Officers are usually posted to Fast Craft Squadrons upon commissioning where the uniform is usually still green.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All! My maiden post!<br><br>I'm actually graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Economics at the end of the year (Dec '06) and will be back for my summer vacation this May-Aug. Should I go for my medical checkup during my summer vacation? Or should I wait till i graduate at the end of the year? Also, I've always wanted to be an officer since I was young, so I see that now the way to OCS is through SISPEC? Is that just a recent change? So does that mean staying in Tekong for a longer period of time?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Another thing with me is that I have high uric acid content in me which causes joint pains(not serious though), my doc did tell me that when I'm going for my medical, he would give me a letter to show the MO. Would that not automatically put me out of range for pes a/b? If so, should I just withhold the information?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> 'Cause my doctor said that it can be controlled by medication and after it reaches a certain level, I can stop with the medication. As of now, I've been on the medication for 3 years and I've been reducing the level of uric acid all these while and has already seen a decrease in dosage in my medication.<br><br>Also, I heard of the tear gas training? Is that true? If so, how is the tear gas training administered? Also, is it true that with a degree, it would be easier to get into OCS, of course if I were to perform admirably well at BMT as well? Or should i say SISPEC now? And if I were to graduate in Dec, then when would I most likely be enlisted?<br>P.S. I'm not one of those nerd who mug for school like the government scholars in my school.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Thanks for all your input in advance!</div>
