Platoon appointments (CPC and CPS) are typically rotated among the cadets in the platoon so that most pple would have held a platoon appointment at least once in their time in ocs.<br>Wing appointments (CWC, CW2IC, CWSM) as well as (and especially) the school appointments on the other hand are truly reserved for the top-performers, to seive out the creme-de-la-creme.
