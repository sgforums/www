            <div class='col-md body'>MOs have their own course MOCC. Trust me it is not easy. Definitely worse than being recruit. Turn outs, alert reds etc are still happening. Most I understand are not allowed by TSR. But MOCC is different, few complain. Also the most someone collapses, so many Drs. around!!<br><br>Coming back to the point, MOCC is a 16 week stay in course, part of this course will include going to OCS for the tri- service term. So if you had done the triservice term earlier then of course you do not have to do it again.<br><br>Oh yes one more thing. Not all MOCC trainees are "rank-less". There are some that completed army first before doing medicine. Those are usually Spec and even LTAs. Unfortunately ALL Drs. have to o thru MOCC irregardless. Of course the LTAs don;t have to go thru the Tri-service term!<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am not sure where to post this but there are some doctors who become SAF officers through the NS MOCC scheme, which is different from the regular MOCC scheme.<br><br>This applies to those doctors who had served their NSF in other vocations/ranks and did not manage to disrupt for their medical course either in NUS or overseas.<br><br>This was a scheme launched by HQMC back in 95-96 I think. The first batch of NSMOCC commissioned officers graduated in 97/98.<br><br>The way this works is like this: Mindef and MOH share their data on the list of registered male medical doctors in Singapore. They narrow down those who did not get their SAF MO commissions during their NSF. These people could be rifleman, storeman, signallers, infantry officers etc. They can even be clerks and be PES E. It doesn't matter. HQMC then arranged to have these people transferred from whatever NS units to under their charge for the NS MOCC.<br><br>NSMOCC consists of two phrases spread out over two years, since ICT is limited to two weeks I believe. At least that was the case back in the late 90s. These guys would then be sent to SMM for their NS MOCC course.<br><br>They would then be commissioned as SAF MOs, and be given the rank of LTA (DR) (NS) for those medically unfit (ie PES C and below), and CPT (DR) (NS) for those PES A/B. Of course the most xiong part these fit guys have to endure is the IPPT. They don't need to take SOC.<br><br>You might think that it is a good deal, but truth is, many of these reservists don't like to go through the NS MOCC. If nothing else, it lengthens their NS cycle and the age limit from 40 to 50 years of age. They would also be given higher appointments to serve in their NS units. And many of them would rather spend their time outside than to be called back to camp for ICTs and what nots. And imagine being a cadet in your reservist time! Yes, even those LTA (NS) officers have to go through the NSMOCC, if their officer vocation before was not MO. They go through with the others who are SGTs, CPLs etc.<br><br>Many are pissed, and some have even asked HQMC if it is possible to 'fail' the course and not get their commission. One guy in the first batch did.<br><br>So for those of you studying in NUS medicine now, you may be a enlisted man/spec in your NSF, but there's no guarantee that you will not be called up for NS MOCC later in your reservist.<br><br>My 2 cents, speaking as someone who served in HQMC before.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BTW, it's almost impossible to 'fail' or go OOC for NS MOCC. That guy failed because of attitude problem. Almost of these doctors are in their late 20s to early 30s. Things might have changed now, as my info is about 5 years old.<br><br>The main reason for SAF to have this NS MOCC is to better utilize manpower. On the grand scheme of things, it looks good, since you wouldn't want to waste a doctor in wartime to fight as a trooper etc when he can be a MO.<br><br>Some of these doctors are quite happy to go through this course, since this gives them a chance to be an officer. Especially for those who wanted but failed to enter OCS when they were NSFs. Or those who went OOC during their NSF time.<br><br>Then there are those who feel disappointed. Their main gripe was that SAF wants them to be an officer only when they are qualified doctors outside.<br><br>Others complain about having their advanced medical training disrupted, since they are taking some MMed/specialty training courses outside. There were requests by this group for deferment/disruption etc.<br><br>I checked through the HQMC website, and I am surprised they didn't advertise this course under the SMM link. The closest I can find is this:<br><br>http://www.mindef.gov.sg/joint/hqmc/hqmc_mp1.html<br><br>Each NSMOCC cohort numbers around 30-40, although with deferments and all that, the actual number could be less than 20.</div>
