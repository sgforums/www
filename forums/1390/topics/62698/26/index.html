              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>does anyone know whether I will be able to get into OCS with a
              conviction. I have heard that with a conviction on record, the
              chances of getting into OCS is significantly dimished. The
              conviction is not having an exit permit, so it is a very minor
              conviction. Apart from that, my record is entirely clean.</p>
              <p>However, I have a degree in law and I train and go to the gym
              often. Please advice.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Hi Linleel, I'm glad tat you show interest in joining the officer corp.i doubt you will have issue getting into OCS if you show the right attitude and prove your worth in BMT. You have the advantage over the rest in terms of qualification criteria. Make it clear to your commander of your interest and work towards it. SITTEST plays a very important role so do well it in. I must warn you that going to gym doesnt nesscary make you combat fit. The road is vigorous and tough but fruit of labour is worth every inch of your life. You will feel that everything you did is worthwhile on the day  your parents don the epaulette onto your shoulder.</p>
              <p>However, I'll like to ask you to think through the reasons why you want to be an officer. Its important because that will establish your mental model before u even embark on the journey towards officership. The many times i want to give up, i ask myself why am i here and all is clear</p>

              <p><br>Failing JCC is not a veto factor in going OOC from the Officer Cadet Course as far as I recall. There have been officers who did not get the badge and still get their commission at the end of the course, even those who did really stupid things during the entire OCC, not just JCC.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I am a NSman who, during my NSF years, went to OCS via SISPEC BSLC and joined the service term phase II. However, and with terrible misfortune, i was unable to complete the course due to injury. Near to the end of my 2 1/2 years NSF duration, my vocation was changed to "Admin Assistant" and i am currently in a reservist infantry battalion as a rifleman. (Somehow this battalion allows service personnel to be riflemen).</p>
              <p>I had completely recovered from my injury and i wish to go for a recourse in OCS. Is that possible as a NSman?</p>

              <p>That means that you have ORDed as the most, only a CPL(man). They should have recoursed you during fulltime NSF, or at least sent you for Specialist Course to get your SGT rank. At least you'd be holding a junior commander position now.</p>
              <p>It's a pity, but there is no such thing as OCT training in reservist. You will remain a man till ROD!</p>

The fact that you crossed over from from SISPEC BSLC to OCS indicated that you performed extremely well within 2% of the BSLC cohort. Why didnt they even send you to complete your ASLC or Pro-term SCS after ooced from OCS?

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I am a NSman who, during my NSF years, went to OCS via SISPEC
                  BSLC and joined the service term phase II. However, and with
                  terrible misfortune, i was unable to complete the course due to
                  injury. Near to the end of my 2 1/2 years NSF duration, my vocation
                  was changed to "Admin Assistant" and i am currently in a reservist
                  infantry battalion as a rifleman. (Somehow this battalion allows
                  service personnel to be riflemen).</p>
              <p>I had completely recovered from my injury and i wish to go for a
                  recourse in OCS. Is that possible as a NSman?</p>

              <p>That's very unfortunate. I don't think SAF wants to pay for your OCS stint and release you back to civilian life. I guess you'll have to sign on, and if you don't want to serve too long then resign from SAF? Nice way to take a break from working life and go back to the chong sua lifestyle.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Heaven_wisher, the potential to be a commander (officer or specialist) is assessed from the day you go for your medical checkup. And you are assessed from day 1 of BMT - not necessarily in a formal way but more the perceptions formed of you from the first moment you meet your peers and instructors - hence the first impressions are important. Things like IPPT, SIT-test, etc are the platforms on which you are formally assessed, to ensure you have both the hard and soft skills requirements to make it as an officer.</p></div>
