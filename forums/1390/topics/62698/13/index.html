If u got Dip/A-levels, higher chance of going into OCS. But other than that, u still can get in, provided u are damn garang, and ur PC recommends u strongly. It sure helps if u get Coy best too.<br><br>As for that computer test, it probably helps in a limited extent bah.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most people who are in OCS get above 70% for peer appraisal and SIT test examinations. Also, the computer test plays quite a big part in deciding if you get into OCS. Good A level grades, especially S papers will tip the scales in your favour too.</div>
