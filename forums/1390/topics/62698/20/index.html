              <p>Hello all.</p>
              <p>Will be entering the next batch of Air Wing for AFST as a pilot trainee, skipping tri-service common leadership module though. Anyone here able to fill me in on how life as an air cadet would be like and things I would have to take note of?</p>
              <p>For starters I was from 01/08 BMT and just POPed from 47th BSLC, and compared to what i've heard about OCS, the amount of discipline and regimentation is far less in BMTC and SISPEC.</p>
              <p>Any tips and all would be much appreciated...thanks in advance</p>

              <p>Officer vocations in the RSAF</p>
              <p>Pilot, WSO ( Fighter, C3, UAV, ADA), Air Maintenance Officer (AMO), Air Engineering Officer (AEO)</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>OCS AIR WING CADET  PATH</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>Common Leadership Module (2 weeks) - 1 bar cadet</strong></p>
              <p>All ocs cadets go through this phase regardless of which service
              you signed up for. All pilot trainees would have completed Air-grading
              prior to entering OCS. During CLM, you can EI (express interest) to
              join the WSO (ADA) (Air defence artillery) course as an NSF. If you are
              in the march or september OCS batch,  you may be lucky enough to be
              called up (~40pax.) for the COMPASS test at CMPB even if you have not
              signed on with the Airforce. Eventually 20 people from the original 40
              will attend an interview that will test your oral skills (clarity of
              voice and pronounciation) and you will be asked some questions about
              yourself. 10 out of the 20 will be called up for a medical chcekup in
              which a final 4-5 will be selected to undergo WSO (C3) training as an
              NSF.</p>
              <p><strong>Airforce Service Term (7 weeks) - 2 bar cadet</strong></p>
              <p>All
              cadets of the already mentioned vocations then enter air wing where u
              will undergo many hours of countless lectures of general airforce
              knowledge. There will be 2 exams and failure usually means having to
              stay back on weekends. Physical training is not a priority although
              there will still be some PT lessons and you will have to complete the
              SEOC at least once. There will also be a 12km route march and a NAVEX
              at mandai. Weapons training only includes the p226 pistol (handling,
              stripping, and live shoot).</p>
              <p><strong>Airforce Professional Term (Length Varies) - 3 bar cadet</strong></p>
              <p>Everything
              up to this stage is the same for all vocations, the pro term for
              Airforce cadets are very different for each vocation due to the
              specialised intensive training they have to undergo. All vocations will
              initially enter Airforce School (AFS)which is at PLAB.</p>
              <p>Pilot</p>
              <p>All
              cadet pilots will wait in AFS until they go for their JST (jungle
              survival training) in brunei. They will then attend ground school in
              AFS and then head to Pearce in Australia for the basic wings course and
              pass out as LTA. After that, they will be streamed to Fighter, Chopper
              or Transport courses. Total length 2-3 years.</p>
              <p>WSO (FTR)</p>
              <p>You
              may undergo training as a WSO (ADA) and then commission as an officer
              before you are sent to the USA for the WSO (FTR) training. If not you
              might attend the course in France as a cadet (I'm not really sure about
              this one).</p>
              <p>WSO (UAV)</p>
              <p>You spend a few weeks in AFS doing
              mostly theory lessons and then its off to Murai Camp for the UAV
              training. Total length 9 months pro term.</p>
              <p>WSO (ADA) + WSO (C3) - total length 6 months pro term.</p>
              <p>Both courses will attend a 2 weeks integrated course to attain
              knowledge common to both vocations. Following which they will split
              into their respective courses.</p>
              <p>WSO (ADA)</p>
              <p>Depending on the
              time of the year, all ADA cadets will go through a common phase before
              being streamed off to one of five different weapon systems (35 mm gun,
              rapier, RBS 70, mistral, iHAWK). ADA cadets go through a lot of
              physical training and runs at the  SOC ground. Technical knowledge of
              the weapons systems and tactics employed are also taught during this
              phase.</p>
              <p>WSO (C3)</p>
              <p>All NSF will undergo the Aerodrome course
              where you will be trained in tower control. Regulars will be streamed
              off to 3 different courses after a 2 week C3 common phase (Aerodrome,
              Radar or Weapons). Radar course teaches you the basics of Air -traffic
              control. Weapons control teaches you the basics of how to control
              aircraft engaging in air to air combat situations (eg. dogfight).</p>
              <p>AMO and AEO</p>
              <p>Will
              attend theory lessons in AFS, AEO will commission after 6 months of pro
              term and then head to uni for degree studies, AMO will remain for
              further training at AFS.</p>
              <p><strong>Joint Term (3 weeks)</strong></p>
              <p>All
              WSO (UAV, ADA, C3) and AEO will attend the 3 week course at OCS again.
              They will undergo integrated lectures and workshops with the army and
              navy. The final 2 weeks of joint term is for commissioning parade
              rehearsals. They will then pass out as 2LTs.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I couldn't find a guide to OCS as an AIRFORCE cadet so I'm contributing one to the best of my knowledge.</p>
              <p>Officer vocations in the RSAF</p>
              <p>Pilot, WSO ( Fighter, C3, UAV, ADA), Air Maintenance Officer (AMO), Air Engineering Officer (AEO)</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>OCS AIR WING CADET  PATH</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>Common Leadership Module (2 weeks) - 1 bar cadet</strong></p>
              <p>All ocs cadets go through this phase regardless of which service you signed up for. All pilot trainees would have completed Air-grading prior to entering OCS. During CLM, you can EI (express interest) to join the WSO (ADA) (Air defence artillery) course as an NSF. If you are in the march or september OCS batch,  you may be lucky enough to be called up (~40pax.) for the COMPASS test at CMPB even if you have not signed on with the Airforce. Eventually 20 people from the original 40 will attend an interview that will test your oral skills (clarity of voice and pronounciation) and you will be asked some questions about yourself. 10 out of the 20 will be called up for a medical chcekup in which a final 4-5 will be selected to undergo WSO (C3) training as an NSF.</p>
              <p><strong>Airforce Service Term (7 weeks) - 2 bar cadet</strong></p>
              <p>All cadets of the already mentioned vocations then enter air wing where u will undergo many hours of countless lectures of general airforce knowledge. There will be 2 exams and failure usually means having to stay back on weekends. Physical training is not a priority although there will still be some PT lessons and you will have to complete the SEOC at least once. There will also be a 12km route march and a NAVEX at mandai. Weapons training only includes the p226 pistol (handling, stripping, and live shoot).</p>
              <p><strong>Airforce Professional Term (Length Varies) - 3 bar cadet</strong></p>
              <p>Everything up to this stage is the same for all vocations, the pro term for Airforce cadets are very different for each vocation due to the specialised intensive training they have to undergo. All vocations will initially enter Airforce School (AFS)which is at PLAB.</p>
              <p>Pilot</p>
              <p>All cadet pilots will wait in AFS until they go for their JST (jungle survival training) in brunei. They will then attend ground school in AFS and then head to Pearce in Australia for the basic wings course and pass out as LTA. After that, they will be streamed to Fighter, Chopper or Transport courses. Total length 2-3 years.</p>
              <p>WSO (FTR)</p>
              <p>You may undergo training as a WSO (ADA) and then commission as an officer before you are sent to the USA for the WSO (FTR) training. If not you might attend the course in France as a cadet (I'm not really sure about this one).</p>
              <p>WSO (UAV)</p>
              <p>You spend a few weeks in AFS doing mostly theory lessons and then its off to Murai Camp for the UAV training. Total length 9 months pro term.</p>
              <p>WSO (ADA) + WSO (C3) - total length 6 months pro term.</p>
              <p>Both courses will attend a 2 weeks integrated course to attain knowledge common to both vocations. Following which they will split into their respective courses.</p>
              <p>WSO (ADA)</p>
              <p>Depending on the time of the year, all ADA cadets will go through a common phase before being streamed off to one of five different weapon systems (35 mm gun, rapier, RBS 70, mistral, iHAWK). ADA cadets go through a lot of physical training and runs at the  SOC ground. Technical knowledge of the weapons systems and tactics employed are also taught during this phase.</p>
              <p>WSO (C3)</p>
              <p>All NSF will undergo the Aerodrome course where you will be trained in tower control. Regulars will be streamed off to 3 different courses after a 2 week C3 common phase (Aerodrome, Radar or Weapons). Radar course teaches you the basics of Air -traffic control. Weapons control teaches you the basics of how to control aircraft engaging in air to air combat situations (eg. dogfight).</p>
              <p>AMO and AEO</p>
              <p>Will attend theory lessons in AFS, AEO will commission after 6 months of pro term and then head to uni for degree studies, AMO will remain for further training at AFS.</p>
              <p><strong>Joint Term (3 weeks)</strong></p>
              <p>All WSO (UAV, ADA, C3) and AEO will attend the 3 week course at OCS again. They will undergo integrated lectures and workshops with the army and navy. The final 2 weeks of joint term is for commissioning parade rehearsals. They will then pass out as 2LTs.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><br>Correction to the WSO (C3) part. Currently, regulars in pro term will be going to either ATC Radar or Weapons. As for Areodrome course, it is for the NSF and the Regulars upgraders (already commissioned officers)</p>

              <p>Hello, I would like to know some things about OCS.</p>
              <p>Firstly, the MAPAS test at CMPB, is this used to assess one on which vocation he goes to, or whether he gets specialist or officer?</p>
              <p>During BMT itself, what are the avenues open to recruits to signal their wish to get into OCS? Also, if one hopes to continue his service and make the army his career, is there a higher chance he will get into OCS?</p>
