              <p>This means your posting will be base on what posting you would have gotten base on your previous BMT results so you do not need to care about when the intakes are cause if you are posted to OCS, you can be sent to OCS to helpout as a clerk etc while waiting for the new intake. If you are not OCS material, regardless when is the intake also will not affect you.</p>

              <p>Hi, all!</p>
              <p>Just a question, does signing on with the SAF guarantee me a place in OCS? I have asked my uncle who's an LTC in the Army, he says that signing on with will guarantee me a place in OCS. However, when I went to the Army Open House last month, they said that this does not necessarily hold true, and I will have to get into OCS by my own merit.</p>

              <p>But what if I sign on even before I go to BMT, and my application is accepted? Will I be guaranteed a place in OCS if that happens? Even if the answer is "no", will my chances of getting in increase?</p>

              <p>There will be more than 1 chance but generally you have to pass IPPT to even enter OCS. I do know of officers who return to SAF after uni who failed their IPPT but they are required to pass if not they cannot be promoted etc.</p>
              <p>Regarding SOC i am unsure but after all the training in BMT and OCS, you should be able to pass it sooner or later.</p>
              <p>Most of the OCT dropouts are more due to medical or conduct reasons.</p>

              <p>I've decided to sign on as an officer after much considerations and research.</p>
              <p>My enlistment is next week @ Tekong, and i just sent in my application through online. And yes, i'm a diploma holder.</p>
              <p>Putting aside what am i required to do to prove myself to be worthy for officership and admission to OCS, i've some questions to enquire.</p>
              <p>I understand that within 48 hours, the PC would have a interview with the recruit, am i right?</p>
              <p>Q1. Is this the one and only interview that the PC would talk to the recruit, or there's another interview session? Is this the time where i voice out my interests to sign on as an officer?</p>
              <p>Q2. As my intake is a JC batch intake, would my diploma cert put me at a very disadvantage position among the recruits who had a A' Level cert?</p>
              <p>Thanks in advance for your response.</p>

              <p>Besides the initial PC interview, there will be about 1 every 3-4 wks and you can express your interest to ur officer anytime but you do have to qualify for OCS if not interest will bring you nowhere.</p>
              <p>Officer selection has nothing to do with whether you are JC or poly student so there should be no disadvantage to talk about.</p>

              <p>So am i right to say that there will be more interview session with PC other than the initial on within 48 hours? Cos i was told by the recruitment officer that i should voice out to the PC should i want to sign on during BMT phase.</p>
              <p>I've heard that JC batches have more intake for OCS. Probably it's a myth i guess?</p>

              <p>There will be more as mentioned.</p>
              <p>The number should be relatively similar since once a person enter a leadership batch, JC or poly should not affect their chances of entering command school. Leadership is not something that JC or poly can teach so its how u perform that will determine your chances.</p>
