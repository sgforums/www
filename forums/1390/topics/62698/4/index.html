            <div class='col-md body'>You can be selected as an Int Officer in three ways.<br><br>1) Earmarked during your OCS cadet days (my experience).<br>2) Selected during your unit days by your CO.<br>3) Selected during ICT's by your CO.<br><br>G2 Mindef sends out a request for short list to CO's and that usually starts the selection process.<br><br>In all cases you must first attend School of Basic Military Inteliigence. If you are in fulltime NS it is about a 7 week course comprising classes, tests and field exercises including a field exercise overseas (in my day was Starlight). If you are reservist in ICT it is a short course with no overseas field trips. If you are in fulltime NS it is normal to be selected to attend Int school with less than 6 months to your ORD; i.e. normally only LTA's and above undergo this course. 90% of Int course candidates are regulars. Of the NSmen that attend Int course during fulltime NS or for that matter during ICT, virtually all are top 20% OCS graduates.<br><br>Int Officers at the battalion level are combat S2's. Reporting and attached to the CO, you also have responsibility to deploy and manage battalion Int resources including the scout platoon. You are expected to be a full combat soldier in addition to your battalion HQ responsibilties, and you carry FBO along with your Int equipment.<br><br>To advance to Division and Brigade level Int you have to attend the Advanced Military Int course, at which you are prepared for G2 responsibilities. Although a combat vocation, you will be less likely to see front line action than at the battalion level as you will typically be attached to div or brigade HQ, which is normally behind Battalion HQ's.<br><br>Basically combat Int officers have to have a sound field ability and be able to: recognise terrain and useage very well, plan, organize, recall and evaluate enemy tactics and armaments, and be able to navigate well as they are often relied upon by Battalion commanders to navigate to objectives by map and compass. The ability to conduct good ops orders is also a valued characteristic as Int officers conduct the Int portion for Battalion orders.<br><br>As with any vocation you are interested in, it helps to mention to your OC/CO that you have the interest and let them decide if they will put your name forward for evaluation and consideration. Int officers also undergo additional security clearances as you may often receive privilliged or secret information.</div>
