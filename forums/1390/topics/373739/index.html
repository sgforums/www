Is our posting anything to do with them? do they choose or recommend our postings to CMPB? or ithas nothing to do with them at all? i heard from my friend that the mono-intake's postings are choosen by their superiors but im not sure bout tekong. anyone can clear my doubts.</p></div>

              <p>How can mono intake posting be chosen by their superiors when they dunno each other before they were posted there and mono intake people are stuck in the same vocation for the rest of their NS life.</p>
              <p>SC, PS, PC can only recommend for command school i believe but not your actual vocational posting. They always say they will recommend the lazy people for infantry la, help those who wanna get a vocation their vocation etc etc but end up i hardly hear anyone saying they got what their superiors 'threaten' or 'recommended' them for.</p>

              <p>Ur sec com and ps and pc dont decide where u go. They can recommend, but thats all. Sometimes if they dun recommend u can still end there. Ur posting is decided entirely by cmpb.</p>
              <p>They look at a few factors; namely bmt results (all the tests), peer appraisal, and commander recommendation. And this is the sucky part. They look at ur academic results also. So, if u and another guy have roughly the same bmt results, he will get into ocs or sispec if he got better academic results. Even if u are better than him, he still has higher chance than u. This fact is not spoken and never admitted by them, but its true. </p>
              <p>And by the way, ur vocational assessment also counts. The computer test u did at cmpb after ur medical? Ya, dun screw that up or u MIGHT get into a shitty vocation.</p>

              <p>Mono u cannot choose what u do. U are stuck as whatever vocation you are posted to which is generally combat. You will only 'change' vocation if you downgrade due to medical reasons.</p>

              <p>Mono intake they pass out from? Unless they were medically deem unfit and failed their course, sort of kick out by their units, they can't be revocated. Some might be given dual vocation like i have friends who were guards/drivers etc but to be completely revocated, its almost always due to medical reasons. Medical problems don't always lead to down PES even if it usually does.</p>
              <p>Your vocation has nothing to do with your IPPT, SOC or your own fitness. It just generally means you don't qualify for command school but any vocation should be open to you.</p>
