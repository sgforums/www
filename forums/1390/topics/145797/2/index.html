            <div class='col-md body'>I think the most underrated units are the logistics guys and the infantry.  Why?  The logistics guys almost always kena because this or that store missing even though it's probably because the unit that borrrowed it didn't return the stuff or didn't account for it properly.  That said at least they usually get a pretty routine work day.<br><br>Infantry cuz the Guards and Cdo get all the glory.  But lets face it, besides the rappelling bit, the infantry does pretty much everything else the gaurds do.  And they don't even get the LSV.  At least with some of CE units you get hazard pay.<br><br>Overrated?  Gaurds lah.  Special coloured berets with cap badge backing, LSV, guards shoulder tab, etc.  At the end of the day, they are infantry too right?  They charge hills just like infantry.  The do fibua and fofo, just like infantry.  They do heliborne, costal hook and joint amour assault ops, just like infantry.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think we were refering to the TKD badge. UC was once no more than TKD. Hence the reference to the TKD badge as UC. I don't think they will be ever be issuing badges for UC. It would be pointless since it would be so very common, and so very difficult to fail.</div>
