            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/armynews/image/issuePic/1_36.jpg">1st Battalion Singapore Infantry Regiment (1 SIR) is SAFÂ’s oldest infantry unit. It moved to Mandai Hill Camp on 30 September from Guillemard Camp, where it has resided for the past 34 years. Before the move, ex-Leopards* who previously held command positions in 1 SIR gathered for a reunion on 23 September. The reunion allowed the ex-Leopards to think fondly of the good old days at the Home of the Leopards and to bid farewell to Guillemard Camp.<br><br>Formed in March 1957, 1 SIR has had an illustrious history that stretches from the colonial years under the British rule to today. In the early days of SingaporeÂ’s independence, 1 SIR played a crucial role in maintaining internal security. From racial riots to refugee problems, 1 SIR was closely involved in operations to establish peace and stability in our fledging country. As SAF grew in strength, 1 SIRÂ’s role evolved and expanded, taking on other tasks. With todayÂ’s terrorism threat, 1 SIR is also involved in protecting SingaporeÂ’s installations and combating terrorism.<br><br>The LeopardsÂ’ Homecoming reunion on 23 September included a walk down memory lane, a simple dinner and plenty of catching up as the ex-Leopards gathered for the last time at Guillemard Camp. The ex-Leopards felt especially nostalgic as they viewed old photographs, newspaper cuttings and trophies that 1 SIR had amassed over the years. Fond memories of 1 SIR flooded back as they reminded one another of interesting stories of their time at Guillemard Camp.<br><br>COL (Ret) John Morrice, 1st Commanding Officer of 1 SIR said: Â“I feel nostalgic. I suppose itÂ’s because I have been with Guillemard Camp for so many years. This camp has been here since a very long time. Now that 1 SIR is going to move to a new camp, I feel a certain sense of loss.Â”<br><br>The current Leopards at Guillemard Camp also feel a tinge of sadness. SSG Surendra Gupta, a CSM at 1 SIR said: Â“We won the Best Combat Unit Competition in 1998. There are many fond memories here at Guillemard Camp. We feel emotionally attached to this place because this is where we have gelled and performed so well together.Â”<br><br>While the ex-Leopards remembered their time at Guillemard Camp, MAJ Desmond Tan, Commanding Officer of 1 SIR was looking to the future of 1 SIR. He said: Â“We have a rich and illustrious history. At the new camp, we intend to set up a heritage room to preserve our history. I can use interesting stories of past happenings at Guillemard Camp to educate my soldiers on our rich heritage and bring out the sense of pride in them.Â”<br><br></div>
