              <p>Hi. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Honest</span> answers please! I don't need confident boosters, I need facts.</p>
              <p>Question: Could anyone fill me in on what it's like in the army? I'm going to enlist very soon, and colleagues at my workplace have been filling me in with all sorts of stuff like how your comrades would hold "blanket parties" for you if they dislike you, etc.
              I figured that these might be the usual antics of childish people, but when you're that old(18+), things don't come off as just playing.</p>
              <p>So, anyone? Are there lots of bullying and stuff in the army nowadays? And is the commander like very unfair, etc?
              I am aware that it varies from person to person but if anyone knows anything, maybe you can fill me in because I really want to have a <strong>mental preparation</strong>.</p>
              <p>Why do I think this way? Well, I heard army used to be <strong><em>hell</em></strong> in the past from older people. <em>Sorry if I come off as a chicken though.</em></p>

              <p>Thanks for the advice. Maybe I'll do just that.</p>
              <p>I <strong>really</strong> want to hear from the soldiers themselves though. Hearing what they have to say to <em>my</em> questions would make me feel better and more trusting on their words.</p>
              <p>Besides, I accept answers like, "Yes, army's tough and people in it do this and that." or, "No. The army's a nicer place than it was a decade ago.". I get your point though. I can just search for topics similar to my question.</p>
              <p>Still, any kinder soldiers out there who can give this worried pre-enlistee some pointers?</p>

              <p>Seriously, just run through that thread. You can post specific questions related to specific queries if need be in that thread..</p>
              <p>I may create a new BMT queries thread should I have the time; that thread is already overloaded.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, this thread is closed, or otherwise this forum will be overloaded with too many similar topics.</p>
