            <div class='col-md body'>I've posted this in sgforums: military nuts and speaker's corner, but thought that this forum might get me some additional (and non-overlapping) coverage.<br><br>Please take a look at this <a href="http://singaporerelief.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">new blog: Singapore Tsunami Relief Effort</a> I've started a few days ago to chronicle Singapore's relief efforts in the region.<br><br>As is well known to every reader of Straits Times Interactive, news articles are accessible for a total of four--four miserly days (Channel News Asia keep their stuff for 8 days, not much better). Articles in the Straits Times archive is available at a S$2/article fee or a S$900 for a yearly subscription for the service at the SPH (Singapore Press Holding) Newslink.<br><br>But apart from ST and CNA, Singapore's relief efforts are hardly ever reported by the international media.<br><br>I am appealing to any kind souls out there who saved ST stories relating to Singapore's relief effort (both official and private) from 26 Dec 2004 to 5 Jan 2005. It will greatly help me in putting this blog together. Please help if you can by emailing any relevant ST stories you have in the above stated time frame to me at loyhc@berkeley.edu. Thank you!<br><br><a href="http://As%20long%20as%20it%20is%20not%20classified" rel="nofollow">As long as it is not classified</a>.<br><br>* * * * *<br><br>Since starting this past Saturday, I've already covered much of the SAF in Meulaboh, SCDF in Phuket, the medical teams in Sri Lanka, the Singapore Red Cross. (See this post for a quick review.) I am still hoping to post, among other things:<br><br>- An overview of the official and private donation and collection drives that brought in the tens of millions of dollars and whole container loads of supplies,<br><br>- The efforts of the religious groups and other NGOs,<br><br>- The employers who did their bit to help their workers who are from the affected countries,<br><br>- Statistics: number of personnel involved in the various locations, amount of money raised, sent or spent, amount of material shipped, etc.<br><br>- (non-classified) First-hand accounts from servicemen who were sent on relief missions.<br><br>So please help by sending me stories or passing the word around.<br>Thank you!</div>

It's a great tragedy but on the contrary, I don't think the local media have sensationalized anything one bit. The reporters on the ground are just providing first-hand account; I'm sure there's one or two who come across as novice eye-openers (blame it on sheltered lives &amp; mundane news beat) but overall IMO they're doing a great job. Now, deploying a Sumiko Tan or a Janice Wong would've likely make an irritating read - but that's just me ~lol~<br><br>Sure, the focus is S'porean but then no local media agency (other than CNA, I suppose) have pretensions about a wider pan-Asian viewpoint - incidentally, that's why the latest Time Magazine was so chauvinistic to me in its photo coverage. More than that, those embedded with the HATF people to Aceh are giving a rare narrative of a large-scale SAF military operation in action.<br><br>I think the readers are generally smart enough to keep things in perspective, even as some may become fatigued at the length &amp; depth of the news coverage. Plenty of pointers here &amp; there for mental reorientation, for example:-<br><br>- the AWSJ article which the ST reprinted a few days back, which gave a brief but fair summary on what the SAF did in Meuloboh (essentially open up air links, then sea links, then road links to the devastated area, while ferrying relief supplies &amp; personnel).<br><br>- another's a Cedric Foo comment, about "everything's being done in crisis mode, at breakneck speed [by us]".<br><br>- tracing back, it would appear that the SAF 1st sent the mobilization order down the ranks on 28th Dec: the 1st C130 plane flew out that day, the choppers/medical teams/SCDF personnel would fly out the next 2 days (to 3 countries), &amp; the LST fully loaded a day later.<br><br>- SAF activity in Sumatra is concentrated only in Banda Aceh &amp; Meulaboh, with a 3rd city, Medan, another pickup point for RSAF flights flying to those 2 cities.<br><br>- a World Food Programme press release stated how 10 days after the tsunami (i.e. Jan 4, the day LHL flew out to get a 1st-hand look), aid was reached to only a <strong>quarter</strong> of the survivors, &amp; how transport was still being limited to choppers &amp; hovercrafts given the ground inaccessibility plus the occasional aftershock/monsoon that were causing flash floods &amp; rough weather.<br><br>I didn't find it too difficult to digest these bits of reality checks at all.</div>

See this post:<br><br><a href="http://singaporerelief.blogspot.com/2005/01/non-local-press-coverage-updated.html" rel="nofollow">http://singaporerelief.blogspot.com/2005/01/non-local-press-coverage-updated.html</a><br><br>And this is despite the fact that the SAF was just about the first to be on the scene helping the TNI. While the American media was still squabbling about whether the Bush Admin. was too stingy, the first LST was already on its way to Meulaboh. While the US Marines were still negiotiating with the Indonesians about whether they should carry their weapons on shore, the SAF has already built the landing sites, and by the time they did come ashore, the second LST has already been there for 4 days!.<br><br>I would be hesitant to call the people in SAF "heroes"--mostly because I suspect that they would be hesitant about that themselves. I tend to think that as far as they are concern, they are merely doing their job. But I salute them for doing their part, for doing what we as a country <a href="http://should" rel="nofollow">should</a> do. They--and all the NGO volunteers, land rover drivers, SCDF officers, and everyone else who contributed--are examples for the rest of us.</div>
