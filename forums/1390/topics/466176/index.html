              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>I am in a AC Logistics Branch with effect from Jan 2013. I

Even though I am a non-combat soldier doing administrative/ logistics matters, I drag myself to camp daily. I admit that it's a rather good camp indeed. Welfare. Quite lobo 8-5 work-life balance. But this mandatory/ compulsory NS does not suit me.</p>
              <p>I have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osgood%E2%80%93Schlatter_disease">OSD</a>/ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea">OSA (sleep apnea)</a> whereby I have problems <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_sleep">recovery deep sleeping</a> to sleep well, to rest and relax effectively well.<br><br>I had a medical appointment with TTSH today. Even

              <p><em><strong>Being psychologically prepared is all about knowing
              what to expect and being prepared for it.</strong></em></p>
              <p>To be better prepared, you can participate in Total Defence
              activities and Open Houses organised by the SAF/SPF/SCDF.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you should also talk to your family members and friends
              who have lived the NS experience. The more you discuss with others,
              the more comfortable and mentally prepared you’ll become.</p>
              <p><strong>Because NS life is different from civilian life before
              enlistment, there are many adjustments you need to
              make.</strong></p>
              <p>A good way to cope is to get support from your buddy and fellow
              recruits. They are going through the same tough training as you, so
              talking to one another will help relieve some tension.</p>
              <p>In most evenings during your leisure time, you’ll also have some
              time to call your family or loved ones to talk. They can give you
              emotional support during NS.</p>
              <p>You can have a one-on-one interview sessions with your officer
              to highlight any problems you may have. If you have a personal or
              family problem that need to be addressed, do let the officer
              know—he may be able to give you some advice or time off to settle
              your problems.</p>
              <p>Life in NS revolves around structure, routine and discipline.
              This helps us stay united as a uniformed organisation as well as
              imparts the rigours necessary to protect our nation and
              citizens.</p>
              <p>This does not mean there is just work and no play. In fact,
              after a few weeks in NS and you’ll find new friends and new reasons
              to smile!</p>
              <p><strong>As a soldier, one of the biggest adjustments you’ll have
              to make quickly is in regimentation and discipline.</strong></p>
              <p>Being in a uniformed organisation, you’ll have to obey orders
              from your superiors. Thus some of you may feel a sudden lack of
              freedom to do what you want and you may find yourself having
              difficulties accepting authority initially.</p>
              <p>Regimentation and discipline build strong character and
              toughness, so that you’ll be tough enough to handle difficult
              combat, crime-fighting or rescue situations without giving up or
              breaking down.</p>
              <p>When you first enlist into NS, you may have concerns of being in
              a new territory, with new faces and new things to do. But don’t let
              this get to you. Just remember the saying that “when the going gets
              tough, the tough gets going”.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Following are some
              tips on what you can do to prepare yourself
              psychologically:</em></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Adopt a positive perception</li>
              <li>Build up physical stamina</li>
              <li>Develop good working attitude and habits</li>
              <li>Overcome psychological stress</li>
              <li>Adopt teamwork spirit</li>
              <li>Learn to be independent</li>
              <li>Set realistic expectations</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can also speak to your friends or family members who have
              been through NS. Ask them to share their stories. The sharing will
              help you reduce some of your fears, uncertainties and doubts.</p>
              <p><strong>During NS you’ll be living with different
              people.</strong></p>
              <p>Because these people come from different backgrounds, they may
              not think like you do or react to situations like you would.
              Instead of trying to select your type of people, you should cherish
              the diversity. This is a chance for you to learn more about your
              fellow mates and their cultures.</p>
              <p>You’ll find that you have many opportunities to absorb the
              different cultures—during training, eating, chatting or just seeing
              and listening. Take these opportunities and learn from people
              around you, you’ll have a much better appreciation of Singapore’s
              cultural diversity.</p>

              <p><br> The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) is a 2,000-bed acute tertiary
                                psychiatric hospital situated on a 25-hectare campus at
                                Buangkok Green Medical Park. Set amidst serene surroundings,
                                IMH offers a comprehensive range of psychiatric, rehabilitative and
                                counselling services for children, adolescents, adults, and the
                                elderly.</p>
              <p>IMH’s tradition of care started in 1928. We were the first
                                mental hospital in Singapore, starting with some 1,000 patients.
                                Since then, many advances have been made in treatment, training,
                                and research. Our treatment integrates evidence-based therapies,
                                supported by the departments of clinical psychology, nursing,
                                occupational therapy, and medical social work, to provide holistic
                                care for our patients. IMH is equipped with modern facilities, with
                                50 wards for inpatients and seven Specialist Outpatient
                                Clinics.</p>
              <p>IMH was the first mental health institution in Asia to receive
                                the Joint Commission International Accreditation in 2005, a highly
                                coveted international accreditation for healthcare
                                organisations. </p>
              <p>Over the years, IMH has gained a reputation for quality
                                research. In 2008, the Ministry of Health,
                                Singapore, entrusted IMH with a S$25 million research
                                grant to implement translational and clinical research into the
                                causes of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.</p>
              <p>IMH also plays a key role in training the next generation of
                                mental health professionals in Singapore. We train psychiatrists
                                and mental health professionals through the NHG-AHPL Residency
                                Programme for psychiatry and through collaborations with the local
                                tertiary institutions.</p>

              <p>Minister of State for Health Dr Amy Khor announced in Parliament
                                on Monday two new community-based mental health initiatives
                                designed to improve Singaporeans' access to mental
                                healthcare.<br> <br> "We are developing Assessment and Shared Care Teams (ASCAT), which
                                are specialist-led mental health teams based in the community, in
                                order to improve access to mental health care. We are also
                                developing Community Mental Health Intervention Teams (COMIT) to
                                provide improved access to counselling and psychotherapy services
                                in the community," said Dr Khor.<br> <br> Dr Khor also said that the Institute of Mental Health's (IMH)
                                occupancy rate for the past three years averaged at about 80 per
                                cent and that the hospital has sufficient capacity for new
                                patients.<br> <br> There are currently about 2,000 beds across public hospitals in
                                Singapore dedicated to mental health patients, with the majority in
                                IMH.<br> <br> Responding to queries from Member of Parliament Mr Hri Kumar Nair
                                on the criteria for admitting patients to IMH, Dr. Khor said those
                                with conditions such as schizophrenia and depression may be
                                admitted for closer monitoring.</p>

              <p><em>What are the changes to your lifestyle, diet and
              exercise?</em><br> <br> Firstly, you are strongly advised to eat oats (instant/ quick-cook)
              as heavy breakfast, and greatly reduce eating fried foods and junk
              foods.<br> <br> Secondly, please start cardio exercising.<br> Start from light to gradual to moderate.<br> e.g. brisk walking, then fast walking, then slow jogging, then
              jogging.<br> <br> Thirdly, if you drink alcohol/ smoke tobacco, please quit.<br> <br> It's best that by changing your lifestyle, your BP will gradually
              stablise and be within normal range. Doctors advise that to manage
              BP effectively, it's optimal to change your lifestyle, next is to
              reduce drug dosage, and finally be completely off medicine.</p>
              <p>That's why I strongly urge you to eat oats (instant/
              quick-cook).<br> 3 big scoops (Chinese soup spoon) into a bowl.<br> Just add boiling water to 70% full.<br> Cover the bowl with a plate and wait 10 to 15 minutes.<br> Add water to 100% full, and consume at lukewarm.<br> Fast and easy-to-make breakfast.<br> <br> Never ever skip breakfast.<br> Start off the day by having a heavy breakfast.<br> Have lunch at 70% full.<br> Have dinner at 30% full. If still hungry, eat oats.<br> If possible, drink <span><em>Pu</em>'<em>er/ oolong</em> tea
              (<em>without sugar</em>) daily</span>.<br> <br> Why I recommend you this?<br> My parents have HBP since first known 2 years ago.<br> And now, their BP is well-maintain with this 1st step in a simple
              change in diet/ lifestyle.</p>

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The military justice system is based on the SAF Act, which was implemented in 1972. All servicemen are subjected to the SAF Act, SAF Regulations, and orders of whatever form issued pursuant to them.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">While discipline is paramount in the military, not all offences committed by SAF servicemen are dealt with by formal investigations and charges. Essentially, offenders can be dealt with either by way of informal or formal punishment systems.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"> <br>3. Informal Punishment System<br>Commanders are empowered to mete out informal punishments like push-ups and weekend confinement to servicemen who have committed disciplinary breaches, like being late, sluggish, or improperly dressed.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">4. Formal Punishment System<br>If the offence that a serviceman committed is of a more serious nature, he may be formally dealt with by his disciplinary officer by way of a summary trial, or brought before a subordinate military court (more commonly known as the General Court Martial or GCM).</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">(a) Summary Trial</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The offences that can be dealt with by summary trial are essentially military offences, such as absence without leave (AWOL), non-compliance with lawful orders or insubordination.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">Depending on the rank of the serviceman in question, and the type of the disciplinary body hearing the case, the possible sentences that may be imposed can vary, and these can include fines or detention.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The summary trial is carried out in accordance with relevant SAF regulations, and the records of the summary trial are sent to the office of the Director, Legal Services of the SAF.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">(b) General Court Martial</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The General Court Martial exists as a separate forum from that of the summary trial. Unlike the summary trial, the GCM can deal with a wider range of offences, and can impose a wider range of punishments including imprisonment and discharge, on top of sentences like detention and fines. The GCM is also a more public and open forum, and its proceedings are conducted using similar legal rules and procedures as those used in a civil criminal court.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">Generally, only serious offences investigated by the Military Police Command, and which are referred to the office of the Director of Legal Services, will result in the accused serviceman being charged in a GCM. In such a case, a military prosecutor will draw up a formal charge sheet and present it before the GCM.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">General Courts Martial can be further sub-divided into two categories, namely the Panel Courts Martial - consisting of a President and usually two other members, and Judge Courts Martial - consisting of a single President only.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">Currently, the practice is for military offences to be heard by Panel Courts Martial, while civil offences like misuse of drugs and penal code offences may be dealt with by a Judge Court Martial.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"><br>The current policy is also for an NSman, who is or was a District Judge in the Subordinate Courts, to preside in a GCM. There are currently 10 NSmen who have been appointed by the Armed Forces Council to perform duty as President of a court martial. They are rostered by the Registrar of the Subordinate Military Court to hear cases during their in-camp training. In the case of a Panel Court Martial, the other two members are rostered from among some 155 military officers appointed by the Chief of Defence Force.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"> <br>5. Ways to Seek Redress</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">There are numerous safeguards and avenues set out in the military justice system for an SAF serviceman to seek redress if he is unhappy about the punishment imposed on him.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">Generally, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with an informal punishment meted out to him may request a higher level commander to review the punishment, or request for formal disciplinary dealing.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">In the case of a summary trial, a serviceman brought before the disciplinary officer may elect instead to be tried by a court martial. Alternatively, an aggrieved serviceman may request that his conviction or punishment imposed at the summary trial be reviewed by MINDEF's Director Manpower (a delegated authority of the Armed Forces Council).</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">In the case of a GCM, a serviceman may choose to be represented by a lawyer or an SAF defending officer if his case will be heard by a court martial. The SAF has about 200 trained defending officers. While an SAF defending officer comes free to the serviceman, he has to bear the cost of engaging a lawyer. At the end of the trial, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with the decision of the court martial may petition the Reviewing Authority (the AFC or a committee of its members) for a review of his case. The serviceman can also appeal to the Military Court of Appeal (MCA) for a reconsideration of his conviction, or his sentence, or both.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The MCA, when convened to hear an appeal, sits as a panel of five members. Heading the MCA is a President, who is appointed by the Chief Justice. By law, he must be a person qualified to be a Judge of the Supreme Court. The current President of the MCA is Justice Choo Han Teck. Four other members - two civilian members who are qualified legal practitioners with at least five years experience each, and two senior military officers - make up the rest of the MCA. The MCA is the highest court in the military justice system.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"> <br>6. Impartial Hearings<br>It is important to recognise that the GCM and the MCA are tribunals headed by presidents who are outside the SAF chain of command.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">Being an "outsider", the president of these forums will hear the case impartially like any other civil criminal case. The proceedings in the GCM and the MCA are also heard in a public forum, and these military courts adopt many of the same legal procedures and safeguards as that used in the civil criminal courts. All servicemen formally charged with an offence can bring their case to these forums.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"> </p>

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The four units are:</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit;">Military Police Enforcement Unit (MPEU):</strong> The unit consists of the Law Enforcement and Ceremonial Company (LECC), the Security Operation Unit (SOU) and the Special Security and Protection (SSP) Branch. It is the active wing of the SAF MPC and executes most of the operational and ceremonial duties and roles carried out by the SAF MPC.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The LECC was formed by combining the former Active Provost Company (APC) and the former Zone Provost Company (ZPC). Its duties include most of the important ceremonial duties required within the SAF as previously handled by the APC, and a traffic platoon which ensures the compliance of traffic regulations by military personnel on the road as well as performing escort duties. It also performs regular raids for contraband and/or miscreants on various camps of the SAF as was conducted by the ZPC. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Enforcement Platoon (also known as Platoon 2) performs regular operations in residential areas, workplaces, and many public places such as shopping centres, clubs and eating outlets to apprehend <a title="Deserter" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deserter">deserters</a>, <a title="AWOL" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWOL">AWOL</a>offenders, drug addicts and other military criminals.</span> They work closely with the Singapore Police Force and are often in very dangerous situations and are extremely well trained for handling the varied scenarios that they find themselves in. This is also the platoon that enforces the public image of the SAF by booking offenders who smoke in uniform and commit other offences in uniform while in the eye of the public.</em></span> It is worth noting that they perform undercover security operations for high-key events like the National Day Parade and the Youth Olympic Games. The security of Mowbray Station is overseen by a platoon who is also in charge of registering and detaining suspects and offenders of military crimes in holding cells. The station is similar to a civilian police station and it is usually the first stop for detainees before their transfer to the detention barracks after conviction in military courts, or a temporary holding cell for servicemen placed under Closed Arrest. The investigative branch for the SAF, the Special Investigation Branch (SIB) investigates higher-order military crimes that requires specialised handling. Since 31 December 8, MPEU has heralded the inclusion of a new branch within its ranks. The Security Support and Protection (SSP) Branch is involved in sensitive operations so no further information is available.</p>
