So now I am currently warded to SAF Ward and I have no idea what is going on except that the MO said I would be OOC for the moment, and I am not allowed to book in.<br>And they photocopied all my educational certs and requested for my parents to come down on Monday.<br><br>Firstly, my body got coordination problem, I cannot do well when the movement is too complicated, example I cannot skip, cause' you need to swing the rope and jump in synch, I cannot do it properly, another example is Standing Board Jump, I cannot swing and carry the force of the swing and jump, I swing already then jump, its like not swinging at all.<br><br>Secondly, I am a super blur king, do you know got a few times, I wear my shirt wrong side then ran down to fall in, and the other time I took another person's towel used for 3 days then realized its not mine, that guy even wrote his name on it.<br><br>Thirdly, I tend to force myself to vomit when I smell or see disgusting stuff like if you talk to me, you stand too close I can feel your breathe, I will walk to a side and force myself to vomit, or when going to toilet, you know the smell.<br><br>Fourly, I have problem communicating with people, like I won't talk to you unless you talk to me first, example if I find a suitable job for myself, I don't have the guts to call up the person for enquiries.<br><br>Fifth, I am CRAZY perfectionist, example I clear windows in a square motion, and must be square motion, if I screw up, I will wash the towel and re - clean again and again till I think its perfect.<br><br>One more thing, my hands on sucks, do you know I only learned how to tie my shoelace when I was Secondary One, and until now I can't do it properly, I can't even fold blanklet or clothes...<br><br>So what will likely happen to me?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Army life is not meant for everybody. From the sound of it you have some serious problems. Some maybe real. Some maybe imagined. But one thing for certain. If you are really as farked as you make yourself out to be than you are doing SAF a service by getting OOC.<br><br>Don't be too sad about it. Army life is not meant for everybody. The most farked up blur cork sotong soldiers can lead fulfilling lives and have successful careers after army, while outstanding officers or specialists can just as easily fall headlong into a drain after ORD.  Just because you can't succeed in NS doesn't mean you can't succeed at life. Unless you are really as farked up as you make yourself out to be. Then prepare to fail at life.<br><br>But dun worry.
