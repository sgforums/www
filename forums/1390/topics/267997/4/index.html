I'd tell you about the DSM and ICD, but you'd end up straining what little intellectual capacity you have and end up in pain.  Suffice to say that both diagnostic systems are standardised so that a practicioner in one country can pick up a diagnosis made by his counterpart in another country and be able to understand exactly what he's dealing with.  I understand that you make things up as you go along, but not everybody is as slipshod as you.<br><br>To put it simply enough for even you to understand, because the diagnostic process is the same across countries, whether I'm applying it as a SAF psychiatrist or an Australian psychologust does not make a jot of difference.<br><br>Wake up and smell the coffee - that fishbowl you live in doesn't constitute the sum of existence, suaku. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

The story as it stands raises too many questions and has too many missing pieces.  As it is, there's one very likely sign that one would expect from OCD cases, but that this kid hasn't displayed at all in this thread.  For the moment, that's as far as I'll go because revealing what that sign is will help him to fake the symptoms, and as I said, I'll have no part of that.</div>

I'd tell you about the DSM and ICD, but you'd end up straining what little intellectual capacity you have and end up in pain.  Suffice to say that both diagnostic systems are standardised so that a practicioner in one country can pick up a diagnosis made by his counterpart in another country and be able to understand exactly what he's dealing with.  I understand that you make things up as you go along, but not everybody is as slipshod as you.<br><br>To put it simply enough for even you to understand, because the diagnostic process is the same across countries, whether I'm applying it as a SAF psychiatrist or an Australian psychologust does not make a jot of difference.<br><br>Wake up and smell the coffee - that fishbowl you live in doesn't constitute the sum of existence, suaku. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div></blockquote>What Gedanken is saying, is that his analysis of the TS's problem, would be the same as that of a Singapore psychologist, or rather, psychiatrist in this case.<br><br>Just as I would diagnose a person in Malaysia as having dengue fever, the Malaysian doctors would do the same. Our conclusion would be the same.<br><br>However, for Gedanken it is slightly more tricky, as there is no 100% guarantee that both psychologist on opposite sides of the world will agree, as psychology is slightly more subjective to personal opinions. For me, dengue=denuge=dengue worldwide, all you need to do is draw some blood for a lab test. However, take note that both are sciences, and the diagnosis of each doctor should be consistent (relatively).</div>
