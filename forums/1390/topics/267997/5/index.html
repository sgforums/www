Our conclusion would be the same.<br><br>However, for Gedanken it is slightly more tricky, as there is no 100% guarantee that both psychologist on opposite sides of the world will agree, as psychology is slightly more subjective to personal opinions. For me, dengue=denuge=dengue worldwide, all you need to do is draw some blood for a lab test. However, take note that both are sciences, and the diagnosis of each doctor should be consistent (relatively).</div></blockquote>Bingo!<br><br>It's not so much a matter of opinion as the differences in approaches between practicioners - given a set of information about the patient, the diagnostic system is prescriptive and should produce the same result every time.  However, the questions you forget to ask can change the diagnosis, just as with a physical illness.<br><br>IMHO, the biggest factor is the practicioner's thoroughness.  When I was still in training, I came across this child psychiatrist who was diagnosing every case as ADHD.  Some of these cases were abused children, and as you may be aware, the presenting symptoms of ADHD in male children and PTSD are virtually identical.  However, this sloppy psychiatrist never bothered performing differential diagnosis to exclude PTSD and just doped the kids right up with Ritalin or dexamphetemaines.

Thus, I am not slamming the TS in anyway.<br><br>Just my $0.03 opinion.[/b]</blockquote>Well, to be clear, chan, I'm not saying the kid's faking his symptoms to get out of NS.  What I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">am</span> saying is that what he's described here doesn't add up to enough for a diagnosis of any major problem.  There may well be some sort of problem, but does it constitute a significant disruption to his daily activities?  From what he's written here, I don't see any evidence of such disruption.<br><br>My question here is whether the problemÂ’s as big as the kid thinks it is.  That doesnÂ’t come out as being very empathic at all, but there is a point to that Â– is the perception of the problem compounding the problem?  Mild autism, if that is indeed the case, isn't going to bring this kid's life to a screeching halt.  As you would probably know, many people with this and other disorders such as Asperger's lead normal lives.  If this kidÂ’s going to keep thinking that the social skills deficits of his autism are going to keep him from being accepted by society, it starts a vicious cycle in which his lack of contact and experience with society only serves to further convince him that he does have social skills deficits.<br><br>IÂ’ve worked with kids who have severe autism, DownÂ’s Syndrome and AngelmanÂ’s Syndrome (I worked with the only recorded case in the world of two AngelmanÂ’s kids in one family), heroin babies and a number of other significantly disruptive disorders.  At the same time, IÂ’ve also worked with clients who have disabilities of less severity.  Having worked with this range of disorders, my experience is that thereÂ’s a line to be drawn.  Beyond that line, thereÂ’s little you can do Â– one severely autistic kid used to sit in a corner all day and punch himself in the head, and all we could do was put boxing headgear on him so he wouldnÂ’t injure himself too severely.  Another autistic girl had pika, and we had to keep 24/7 coverage of her to make sure she didnÂ’t eat anything that would kill her, and she took enough drugs in one morning to knock an adult out for a week.  Mind you, that was just the morning dose Â– it was repeated at lunchtime and dinnertime.<br><br>Up to that line, though, youÂ’re not doing the kid any favours by keeping them out of things.  With a lot of the less disabled kids, I made sure that they were progressively pushed ever so slightly out of their comfort zones, and as a result they did develop life and social skills that they would not have if theyÂ’d been treated with a hands-off approach because of their disorders.  One example I can think of is one kid (IQ of about 75, inbred family) who was obsessive about time Â– he had to call his parents at precisely 7 pm (he was in a residential care unit), have his breakfast at precisely 7.30 am and so on, otherwise heÂ’d hit the roof.  The staff who looked after the kid perpetuated his obsession by sticking strictly to his timelines.  When the kid came into my care, I deliberately messed up the timelines.  I had him starting his household chores at a quarter to seven in the evening and beginning other activities just before his scheduled tasks.  For the first week, sure enough, he hit the roof.  For the second week he grumbled.  By the end of the fourth week, he stopped looking at the time.  If IÂ’d focused on his having a problem rather than looking for ways around it, to this day heÂ’d still be getting his knickers in a twist about not being near a phone at 6.58 pm.<br><br>I donÂ’t doubt your experience Â– you seem to know what youÂ’re on about and I think what youÂ’ve written so far is reasonable.  I will however, differ with you about the approach to take, and I hope you understand that I intend you no disrespect by disagreeing.  In my experience, there is such a thing as killing people with kindness, and my read on the current case is that the kidÂ’s not doing himself any favours by focusing on the limitations imposed by his problems.</div>
