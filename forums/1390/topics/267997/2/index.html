I stand out like a sore thumb. My platoon mates all hates me becoz they know I am slow and blur. My sgts all take special care of me, always encourage me.<br><br>When I was in Secondary School, I was in some dance cca, then everytime I see the Secondary 1 come in, they looked like noobs, but their skills overtook me within a matter of days. I am like crap, I felt like crap, I couldn't do anything. They were somersaults... the Secondary Ones learned it within 1 or 2 tries... in fact everyone knew it... sometimes even the gals who are not supposed to learned somersault... came over and do 1 or 2... I was crap... in there for 3 years and can't even do a somersault. And that is just the tip of the iceberg, there were so many other things I couldn't do. I was such a disgrace during SYF ppl danced 7 mins... I barely did 30 seconds... At Secondary 4 everyone was a community member, except me... I was always crap. Always...</div>
