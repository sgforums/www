Like I would wash my legs and hands, wipe them with a towel with a parrallel motion. Stand in front of the toy, with my legs parrellel to each other. then position my hands neatly and take out the toys, make 1 mistake and I do it all over again. I usually also lay some A4 paper on the floor to put my toy on. I don't know what, I have this feel that it protects the toy from dirt from the floor, but I know its not working. I just feel more comfortable that way.<br><br>As for studying, its no big deal really. I am only really bad at hands on stuff. I study computers, programming, no hands on anyway. I usually sleep during lectures and tutorial because I know there is no way anything will get in even if I concentrate. Therefore, I lose a lot of tips for quizes. But it doesn't matter, because b4 exam, I would spend the ENTIRE f**king day, there was once I did it till 4 am, MEMORISING the entire book. Yes, its possible, there was once someone asked me the page number and I could even split it out. Just that it takes a long time. I do not hav a good memory, I just make it a point to memorise everything word by word, else I would feel very uncomfortable.</div>

Either the dude is true case or he is a kengster.<br><br>If true, then he will be ok, he will get the appropriate actions from SAF be it downgrade, excuse, his superiors informed of his condition, etc.<br><br>If false, then he be prepared to face the consequences. Because the jurisdiction here is with SAF ward not his unit. The unit still can close one eye, there is up to their prerogative.<br><br>(My reply is also serve a warning to those kengsters who wants to keng siao to downgrade. Because the biggest kengster is none other than SAF itself, anything u can think of, they already know, how to win.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )</div>

IIRC your job is just to do whatever the doctor tells you to do for the patient.

It's funny that you're obsessed enough with me to find out my qualifications, but not to work out the more obvious thing, which is that I practice in Australia where qualification standards are more stringent and are subject to more legal requirements than in Singapore.  Then again, given the limited capacity of your palsied mind and your crippling dependence on the borders of your fishbowl, that's no surprise at all.<br><br>Where this comes into relevance is that in countries like the US, UK and Australia, the fields of psychology and psychiatry have developed to the point where psychologists are acknowledged to be the specialists in assessment, while psychiatrists tend to specialise in prescription-based treatments.  The mutual respect and recognition between the two fields readily and easily exists - my psychiatrist counterparts and I often joke about how we're the witch doctors and they're the drug pushers.  Being excluded from both fields, your insistence on applying your myopically title-based, backwater banana-republic view of things only goes to further demonstrate your hillbilly ignorance.  I already know you're a suaku - you don't have to keep proving it to me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>It's funny how you accuse me of claiming to be what I'm not.  Given how you claim to know what you obviously don't, not only have you proven how your ignorance and stupidity get in the way of grace, you've now demonstrated your hypocrisy as well.  Keep shooting yourself in the foot - it's quite entertaining. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
