            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br>I'm still a student actually but am worried about my NS in the future. Right now I'm diagnosed with anemia due to bleeding in my small intestine. I'll need blood transfusion of 2 units of every 2 weeks or even lesser. The blood is lost via a white patch that covers my small intestine as well as my main blood vessels providing blood to my internal organs from the heart.<br><br>I'm seeing a surgeon at the moment to discuss for a possible operation later this year as the white patches are causing the blood lost. The operation will remove the white patches either partially or fully. As it also covers my blood vessels, I might need to do a en-route of my blood vessels and remove the current wrapped-up blood vessel.<br><br>My low blood count was discovered when I was given a FBC check when I was referred to the A&amp;E department and my blood count dived to 4.7 (normal 12 - 1. This low blood count gives me occasional headaches, chest-pain and serious dizziness and also being easily out of breath. The cause was only discovered when I underwent intense scans as well as multiple CT scans and eventually found out the exact bleeding area and cause through a MRI scan and scope test with biopsy taken from the bleeding ulcer inside my lower end of my small intestine.<br><br>If I undergo the surgery in a couple of months and return to normal lifestyle, will my health condition be considered during my enlistment ? Because the white patches could grow back again if not fully removed.<br><br>Hopefully someone can clarify my doubts here as I'm pretty confused and my doctor aren't sure how the NS MO will determine my condition.<br></div>

I'm rather worried because I don't want to be forced to do it and injure myself within. At first when I get breathless, I thought it's I'm getting fat. But only realised that I'm having internal bleeding when admited to A&amp;E which required immediate admission for 1 week. If I only go army say 4 years later, how arhs?</div>
