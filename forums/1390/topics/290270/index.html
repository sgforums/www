I do know some components can be bought at beach road while some can't but to make things simple, PC/PS will always say everything cannot replace. I thinking firing pin is 1 of the cannot replace things but i hardly touch the rifle after BMT.<br><br>They might keep him in tekong do sai kang and wait for the obese BMT to start if hes really going to transfer since they cannot let him become a civilian again then reenlist again in Dec as far as i know. Chances of sending him elsewhere is also low since tekong is not really a unit and they can't anyhow sent people out.<br><br>Go beach road i heard is go city hall MRT then walk but i don't remember since i never been there to buy things before.<br><br>Maybe some others can give more confirm answers but this is my view from what i know or heard.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I grew up in the Beach Road area. Orientate yourself like this:<br><br>Next to Lavender MRT is the ICA building. Behind them, across the canal, is Crawford HDB estate, which has a major road (North Bridge Board) bisecting about one-third into the residential area. The hawker center itself is located at the "further" perimeter of this estate, bordering another major road (Beach Road).<br><br>Stand outside the MRT entrance so that the ICA building is on your right side. The beeline between you &amp; the latter is actually southwards on a compass, &amp; the hawker center is further down the same direction too. Keep this overall bearing in mind as you venture forth: cross the canal bridge, cut across Crawford Court (i.e. HDB block nos. 460-plus's), cross North Bridge Road at the traffic right, walk down either the car park or HDB block no. 7 &amp;, before you see the NPP post straight ahead, the bigger hawker center behind it will already be conspicious too.<br><br>When you finish shopping at the army market, I recommend the Sarawak-style chilli noodles one floor down. Of course, you can then cross Beach Road (overhead bridge only) &amp; go ogle at the Thai girls at Golden Mile too ~lol~</div>
