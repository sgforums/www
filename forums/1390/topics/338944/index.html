All the route marches and heavy loads is to build up your mental strength, test your resolve what. PT is to build up your physical fitness, so you can go Palawan and flaunt your body. Hahaha. Storemen always have to stay in office/store, things lost kana F, LRI check come everyday work until 1-2 AM then close store, if your QM/RQ fucked up, you lagi stress....been there done that, i can honestly say combatant life is better.....more respect. Not to say storemen/clerk don't deserve respect, but too bad they are behind the scenes, not many people will appreciate.</p></div>

              <p>I somewhat agree that Hellraiza that despite common mindset, being a clerk or storeman or whatever is not as good as what many people think to be.</p>
              <p>If you make a mistake, such as losing a very expensive store item, the impact is much more real and physical. Sometimes something gets lost and you don't even know when or how it got lost. You have to keep it to yourself, don't dare to tell your commanders, find all ways to hide the fact while at the same time, feeling guilty about handing over your problems to your next batch. There is much mental stress involved. I may not be a storeman but I am the 'store i.c.' for my company, so I know.</p>
              <p>I see my friends do admin work and seriously, it isn't any much easier. If they screw up their work, they can affect the entire company.</p>
              <p>There isn't really a so-called 'slack vocation' out there. If a person seriously wants to gain and learn something out of his two years experience in NS, he will give his all and his best even if he is just a clerk or driver. People may belittle him and give him little regards, but he can still give his best effort in whatever that he do.</p>
              <p>If a person is spoilt and pampered, he will somehow chao keng all the way into supposedly slack vocation such as a clerk and will indeed slack his way through. That's why other people are given the impression that such vocation is slack.</p>
              <p>And seriously, depending on the way you look at it, there's nothing bad about infantry unit. You gain much physical endurance, strength, bonding with your batchmates (unlike logistics unit who goes through less 'tekan' session), etc.</p>

              <p>u might think its lucky. but some of us isn't as lucky as you thought.</p>
              <p>bringing myself as an example. im down PES to C9L9 because of borned atopic eczema, skin problems for easier understanding. i can understand that the reason ur bmt friends are posted to clerical or driver unit due to either health or clearance problem.</p>
              <p>because of this skin problem, i can't lead a normal life like others. who'll dirty the whole bedsheet everyday because he bleeds every night? and occasionally can't sleep the whole night because its just too itchy.</p>
              <p>lets not talk about those chao keng cases, wad about the PES E and Fs? do you think they can lead a normal life after NS? 2years of suffering is better than a lifetime of suffering.</p>

              <p>Sports fitness requires different physical levels/competencies than military standards.</p>
              <p>A person with impaired hearing, is PES C. That does not prevent him from running in a football match.</p>
              <p>Many sportsmen have sports injuries to their knee meniscus, or ankles. They are able to play sports due to the duration and ability to stop when it flares up. Can an infantryman stop his assault because his knee flared up? No.</p>

              <p>Actually I don't know whether am I feeling the same way as others or am I just thinking too much.</p>
              <p>When I was enlisted into army in tekong and then post out to unit, I was in the infantry unit you know they say hokkien peng and I check with my bmt friend and my junior as well, I see many of them posted to service side such as clerk, admin and more lucky want, they kena driver. That is the real lucky I mean, after ord, they got free license and I was like wtf, people stay out 8 - 5 and me stay in mon - fri, go through outfield, carry over 20kg route march for over 30km, xiong SOC and many more PT. I mean why people got such a comfort life in army and why I so xiong wan?</p>
              <p>Do you guys have this smiliar grudges as I do?</p>

              <p>You want to compare then compare with stay in clerks who work 8 to 5:30 lah.</p>
              <p>Although they don't stay in for five days, still they are stay in personnel.</p>
              <p>Think about it, you chiong sua ppl can openly relax and sleep in your bunk after PT or/and training. Isn't that good?</p>
