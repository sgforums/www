I just choose to stay back and because i had to train my understudies to take over my job. Somehow that was also for my own good lah cos if i don't train anyone, my phone will ring everyday in uni.<br><br>Due to the training, i had to start clearing some of my leaves and off earlier instead of clearing at 1 shot cause if i did, i think i will see my understudy only 1 day or not even at all. However, in the end i still burned 1-2 days of off since there were some last min stuff and they really weren't that up to standard yet even after a few days of slight OT, just 7pm and they start to give me attitute...<br><br>Hmm, maybe have freedom fighter this type of people as my understudy won't be so bad if he keeps his enthu up as i do need someone more enthu than the 2 guys i had. First thing in the morning they already asking what time i will dismiss them already since their dismissal entirely up to me and they don't fallout with the rest unless i say they could.<br><br>Anyway, i just feel its better to clear up as much loose ends as i can before i leave so there will be less problems thats why i worked later during my last day. Unfortunately there were still some outstanding stuff that couldn't be cleared but since my understudy were working with me, the transition was easier. I already made them do most of the work by mid training and just keep teaching them new stuff while they carry out the basic work to practice and reinforce their knowledge.<br><br>In my final report to round off the entire training, i still requested my IC to give them 1 or at least half day of off to 'pay back' for their OT, whether they got it or not i don't know but i sometimes i still wonder whether they really do deserve it or not.</div>

Its supposed to be a paperless system but we end up using up more paper cause we have to print things out or reproduce them on paper since army does not provide every office with a projector that lets me project my screen (reminds me how stupid it was for me to have to teach more than 10 ppl ES on 1 PC and i think less than 5 could see the screen while the rest just hang around because they were forced to be there and their OC was around).<br><br>Even from the time it was implemented, it keeps going through numerous changes so all the regulars that were trained in it were as good as untrained so it was worse for me who didn't even go through any formal training. I learnt the basics from my spec then after that it was phone calls after phone calls to my company ES expert and emails to DSTA for help as i got to more and more complicated issues. I made so many calls and emails that everytime anyone hear me call company HQ, they will auto direct the line without me even asking or saying who i looking for and i know quite a few of the DSTA stuff through email/phone conversations.</div></blockquote>10 people to 1 PC?

The whole communication from the core team designing and maintaining the software and the users are not there. We are always lagging behind. It has been 4 months since i left, i won't be surprise if some of the things i'm used to have changed but i don't thin there will be anymore drastic changes if not they might as well just change the entire system.</div>
