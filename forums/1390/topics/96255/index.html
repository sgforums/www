            <div class='col-md body'>Just one ... happened during my NSF time (1995-96)<br><br>Place: 2 SIB, Temple Hill Camp (Changi), Officer mess.<br><br>One of the officer died during training ealier in that year. The "ghostly" incident happened when the whole brigade was away in ROC. Two NSF who was left behind saw an officer in the mess during guard duty, and they recognised him as the officer who passed away ??!?!?!?! Not a well known story was it was a one off incident.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tekong... 1980s... doing my BMT.  Section ambush on cross-roads near the old  village school in the north of the island.<br><br>8 or 9 of us lined up in typical ambush formation. The corporal in charge of training was a few meters behind the ambush formation. We were all settling into the ambush drill...<br><br>Suddenly, a high pitched scream pierced the night. The scream was half human , half mechanical . And it was REALLY LOUD and PIERCING. So much so that all the section stopped whatever we were doing and broke the ambush drill by sitting up in our positions looking around. I looked back at the corporal as he was more or less directly behind me. He was brushing his teeth at the time of the scream. In the darkness of the night, I could see the white of his Colgate in his open mouth. He was frozen mid-way in brushing his teeth. (Because it was BMT training, there was a nominated recruit who was acting section commander, so the "real" corporal can be non- tactical...).<br><br>At that time, we were not really scared. It was just that the scream was unnerving. The corporal decided to pack up and told us to execute a quick tactical withdrawal from the ambush site. We then went back to camp. Believe he reported the scream to the OC and camp DO, and cited it as a valid excuse to break off night training. It was also a Thursday night !<br><br>Later , wild stories started to circulate, most were untrue. WE DID NOT SEE ANYTHING, but we just heard this frightful half human scream, which at that time puzzled us more than frightened us.<br><br>Of the recruits in this section, a number signed on later and some of them are still serving in the SAF. Bet they remember this episode.<br></div>

It is some kind of Taoist ceremony. Usually there is a camp fire also. I am not sure what they do, but they dress up in black robes and dance around the fire and they burn stuff (maybe joss paper). I did not go near as they looked pretty spooky.<br><br>The high pitch cry could be something that my whole section heard in my story above. A few theories floating around, apart from ghosts. One is that there are civilians still hanging around Tekong. This was certainly true during the 1980s when there was a very small kampong near the old jetty. There was a crazy mad old man who likes to follow recruits around during field training. He was from this kampung. The joke was that he was some kind of spy for the Viet Cong !  Anyway, the screams and cries we hear could be the villagers playing the fool with the soldiers. I am not sure if in the 1990s there were still villagers around.<br><br>The other theory was that it could be stray cats or wild boar having sex !</div>

My platoonmates in bunk 3 experienced this constant knocking thruout the night in the wall between bunk 3 and 4. finally the guy sleeping right underneath the spot with the knocking got fed up with it. he thot it was someone in bunk 4 playing the fool so he got up, banged at the wall and shouted nahbeh cheebye shaddup lah! the knocking stopped for a few seconds, then heavy banging started! at that point both bunks had been woken up and no one was touching the wall, but the heavy banging continued. Only stopped much later There were 26 witnesses to this incident.</div>
