              <p><strong><span>New NS cert helped me get
                  job</span></strong><br><em><span><span>By Andre Yeo,</span></span> <span>02 March 2008</span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>LANCE Corporal Budiman Mohamad Som, 23, needed a job to help
                  support his single mother - a sales assistant - and his two younger
                  brothers.</p>
              <p>Having just completed his national service (NS) in December, he
                  was not hopeful of getting a job immediately.</p>
              <p>But thanks to a new enhanced certificate of service (COS) for
                  full-time national servicemen (NSF) who have just completed NS, he
                  managed to secure a job within a month.</p>
              <p>Associate Professor Koo Tsai Kee, the Minister of State for
                  Defence, yesterday announced the introduction of the new
                  certificate, which gives a more detailed description of a
                  serviceman's contributions and achievements during NS.</p>
              <p>Those who performed exceptionally well or who assumed positions
                  of responsibility will also get personal testimonials from their
                  unit's commanders.</p>
              <p>NSmen can use this certificate to apply for jobs, scholarships
                  or places in tertiary institutions.</p>
              <p>Previously, the certificate would only state whether the
                  performance was 'good' or 'outstanding'. It did not describe what a
                  person did - whether he was a team player or if he had good
                  organisational skills.</p>
              <p>The first Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) unit to get the COS was
                  the 1st Battalion Singapore Guards in November 2007.</p>
              <p>LCP Budiman was a light anti-tank weapon sharpshooter in the
                  unit. In his COS, he was commended for having good organisational
                  skills.</p>
              <p>He organised company activities, took part in singing
                  competitions to boost morale, and was praised for being a team
                  player who carried out duties efficiently.</p>
              <p>His performance and conduct were listed as 'outstanding'.</p>
              <p>Using his COS, he applied for a job at Aetos, the auxiliary
                  police force, two weeks after completing his NS on 8 Dec. He got
                  the job during the interview and started work last month. He is now
                  based at the Woodlands Checkpoint, earning $1,000 a month.</p>
              <p><strong>MORE CREDIBILITY</strong></p>
              <p>LCP Budiman said the COS helped him during the interview. He
                  said: 'The certificate is from the Government, so it has more
                  credibility and is recognised.</p>
              <p>'If I were the boss of a company, why would I not want to hire
                  someone who performed well in the army during stressful
                  situations?</p>
              <p>'It will motivate NSFs to work harder during NS.'</p>
              <p>LCP Budiman's younger brothers are aged 19 and 13. An older
                  sister, 24, who is married without kids, also lives in the family's
                  four-room flat in Teban Gardens.</p>
              <p>Aetos' commanding officer (land checkpoints), Deputy
                  Superintendent (Auxiliary Police Force) Roland Wee, 47, is in
                  charge of the Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints. He interviewed LCP
                  Budiman for the job.</p>
              <p>He said previous certificates did not contain enough details of
                  what an NSF did. The COS gives employers a better idea of whether
                  job applicants were suitable.</p>
              <p>He added that</p>
              <p>LCP Budiman's COS contributed to the decision to employ him.</p>
              <p>He said: 'The COS was a good one, as it reflected his
                  contributions to the SAF. It has been accurate in describing his
                  character and abilities.'<br><br><strong></strong></p>
