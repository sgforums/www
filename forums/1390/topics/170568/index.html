            <div class='col-md body'>Gordonator is correct. Recce troopers are prized catches during exercises. Ociffers always give incentive for catching one, or some. But you will also learn about being tactical, so tactical that the enemy soldier will be peeing/shitting in front of you without realising he's being watched. A lot of andrenaline rush.</div>

Remembered long time ago, while on exercise in Tekong, observed my JC classmate, an ITD officer,  talking to his staff for a few minutes before we moved on. Called him during the weekend and told him his conversation details. He was totally dumbfolded,  didn't even know he was being watched.
