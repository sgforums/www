              <p>i dunno if it is within the SAF guidelines, but from what i checked with friends from other coys, ours was terribly different. and when our fieldcamp ended our oc threatened to charge us if we write abt our field camp training online etc. ok i shan't talk much about the training. all i can say is that our coy's morale is super low, we are super tired and depressive. the mood is real bad. after nearly 3 mths we are breaking down. even the siao on ones are finding it hard to lift our morales now. nobody is happy. we are just waiting for POP and just get out of tekong. what to do? suck thumb. we are only recruits. we dunno anything. if people exploit our rights we also dunno. suck thumb and suffer in silence!</p>
