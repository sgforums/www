              <p>Please advise me on my future!</p>
              <p>Is it for country/ passion/ money?</p>
              <p>If like so good, but why so many men just don't want to sign on with SAF/ RSN/ RSAF?</p>
              <p>Why some regulars can't wait to quit immediately after their contractual bonds end?</p>
              <p>How come?</p>
              <p>How?</p>
              <p>Will it be better for me to look for better jobs at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.jtc.gov.sg/RealEstateSolutions/Seletar-Aerospace-Park/Pages/default.aspx"><em>Seletar Aerospace Park</em></a></span>?</p>

              <p>What do you to sign on for? Money? Passion? Country? Nation?</p>
              <p>How old are you? Still schooling? <br>Please concentrate your studies first.</p>
              <p>When I was doing my NS, some
                  people got family problems so no choice, sign on to got money, got income than NSF allowances.</p>
              <p>The most worthwhile to sign on is if you are a
                  scholar. Because SAF military recognize academic
                  qualifications. Think SAFOS scholars who are Lee Hsien Loong, George Yeo, Chan Chun Sing, Tan Chuan-Jin, Teo Chee Hean, Lui Tuck Yew, Desmond Tan...etc.</p>
              <p>SAF scholars' qualifications high, triple quick career progression in
                  the military due to the system used of the maximum Career Potential Point. Or else, you are just a farmer. <br><br>If you
                  just sign on to be WOSE ranks (NCOs), then no point since most of the skills in the
                  military have very little applications in civilian jobs. Do you carry a rifle to office?</p>
              <p>Some years ago after NS OR<span>D, I</span> met my
                  platoon sergeant, who is quite a solid guy but after his contract ended, he cannot find
                  job as military job experience is not counted as actual work experience to most civilian employers. So he no choice, self-employed to a goods delivery transporter ferrying couriers
                  around.</p>
              <p>NS 2 years is enough to know the SAF. Just smoothly ORD from NS, then
                  use the time during ORD mood to think twice and thrice carefully what you want to do.</p>
              <p>After NS, the world is your oyster and the grass is always greener on the other side. Way much better prospects outside.</p>
              <p>Such as your interest in aviation such as SIA Engineering, Seletar Aerospace Hub for Aircraft MRO, the new expanding Changi Airport with T4/ T5 with Jewel Hub...etc.</p>

              <p>Hi, I'm 16, taking GCE 'O' Level this year.</p>
              <p>I am think of sign on since I'm planning for my future, and I'm keen on a military job although I have not yet experience any real military life, say the NS BMT as a "trial run" to see if I am really fit-in for a military job. Maybe I watch the TV advertisements to only see the 'glam' factor only, ignoring other job factors.</p>
              <p>See if I should apply next year after if I can get into a Polytechnic or not first. <br>And I'm not planning to go for my first basic degree, maybe not just yet. <br>SAF give carrots quite good to have $ allowances but let's say if I break bond half-way, I need to pay back SAF whatever all the money allowances + compensation penalty.<br>So if I sign on, is it going to be a 'farmer' soldier as in slow promotion progress?</p>
              <p>Is it real and the hard truth that if after the contract bond ends, to almost all employers outside which for military experience is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>not</em></span> counted as real working experience since who will carry rifle to work as typical office worker?</p>
              <p>Is it really need to go down to CMPB at Depot Road?</p>

              <p>When I was at your age, I was restless that I too nearly sign on to 
                              RSN. Navy seemed like a good place to go see the world as a sailor. Now,
                               I am glad I didn't sign any contract, but my friend did signed on as a 
                              Navy Cook. But yet after he completed 6 year bond, he wasn't even 
                              qualified to be a proper chef in a good restaurant...</p>
              <p>You see, at the 6 years bond, you are at most a 1st sergeant. You need to clear some requirements/ interviews/ work performance appraisals to be offered the 2nd contract to progress to the Warrant Officer scheme to be safe till retirement age. Or else, you will just hit the maximum rank/ salary ceiling, you can choose to stay there with no further job progress stagnantly or honourably ask for a golden handshake at the 6 years contract to leave the place.</p>
              <p>It's your life, so you decide I won't say to be neutral. I
                               can only advise you to first go through at least the 1st year NS as a 
                              real military life (<em>unlike</em> NCC) before deciding. By then, you are not 
                              even 18 still not too late as even if you sign on then, SAF will still backpay you the allowances and salary prior to contract signing. But after the 1st year of the NS soldier, perhaps your perception view changed to be that the SAF is not what it seem/ projected to be in the public view when 
                              you are considered "an insider view" when you are a NSF serving just 2 
                              years full-time. Maybe you will change your mind to many people who have already saw
                               through their NS experience, and that mean something on how come so many
                               men still don't want to sign on with the SAF even if they are retrenched/ 
                              unemployed/ jobless that they would rather work part-time jobs/ drive 
                              taxi at the very least rather than to experience the same old brand new NS again. 2 years of NS full-time is okay to experience the NS soldier life, but not as a job.</p>
