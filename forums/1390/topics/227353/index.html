Fire Guardsmen! Fire NDU! Fire Tankess and Riflemen!<br>Fire Matador! Fire M-16! Fire mortars and SAR!"<br><br>"You in the courtyard and you men on the walls!<br>Now blast away! Blast away! Blast away all!"<br><br>But all through this maelstrom the evil one flew,<br>Past bullets and mortar shells and grenades that we threw!<br><br>And then, in my horror, I heard on the roof<br>The decadent cavorting of each vile hoof.<br><br>Screaming my orders, I spun quickly around,<br>As down the staircase shaft it came with a bound.<br><br>I saw its eyes glow, its vast stomach gurgle,<br>Bloated and fat, like a White Horse of Tekong.<br><br>Blinded by anger, I attacked with a scream -<br>Charged into battle with my garang RPs.<br><br>As we thundered towards him, closing the rift,<br>He reached in his satchel and pulled out a gift.<br><br>Then it tossed the vile boxes - I fell in a stoop,<br>As they arced through the air at me and my troops.<br><br>The wrapped missiles fell short, and plopped at our feet,<br>Our morale was quite strong, we did not retreat.<br><br>But the soldiers paused - our charge was disrupted,<br>They picked up the gifts and were quickly corrupted.<br><br>For each box contained a chaotic present -<br>The soldiers (damn their souls), found them quite pleasant.<br><br>An FHM, a Maxim, a new "power fist",<br>The Claus gave to all, and he checked off a list.<br><br>It moved through the station and left in its wake,<br>The sound of bright laughter and the stench of bak kwa.<br><br>The others succumbed, but it failed in its goal,<br>For it gave to me only a small pile of coal.<br><br>The camp was lost, I could only instruct<br>The RSM to alert the DB Guards.<br><br>With extras and SOL and charging them to<br>the JDO and RPs came down with them too<br><br>I failed to kill him, for I saw as I fled<br>The target escaping, quite safe in his sled.<br><br>I heard it cry out as the MPs burst into the night,<br>"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!"</div>
