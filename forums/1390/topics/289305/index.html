            <div class='col-md body'>1) In my opinion, the defence of the country shld not be solely dependant on the males alone. Females shld also contribute to the defence of the country. For example, they can contribute under logistics, medic assistants,service sectors, unit administration etc etc. The defence of the country shld not juz be relied upon the males. If possible, the females can also learn certain skills as those mentioned above. We cannot have a war with the males fighting and females sitting at home watching tv or sleeping.<br><br>2) Mono-intake units got orientation officers?

Already, our military budgets are among the higher ones in the region (BTW Brunei's is too). There's the composition of our neighboring armed forces to consider too: we only need to match up well against them -- any bigger force will create unnecessary tension -- &amp; yet we quietly hold an edge cuz Malaysia is currently transforming into a conventional force (eg. only one combat-arms DIV) while Indonesia's remains a largely regional-based, counterinsurgency one.<br><br>Our ORBAT restructuring (to offset a reduced conscript intake) is also already more than 15 years in the making, &amp; fortunately it meshes with our later ambitions to upgrade to a high-tech 3G army. This new system works too, or else we couldn't have deployed to aid the tsunami victims almost the same time as the US 7th Fleet did too. Contrast, too, the scale of that taskforce vs. the one for the Cable Car disaster over 20 years ago.<br><br>Also, the SAF has even outsourced non-ops endeavors (food catering, administration, maintainence, even area-cleaning) to further free up enlistees for other vocations. So, if anything, it's moving in the OTHER direction: progressively farming these workloads out to the civilian side, instead of conscripting the other sex to do them. Who knows, perhaps someday even NSF clerks may be rendered redundant ~shrug~<br><br>If it ever expands its NSF pool again, methinks it'll be the naturalised citizens who'll get called up first, rather than females as a whole. IMO There's some inevitability to this cuz, as things stand, the enlistee intake shall shrink again soon (today's batches are from the "have 3 or more" population policies of the late '80s, whose effect wore off by the mid/later '90s) &amp; yet there's this recent population explosion (from aggressive awarding of citizenship to new immigrants). Whatever happens, it'll likely shake up local society, more so than when they introduced the 13-year cycle in the early '80s or when they elevated reservists to join the combat-arms DIVs (as "ops-ready NSmen") in the early '90s.<br><br>To T/S: This is the element you haven't considered with your suggestion: NS liability doesn't end after 2 years, but only when you turn 40 (or 50) years old. The females shall need to serve reservist for as long as the males do -- so how you think S'pore can accomodate/finance that, even if the gesture is noble (enlistee equality, nation-building, etc.)?</div>
