              <p>Situation: <br>I am pes A.<br>I got injuried during BMT, I got a bad shin splint. I managed to POP by eating pain killers(tekong doctors gave me) whenever I am marching or feel pain in my leg etc.<br><br>I posted out to a unit. I finally got a letter from specialist to excuse me from rmj, LL, heavy load for a few months etc. The camp MO ask me if I want a temporary down pes. I said, "is there a need?" Lastly, the camp MO convinced me to try temporary down pes.</p>
              <p>Qns:<br>I was temporary down pes for 6 months, I have completely no idea what pes am I down to. What I'm worried is, what if after 6 months I go for medical board to review my pes, they decided to up pes me, back to pes A. <br><br>1. Will I stay in my unit? or do I revocate?<br>2. I don't understand what's the use of temporary down pes.<br>3. What if I succeed in downgrading my pes, is there a chance for me to upgrade it back after I ORD? <br>4. If i get to upgrade it back after I ORD, do my reservice still in the same vocation?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please help me. I am confused. Am I wrong to temporary down pes?</p>

              <p>Please check current PES and its expiry with the counter medic at the medical centre. The medic can readily see your PES on the computer just with your NRIC number. Simple. </p>
              <p>1. Revocation/ Post Out matters are none of medical centre business. Medical centre can only <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">recommends</span></em> a revocation/ post out. Please note that all <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">actual</span></strong></em> manpower matters are all handled by the NS unit's S1 Manpower Branch. Therefore, please go to check with S1 Manpower Officer/ DyS1 Officer/ Chief Clerk. </p>
              <p>2. Temporary PES downgrade is to let the person to rest, recover and recuperate well enough with sufficient time period for health conditions/ injuries deemed temporary. As simple as that.  </p>
              <p>3. To upgrade PES, please get a hospital specialist to write memo to verify and certify that you have well recovered to fit. </p>
              <p>4. As mentioned above, for all revocation/ post out matters, please check directly with the S1 Manpower Branch for all manpower issues. </p>

Compensation will be based on your civilian pay or an equivalent regular serviceman’s pay (whichever is higher) if you do not receive any income from your employers. This ex-gratia payment is compensation for your loss of income during this period. Payment will cease when you are no longer on medical/hospitalisation leave or when disability compensation is paid, whichever is earlier.</span></p>

              <p>1. Will I stay in my unit? or do I revocate?</p>
              <p>It depends on the operational and requirement of your unit. If you are in NDU and you got down pes, you will ooc and be revocated.</p>
              <p><br> 2. I don't understand what's the use of temporary down pes.</p>
              <p>Just so that they can give you extra care and attention.</p>

              <p><br> 4. If i get to upgrade it back after I ORD, do my reservice still
              in the same vocation?</p>
              <p>Most probably you will do reservice in your exsiting vocation because they cannot just post you around you ORD as you do not know how things work in other units. In addition, you did not receive training from other units.</p>

              <h3>Service Injuries</h3>
              <p>When an NSman sustains an injury due to an authorised activity
              sanctioned by the Unit Commanding Officer during his In-Camp
              Training (ICT), he is required to report the incident immediately
              to his Unit S1/Manpower Officer and Unit Medical Officer (MO), so
              that his unit can assist him in the filing of his injury report and
              to provide him with the required treatment for his injury.</p>
              <p>NSman is to provide the following, should he wish to submit his
              bills incurred for the treatment of his service injury:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Original tax invoice/receipt</li>
              <li>Certification from hospital/doctor that the bill incurred is
              for the treatment of his service injury</li>
              <li>Statement from CPF Board for amounts deducted from Medisave
              account (if any)</li>
              <li>Statement from insurance company on the amount deducted from
              policy plan for the treatment of his service injury (if any)</li>
              </ul>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div><br>
              <h3>Service Injury (SI) Card</h3>
              <p>Upon the approval of his injury as attributable to service, the
              NSman may be issued with an SI card, if it is certified by his
              attending doctor that he would require long-term medical treatment
              for his service injury. This SI card will provide him with fully
              subsidised medical benefits at government/restructured hospitals
              and polyclinics at his eligible ward for as long as he requires
              it.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div>
              <h3>Medical Reimbursement</h3>
              <p>If NSman has incurred medical fees at government/restructured
              hospitals and polyclinics for the treatment of his service injury
              prior to the approval, he is to retain all original receipts,
              certification from the doctor that the treatment is for his service
              injury and other supporting documents to his payment of medical
              fees. He may submit these documents to MINDEF/SAF Human Resource
              Shared Services Centre (HRSSC) upon the approval of his service
              injury for medical reimbursement. Do note that only medical fees
              incurred at government/restructured hospitals and polyclinics are
              reimbursable by MINDEF and he is to seek referral from doctors at
              polyclinic, hospital's A&amp;E or his Unit MO for treatments at
              government/restructured hospitals.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div>
              <h3>Ex-gratia Payment</h3>
              <p>If the NSman remains on continuous medical leave upon his ICT
              due to his service injury, he may be eligible for ex-gratia payment
              if it is certified by his employer that he is not receiving any
              salary for the period of his medical leave for his service injury.
              He is to provide a letter from his employer to inform MINDEF of
              this and the amount that is to be reimbursed, together with
              supporting documents.</p>
              <p>This ex-gratia payment, which is meant to compensate NSman's
              loss of income during the period of medical leave, will be paid in
              a stepdown approach based on his civilian pay or an equivalent pay
              of a regular serviceman, whichever higher. The ex-gratia payment
              will cease upon the termination of his medical leave or the award
              of his disability compensation, whichever earlier.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div>
              <h3>Lump Sum Disability Compensation</h3>
              <p>If it is certified by his attending Specialist that his service
              injury has stabilised, the NSman is to inform his unit to request
              for him to be reviewed by his Unit MO. He will be required to
              complete an authorisation form to allow MINDEF to obtain a
              Disability Assessment Report (DAR) from his attending Specialist on
              his service injury. The hospital will take about 3 to 4 months to
              revert with the DAR. Upon the receipt of the DAR with no further
              query, he will be scheduled to attend a PD Board by Military
              Medicine Institute (MMI) for the endorsement of the PD that has
              been assessed by his attending Specialist for him to have suffered
              as a result of his service injury. Upon the endorsement and
              approval of his PD Board Outcome, MINDEF/SAF HRSC will then be able
              to process his disability compensation. He will be informed of the
              award of his lump sum disability compensation subsequently.</p>

                                treatment for his service injury. This SI card will provide him with 
                                fully subsidised medical benefits at government/restructured hospitals 
                                and polyclinics at his eligible ward for as long as he requires it.</p>

                                his service injury prior to the approval, he is to retain all original

              <h3>Ex-gratia Payment</h3>
              <p>If the NSman remains on continuous medical leave 
                                upon his ICT due to his service injury, he may be eligible for ex-gratia
                                 payment if it is certified by his employer that he is not receiving any
                                 salary for the period of his medical leave for his service injury. He 
                                is to provide a letter from his employer to inform MINDEF of this and 
                                the amount that is to be reimbursed, together with supporting documents.</p>
              <p>This ex-gratia payment, which is meant to 
                                compensate NSman's loss of income during the period of medical leave, 
                                will be paid in a stepdown approach based on his civilian pay or an 
                                equivalent pay of a regular serviceman, whichever higher. The ex-gratia 
                                payment will cease upon the termination of his medical leave or the 
                                award of his disability compensation, whichever earlier.</p>

              <h3>Lump Sum Disability Compensation</h3>
              <p>If it is certified by his attending Specialist 
                                that his service injury has stabilised, the NSman is to inform his unit 
                                to request for him to be reviewed by his Unit MO. He will be required to
                                 complete an authorisation form to allow MINDEF to obtain a Disability 
                                Assessment Report (DAR) from his attending Specialist on his service 
                                injury. The hospital will take about 3 to 4 months to revert with the 
                                DAR. Upon the receipt of the DAR with no further query, he will be 
                                scheduled to attend a PD Board by Military Medicine Institute (MMI) for 
                                the endorsement of the PD that has been assessed by his attending 
                                Specialist for him to have suffered as a result of his service injury. 
                                Upon the endorsement and approval of his PD Board Outcome, MINDEF/SAF 
                                HRSC will then be able to process his disability compensation. He will 
                                be informed of the award of his lump sum disability compensation 
                                subsequently.</p>
