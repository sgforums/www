If you're asking how CDF gets a airborne badge, well as a regular officer he can take confidence courses, and one of them can be airborne. You don't need to be a commando by vocation to be able to take airborne courses... but these courses are normally only opened to regulars.</div>

The Mission was set up to facilitate national reconciliation in and reconstruction of Afghanistan.

As part of his duties, LTC Lo will keep track of the military situation in Afghanistan, talk to the representatives from the various warring parties, facilitate the parties' discussion of options for settlement and demilitarisation, and make recommendations to UNSMA on how to improve the situation in Afghanistan.<br><br>I am confident that LTC Lo will be able to meet all the challenges he will face. His professionalism and experience as a Commando will enable him to carry out his tasks competently and skillfully. I am sure he will be a credit to Singapore and the SAF.

            <div class='col-md body'>Pointer Journal July 1999 Issue , Supplement<br><br>My Experiences in Afghanistan as Military Adviser<br>by LTC Lo Yong Poo<br><br>An excerpt<br><br>The SAFÂ’s First Peacemaking Mission<br><br>In early 1997, Singapore was invited by the UN to provide a Military Adviser for the UNSMA. This was to be SingaporeÂ’s first peacemaking mission. Unlike peacekeeping, peacemaking is the use of diplomatic means to persuade parties in conflict to cease hostilities and to negotiate a peaceful settlement of their dispute. Peacemaking thus excludes the use of force.2<br><br>I felt thrilled and honoured to participate in the SAFÂ’s first peacemaking mission. When approached by Army Officers Management Centre (AOMC) in March 1997 to undertake the post of Â“Military AdviserÂ” to UNSMA, I was immediately charged up and ready to go. After all, what better way to expand oneÂ’s professional horizons, I thought, than to take part in an overseas Â“no duffÂ” military operation with all its attendant thrills and challenges?<br><br>The Mazar Mission<br><br>In September 1997, a worsening of the military situation in the north, following a deepening of hostilities between encroaching Taliban forces and the opposing ethnic minorities, as well as widening divisions within the anti-Taliban alliance, resulted in the necessary evacuation of all UN personnel from the region. In that month, a Security Officer of UNDP and I were assigned to travel to Mazar-I-Sharif, a major city in the north where fighting had become particularly intense, to assist in the relocation plan as well as to provide a professional assessment on the local military situation.<br><br>The journey to Mazar-I-Sharif was itself a gripping adventure. Blocked heavily by hostile Taliban forces, the road to Mazar from Taloqan in Takhar province (where we were inserted by UN aircraft on 11 September) had to be abandoned, the usual half-day journey converted into a tedious four-day affair as we circumnavigated Taliban-controlled territory in Kunduz province across four neighbouring provinces, through perilous rocky terrain and the frontlines of three other fighting factions. Twice on our route to Mazar, our lives were endangered by local gunmen who threatened to rob us while accusing us of being foreign intruders responsible for the fighting in the country. On the fourth day, we were even trapped for several tense hours in the valleys of Mumoor, detained by a group of militia who Â“confiscatedÂ” our vehicle, refusing our release until we managed to seek the help of an intervening party of local militia fighters. To negotiate for our release, whereupon we were happily escorted to Mazar, with eleven of us all squeezed in an old jeep!<br><br>Arriving at the city on 14 September just before last light, we confirmed that an escalation in the conflict had resulted in widespread damage and looting of UN compounds and vehicles, NGO premises and international staff residences. We sought several meetings with numerous faction commanders to enlist their support and co-operation in ensuring the security of UN compounds and the safety and successful evacuation of UN international staff. However, mounting anti-foreigner sentiment and repeated outbreaks of violence in the region eventually compelled the emergency helicopter-extraction of all UN and NGO personnel from the city. This heli-evacuation plan (itself a last-resort option as all other escape routes by road had been successively disabled by advancing Taliban troops) was successfully co-ordinated and executed on 15 September. In the face of significant risks and difficulties, and to the relief of all, fifteen UN staff members and two NGO personnel in all were removed to Shiberghan in a neighbouring province and subsequently picked up by UN plane to Islamabad the following day. At that juncture, despite the dangerous atmosphere of antagonism that surrounded us, both the DFSO (Deputy Field Security Officer) and I decided to remain in Mazar, in order to continue to be the link to the UN HQ. We believed that our presence in the city would act as a symbol of hope to the locals, a declaration that the UN would continue to be around to help the people.<br><br>Riotous looting and wreckage of UN and public property by heavy aerial and artillery shelling, however, continued unabated in the ensuing week, while inter-ethnic conflicts became increasingly brutal and cruel. Throughout, we continued to confer and negotiate with the local authorities, but to no avail. Arrangements to leave Mazar by ICRC flight in compliance with urgent instructions from UNSMA were unsuccessful. Finally, a death threat was explicitly issued against us by one of the factions.<br><br>Waiting anxiously to be evacuated to the nearest UN aircraft pickup site with the help of friendly local factions, we remained mostly in hiding, confined to a stuffy UN bunker with limited rations and survival amenities, and subjected to constant bombing and shelling by warring parties in the vicinity (the closest bomb being dropped only a few houses away from our bunker). We ate one to two meals a day Â– mostly plain rice with green chilli or vitamin tablets Â– and occupied our time and thoughts with small talk and personal sharing sessions, and the routine of planning for the dayÂ’s activities and contingencies. Fuel and batteries had to be carefully conserved, particularly after the cityÂ’s power supply was completely cut off on 26 September. That we did not fall sick, suffer injury or lose hope in the prospect of escape was, of course, critical to our survival plan of staying mentally alert and positive.<br><br>Through days of nervous anticipation and hazardous close encounters with the opposition, we continued discreetly to explore escape options and emergency contingencies with the UN authorities and faction leaders. Eventually, three attempts at heli-evacuation were made with the co-operation of one of the local factions, and then frustratingly aborted due to bad timing and weather. At last, on the fourth day (5 October Â– more than three weeks after our arrival in Mazar), a fortuitous encounter with a friendly chopper passing by succeeded in securing our escape from Mazar to Shiberghan. There, we were picked up by a UN plane and sent to Islamabad, our hearts filled with inexpressible relief.<br><br>Read more below.
