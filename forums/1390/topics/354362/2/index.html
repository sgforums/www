              <p>There are times i see transport sups even slacker than clerks.
              While clerks are like forever busy, i every so often hear that
              those transport sups are in bunk or slacking somewhere when i call
              them come to my office to meet me. Transport sups are mostly
              stayout but i quite a number of clerks are stayin so hopefully you
              don't regret.</p>
              <p>Clerks used to be my ideal vocation as well but after NS i
              realise i enjoy my vocation more. I get to sit in the office, do
              some work similar to clerk with a 3SG rank, sometimes busy till OT
              sometimes slack till slp in my office :p</p>

              <p>Seriously most of the SAF vocations are stay in. Staying out is not a privileges. Transport sups depends on which units. In fact nowadays most of the SAF bunks are relatively clean. If it's dirty, it's your fault for not doing the area cleaning properly. You want to hire a maid to do for you?</p>

              <p>I was a auto tech spec working in where u training now. My workshop is just behind blk 207 if i didn't remember the blk wrongly. Left the service for 2 yrs already so no point finding me and my vocation is not for you since once i step out of the office, its a world of vehicle exhaust :p</p>
              <p>That will depends on where you are posted to. 1TPT which is in that camp has all their transport sups staying out as far as i know since i know all the transport specs from all 3 companies there (provided no change in the past 2 years, i did hear that their clerks went from stayout to stayin). However, for your condition it is possible to request MO to give you an excuse stay in. I used to know a spec who managed to get that excuse because he has serious sinus problems.</p>
              <p>Generally if you are posted to a transport hub, you rarely join them for exercise. Normally you will just be sent to camps for standby with the vehicles but all you do is eat and slp unless you suay suay kanan activated. If you cannot take all the fumes etc, then as i suggested, you could request to be the detail spec whose job is just to detail the drivers and stays in the office. in 1.5yrs or so there, i have never met the detail specs unless the company does not have any spec left in the entire coy and i have to demand the detail spec to come see me.</p>
              <p>Every single job is full of responsibilities. What make you think a clerk's life is easy? Clerks are like the people who gets scolded by everyone all the time becos RO is late, this is not done that is not done etc etc. I used to call the battalion clerks often whenever RO is late till in the end i don't even bother to read it :p</p>

              <p>I not saying you are trying to keng, have you tried in the 1st place....maybe take a puff of the inhaler before going to the workshop or environment when you know you are likely to get attack. Consult MO if wearing a mask help or not.......TS you must know even in the office, there is no such thing as an absolute clean environment, paper dust, toner from fax, photo copier, etc, unless you worked in the clean room......you are already in the real world you must know how to take care of yourself. In my times, I seen many cases worse than you yet they managed to coup with a vocation far worse than yours......</p>

              <p>i tried i tried for a week. i never say anything just tried to cope myself. but now i really cannot take it, its so frustrating to have breathing problems, constantly throughout suddenly shortness of breath, simply cause i near tonners driving about. at night also cannot sleep properly, waking up throughout the night just to take inhaler. and most of the times i have to take multiple times and its like overdosage. i tell my specialist he said its quite serious and my condition is worsened.  of course there is no such thing as totally dust free but i think it would be better for me to work in a less dusty environment. i mean i tried, but i really reached my limit already.</p>
