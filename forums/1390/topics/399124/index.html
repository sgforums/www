              Talked to many people I know who are/were commandos, guards, snipers, infanteers, armour, plus many other combat vocationalists,etc. The general consensus is that during training and exercises for the first year tough. After that, 2nd year onwards, Very Switch Off lah!!!
              
              This proves or rather substantiates that fact that 1 year is more than enough to train up a good soldier!
              
              BMT(2 mths)
              Vocation Training (2 / 3 months)
              Unit attachment for exercises, etc (remaining 8 mths or so)

              When I said 1 year, I mean for NS, train only to become a good solddier enough. Don't want to bother about being specialists or officers. Leave these appointments to those who wanna sign on as regular "Khan Chiak Peng".
              
              Train to be good combat soldier 1 year can already lah! do u understand? simple logic right?
              
              talking about productivity, as in other developed western countries, Germany, etc only serve 1 year. Taiwan only serve 4 months! But I propose 1 year!!!
              
              Dont' waste another year! Girls would get head start in working life already! u have to work under them! girls go into uniersity earlier &amp; come out earlier to work mah!
              
              Just do more shorter In_Camp Training for reservist. Once a year 1 or 2 weeks enough to refresh lah!
              
              OK ? Agree? If think this is logical and cogent please voice your support! Get the policy makers to change NS to 1 year immediately!So many policies can change immediately, why not this propsal on NS!?

              YO! Yo! This is exactly where hardcore suckers who have served 2.5 years of hardlife NS in the past who just refuse to let go and accept that the world has changed! This category includes the policy makers as well it seems.
              
              15 years reservist cycle for a 1 week Annual In-camp Training shouldn't be a problem mah! The volunteer US National Guards, who are parttime soldiers, also do their reservist training for a few weekends only.
              
              Training &amp; ops can all be scheduled within one year, trust me. BMT(2mths)- Vocation Trg(2mths) - 8mths is more than enough to put a combat soldier to platoon, company, battalion and brigade exercises!

              <p>Yeah, 15 years of 1 week annual ICT. Wait long long. Provided your reservist unit is super duper low key types.</p>
              <p>Then I must be really suay that my unit is super operational, of 10 ICTs, 8 are high key (2 weeks or more).</p>
              <p>And not all units operate the same one. I don't think commando units need to t/o and h/o OVM + A vehicles like armour does. Some logistics take already a day or so to settle. When the weekend is over, have not even draw arms.</p>
