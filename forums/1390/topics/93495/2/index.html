In fact during NS (and to some extent during ICT) I was very happy to be outfield. Particularly in the forest / jungle. Usually it will be platoon or section level when in close terrain ... so we are pretty much on our own.<br><br>For those going into NS first time, take the time to "enjoy" the jungle. Relax and soak in the atmosphere. Look out for rare animals (see if you can spot the mousedeer in Mandai forest for example).

The heat generated by that bulky thing will certainly warm up your meal sufficiently to make it more edible</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My BMT was done in Nee soon camp. My batch was the transition batch. last 2 weeks of BMT in TeKong. that time... the Combat rations was worse. the rice were separate pack from the dish. There were only plain rice ( as hard as rock ) or savioury ( fogot the spelling ) rice. and the dishs are baked beans,satay chicken, and forgot the rest le.. damn sianz..  nobody ate the rock hard plain rice. After that came the combat ration being issued now... think they are constantly improving the CR.... got pasta somemore...spicy pasta with mutton was the best..<br><br>Remembered my 2nd Wallaby, in 2001, we were finally resting betw missions. Took out the spicy pasta with mutton and curry maggi mee... cook them together,, almost like a stew.....plus the mess tin of coffee we cook.... gosh... it was my best meal during my NS time, not even the canteen or cook house proper meal can fight. sharing the hot mess tin of spicy-pasta-with-mutton-and-curry-maggi-mee and hot coffee among my men in my section. with the cold Aussie weather at night... Damned.. missed those days...<br>BTW is the spicy pasta with mutton still issued..? if available.. guys go try adding in curry maggi mee.... BEST.. plus some coffee... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I got used to it being a kind of "dirty" chap in civvy life anyway being an engineer (grease monkey) in my younger days, and also playing kampung football etc etc.<br>Also a bit of a nature lover, so I am OK in that environment.  I must say that apart from NSF days, my ICT time in the forest was not the really "chionging" type.. not much topo -ing  around to meet checkpoint timing. A lot of it was preparation and using the forest as cover and concealment and lay-up. Not looking for enemies as such.... but tactical nevertheless. No bashing allowed... which was good.</div>
