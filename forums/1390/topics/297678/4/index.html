He  was my CSM and we used to call him Mario. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>He took over from Tua Chiew as CSM, and unfortunately he had big shoes (and gloves <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) to fill.  He's a very nice guy, but he never quite commanded the respect of the men.<br><br>One of his key problems was the way he saw his job.  One thing about him was that he had a very "combat side and service side are separate" mentality, and he bought himself a lot of trouble with that.  A lot of the service side guys were my chiong buddies, and I had to smooth things over with them on his account quite often so the job would get done quickly and properly.<br><br>As Ninja says, he's a good soldier but not the instructor type - he could execute orders very well, but he struggled a bit when it came to generating orders himself, and that cost him a lot in terms of commands and control.  One thing's for sure, he could never shoot arrows properly - when we ROD'd we printed a book covering our entire service, and one of the guys drew a cartoon of Mario ending up with all the arrows he shot. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
