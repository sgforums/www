Are reservist eligibel to go for the ranger course?</div></blockquote>Ranger course used to be only for regulars but although some NS men have attended so far never heard of reservists intake and never will.There are many opportunites for a regular CDO to clear this course unless he is downgraded permanently .In this case, he might as well not wear the Red Beret anymore.Why I say opportunites given to CDO only because they can go for recourse over and over again until they pass.This course used to be very difficult to pass so there is no shame to say that many old timers have taken it several times.Some of the courses were intentional for old troopers (people already into their 30s) to clear .This is to the best of my knowledge unless they are changes already.People get posted out of formation for all kinds of reasons but I see no reason why a regular Commando shouldnt be without a Ranger tab.</div>

The Ranger course and the Ranger battalions are two related but entirely separate things.<br><br>Commando LRRP companies already have LRRP training and all companies are trained in the strike role (I don't know if the distinction exists following the changes in the NS structure, though), so the ORBAT-related issue is already addressed.<br><br>On the other hand, as the others have already said, the Ranger course is more of a leadership course.  The Commando section leader course can be seen to be a more basic and scaled-down version of the Ranger course, and is in fact conducted by Ranger cadres (or it was the last time I checked).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like others have pointed out - US Ranger units and ranger course are 2 different things (with 2 different tabs as well).<br><br>Members of the US Ranger units must pass a 4 week Ranger Indoctrination Program (RIP) before posted to one of the US Ranger battalions.<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranger_Indoctrination_Program" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranger_Indoctrination_Program</a><br><br>The US Ranger school on the other hand, conducts a 9 week leadership course - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranger_School" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranger_School </a>.<br><br>Being professionals, most, if not all, US Rangers take up the 9 week Ranger school course in order to progress in their military careers (hence 2 "ranger" tabs on their uniforms).<br><br>The roles of the US Ranger units are similar to our own commando unit. US Rangers are commandos - British commonwealth countries use the term commandos, whereas, the US choose the word "Rangers" instead. More details on the naming can be found in the history of US Ranger units formed during WW2.<br><br>And please - not all units named "rangers" are special warfare/forces units.</div>

Each has it own merits, and are tailored to suit the demands of each army..<br><br>From books and websites, i gather that the navy seals course is very physically demanding, i'm not sure if what is the theoratical component of the course.. seems to be mostly field work and PT.</div>

Not his fault, but he never quite got over coming back without the yellow tab and left after his first contract with the SAF finished.  It's a shame because he really was a damn good soldier.</div>
