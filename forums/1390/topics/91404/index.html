Chicken will be dead in split second. When the method is not executed properly it causes unnecessary suffering to the animal.<br><br>The helicopter method of killing chickens ( holding head with one hand and swinging the animal around till the head breaks ) is extremely inhumane, brutal, barbaric and unprofessional.<br><br>We kill for food and for training purposes because we have to and not because we want to have fun.

There was a lack of food and the killing of the bird is so as to provide for our need to eat... to survive. Hence, the name of the course: Jungle Confidence Course.<br><br>The main objective of the course is to train a cadre of soldiers who can operate confidently in the jungle terrain, something which many of our soldiers lack the experience of as Singapore do not have (real) jungles.<br>Before one can operate efficiently in the jungle, he must learn to survive.<br><br>Killing animals for food is a reasonable enough act because you are doing so to survive. There is no other food available and you are left with this means, therefore it is understandable even in buddhism context.<br><br>Of course, the killing must be done in such a manner that the animal experiences a swift death. This is what is taught by the instructors, do not let the animal suffer.<br><br>If you are really so affected by it, think of it this way. The quill will have to die, because it has already been purchased for that reason. If you are not the one to kill it, it will kill by another person's hand too. As fellow living beings, I'd rather take it upon myself to kill it. At least, that way I'd still have the ability to make sure that it dies the least suffered way.<br><br>If you really didn't want to do it, you'll at most forgo points. No points will be deducted, but certainly no points will be awarded for the course for that event.<br><br>Anyway, just to clarify, the JCC consists of the following:<br><br>3 days of jungle navigation test.<br><br>5 days of jungle survival. (not 4)<br><br>5 days of evasion and navigation back to base camp. (others like to say this is the escape and evasion event, but really, there's no escape part. think that's only for the ranger course)</div>
