              <p>I have been serving my NS for a year. But all the while, I have been very anxious in everything I do and often screw up. I have been scolded and punished for countless for doing things wrongly. This is just something even before I enlisted, since young. So recently, as my condition got worst, my mum started to get worried and advised me to go to see a doctor. At first I didn't want to go because I thought I am all fine and so I delayed for quite some time until I am convinced to go. The doctor referred me to a shrink and was diagnosed to have something they called the Generalised Anxiety Disorder.</p>
              <p>I have just started the medication and the shrink did give me a memo to pass to my camp MO. However, I dare not submit the memo to my camp MO as by doing so, all the people in my unit will know about my condition. I have been acting normal in front of them all the while. I am worry that they may start to laugh at me, tease me and reject me for having such illness. Or some may even accuse me of being chao keng. Then life will be even harder than now. Moreover, two of my friends in the unit have been downgraded due to depression(one of them is obviously chao keng one). If I suddenly tell them I have medical condition, they may think I trying to chao keng too. haiz..</p>
              <p>Now in my mind, I have a few worries and wish to know the answer:<br>1. I went to see a shrink at those outpatient specialist but I haven't inform to my camp MO. But in future when I apply for job or schools, are they going to make me declare that I have such illness or are they going to find out the record?</p>
              <p>2. Now that I have this memo from the shrink, which I asked the shrink not to write but he insisted, and if I didn't submit to my camp MO, will there be any issue?</p>
              <p>3. If anything happen to me during my service, will the insurance deny to pay as they could accuse me of not submitting my medical memo?</p>
              <p>Sorry if I sound like a stupid paranoid and thanks for reading...</p>

By submitting this memo to the MO does not mean everyone in your unit will know.

              <p>If u have not see a SAF shrink, all u did is useless. Submit the memo, u will be arrange to see the SAF shrink (ususally a medical officer LTC/COL), then under a medical board, u will be downgraded, given further review or charge and send to DB.</p>
              <p>I am writing in this tone because really we have no idea if u are true or a chow keng case. If u are true case, then no need to fear, just send up ur memo, the MO will arrange it. They are also doctors, it is their moral responsibility to keep their patients record secret.</p>
              <p>Unless ur medical condition is a risk to the surrounding peers (example, ppl with fits) then the doctor will ususally let those in charge know.

              <p>Furthermore, ppl being ppl, u cannot stop them from thinking u are chow keng, even if u are really a true case. Just because u have real condition, doesn't mean ppl will be nice to you, doesn't really work this way in SAF (or in the outside world).</p>
              <p>In the other spectrum, if u are chow keng, just be prepared to spend time in the DB once the SAF shrink found out that you are malingering.</p>

              <p>I am definitely not trying to chow keng as I wouldn't have waited until left 11 more months then do it if I wanted to. I am just finding myself a little weird to always be anxious and worried over all things and then worst is to do things wrongly and get scolded so often. I didn't think I may have problems until my mum told me that she find me always moody and encouraged me to see a doctor. In camp, I even caused my other friends to get scolded just because of me doing things wrongly. I felt so terrible especially when how people would see me after being scolded due to my fault. Other people even called me 'C0CK' for doing things wrong all the time.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I am still pondering if I should submit the memo. You brought up a point which I think such illness could be subjective to people. The shrink that I visited could think that I am having the Generalised Anxiety Disorder and written me the memo. However, when I am facing the SAF shrink, he may think otherwise. Especially when two of my friends in the same unit has declared they had depression and probably have seen him. Then I will get charged to DB as he may think I am trying to follow my friends and find me trying to chow keng.</p>
              <p>If this is the case, submitting the memo could give me more troubles and worries.</p>

              time.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I am still pondering if I should submit the memo. You
              brought up a point which I think such illness could be subjective
              to people. The shrink that I visited could think that I am having
              the Generalised Anxiety Disorder and written me the memo. However,
              when I am facing the SAF shrink, he may think otherwise. Especially
              when two of my friends in the same unit has declared they had
              depression and probably have seen him. Then I will get charged to
              DB as he may think I am trying to follow my friends and find me
              trying to chow keng.</p>
              <p>If this is the case, submitting the memo could give me more
              troubles and worries.</p>

              <p>Ultimately, it is still your own choice whether to submit the memo or not. But if you have did nothing wrong, there is nothing for you to worry about.</p>
              <p>Indeed, if we look from a negative view, two others from your camp have declared that they have depression and went to see the SAF shrink, and thus others who do not know of the serverity of your case might think that you are trying to follow their example in order to "chao keng".</p>
              <p>But if we look from a positive view, your friends in the same unit as you who know you well enough could stand as alibis. They could tell the superiors about your moodiness and tendency to be anxious over small things if questioned. This in turn could work in your favour.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if you wish to declare, then you should declare as soon as possible. It is definitely not a good thing to keep the memo from the shrink outside for a few months before submitting it. That will only arouse the suspicions of your superiors, as they will think that you have some ulterior motive.</p>
