              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for 
              Defence intends to raise in Parliament several defence-related issues 
              highlighted in public recently.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In addition to 
              points in the Defence Ministry's addendum, the GPC will raise issues 
              like perceived preferential treatment during National Service (NS), 
              deferment and disruption policies as well as concerns that children of 
              new citizens or permanent residents give up their citizenship to evade 
              NS.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The chairman of GPC 
              for Defence, Dr Lim Wee Kiak, told Channel NewsAsia that for next week's
               Parliament sitting, he has filed a question on perceived preferential 
              treatment during NS - something highlighted during the recent 
              Presidential Election.<br><br>He has asked Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen 
              to "clear the air" on the matter related to Dr Patrick Tan's prolonged 
              disruption from NS.<br><br>Dr Patrick Tan is President Tony Tan Keng Yam's son.<br><br>Dr
               Lim said: "There shouldn't be any doubt in Singaporeans' mind as far as
               Mindef's policy is concerned (that) there must be fairness in terms of 
              who get disrupted and who doesn't get disrupted. As a result, it doesn't
               cause resentment, it doesn't divide the society."<br><br>On Dr Patrick 
              Tan's NS deployment to the Defence Medical Research Institute, Dr Lim 
              said NSmen should be deployed according to their skill sets.<br><br>Dr 
              Lim said: "In the sense that if he has certain skills that we can use, 
              then (there is) no point using him as a cook or a driver or an infantry 
              man.<br><br>"We do have naval architects coming to serve their reservist
               as their role as naval architects, because they studied in the subject.
               So, when the Navy wants to build a new ship, they call back our NSmen 
              who are naval architects, so they serve in their role."<br><br>Dr Lim 
              also wants Mindef to review its deferment and disruption policies, 
              especially with many universities having different starting dates for 
              their terms.<br><br>Dr Lim said: "There are many different universities 
              now in Singapore, with the enrolment or the starting dates for their 
              term different from one another. <br><br>"Our education scene has 
              changed drastically, so must the SAF as well, in the sense that they 
              have to keep up with times and look at approved universities, approved 
              degrees. I think the list certainly should be expanded."<br><br>The GPC 
              will also address concerns that children of new citizens or PRs may 
              choose to give up their citizenship to evade National Service, after 
              enjoying benefits such as subsidised education in Singapore.<br><br>Dr 
              Lim said: "There have been some suggestions....(if) you are a PR and 
              when you have a child that is going to serve NS, should we ask them to 
              put in a bond. If your child refuses to do NS, then you forgo the bond."<br><br>Dr Lim hopes his fellow MPs would raise more questions during the debate in Parliament.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>

Many say these early years formed his conservative approach to financing. Educated at Anglo-Chinese School, he first worked for the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC) as a clerk on 1 March 1925 at the age of seventeen. He would remain at OCBC for 58 years altogether. He was Managing Director of OCBC from 1942 to 1972, and Chairman from 1966 to 1983. Under Tan's stewardship, OCBC rose from its humble beginnings to become among the world's top banks.<br><br></span><span style="text-align: left; color: #000000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Philanthropist</span><br></strong>Tan Chin Tuan is also a noted philanthropist. In 1984, he donated 350,000 pound sterling to the Needham Research Institute (NRI) in Cambridge, United Kingdom. The NRI is now one of the top three centres on Chinese science and technology in the world. The library block at NRI is named after him. In 1997, he committed S$250,000 each year towards the Nanyang Technological University's exchange programme in engineering. The Tan Chin Tuan exchange fellowship will allow 20 academics to conduct research at NTU or be sent overseas.<br><br>In 1999, Tan Chin Tuan celebrated his 91st birthday by promising $1,000 to Singaporeans over 90 who were lucid and active.

              <strong>Tony Tan the best actor<br></strong><br>
              In public, Tony Tan shows himself as a humble and wise man.
              Unfortunately nothing is further from truth. Nothing good can be
              expected from scion of banker. While Singaporean focus
              on <strong>Ho Ching </strong>and her Temasek fiasco, few
              people knew that <a href="http://veritas-lux.blogspot.com/2011/06/defaulting-cpf-6-biggest-loser.html" rel="nofollow" style="color: #920101;">GIC under the charge of Tony
              Tan has lost its pants in 2008 crisis</a>.<br>
              <br>
              In short, <strong>Tony Tan </strong>has blown up
              Singaporeâ€™s pension aka the corrupt CPF. He is responsible for
              condemning Singaporean to a work till death because CPF is
              effectively being wipe out in real terms. (PAP is going to stealth
              default CPF).<br>

              war.</span></span></strong>..Teo Cheng Guan subsequently met his
              wife who was also working in OCBC and got married and gave birth to
              Teo Chee Hean<br>
              <br>
              Teo Cheng Guan rose all the way to the top and was Chairman of OCBC
              from 1989 to 1991.<br>
              <br>
              After leaving Cabinet in 1991, Dr Tan returned to OCBC. He took
              over from DPM Teoâ€™s father and served as Chairman of OCBC from 1992
              to 1995.<br>

              Yong Pung How, a schoolmate of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his wife, Kwa
              Geok Choo. In 1971, Yong switched from law to finance, and formed
              Singapore International Merchant Bankers Limited (SIMBL) and the
              Malaysian International Merchant Bankers (MIMB) in Malaysia serving
              as Chairman and Managing Director of both companies. At the same
              time he also served as a member of the Singapore Securities
              Industry Council from 1972 to 1981. He announced his retirement
              from the SIMBL and MIMB offices in 1976. That same year, Yong was
              appointed Vice-Chairman of the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation
              (OCBC).<br>
              <br>
              He was seconded in 1982 by the Singapore Government to form and
              head the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC), and
              the Monetary Authority of Singapore as well. His experience in
              commercial banking proved to be invaluable to GIC as he effectively
              re-organized and streamlined the use of Singapore's foreign
              reserves.<br>
              He was also made Deputy Chairman of the Currency Commissioners, and
              Alternate Governor for Singapore of the International Monetary
              Fund.<br>
              <br>
              Yong returned to the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation in 1983,

              a judge in 1989.<br>

              <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: left; color: #000000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tan Sri Tan Chin Tuan (<em>b. 21
              November 1908, Singapore - d. 13 November 2005, Singapore</em>),
              nicknamed Mr OCBC, is a prominent Peranakan philanthropist and
              often credited as the man who built the Oversea-Chinese Banking
              Corporation (OCBC).</span></strong> <br>
              <br>
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Early
              history<br></span></strong>Tan Chin Tuan grew up in the
              Depression years under austere conditions, having lost his father
              whilst still at school. Many say these early years formed his
              conservative approach to financing. Educated at Anglo-Chinese
              School, he first worked for the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation
              (OCBC) as a clerk on 1 March 1925 at the age of seventeen. He would
              remain at OCBC for 58 years altogether. He was Managing Director of
              OCBC from 1942 to 1972, and Chairman from 1966 to 1983. Under Tan's
              stewardship, OCBC rose from its humble beginnings to become among
              the world's top banks.<br>
              <br></span><span style="text-align: left; color: #000000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Philanthropist</span><br></strong>Tan
              Chin Tuan is also a noted philanthropist. In 1984, he donated
              350,000 pound sterling to the Needham Research Institute (NRI) in
              Cambridge, United Kingdom. The NRI is now one of the top three
              centres on Chinese science and technology in the world. The library
              block at NRI is named after him. In 1997, he committed S$250,000
              each year towards the Nanyang Technological University's exchange
              programme in engineering. The Tan Chin Tuan exchange fellowship
              will allow 20 academics to conduct research at NTU or be sent
              overseas.<br>
              <br>
              In 1999, Tan Chin Tuan celebrated his 91st birthday by promising
              $1,000 to Singaporeans over 90 who were lucid and active. Mr. Tan
              wanted to share his good fortune with people of a similar age. At
              least 60 volunteers and Justices of the Peace checked the health of
              over 1,282 applicants. It is estimated that his birthday gift cost
              him $1.2 million.<br>

              <p><span><span>SINGAPORE: The Government Parliamentary Committee
              (GPC) for Defence intends to raise in Parliament several
              defence-related issues highlighted in public
              recently.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>In addition to points in the Defence Ministry's
              addendum, the GPC will raise issues like perceived preferential
              treatment during National Service (NS), deferment and disruption
              policies as well as concerns that children of new citizens or
              permanent residents give up their citizenship to evade
              NS.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>The chairman of GPC for Defence, Dr Lim Wee Kiak,
              told Channel NewsAsia that for next week's Parliament sitting, he
              has filed a question on perceived preferential treatment during NS
              - something highlighted during the recent Presidential
              Election.<br> <br> He has asked Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen to "clear the air" on the
              matter related to Dr Patrick Tan's prolonged disruption from
              NS.<br> <br> Dr Patrick Tan is President Tony Tan Keng Yam's son.<br> <br> Dr Lim said: "There shouldn't be any doubt in Singaporeans' mind as
              far as Mindef's policy is concerned (that) there must be fairness
              in terms of who get disrupted and who doesn't get disrupted. As a
              result, it doesn't cause resentment, it doesn't divide the
              society."<br> <br> On Dr Patrick Tan's NS deployment to the Defence Medical Research
              Institute, Dr Lim said NSmen should be deployed according to their
              skill sets.<br> <br> Dr Lim said: "In the sense that if he has certain skills that we
              can use, then (there is) no point using him as a cook or a driver
              or an infantry man.<br> <br> "We do have naval architects coming to serve their reservist as
              their role as naval architects, because they studied in the
              subject. So, when the Navy wants to build a new ship, they call
              back our NSmen who are naval architects, so they serve in their
              role."<br> <br> Dr Lim also wants Mindef to review its deferment and disruption
              policies, especially with many universities having different
              starting dates for their terms.<br> <br> Dr Lim said: "There are many different universities now in
              Singapore, with the enrolment or the starting dates for their term
              different from one another.<br> <br> "Our education scene has changed drastically, so must the SAF as
              well, in the sense that they have to keep up with times and look at
              approved universities, approved degrees. I think the list certainly
              should be expanded."<br> <br> The GPC will also address concerns that children of new citizens or
              PRs may choose to give up their citizenship to evade National
              Service, after enjoying benefits such as subsidised education in
              Singapore.<br> <br> Dr Lim said: "There have been some suggestions....(if) you are a PR
              and when you have a child that is going to serve NS, should we ask
              them to put in a bond. If your child refuses to do NS, then you
              forgo the bond."<br> <br> Dr Lim hopes his fellow MPs would raise more questions during the
              debate in Parliament.<br> <br> - CNA/ir</span></span></p>
