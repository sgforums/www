Makes sense why would a combat unti require more admin clerks for? And i do not think people who were non clerks during nsf can become clerks as they have to undergo training. i guess some ppl just cannot do admin work.<br><br>Anyway its already sort of established pes E no more reservist can go burn uniform liao how come all of a sudden this kind of thing comes up? Those pes E Mo's you can understand as they are MO's ie key appointment holders and saf may have a shortage of those kinds of people so i guess they lan lan bring them back.<br><br>I already in ROD modd i go burn my uniform liao.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

The phrase medical holding list makes it seem like i might be there for couple of years and then they might decide to call me back for review or whatever kind of shit. Anyone can confirm this to be true? That's why i mentioned the ROD letter thingy, 100% confirmation thingy.
