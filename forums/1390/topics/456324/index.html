              <p>i went for FRO and after declaring i have social anxiety and a few days later saw my pes changed to E9L9 on the website <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/oh.png" alt="oh.png"> which was quite demoralising <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/unhappy.png" alt="unhappy.png"> :being grouped in the second lowest pes...<br>sry if anyone feel insulted by this and thinks i look down on them <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>so i was wondering if being in pes E will it be like quite sian and meaningless doing admin stuffs and doing nothing much? <br>such that after experiencing the whole NS thing will i regret being in pes E? <br>and didnt get to experience to the fullest what other people get considering what im suffering from <br>what are the experiences that i will be missing out? <br>what are the chances that being in the normal BMT i will be forced to break out of my shell and improve my condition? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>or will i be glad that i got into pes E considering how i may suffer in a normal BMT thingy with my condition? <br>how may i be suffering if so?</p>
              <p>what about the people in pes E what are they like (im quite afraid of mixing with people who are weird as in the extreme) though im sure they will all be quite weird like me ._. haha</p>
              <p>so i pass my napfa with a silver will i still have my 2 month reduction? <br><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"> i hope so haha<br>so im in jc now when will my enlistment date be like?</p>
              <p>and if i may regret not experiencing ns to the fullest what are my chances of having it changed &gt;,&lt;<br>haha sound quite boring eh just doing admin work?</p>
              <p>i was thinking while all my other friends are getting fitter in ns i am getting out of shape <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/confused.png" alt="confused.png"> the irony...</p>

              <p>Just get over and done with for NS!</p>
              <p>Of course, it will be ideal if you are a Pes A, Commando/Diver, with dark tanned skin, tall and muscular body, with full 8 packs. However, why do you want to work so hard for a McDonald pay? </p>
              <p>The game would be different if you want to sign on. However, why do you want to sign on when you are a JC caliber, going to Uni and becoming a professional. </p>
              <p>For a similar pay, I rather sit at home and watch TV, give tuition, attend night class and sleep on my king-size bed in an air-con room, compared to running in the jungle, being bitten by insects, getting smelly and wet at the middle of the night.</p>
              <p>Each vocation have its pros and cons. Since, you are fated, just accept your fate. Pray hard that you get a nice boss.</p>

              <p>Hi CrimsonSoul, with the situation I am in, I reckon I am in a good enough position to advise you on this. First and foremost, I think that it is only right that you declare whatever problems you have, however insignificant you may feel, to the MO at CMPB, which you had. I had eczema, though it was well under control before I enlisted. Hence I did not see the need to declare it to the MO during my full body check up. Well, I was like you and many other pre-enlistees, having that mindset that being pes unfit would be uncool, and seen as weak. Expectedly, I was given pes B. I got silver for my IPPT and so was undergoing the Enhanced Leadership (For JC/ Silver and Gold IPPT) BMT, with 2 less months to serve.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BMT was, on hindset, an experience I am highly unlikely to go through again, given the context of City life in Singapore; not that I enjoy it, but I am glad I experienced it. However when I was going through BMT, it was hell for me. The shouting and swearing over the most trival of things, the "wait to rush, rush to wait" culture, synonymous to the SAF, the sleep deprivation, and the "mind fucking" at times. I started contemplating down pesing, and totally regretted my foolishness of not declaring my eczema; pride maybe, but that is plain stupid. I aggrevated my eczema, and after 8 months and numerous visit to my specialists and the camp MO, did I manage to downpes. Though I had sucessfully passes out from BMT and from my MP Training school by then. I was subsequently posted to MP after BMT. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the 12 Mar 12, I was officially revocated to an ASA, clerk. Dream come true for me. Admin work can be boring, but we are trading that for time, the luxury of booking out everyday, I think it is more than worth it. Time may be hard to pass, but we are way better than our stayin counterparts. The only major trade off I feel is that as a clerk, we do not go through the same sh*t with our mates, and hence the sense of bonding and cameraderie may not be that strong, or non existent at all, for my case as only 2 NSFs including me are in the office. It can get lonely at times. Like a dental assistant in my camp told me "although people envy me, being able to work with a female dentists, I envy those that get to book out on weekends, going out with friends, enjoying that bond". I agree with that. But nothing is perfect, learn to accept and realize that 2 years will pass, and it is the perception that shapes your attitude that determines the experience. As a clerk, your 2 years can be equally fufilling. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope my experience will enlighten you a little. My big day will come on the 04 Mar 13. Long have I waited for the coming of this day. It is coming!</p>
