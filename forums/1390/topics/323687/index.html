              <p>(WASHINGTON) Singapore has shown interest in possibly buying up to 100 of Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft over coming decades, matching Israel's tentative plans, the general in charge of the programme for the Pentagon said on Monday.</p>
              <p>Separately, the eight countries that have joined the US to co-develop the plane appear to be largely sticking to their plans to buy some 730 of their own, said Air Force Maj Gen Charles Davis, the Pentagon's programme chief.</p>
              <p>'The Israelis have said they'd take up to 100 aircraft,' he said. 'The Singaporeans have said basically the same thing.' Embassy spokesmen of the two countries had no immediate comment.</p>

              <p>M'SIA NOT THREATENED BY S'PORE'S PURCHASE OF JETFIGHTERS - AIR FORCE CHIEF</p>
              <p>PETALING JAYA, July 9 (Bernama) -- Malaysia does not feel threatened by its neighbour's plan to purchase new and modern fighter jets, Air Force Chief General Tan Sri Azizan Ariffin said</p>
              <p>"I'm not surprise with the report. This is a competition to acquire modern and sophisticated assets," he said.</p>
              <p>He was asked to comment on newsreports that Singapore was planning to buy up to 100 units of the world's most advanced fighter jet, the supersonic F-35, which uses stealth technology to avoid radar detection.</p>
              <p>Speaking to reporters after the air force's service excellence award presentation here, he said Malaysia was not lagging behind in terms of military assets.</p>
              <p>"We have the Sukhoi fighter jets and other sophisticated assets," he said.</p>

              <p>Officially we have procured 62 F-16C/D fighters from 1998-2004. These are true multirole fighters fully capable of ground attack / strike and not limited to a pure interceptor role. Earlier F-16A/Bs procured in the 1980s have already been withdrawn from the inventory and passed on to Thailand. Perhaps you took into account only the last batch of F-16s bought in 2004 under Peace Carvin IV which numbered 20 warplanes in total.</p>
              <p>Regarding the F-5 the number you quoted is closer. The RSAF officially possesses 53 of these upgraded to F-5S/T standard.</p>

              <p>Keeping 30 units in reserve is still costly as they still require maintenance, and they will be utterly in case of a war as there will not be any pilots assigned to fly them. No air force in the world pursues such a policy of buying extra as replacement - good maintenance means not having to replace aircraft, which is a highly costly prospect.</p>
