            <div class='col-md body'>I haven't heard abt the crest being blessed by the 7 main religons en mass, it could be spun off from the Commissioning Parade ceremony when the 7 religous leaders will bless the graduating cohort, as common practice, the cadets will usually remove the crest on their pick caps before returning to store and use the blessed crest on their own berets and returing the non blessed crest back to the store.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So now we know that there is a practice of blessing the SAF crest, in a way through a commisioning parade.   But what is its purpose?<br><br>Is it really supposed to act a "Ward" against evil spirits? Or is it something else?</div>
