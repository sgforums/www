If you were in their position and knew you were wrong, would you take that risk, or take the 3-month sentence and be thankful it was not longer?  Any reasonable man would take the latter option, <strong>IF</strong> he was in the wrong.  On the flip side, appealing under those circumstances if you know you're not in the wrong is not an unreasonable course of action.<br><br>The only thing the outcome says is that there was insufficient evidence to prove any errors in the original trial.
