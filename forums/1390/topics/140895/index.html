            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Lordz, it comes down to this.  Sure, you can be more safety-conscious, but ultimately any combat vocation is a dangerous job.  If you are more safety conscious (to prevent any accusations of tekaning) at one stage, say selection of a soldier for a role, you may end up subjecting that soldier to later training that he is unable to handle, making it more dangerous.</div>
