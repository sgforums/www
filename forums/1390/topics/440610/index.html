              <p>I feel sorry for TS, cos I can understand how you feel. I detest army life too. BMT was still ok, but when I was posted to SISPEC for that 10 weeks, it was the lowest point in my life. I am fairly fit, but I lack endurance. Ya, 24km road marching was terrible. I was dragging my feet to the finishing line, and my legs felt like a pair of toothpicks, going to break anytime...and the blisters on foot and pelvic...Not forgetting the overnight trench digging which is so dirty and sticky, and lastly is the week stay in Tekong. After the hard trining, the last drill was the evacuation where we must carry the heavy guy on the stretcher and run for the ferry. All these plus those confinements....terrible period.</p>
              <p>After that I was posted to SADA (Air Defence) to train in RBS70. Training was not as tough as in SISPEC, but the load is very heavy too. Now I already ROD and these are my memories.</p>
              <p>Bear with it and go through it! You are a man, and we must not be wimps! Chiong ah!</p>

              <p>Are 120mm nowadays only towed or M113? Pushing the towed one on a flat road already a killer, imagine carrying a tube or base plate.</p>
              <p>Is this you without your field pack?</p>

              <p>i not so old la... I am with SP, but everyone need to learn and experience man packing it as they say.. is M113 break down... the mission still must carry-on. so everyone of us must be able to man pack it also.... those that dont carry the system, carry 3 ammo each.. each ammo weigh 12~15kg.</p>
              <p>We also need to cross train the towed type also... the tube is to be thrown to action the system... I remember my time, the actual towed unit 60% down graded and the whole unit regroup with other units.</p>

              <p><br>Recce as a whole is quite fun since its a specialised field. Your platoon should have quite a fair bit of autonomy esp if the CO is not well-versed in recce ops and your S2 has little or no recce background.</p>
              <p>You get to learn things (though pretty much useless in outside world) that make you seem pretty cool (try rattling off those cool stuff at the bar when with your rifleman friends)</p>
              <p>Ops wise may seem tough, being the first in (and usually last out) but look at it this way. You are given a set time to make your way to a point, after which you hardly move around much anymore (unless you got contacted, then hong gan liao...). While the rest of the Battalion charge the hill, you're "relaxing" in one corner waiting for ex to end. You get to learn things (though pretty much useless in outside world) that make you seem pretty cool (try rattling off those cool stuff at the bar when with your rifleman friends).</p>
              <p>Every vocation will have their own siong times or downright bored periods. How you make use of that time determines on how you'll look back on your NS life.</p>
