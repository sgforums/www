              It has been a couple of months since I got enlisted, I realized there are several flaws in the training for our soldiers, even during BMT. I'm just sharing what I realized, no flaming please, discuss this as peaceful as possible.
              
              1) Recruit detest their sgt/lower rank soldier detest their superior whose rank is higher.
              
              During BMT, we always see recruits saying "this sgt kns, that knn sgt" or complaining how bad their platoon commander are. I know even our sgt and platoon commander are NSF too and all of us went through the stage of being order here and there. I realized the reason of this is because most sgt and PC are acting like some as*****. I work as a teacher for 3 years before I got enlisted. I know sometimes when students(in this case, recruits) behavior weirdly and may not listen to you, from my experience, the sgt/PC should start doing things that the recruits will like them. For a successful educator/commander(sgt/lt/whatever higher rank) to command his men, his men must be able to respect him and like him first, if they don't, they can turn around and disobey order disregard DB or whatever punishments and that, the commanders don't want to see in war time. Btw, my sgt and pc are good person and I kinda like them, just some other sgt I saw who act big because of rank.
              
              2) Flaws in the training schedule.
              
              During BMT, it's the time for the commanders to prepare the new recruits for the basic stuff as a soldier, some go through ptp and some go straight to BMT as enhance batch. No matter it's the ptp or enhance batch, the training schedule is fatally flawed. Strength training and running are done almost everyday and it can cause serious damaged to the body rather than building muscles and strength. A few platoon mates and myself are experienced in building strength/muscles and martial artists&amp;instructors, all of us agree that the training that we are doing are more damaging that benefiting to our muscles. Several recruits in my company suffer serious injury and that include myself. I once reflected this to my sgt, the PTI and even our OC, I forgot what my sgt and oc said, but the PTI who handle our strength training and the running agrees that the training are seriously flawed and totally wrong from building strength. Instead of everyday train, which allows zero time for the muscle to repair it's tissues, the schedule should do like alternate day training. One day train, one day lecture. It can be a bit slow for some people, but it would be inefficient if recruits kept suffering injuries because of the training.
              
              3) No gun=useless?
              
              This is a weird thing, this even somehow happens in SPF. During all the BMT, BCCT(basic close combat training) are introduced to the recruits. ICCT and ACCT are then introduced to soldiers depends on which unit you go to. The problem is, it's crappy. BCCT won't work if a recruits were to met someone for close quarter combat. During one of the BCCT, I asked my platoon mate to use the same technique that the instructor taught the combat of how to disarm a knife from enemy. The instructor took about 5 seconds, doing things that don't make sense, I took one second which my platoon mate said he could have died several times if that's for real. I also once witness my OC demo something out of ACCT or something and that's what I was taught in my martial art class when I first started couple of years back. So the advance close combat technique are the basic of martial arts? So if during close combat situation, rifle, knife and pistol are not with him, does that mean that soldier is as good as dead? I think the training should include more realistic close combat training beside the handling of rifle and other forms of weapon.
              
              Again, I'm just sharing what I noticed in the training, especially during BMT. No flaming please and please discuss this peacefully.
              
              P.S I'm still serving NS.

              For 1) Some people sucks irregardless of their rank (this includes me). These people may be alright initially, but their character and personality changes when they are given power in hand.  
              
              For 2) For strength training, one have to alternate and rest. However, BMT trains on stamina and endurance, which can be trained everyday. The problem is some people are naturally "weak". Their running techniques are flawed, spine is not straight, etc  so they will ended up destroying their joints. The more they run, the worse they become. Tekong BMT actually dont train on running everyday. In fact, I used to run 10 km everyday during JC times, and I actually became weaker and fatter during BMT. LOL. 
              
              For 3) If you learn martial combat, then you should know that martial combat is something that needs to be trained often. My Aikido and Muay Thai skills drop to level zero after I did not practise  it for a while. So what is the point about teaching proper close combat.

              <p>Well the thing about Tekong's Specs and Officers is that they take care of you for 2-4 months and off you go. Even if they, the commanders, got the respect of you, it will only be for 2-4 months. While once posted to the units or vocation, you will realise that those unit commanders are better in general where they have to go on excercise with you and work with you at least for a year.</p>
              <p>On the micro aspect, in Tekong there are like 20 in a section, about 70 men in a platoon. Do the math, and how do you expect a sect com to know all 20 in a section in 4 months? He might not even remember your name as he has many as 4 batches of BMT coming in a year. Even section mates do not bond well over 2-4 months. What more for a PC?</p>

              <p>2) With regards to the training schedule, I think the main focus
              is on endurance rather than strength. In a real war-time scenario,
              soldiers walk long distances and survive on little food. Endurance
              and stamina would be the key here. Of course, good core body
              strength helps in survival too.</p>
              <p>Having gone through the PTP phase of BMT myself (about 5 years
              ago), I would say the commanders do try to schedule less strenous
              activities such as lectures and briefings after strength training
              sessions, so as to allow the body to recover. They face the problem
              of having to plan and properly fit gym training, runs, lectures,
              field camp, route marches and more into a time-span of just 9 weeks
              (circa 2005).</p>
              <p>3) ICCT and ACCT lessons will be taught after BMT, depending on
              vocation/unit. That is all I can say.</p>

              Dont say that. I think it is a good idea and innovation. These ideas are aimed to improve life.

              <p>They do. But usually we carry our personal luggage into the aircraft and all military equipment are pre loaded into the aircraft cargo compartment. I agree the new duffel bag looks very sissy-ish. That is why i still use my ali baba bag to carry all my kit.</p>
              <p>I was trained in BCCT/ACCT towards the tail end of my NSF stint. I did bayonet fighting during BMT. The best advice we got from the close combat instructor was that if a soldier needs to use his limbs to defend himself from the enemy, it meant that he is fucked or going to get fucked.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Basically, BMT is a programme of putting civic education into practice amongst all rank &amp; files and their supervisors. Probably, they could implement class lesson on civic mindedness and esprit de corps on peace &amp; harmony. This physical training is a form of exercise that is based on individual capacity and ability. The individual should understand their limitation and carried them out based on their limitation rather than strictly follow training direction, to avoid injury and untowards accidents. Please be reminded that once you got injure, you suffer pain instead of the officer, so take good care bro!.  Whether it is BCCT, ICCT or ACCT, once a big bomb is landed on Singapore because of diplomatic flaw due to uncivic mindedness, your body either distorted or brain dead. These training is like lego helping your to exercise your mind through self discipline.</p></div>

              <p>henshin ... all i can tell you is in ns we are not treated as mere human we are just slave ... who can u feed back to ? u look for a mp to feed back they will come find u ... u tell ur superior they will tell u i will look into it but what they do they just sit on it and forget ... so why bother ? the only time when they will take actions is something really went wrong and something happens till they cant really cover it any more .... than they will only change ... it is not the first that that happen ... </p>
              <p>If ns was a pleasant thing ... do you think the government have to make NS compulsory ? facts are infront of you ... so why bother ? let put this way ... in SAF there is no equility ... when u are sick and u are a junior ranking man and u tell the MO u are sick (e.g flu ,soar throat ) ... they will say " you still can talk, still can complain and still can move, you are not that sick la light duties will do"  ... when u see a senior ranking officer see a MO .. you see lo ... even Soar throat got MC ... what kinda fair treatment you wan ? </p>
