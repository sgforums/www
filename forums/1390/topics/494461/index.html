              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;" dir="ltr">After reaching your Operationally Ready Date (ORD), you will transition from full-time National Serviceman (NSF) to Operationally Ready National Serviceman (NSman). ORNS refers to the NS training phase that NSmen undergo with their NS unit. It is typically a 10 year training cycle which comprises 3 main phases:</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;" dir="ltr"><img class="img-responsive" style="box-sizing: border-box; vertical-align: middle; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="https://www.ns.sg/nsp/wcm/connect/nsmen/097dbc68-a620-49a3-8e70-4cfae26d4887/1/orns-updated.jpg?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CVID=" alt=""></p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;" dir="ltr">To complete an ORNS year, you need to participate in an ORNS activity within your work-year, which starts on 1 April and ends on 31 March of the following year. For this period, you may be called up for not more than 40 days of ORNS activities annually. It is your responsibility to inform your employer in advance of any ORNS activities you need to attend.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;" dir="ltr">Throughout your ORNS, you must update MINDEF on your contact details via Update My Profile on the NS Portal.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;" dir="ltr"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 700; font-family: roboto-500-medium, sans-serif;">Note:</span> Any changes to your contact details will take up to 3 working days to be reflected in the system.</p>

              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;" dir="ltr">As part of your ORNS, you could be called up to fulfil the training requirements for the following ORNS activities:</p>

              </ul>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;" dir="ltr">You will be notified of your ICT via MINDEF notification channels which you are required to acknowledge. Furthermore, you will receive a softcopy of the official notice, i.e. SAF100, via Manage Call-Ups &amp; Manning on the NS Portal. Your SAF100 will have your ICT details, like the reporting date, time, venue, attire and instructions for your call-up. If you are unable to attend, you must apply for deferment via Manage Call-Ups &amp; Manning on the NS Portal.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;" dir="ltr"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 700; font-family: roboto-500-medium, sans-serif;">Note:</span> Being absent from your ICT without approved deferment may subject you to disciplinary action.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;" dir="ltr">To prepare for your ICT, you can replace and replenish your personal equipment at the <a style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #a12426; outline: none; background-color: transparent;" href="https://www.ns.sg/nsp/portal/nsmen/home/locations/locations?locationType=eMart">SAF eMarts</a> or via Shop At eMart on the NS Portal.

Notification can occur through 2 ways:</p>

              <li style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 5px;">Open Mobilisation: You will be notified through broadcast of codewords representing your unit in mass media like TV and radio, and through your personal contact numbers<span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 15.4px;">–</span> home, office or mobile phone</li>
              <li style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 5px;">Silent Mobilisation: You will be notified through your personal contact numbers <span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 15.4px;">–</span> home, office or mobile phone</li>

This has to be done within your IPPT Window <span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 15.4px;">–</span> a 12-month period. The first window starts on your birthday after your ORD and ends a day before your next birthday.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;" dir="ltr">As IPPT requirements are gazetted under the Enlistment Act, you will not receive notification via SAF100 to attend any IPPT activities. It is your responsibility as an NSman to track and fulfil your IPPT requirements within your annual IPPT Window. To assist you, an SMS notification could be sent upon the commencement of your IPPT Window.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;" dir="ltr">You can also fulfil your IPPT requirements by completing 10 sessions of <a style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #a12426; outline: none; background-color: transparent;" href="https://www.ns.sg/nsp/portal/nsmen/home/nstopics/ippt_requirements/ipt/introduction_to_ipt">IPPT Preparatory Training (IPT)</a> with at least 1 IPPT attempt within your IPPT Window.</p>

              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;" dir="ltr">For overseas travel that is more than 14 days and less than 6 months, you need to inform the MINDEF Notification Centre (MNC) prior to your trip. But if you are travelling for 6 months or longer, you will need to apply for an Exit Permit (EP). All these can be done via the eService<span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 15.4px;">–</span> Manage Overseas Trips on the NS Portal.</p>

You will still need to seek approval from your unit's Commanding Officer on the travelling details. If you do not, you may be called back for investigation and be subjected to disciplinary action.</p>

This is to ensure that you will not suffer a loss of income as a result of attending these activities while employed. Your NS Pay is typically made up of your Service Pay and Make-Up Pay.</p>

              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;" dir="ltr">Different schemes have been designed to recognise your contributions throughout your ORNS. You will receive this in the form of annual tax relief of $1,500, MINDEF/SAF Group Insurance coverage during your ORNS training, and Celebratory Gifts to commemorate your special occasions.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;" dir="ltr">You can also receive awards when you reach the different milestones in your ORNS, like the National Service HOusing, Medical and Education (NS HOME) Awards and Service Medals. NSmen with exemplary performances may also be eligible for other forms of awards and recognition, like the NS Excellence Award (NSEA).</p>

              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;" dir="ltr">You will be deemed to have completed your ORNS training cycle and be phased into the MINDEF Reserve (MR) when you have fulfilled 10 ORNS years of which 7 are HK ICTs.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;" dir="ltr"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 700; font-family: roboto-500-medium, sans-serif;">Note:</span> For Key Appointment holders, you have to fulfil 13 ORNS years of which 8 are HK ICTs.</p>

              </ul>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;" dir="ltr">However, you will still need to apply for an EP if you are travelling overseas for 6 months or longer. You should also maintain your personal equipment as you may still be activated for operational service up to your statutory age – 50 and 40 years old for Officers and WOSEs respectively.</p>

              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;" dir="ltr">Upon reaching your statutory age, you will be considered an Ex-NSman. You have fulfilled your NS duty. You are no longer required to participate in any ORNS activities and notify MINDEF on your overseas travel.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;" dir="ltr">You may dispose your personal equipment by returning it to any SAF eMart outlet or the Army Logistics Base. You may also dispose of it on your own, as long as it does not result in the unauthorised usage of your equipment by other persons.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;" dir="ltr">For example, you should cut your SAF uniforms and SAF helmet liner suspension assemblies and retention straps into small pieces, and remove all tags with the label "Property of SAF"Â€Â� before discarding them into the waste bin.</p>

Overview<br>The military justice system in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is expected to treat every service personnel fairly and equally, regardless of race, rank or vocation.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;"> <br>2. Multi-levelled Approach</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;">The military justice system is based on the SAF Act, which was implemented in 1972. All servicemen are subjected to the SAF Act, SAF Regulations, and orders of whatever form issued pursuant to them.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;">While discipline is paramount in the military, not all offences committed by SAF servicemen are dealt with by formal investigations and charges. Essentially, offenders can be dealt with either by way of informal or formal punishment systems.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;"> <br>3. Informal Punishment System<br>Commanders are empowered to mete out informal punishments like push-ups and weekend confinement to servicemen who have committed disciplinary breaches, like being late, sluggish, or improperly dressed.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;">4. Formal Punishment System<br>If the offence that a serviceman committed is of a more serious nature, he may be formally dealt with by his disciplinary officer by way of a summary trial, or brought before a subordinate military court (more commonly known as the General Court Martial or GCM).</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;">(a) Summary Trial</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;">The offences that can be dealt with by summary trial are essentially military offences, such as absence without leave (AWOL), non-compliance with lawful orders or insubordination.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;">Depending on the rank of the serviceman in question, and the type of the disciplinary body hearing the case, the possible sentences that may be imposed can vary, and these can include fines or detention.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;">The summary trial is carried out in accordance with relevant SAF regulations, and the records of the summary trial are sent to the office of the Director, Legal Services of the SAF.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;">(b) General Court Martial</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;">The General Court Martial exists as a separate forum from that of the summary trial. Unlike the summary trial, the GCM can deal with a wider range of offences, and can impose a wider range of punishments including imprisonment and discharge, on top of sentences like detention and fines. The GCM is also a more public and open forum, and its proceedings are conducted using similar legal rules and procedures as those used in a civil criminal court.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;">Generally, only serious offences investigated by the Military Police Command, and which are referred to the office of the Director of Legal Services, will result in the accused serviceman being charged in a GCM. In such a case, a military prosecutor will draw up a formal charge sheet and present it before the GCM.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;">General Courts Martial can be further sub-divided into two categories, namely the Panel Courts Martial - consisting of a President and usually two other members, and Judge Courts Martial - consisting of a single President only.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;">Currently, the practice is for military offences to be heard by Panel Courts Martial, while civil offences like misuse of drugs and penal code offences may be dealt with by a Judge Court Martial.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;"><br>The current policy is also for an NSman, who is or was a District Judge in the Subordinate Courts, to preside in a GCM. There are currently 10 NSmen who have been appointed by the Armed Forces Council to perform duty as President of a court martial. They are rostered by the Registrar of the Subordinate Military Court to hear cases during their in-camp training. In the case of a Panel Court Martial, the other two members are rostered from among some 155 military officers appointed by the Chief of Defence Force.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;"> <br>5. Ways to Seek Redress</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;">There are numerous safeguards and avenues set out in the military justice system for an SAF serviceman to seek redress if he is unhappy about the punishment imposed on him.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;">Generally, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with an informal punishment meted out to him may request a higher level commander to review the punishment, or request for formal disciplinary dealing.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;">In the case of a summary trial, a serviceman brought before the disciplinary officer may elect instead to be tried by a court martial. Alternatively, an aggrieved serviceman may request that his conviction or punishment imposed at the summary trial be reviewed by MINDEF's Director Manpower (a delegated authority of the Armed Forces Council).</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;">In the case of a GCM, a serviceman may choose to be represented by a lawyer or an SAF defending officer if his case will be heard by a court martial. The SAF has about 200 trained defending officers. While an SAF defending officer comes free to the serviceman, he has to bear the cost of engaging a lawyer. At the end of the trial, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with the decision of the court martial may petition the Reviewing Authority (the AFC or a committee of its members) for a review of his case. The serviceman can also appeal to the Military Court of Appeal (MCA) for a reconsideration of his conviction, or his sentence, or both.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;">The MCA, when convened to hear an appeal, sits as a panel of five members. Heading the MCA is a President, who is appointed by the Chief Justice. By law, he must be a person qualified to be a Judge of the Supreme Court. The current President of the MCA is Justice Choo Han Teck. Four other members - two civilian members who are qualified legal practitioners with at least five years experience each, and two senior military officers - make up the rest of the MCA. The MCA is the highest court in the military justice system.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;"> <br>6. Impartial Hearings<br>It is important to recognise that the GCM and the MCA are tribunals headed by presidents who are outside the SAF chain of command.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;">Being an "outsider", the president of these forums will hear the case impartially like any other civil criminal case. The proceedings in the GCM and the MCA are also heard in a public forum, and these military courts adopt many of the same legal procedures and safeguards as that used in the civil criminal courts. All servicemen formally charged with an offence can bring their case to these forums.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;"> </p>

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;">The four units are:</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;"><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit;">Military Police Enforcement Unit (MPEU):</strong> The unit consists of the Law Enforcement and Ceremonial Company (LECC), the Security Operation Unit (SOU) and the Special Security and Protection (SSP) Branch. It is the active wing of the SAF MPC and executes most of the operational and ceremonial duties and roles carried out by the SAF MPC.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;">The LECC was formed by combining the former Active Provost Company (APC) and the former Zone Provost Company (ZPC). Its duties include most of the important ceremonial duties required within the SAF as previously handled by the APC, and a traffic platoon which ensures the compliance of traffic regulations by military personnel on the road as well as performing escort duties. It also performs regular raids for contraband and/or miscreants on various camps of the SAF as was conducted by the ZPC. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Enforcement Platoon (also known as Platoon 2) performs regular operations in residential areas, workplaces, and many public places such as shopping centres, clubs and eating outlets to apprehend <a title="Deserter" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deserter">deserters</a>, <a title="AWOL" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWOL">AWOL</a> offenders, drug addicts and other military criminals.</span> They work closely with the Singapore Police Force and are often in very dangerous situations and are extremely well trained for handling the varied scenarios that they find themselves in. This is also the platoon that enforces the public image of the SAF by booking offenders who smoke in uniform and commit other offences in uniform while in the eye of the public.</em></span> It is worth noting that they perform undercover security operations for high-key events like the National Day Parade and the Youth Olympic Games. The security of Mowbray Station is overseen by a platoon who is also in charge of registering and detaining suspects and offenders of military crimes in holding cells. The station is similar to a civilian police station and it is usually the first stop for detainees before their transfer to the detention barracks after conviction in military courts, or a temporary holding cell for servicemen placed under Closed Arrest. The investigative branch for the SAF, the Special Investigation Branch (SIB) investigates higher-order military crimes that requires specialised handling. Since 31 December 8, MPEU has heralded the inclusion of a new branch within its ranks. The Security Support and Protection (SSP) Branch is involved in sensitive operations so no further information is available.</p>
