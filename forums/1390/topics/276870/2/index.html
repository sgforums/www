He died of liver and organ failure on February 1 last year.<br><br>After his enlistment on December 3, 2005, Mr Muhammad Sufian was administered the anti-malaria drug, Maloprim, on seven separate occasions. He started to develop a cough, fever, rash and headache and sought treatment at the Pulau Tekong Medical Centre on six occasions.<br><br>On January 15 last year, he sought treatment at Alexandra Hospital (AH) after developing a fever and rash.<br><br>He was then in a stable condition and was given an appointment to see a dermatologist about a week later. His condition had deteriorated further when he returned to AH on January 23.<br><br>In view of his worsening liver condition, he was admitted to the hospital and later transferred to National University Hospital (NUH) on the same day.<br><br>At NUH, dermatologists and the infectious diseases and liver transplant teams treated him. But his condition declined, developing multi-organ failure before eventually dying.<br><br>On Wednesday, State Coroner Ronald Gwee ruled a misadventure verdict on Mr Muhammad Sufian's death. Citing reports from two medical experts, the District Judge ruled out any negligence on the part of the physicians who provided "aggressive supportive treatment" to the deceased.<br><br>Consultant dermatologist Dr Lim Kah Beng's report noted that Mr Muhammad Sufian's case was "unusual", as the "complaints were more of a flu-like illness".<br><br>In an investigation report read out in court, Chief Army Medical Officer Colonel Dr Benjamin Seet said that Maloprim "had been very effective in preventing malaria amongst SAF troops training on Pulau Tekong and overseas". Prior to the incident, the drug "had a good safety profile in the SAF" and the serviceman's death was "unprecedented".<br><br>The court also heard of steps taken by the SAF to address the situation after a forensic report attributed Mr Muhammad Sufian's death to one of Maloprim's components.<br><br>SAF doctors were educated on the rare condition through a medical advisory and lecture.<br><br>An independent expert panel to review the SAF's anti-malaria policy was also convened last October. Based on its recommendations, Maloprim was replaced with two other drugs</div></blockquote>my platoon mate. was a nice guy, really willing to go. we was just told its liver failure, din know its cause by dapsone....<br><br>man bro. we from G P2 miss you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MALOPRIM'S SAFETY PROFILE HAD BEEN GOOD: MINDEF<br>-----------------------------------------------<br>Letter from Colonel Benedict Lim, Director Public Affairs, Mindef<br><br>I refer to the letter, "How Safe is Maloprim?" by Jiang Zhiwei (Sept 5).<br><br>Maloprim was first introduced in the SAF in 1985, and became the SAF's<br>first-line drug against malaria in 1998. Up to the unfortunate incident<br>involving the late REC Muhd Sufian, Maloprim had a good safety profile in<br>the SAF. Maloprim is also one of the drugs approved by the Health Sciences<br>Authority for malaria prevention in Singapore.<br><br>All hospitalisations and cases of drug-related adverse reactions involving<br>SAF personnel are reported and tracked. Side effects to Maloprim are rare<br>and only a few cases of Dapsone Hypersensitivity Syndrome have been<br>reported among SAF servicemen over the past  20 years. The majority of<br>servicemen who were affected developed either rashes or hepatitis, and<br>they recovered fully once Maloprim consumption was stopped.<br><br>The SAF will continue to take active steps to look after the health and<br>well-being of its servicemen. Working closely with the National<br>Environment Agency and Ministry of Health, the SAF set out to make Pulau<br>Tekong "malaria-free". This was achieved in March this year, and the<br>requirement to consume drugs to guard against malaria infection on Pulau<br>Tekong was lifted a month later.<br><br>Todayonline News Alert</div>
