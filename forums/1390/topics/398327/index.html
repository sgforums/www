              <p>Hi experts,</p>
              <p>          I am just curious, I mean by common sense, BMT should be the platform for which the MINDEF screens through the various military competency of each and every individual to post them as of the units in which they will serve the best.</p>
              <p>          I have friends whom told me that during BMT, there are combat competent trainings that files you into being a rifleman, SISPEC or OCS and sorts. What my friend did was that he just nice pass those rifle trainings, IPPT, jungle craft and survival(He tell me especially this one, must show them I am a real pussy), rappelling(He told me if there are any rope trainings just be the one lagging behind, so as not to kena Guards and Commando).</p>
              <p>          So I want to ask, about in BMT, whether there are any sorts of competency trainings that are logistics and OETI related, so that I can just scrape through the rest of the trainings and excel on those that I wanted to be in, so as to manipulate where I want to go.</p>
              <p>          I am Pes B and I hope to enter OETI and I just dun wan to keng. Pls help. Cus my friend told me that in army, actions are louder than words, just shut up and underperform till they really think that I am a combat shit to post me to support units.</p>

              <p>You say you don't want to keng, but you say that you want to enter logistics units.</p>
              <p>Very contradicting indeed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Well, there is this lifeguard selection test, if you can do well in it and fail to qualify for command school at the same time, you will become a lifeguard. And yeah, most lifeguards are either under logistics branch or manpower branch.</p>
