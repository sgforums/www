Thanks a millions!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>Hey fren <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ... your physical fitness and educational level doesn't necessary qualify you for commandos... being a commando means you must possess a higher IQ, calm and analyatical mind, the ability to think on your feet and of course certain psychomotor skills... maybe the vocational test at CMPB proved that you might not fit the critiera <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>I too received the VA with the commandos earlier on, and I dun think there would be another vocational assignment for CDOs... my fren received the VA in august while I received it in september... given the fact that the posting order would be around late sep to mid oct, it would be unlikely that there would be another VA...<br><br>It is unlikely that you'll join the CDOs from BMT or during command schools as all cdos are straight from their mono-intake... even cdos officer at OCS also join after their training after BMT and BCT for Pro term... The only chance that you may cross over to CDOs may be signing on, but bear in mind their stringent crossover requirement, it's not as easy as the VA when they select you... only a small percentage made it each time...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> my advice would be, take it easy and be happy... view it as a bonus, it'll be great if you have it but it's also fine if you dun... you can try hard for other alternatives... good luck!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What's all this about going from Tekong to CDO?  AFAIK, CDO has not changed its mono-intake policy.  Bottom line is that for NSFs, if you don't do your BMT with CDO, forget it - there's no entering after BMT, OCS or any other course.  However, if you're a regular, you can be posted to CDO if the conditions are right.<br><br>As for the selection criteria, I'll say it again - after 15 years, I've yet to come across a feasible explanation of how they came to select a bum like me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  If you get it, you get it.  Otherwise, don't worry about it - life's obviously got better plans for you.</div>
