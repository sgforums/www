Your battalion 2 I/C's my batch boy, as well as SOF's next boss, so maybe you wanna think about easing up on that "take care of you" talk?  If you want, I can get my old buddies Chris and Ari to "take care of you" as well - I'm sure you know those two Ranger cadres?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Paradise and hell,<br><br>Looks like you're really keen so a few pointers for you. All heresay and unverified, you understand?<br><br>*CMPB work on NSF done by computers, as are many things nowadays (sigh). Parameters are set. Necessary information entered, processed and who-goes-where lists are generated. No one there knows who you are and i guess no one there really cares about who you are (unless you are what was formerly known as WHITE HORSE. But officially, WH DON'T EXIST anymore. Unofficially......hmm) The lists are sent to where they ve to go and orders are sent to where they ve to go. One of them to you la. So if you did not get a letter from computer telling you to report to Commandos then ....... too bad. You can't really appeal to a computer.<br><br>*BUT ...... yes, there's always a BUT! In the unlikely situation (so don't get your hopes up) where the Commandos, for some reason or other, should experience a shortfall (whole batch kena chicken pox? Haha) then it's back to the computer. More inputs, more processing, more generating and viola, another list is generated and new orders issued. How to get on that back up list? Ask the computer. Again, no appeal.<br><br>*BUT! (Another one?!) Never say never. Your name might somehow be on THAT list. Just held up a bit, as does everything else nowadays (sigh). Then you find yourself in the Commandos! Good luck, work damn hard and do your best. Maybe you can just jump up and shout "PARADISE AND HELL REPORTING, SIR!" in the middle of the cookhouse during lunch. And some of the lao jiaos here will know who you are.  But BOY OH BOY will you get into GDBH (God Damn Bloody Hell) lot of TROUBLE!!<br><br>*Signing on. Very personal. Will have profound effect on the rest of your life and your family too. Seek out the SAF Recruitment Officer or people in service whom you trust. This one has to be face to face, cannot online. And NO, i'll NOT meet you in person. Because im not in service and im only an ORCA in a BIG BIG OCEAN. You can't find me.<br><br>*Other services are just as good. All have a role to play. If you are really sincere about being of service to your nation, just do your part and do it well. Be it in Guards, Infantry, Armour, Signals or wherever the computer might send you.<br><br>P.S.  I tot everyone wants to be a fighter pilot? Got F-15 you know?<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">ORCA<br>DE OPPRESSO LIBER<br><br>I WILL ALWAYS PLACE THE MISSION FIRST.<br>I WILL NEVER ACCEPT DEFEAT.<br>I WILL NEVER QUIT.<br>I WILL NEVER LEAVE A FALLEN COMRADE.</span></strong></div>
