            <div class='col-md body'>Clear doubt.<br><br>If you already have a brother in Cdo, there is no such excuss that you will not be selected. In Cdo, have have brothers either from the same coy or different coy.<br><br>It is very rare to be transfer from SBMT or ITD into Cdo. So far have not hear off.  Because the BMT phase is a little different in situation. After BMT you come, you will collaspe because that candidate is not adapt to the situation and environment.<br><br>As for going to OCS then to Cdo, sorry no such things happened in Cdo. During BCT, trainers will only start to observe and recommend after BCT.  That means a Cdo Trainee can only go to OCS during VT when the rest are doing their VT.<br><br>During para, Cdo Ocs trainee will return to PTW for the para training then get their red beret and return to OCS to continue. They will only return on the 3/4 month after the whole coy is operation.  They will then to posted to others coy as PC with the ranks of 2Lt until ORD. Before ORD, they will be promoted to Lta one or 2 months before ORD.</div>
