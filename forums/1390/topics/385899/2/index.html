              <p>i think more easily to get downgraded</p>
              <p>because of ones body starting to show</p>
              <p>signs of wearout..</p>
              <p>For instance ..I rem during first ICT</p>
              <p>so many super fit and Pes A/B</p>
              <p>come to Last two ICT.. so many got downgraded</p>
              <p>even officers also got into Pes C hhaha</p>
              <p>What can army expect from a bunch of 35 years</p>
              <p>plus soldiers? As fit as a 18 yr old boy?</p>

              <p>I also suffer from pretty serious flat feet. When I complained to my MO during NS, he asked me to walk around the room and he remarked that my feet were as flat as a tack.</p>
              <p>I told him it only hurts when standing stationary for extended periods of time, marching or walking &amp; running is ok as long as the foot is in motion and I have good insoles.</p>
              <p>He asked me if I wanted to downgrade because my case is due to structural failure of the foot arches and even physio cannot help. But by then I was already operational ready (finished all my vocational training - I was combat engineer) so I said don't bother I already learnt to cope with the pain.</p>
              <p><br>Yeah it hurts but you get used to it. Go see your MO if it's causing you real issues but I think most people just end up living with it.</p>

              <p>Hi crus and everyone,</p>
              <p>Sigh, I have some problems which I hope you guys could help me out.</p>
              <p>I am enlisted in Feb for BMT at Tekong with a PES A.<br>However, I did not declare that I had a flat foot (it is really quite severe, like totally flat on the ground) during CMPB screening because I wanted to go to command school..<br><br>I thought I could handle it but recently my feet is getting really really painful.</p>
              <p>During route march, speed training and even the first few IPPT runs/SBJ, it is really affecting me physically and psychologically. Really painful and flat.</p>
              <p>What should I do? <br>How do I go about getting a downpes? I've heard that severe flat feet like mine can be given up to PES C or even excused from static stations like SBJ (CL1)</p>
              <p>I have read lots and lots of guides of downpes-ing but it seems that it will take alot of time and money and months and the efficiency is really sucky.</p>
              <p>Which hospital could I go to get a diagnosis and a report which I can submit to the MO at tekong? How much must I roughly pay?</p>
              <p>Hope crus could come back to this thread and tell me the result of yours and so could everyone else help me out because I don't want to have serious leg problems when I grow old next time..</p>

              <p>First of all, get ready to answer why you did not declare beforehand when you know you have such a problem.</p>
              <p>Secondly, even with external medical reports, the MOs will still have to look at your condition for themselves before deciding to downpes you or not, so you may want to consider saving your cash.</p>

              <p>Hi crus and everyone,</p>
              <p>Sigh, I have some problems which I hope you guys could help me
              out.</p>
              <p>I am enlisted in Feb for BMT at Tekong with a PES A.<br> However, I did not declare that I had a flat foot (it is really
              quite severe, like totally flat on the ground) during CMPB
              screening because I wanted to go to command school..<br> <br> I thought I could handle it but recently my feet is getting really
              really painful.</p>
              <p>During route march, speed training and even the first few
              IPPT runs/SBJ, it is really affecting me physically and
              psychologically. Really painful and flat.</p>
              <p>What should I do?<br> How do I go about getting a downpes? I've heard that severe flat
              feet like mine can be given up to PES C or even excused from static
              stations like SBJ (CL1)</p>
              <p>I have read lots and lots of guides of downpes-ing but it seems
              that it will take alot of time and money and months and the
              efficiency is really sucky.</p>
              <p>Which hospital could I go to get a diagnosis and a report which
              I can submit to the MO at tekong? How much must I roughly pay?</p>
              <p>Hope crus could come back to this thread and tell me the result
              of yours and so could everyone else help me out because I don't
              want to have serious leg problems when I grow old next time..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you guys.</p>

              <p>First, please get your own head examined for not declaring a potentially-serious medical condition just because you want to be a commander. We have seen far too many cases of Rambo-wannabes in here who think that honour and glory can only be attained at the cost of good health and wellbeing.</p>
              <p>Besides, if you had declared it to the CMPB MO, he might have referred you to a specialist...... <em>at government expense</em>.</p>
              <p>Secondly, go see a family doctor (if you have not enlisted), or the MO (if you already have enlisted - you didn't make that clear). Either way, you may be referred to a specialist who will decide on the severity of your condition.</p>
              <p>If it's going to cost you, so be it. Let this be a lesson for your not following good common sense to begin with.</p>

              <p>Yo, I'm successfully downgraded to C2L2.</p>
              <p>To System, heres an overall guide for you.</p>
              <p>Firstly, step into any Polyclinic or Hospital A&amp;E department to "Report Sick". Fear not, flash your 11b and everything is free. Tell the doctor about your foot pain caused by your flat foot aka Pes Planus. Kindly request for a referral to the Orthopedic ( Bone Specialist ). Ask for the earliest appointment possible.</p>
              <p>At the Orthopedic, tell him/her about what activities causes you pain/uncomfort ( location such as ankle, heel and inner sole pain. ) or activities you CANNOT participate in. Eg, running, jumping etc. He will then send you for x-ray and get back to you later. When back at him/her, he will then review your x-ray for possible fractures on your foot area.</p>
              <p>Kindly ask him to write you a memo about your condition for your camp MO. REMEMBER, ask <span style="font-weight: bold;">humbly</span> yet <span style="font-weight: bold;">firmly</span> for him/her to include in the memo to excuse you from RMJ and RECOMMEND you to be submitted for a Medical Board Review.</p>
              <p>FYI : My specialist was Dr Lim Mui Hong. He is currently at SGH as an Orthopedic. He is also a Orthopedic at MMI. LTC (Dr) Lim Mui Hong. If you're lucky enough you might get to consult him. Since he is himself at MMI, his words will have greater impact.</p>
              <p>I still have yet to go for follow up. I need to thank him for helping me. </p>
