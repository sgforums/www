              <p>Just to share, for mob manning, you can be scheduled to be called up EVEN the next day after you ORD. </p>
              <p>Since you are entering uni in about July/Aug, calling you up in May will not result in any clash. I was even called during my exam period, though I manage to easily get "deferment" from the WO in charge for the days which falls on my exam dates.</p>
              <p>Mob manning usually ( over 90%) takes place on weekends, and most of the time you just need to bring your stuffs down and sign and go back. In fact, you won't necessary be called up even if it is stated that a certain week or two is the mob-manning period.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think I missed your previous post. Some questions to TS. Did your whole Bn (or NSF Unit) ORD the same time as you?? Did you get posted to the same ORNS Unit as you? Did they recieve the same Manning message as you? <br><br>Call up to ask which unit you are posted to, to confirm.<br><br>I recieved my first Mindef message just 5 days after I ORD. Of course that would mean 6 months later for Bn as they ORD-ed much much earlier than me. <br><br>Exceptions occur everywhere, and they exist the possibility of cock-ups. Then again, since are are going to defer. JUst go ahead with  your deferment and check the status of your deferment ... <br><br>If you are whining about something not going by the book .... welcome to SAF.</p></div>

              <p>it's all depends on whether you had a unit or not... and not because you just ord... many still are left wandering around even after years... but the system usually caught up with them one...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think the crux of this issue lies with the statement.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">As a National Serviceman (NSman), you will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not be called up for <strong>ANY NS activities</strong></span> for the <strong>first 6 months </strong>of your release from full-time NS.  </span>What is the definition of 'ANY NS activities'? I presume it means having anything to do with National Service, including mob manning? So, how does moderator knows that NS activities only refer to ICT and not mob manning. Maybe moderator can share with us any official source whereby he got his info from? Thanks in advance.. </p></div>
