              <p>Effective from 1 July 2014, <span>all NSmen below the age of 50
              for Officers and 40 for Warrant Officers, Specialists, Other Ranks
              and Enlistees who are leaving the country <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">for more than 14 days but less than 6
              months</span></strong> are required to notify MINDEF Notification
              Centre (MNC) / Overseas Notification Centre (ONC) via <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ns.sg/nsp/web/esvcs/mindef/mnc/main">Notification of
              Overseas Trips</a> of their country of destination and a contact
              telephone or a fax number (can be local or overseas) at which they
              can be contacted or where information of their overseas whereabouts
              can be obtained during their absence. NSmen with valid Exit Permit
              are not required to further notify their overseas trips to MNC /
              ONC).<br> <br> NSmen have given feedback on the MNC through focus group
              discussions conducted by the Committee to Strengthen National
              Service (CSNS) and various feedback channels. While NSmen
              understand the need for the MNC, they felt that the process could
              be reviewed, since Singaporeans now travel more frequently.<br> <br> The CSNS has proposed that the MNC requirements be reviewed to
              reduce the inconvenience to NSmen, while maintaining the
              operational readiness of the SAF. At the same time, the CSNS
              recognises that Singapore's peace and stability cannot be taken for
              granted, and the security environment can change quickly. A strong
              and operationally ready SAF is needed to deter would-be aggressors
              and meet a wide range of security threats. After careful
              consideration, MINDEF and the SAF have decided to extend the period
              of exemption from notification from one to 14 days. From 1 Jul
              2014, only NSmen who travel overseas for more than 14 days but less
              than 6 months will be required to notify the MNC. This will reduce
              inconvenience for the large majority of NSmen, while still
              providing the SAF with information on those who are overseas for
              longer periods, to support manpower and operational planning. The
              notification requirement may be adjusted depending on the security
              threat assessment. NSmen in units on operational manning are still
              required to seek approval from their unit commanders before
              travelling overseas.<br> <br> Based on similar considerations, the revised requirement will also
              apply to the ONC, which is the MNC equivalent for NSmen in the
              Police and SCDF.</span></p>

              <p>In order to maintain operational readiness, it is necessary for MINDEF 
                      to regulate NSmen’s overseas travel. As such, it is important that you 
                      keep MINDEF informed of your whereabouts by being contactable while you 
                      are travel overseas to facilitate recall in times of emergency.<br> <br> If you are travelling on overseas trips of more than <strong>more than</strong><strong> 14 days and less than 6 months</strong>,  you need to notify MINDEF via the MNC.<br> <br> MNC was set up in November 1992 to bring forth more convenience and 
                      accessibility for NSmen to notify MINDEF when they are travelling on 
                      overseas trips.<br> <br> MNC operates 24 hours and 7 days a week, including public holidays. You 
                      are able to make your notifications to MNC through the followings:<br> <br> <strong>Online</strong>: <a href="https://www.ns.sg/nsp/web/esvcs/common/mnc/main">www.ns.sg</a><br> <strong>NS Call Centre</strong>: 1800-eNSNSNS (1800-3676767)<br> <strong>SMS</strong>: eNSNS (36767)<br> <strong>Fax</strong>: 6853 7894<br> <br> You are required to inform MINDEF of the country that you are travelling
                       to, a valid contact number, at which you can be contacted or where 
                      information of your overseas whereabouts can be obtained when you are 
                      overseas.<br> <br> Upon completion and successful notification, you will be issued a <strong>4-digit Acknowledgement Code</strong>,
                       which you are to keep for any future verification. In the event that 
                      you have forgotten your Acknowledgement Code, you can call the NS Call 
                      Centre to retrieve.<br> <br> Note that your overseas trips notification does not automatically 
                      excused you from any NS activities like IPPT, mobilisation and any other
                       NS call-ups. If you are scheduled for NS training, i.e. ICT and other 
                      courses, you are required to submit your deferment request through <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.ns.sg/nsp/web/esvcs/mindef/mydefer/main">MyDeferment</a></span></strong> at NS Portal (<a href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a>).<br> <br> <strong>What if I fail to notify MINDEF?</strong><br> <br> It is considered an offence if you fail to notify MNC of your overseas trips of more than 24 hours and less than 6 months.<br> <br> If you are a first time offender, a Reminder Letter will be sent to you.
                       However, if you continually do not notify MINDEF, you may be served 
                      composition fines or charged in court. If you are found liable and 
                      prosecuted in court, you will be fined up to a maximum of up to $2,000 
                      if convicted and your full passport facilities will also be withdrawn. 
                      This also means that you will have to apply for an <strong>Exit Permit</strong> every time when you go overseas.<br> <br> <strong>Do I still need to inform MNC if I have completed ORNS?</strong><br> <br> If you have completed your Operationally-Ready National Service (ORNS) 
                      training cycle and have been phased into the MINDEF Reserve (MR), you 
                      are exempted from MNC requirements. But, you are still required to apply
                       for an Exit Permit for overseas trips of 6 months or more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Exit Permit (EP)</strong></em></span></p>
              <p>If you are travelling overseas for <strong>6 months or more</strong> you are 
                      required to apply for Exit Permit. If you have a valid EP when you 
                      travel overseas, you need not make further notification to MINDEF 
                      Notification Centre (MNC).<br> <br> Applications of EP can be made through the NS Portal at <a href="https://www.ns.sg/nsp/web/esvcs/common/eep/apply">www.ns.sg</a> and you must declare the followings:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Reason and duration of your overseas trip; and <br> </li>
              <li>You are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT </span></strong>scheduled for NS training within 6 months from the date of your application.<br> </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Once your application is confirmed, you will be issued with an e-EP. 
                      You must provide documentary proof, e.g. letter from your employer to 
                      substantiate your declaration when required. Otherwise, you may deemed 
                      as providing false declaration and be liable for prosecution.<br> <br> If your NS training schedule clash with your overseas trip, you will need to apply for deferment of your training in <strong><a href="https://www.ns.sg/nsp/web/esvcs/mindef/mydefer/main">MyDeferment</a></strong> at NS Portal (<a href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a>)
                       before applying for EP. You will be disrupted from ORNS if the duration
                       of your overseas trip is 1 year or longer. If you wish to extend your 
                      overseas stay and your EP expires, you are required to apply for an 
                      extension.<br> <br> Upon your permanent return to Singapore, you are not required to 
                      surrender your EPs if you have been issued with EPs previously. MINDEF 
                      will use the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) Exit Entry 
                      Control Upgrade System (EECUS) to track your return and schedule you 
                      accordingly for ORNS activities.<br> <br> <strong>When will I be exempted from EP requirements?</strong><br> You will be exempted from the EP requirements if you belong to the following categories:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Personnel who are exempted from National Service liabilities and have been issued with a Notice of Exemption [NOE (NS)];</li>
              <li>Personnel who are exempted from applying Exit Permit (EP) and are issued with a Notice of Exemption from Exit Permit [NOE (EP)].<br> </li>
              </ol>
              <p><strong>What happens if my EP expires?</strong><br> It is an offence to remain overseas without a valid EP under the Enlistment Act.<br> <br> If you are a first time offender, you may be served with composition 
                      fines. However, if you are a recalcitrant offender, you will be charged 
                      in court and on conviction, you are liable to a fine of up to $10,000 or
                       imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both.<br> <br> For more enquiries on our exit control measures, please contact our 24 hours NS Call Centre at: 1800-367 6767.</p>

              <p>Effective from 1 July 2014, <span>all NSmen below the age of 50 for Officers and 40 
              for Warrant Officers, Specialists, Other Ranks and Enlistees who are 
              leaving the country <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">for more than 14 days but less than 6 months</span></strong> are required to notify MINDEF Notification Centre (MNC) / Overseas Notification Centre (ONC) via <a href="http://www.ns.sg/nsp/web/esvcs/mindef/mnc/main">Notification of Overseas Trips</a> of their country of destination and a contact telephone or a fax number
               (can be local or overseas) at which they can be contacted or where 
              information of their overseas whereabouts can be obtained during their 
              absence. NSmen with valid Exit Permit are not required to further notify
               their overseas trips to MNC / ONC). 
                 
              	<br><br>NSmen have given feedback on the MNC through focus group 
              discussions conducted by the Committee to Strengthen National Service 
              (CSNS) and various feedback channels. While NSmen understand the need 
              for the MNC, they felt that the process could be reviewed, since 
              Singaporeans now travel more frequently.<br><br> The CSNS has proposed that the MNC requirements be reviewed to reduce 
              the inconvenience to NSmen, while maintaining the operational readiness 
              of the SAF.  At the same time, the CSNS recognises that Singapore's 
              peace and stability cannot be taken for granted, and the security 
              environment can change quickly. A strong and operationally ready SAF is 
              needed to deter would-be aggressors and meet a wide range of security 
              threats. After careful consideration, MINDEF and the SAF have decided to
               extend the period of exemption from notification from one to 14 days. 
              From 1 Jul 2014, only NSmen who travel overseas for more than 14 days 
              but less than 6 months will be required to notify the MNC. This will 
              reduce inconvenience for the large majority of NSmen, while still 
              providing the SAF with information on those who are overseas for longer 
              periods, to support manpower and operational planning. The notification 
              requirement may be adjusted depending on the security threat assessment.
               NSmen in units on operational manning are still required to seek 
              approval from their unit commanders before travelling overseas.<br><br> Based on similar considerations, the revised requirement will also apply
               to the ONC, which is the MNC equivalent for NSmen in the Police and 
              SCDF. </span></p>
