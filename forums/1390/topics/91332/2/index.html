(except going for range, exercise etc) </blockquote>Heck, reservists book in/out in long 4 all the time. I've even experienced MPs overlooking it, though they hauled me up for tying my bootlaces outside my boots.<br><br>All in all, the smart 4 is more of a dress code than regulations. It's a way to distinguish from field-training uniforms, for a start. I remember this newspaper incident in the '90s when a reservist showed up in Singapore Cricket Club &amp; was told off by an ang-mo for wearing "overalls", &amp; he countered back that there's a (subtle) SAF difference between folded sleeves &amp; unfolded. Readers wrote in to admonish the uninformed foreigner too.<br><br>I also remember when I was in Sec 3-4 (circa '81/'82) when SAF 1st designated the old Temasek Green uniforms into standardized No. 3 &amp; No. 4 dress. They distinguish them fairly simply - No. 3 = tucked in; No. 4 = tucked out - &amp; it's something that has been informally retained for those wearing the non-camoflauged dress in Taiwan.<br><br>So view the present smart/long 4 in this light.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>All these wont happen if you take some pride in your turnout.</blockquote>That's not fair. The reality is it's more specific to the particular unit culture, where - if anything - standardization is more of the keyword. It's par for the course that personnel at division or formation levels (or units that share the same army camp with them) are expected to wear smart 4's; ditto for those PES C guys with 8-to-5:30 vocations.<br><br>But IMO combat-outfit troops aren't as strangled with such chickensh!t customs. Of course, they must be presentable when booking in/out but, attire-wise, it could be civilian (most popular), PT kit, smart 4 or long 4.<br><br>Heck, even the daytime sentry guards for these places aren't that consistent with folded or unfolded sleeves.<br><br>Again, IMO "symmetry" is the emphasis. FYI My own reservist unit designated long 4's as the standard attire (in camp, out to field, book out, et al), but it could never be consistently enforced - even officers rolled up their sleeves. &amp; whenever the senior trainer or "visiting" colonel complained about the, ahem, non-uniform (pun) uniforms, all they verbally asked for was for everyone to conform to a coherent appearance - &amp; nothing more.<br><br>For the record, I'm inclined to hold that smart 4's are "neater" &amp; more orderly (particularly out in the field), but long 4's provide for more ventilation (with the cuffs unbuttoned). Some of us improvised with what could be called the "casual 4" - one-fold sleeves that cover the biceps up to the elbow - as early as the 2nd year of "active" service, but worn commonly together with the webbing &amp; certainly not near a RSM or RP back in base.</div>
