            <div class='col-md body'>Have you slacken down from BMT? Or do you still retain that regimentation from BMT?<br><br>I saw this guy he very weird, at least in my HQ he is very weird. Because my side there not much regimentation, basic requirements just fall in and fall out on time (You can move in the file, its okay, just be on time...), do your work properly (Clerk work or driver work ), then keep your hair tidy, shave bread. Thats basically all lah. Can forget about everything you learn from BMT.<br><br>But got this guy... at first I though he cannot adjust, then now I realize he damn weird. Because for people who posted in to our Unit the first day, they don't know the culture here, so they tend to feel very tense. Like they see 3SG, they will ask "Permission to fall in, Sergeart!" But overhere, we call the 3SG by names, all treat each other like friend friend one.<br><br>But this guy... after being here for almost 2 months, he still like damn tense. Like when somebody called and asked for the Captain, normally we will just transfer call... but that guy will run all the way to the Captain's office, and ask her, Ma'am, I transfer call to you can?  Then he say BMT teach 1...<br><br>Or everytime lunch, there's this NSF 2LTA... he will ask him to join us.  Then sometime he looking for the Superiors, he will say "Sorry to bother you, ..." But the guy was SMSing his girlfriend... not even doing work.<br><br>Or like he sees Officers, he will greet them, last time he used to greet always them, but now he abit relaxed liao. But you can still feel his tenseness lah. Like we doing duty, then some people from the other office, haven't submit their stuff, he will urge you to faster call them... but normally people slack one mah, always submit late, but we know it will come de, coz everyday also must do one. So we dun bother to call.<br><br>Then when we go lunch, we usually just walk out and go eat... den tis guy will go inform the superiors that we going lunch.... I mean its alrite lah just that... damn weird, its like he still in BMT mode...<br><br>Why this guy can't just relax? Its getting on my nerves... then got 1 day he go see MO... coz his condition at the moment the MO can't treat it... so the MO say give him MC, den let him go see specialist... den he told the MO, cannot, I very busy. WTF man!!!!! He in the office is the most free one.... coz MC just take lah.... until the MO say he better go see or he charge him... den he take the MC...<br><br>Then coz tis guy tink he shotgun marriage lah, gt baby. So 1 day while he was playing chess... his wife called... say the baby roll down from the bed... den hit the head how... den he started scolding his wife then told his wife he very busy... HE FREAKING PLAYING CHESS LAH!!!!! ask her bring the baby to family doctor... then later he told us, now almost 4 PM liao, if I take halfday leave not worth it... I was like WTF man!!!!!! Ur baby hit ur head, u tell the Captain she sure give you Off one... where got need to take leave?!!!!<br><br>And then everyday he come in machiam boss like tat... put 1 bag on 1 chair... den he sit on another chair... FREAK YOU!!!!! There's alreadi lack of chairs in the office...<br><br>Then he will alreadi buy his fingers.... his finger all the skin peel off one... then I told him stop bitting lehz... let it heal... he say no use 1... I let it heal... then it will turn dunno wat he say lah... then it won't heal de... den he continue bitting... crazy ar!!!!<br><br>Then the stupidest ting he said was... he asked 1 DXO, whether he can transfer his childsick leave to his wife.... WTF SIA!!!!!!! His wife not even in SAF, and leave can transfer 1 meh? Dunno wat his brain tinking... not tat I insulting N'Levels ppl lah, but tis guy takes the cake...<br><br>Then because currently, I got no appointment, also in the office do nothing 1, then he always ask me, wat I actualli do in the office ar... I tell him I dunno, and I duncare... I just want to serve finish... den he say u dunno, u DIE ar... u no appt wait they post u out...  His business meh? Y I will die...<br><br>Then coz he is a storeman vocation... den he kip saying he want to try to revoke his vocation to an ASA... coz say he want to submit his medical report. Then on the otherhand he says... he go cmpb tat time never submit his full medical report, coz he dunwan pes e... he wants to go shoot shoot...<br><br>WTF man, tis guy not normal sia.</div>
