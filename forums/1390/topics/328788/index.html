              <p>the Mess is for officers only...got facilities like aircon, TV, pool (billiard), table soccer, beer, etc...</p>
              <p>but any of u guys (non officer rank) ever go there n make use of the facilities or to slack? esp. if u happen to know the messboy or quite friendly with him.....</p>
              <p>then ever got caught or told off by those regular officers?</p>
              <p>or perhaps u go to officer mess with ur officer colleagues? therefore u got privilege.</p>

              <p>If I see an enlistee in the spec mess, I am not bothered with it. As a regular specialist, I pay for the events, equipments in the mess. But Being a superior, I don't mind paying for it while my men comes in occasionally to use it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, I have seen incidences whereby some Warrants or Specialists feeling very offended to see enlistees in the mess sharing the couch and watching the same TV screen. They drove them all out to the mosquitoe infested external surrounding. This is the issue of 'ego'. To them as this is the spec mess, anybody lower than the rank of 3SG will be driven out with no qestions asked. And if you take note, it's always initiated by the same person. Discipline? I doubt so. It's double standard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if a 2LT hangs around and makes a mess by puking his beer on the floor, the same warrant or specialist who drove the enlistees out will not make the same noise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If my men who're the enlistees were being driven out because of rank difference, I will leave with them back to the bunk. With my men in the wilderness, I will not have the cheek to remain in the comfort of the spec mess.</p>

              <p>yeah, i noticed this during NS and it disturbs me. i always have the notion if a man is good enough to fight with, he is also good enough to eat/party with.. anyway i got dragged once to the mess rules hung on a wall by a WO when i told him i "invited" my men to play pool inside the mess. it wasnt the end of it, an email was sent and cced to every man and his dog on my "misdeed". Needless to say that was the last time i when to the wospec mess during NSF days.</p>

              <p>I belong to the "old " army period.  Back then, there were rather strict rules on the use of messes by the various ranks. There was the officers mess and the WO and SGTs mess. If you are not of the correct "rank" and you were not specifically invited to go to the other mess, you will be told off. <br><br>There were various reasons for this. Firstly, the mess was where people could hide and relax in the comfort of their own group, without causing embarrassment. It was also the place where the "chief" of the group, e.g. the CO of the battalion, would be able to inform his officers of his private and personal opinion of certain issues. Likewise, for the RSM in the SGTs mess to shed his usual hard stance, and talk to the NCOs about issues.</p>
              <p>I have been to many other foreign countries' mess and there is a certain code of conduct  practised in there. I have been to the US Navy officer's mess and eating there is like eating in a 5 star restaurant and you are supposed to behave accordingly. That is part of the training and discipline and culture. I have been to a British air force officer's mess and this was when you could bring your partner or wife there. And then again, because of the females present, you were supposed to behave accordingly. Again, it is part of the culture and tradition. <br><br>There were no table soccer or video rooms in those messes. This type of activity were housed in another area and this was open to all ranks. The mess ( officer and NCO) were areas where people could dine in peace, relax and entertain friends.</p>

              <p>depends on the chairman of the mess committee. i had no problems going into the spec mess cuz the chairman and me were on good terms. my orderly room chief clerk also always bring me in with her to take milo. as for officer mess, i do enter it alot of times, but all for official business. both mess boys are my friends even before i entered the army(small world) and they usually don't bother if i go in to take a cup of drink.</p>
              <p>but then again, there are some regulars and nsfs who feel that the mess belongs only to the proper rank and men are not allowed inside. so far haven't really encountered a real bad case yet. only 1 new officer(2LT) who was posted in and he was slacking in the offr mess after lunch when i went in to talk to my friend. told me to mind my own biz and rmb what rank i was. few weeks later when there was an event, i stayed throughout the whole event(i attend all the events if i can, to mix around with my colleagues, fellow nsfs and regulars) and kept staring at him. the only thing i could do to piss him off.</p>
