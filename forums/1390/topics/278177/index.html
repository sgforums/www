Tell them the reason why u want a deferment(in your case, just joined a new company).

            <div class='col-md body'>Still got chance, but ask your employer to "fight" for you all the way. 6 months is a bit long but, in your case, maybe you're part of a new business set-up or, say, are still under job training.<br><br>Don't sabo your CO by applying late too,  leaving him little time to tinker the nominal roll &amp; thus rejecting your deferment accordingly.<br><br>Newly-formed units are also quite ngeow about troop rostering, if applicable. In my own case, no deferments permitted for the 1st ICT, unless studying (but then undergrads would be posted to an IHL unit instead) or working overseas or due to an emergency. Those who reported for the first few call-ups would stay on for the rest of the cycle. Anyone who successfully deferred may get posted out altogether, so take this into consideraion.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, I went digging ... Found an oldie article that announced the revamped cycle.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">NS has been the bedrock of Singapore's peace and prosperity for the past 34 years of our history as an independent state. For a small state like Singapore, our survival depends on the ability of our NSmen to go into action within a very short time. After all, the bulk of the SAF's strength comes from our NSmen who fight shoulder-to-shoulder with the regulars in the defence of Singapore.<br><br>From<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">R TONY TAN KENG YAM DPM AND MINISTER FOR DEFENCE MARCH 2001<br><br>Under the Enlistment Act, Chapter 93 of the Singapore Statutes 1992, NSmen will continue to fulfil your military obligations up to the age of 40 for NS Warrant Officers, Specialists and Enlistees (WOSEs), and 50 for Officers.<br><br>National Service Training Cycle<br><br>NSmen will be required to undergo a national service training cycle, which comprises several 'high key' and 'low key' training. 'High key' or intensive training involves operations and in-camp training, which last for seven days or longer. 'Low Key' training refers to training duration of six days or less.<br><br>Completion of the Training Cycle<br><br>Upon completion of your NS training cycle, you will be posted to the MINDEF Reserve (MR) List. While in MR, you may still be called up for national service, as you remain liable for national service up to the age of 50 for Officers and 40 for WOSEs. You are to disregard your previous unit's mobilisation codewords as you are not required to report for mobilisation activation for your previous units. Should you be required to be mobilised while in MR, you will be informed of your codewords accordingly. However, you are still required to abide by the existing exit controls up to your statutory age limit. Please see the section on Overseas Travel for information regarding exit control requirements.<br><br>REVISED NATIONAL SERVICE TRAINING SYSTEM (WITH EFFECT FROM APR 03)<br><br>Revised Training Cycle<br><br>With effect from April 2003, a revised National Service (NS) training system has been introduced for Operationally Ready National Servicemen (NSmen).<br><br>Under the previous NS training system, NSmen had to perform 13 years of NS training, of which, at least nine must be high-key in-camp training (ICT). With the revised NS training system, the majority of NSmen will only need to serve <strong>at least seven high-key ICTs.</strong> A two-day Basic Individual Training (BIT) programme that focuses on physical fitness, marksmanship and refresher training has also been introduced in the last three years of their 13 years of NS training. This ensures that NSmen maintain their currency in basic soldiering skills. Mobilisation exercises will also be conducted during the BIT phase to maintain operational readiness.<br><br>To minimise inconvenience to NSmen pursuing full-time local university studies, specific periods during the university vacation have been set aside for NS training. No academic programmes are conducted during these periods. This arrangement enables NSmen to better manage their academic studies and NS duties.<br><br>Training Improvements<br><br>Performance-oriented training has been introduced as part of the revised NS training system. Through a modular approach, training is customised to focus on the specific training needs of each NS unit instead of adhering to a standard training syllabus. This achieves more effective and purposeful utilisation of training time.<br><br>The revised NS training system also incorporates an incentive-based component to motivate NSmen to put in their best. Those who achieve good results at the individual or unit level need not undergo additional training. For example, NS units that perform well in major evaluation exercises could have a subsequent high-key training replaced by low-key training.<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>Over the years, NS training has progressively become more effective and efficient with improvements in technology and administrative efficiency. The revised NS training system capitalises on these improvements to effect a reduction in the number of high-key ICTs and the introduction of BIT, without compromising the operational readiness of the Singapore Armed Forces.<br><br>Our citizen soldiers have to shoulder the multiple demands of family, work and duty to country. We recognise that this requires significant commitment and sacrifice. The Ministry of Defence continually reviews the NS training system to optimise training time and ensure a meaningful NS experience. The revised NS training system is the latest of a series of improvements to NS management and administration, following the increase in NS allowance in July 2002 and the revised Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) system in April 2003.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It depends on the S1 branch manpower planning for this ICT.<br>If they are having an exercise then it is more difficult to allow defermant by NSmen.<br>Another reason will be the rank or appointment holder.<br>Key appointment holder might find it harder to get defer.<br><br>I would suggest get the company to write to your unit directly stating the reason for this deferment.<br>Eg. Important project in hand etc.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It called for "at least 7 high keys", so I stand corrected on this.<br><br>Thinking back -- I was under the old system -- we rank &amp; file were never told which year was HK or LK anyway. My first half-dozen ICTs in the first 10 years were all for between 14 to 27 days. Quite grueling.<br><br>The confusion, if any, occurred with my subsequent call-ups (all for only a week or so) with only a "ORD"-style range shoot &amp; the usual IPPTs the "serious" military activities. Most the time were taken up by long-service award ceremonies; COC (from combat-arms to PDF command) &amp; then finally stand-down parades; KAHs' recycling-on news; etc. Plenty of wayang &amp; handshaking, as my unit winded down. Even the token refreshers' training itself was half-hearted, with the Arty formation already moving on to new equipment &amp; its trainers must consult old manuals before "instructing" us!<br><br>Dunno if the latter ICTs were LK ones, other than numerically referencing the days reported.</div>
