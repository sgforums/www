            <div class='col-md body'>I think u have to ask urself some simple question.<br>1.) What do u hope to achieve by servning NS?<br>2.) Does me serving NS help me in my future?<br>3.) Do you want to use 2 years of your life to serve, whereas u also could use these 2 year to do something useful as well?<br>4.) NS is not a child's game, when u buay tahan inside liao, do u think u can quit as easily as u sign up. Army is not a game, u cannot suka suka come, suka suka go one.<br>5.) Am I ready for rules and regulations lifestyle for 2 years? If u are a rebel ur whole life be prepared for a shock in the army. i.e. NO FREEDOM.<br>6.) Are u ready to be lead by someone who might be 2 years younger than u and have a IQ and attitude of a six year-old? (And worst, u cannot argue with him?) Or lead by someone who might be in his late thirties, early forties but still have an IQ and attitiude of a six year old.<br>7.) Are u ready to let go of what u have now? i.e. Most important thing to loose is privacy, the other is like no air-con lah, no PC for a week lah, no pub, no go out with friends, no jalan jalan outside, etc.<br><br>At lastly, u think u are ready but are u really?<br><br>The reason I am saying this is, when u serve, during ur xiong training, this question might pop up in ur mind....<br>"WHY AM I DOING HERE?"<br>U have to be mentally prepared to answer urself with on this question.<br><br>For Singaporeans and 2nd gen PR, they dun really have a choice or say in NS, they are dragged in screaming and kicking. So when the above question pop up in their mind, they have a ready answer "I am Singaporean or I am a 2nd gen PR, LAN LAN".<br><br>But u have a choice, so make ur choice wisely. Once ur decision is final, DON'T REGRET IT.<br><br></div>
