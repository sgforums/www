            <div class='col-md body'>Look, imo, it is really quite irrelevent that you think you would enjoy army life. To a certain extent, i quite enjoyed army. That does not, however, make me think that i have not wasted 2.5 years for a country that really doesn't care.<br>Remember, after 2.5 years, you will have almost gained no new transferable qualifications whatsoever.<br><br>So unless you want to sign on as a regular, or is able to come up with some overwhelmingly good reason, i would advise against serving NS.  If you think you would like to try a little soldiering, then just go try airsoft or go on some private courses run by ex-soldiers.  If you would like to try something different, or seek a like changing experience, how about participating in some voluntary overseas expedition? That would be more worthwhile and meaningful. You would also be able to make more of a difference to the world.<br><br>Hope you think you choices through carefully.</div>

A HK friend of mine did NS just because he LOGICALLY thought having an SG passport is easier, no visas and all. But in the end of the day, he just could not leave his home and went back to HK and now plans to settle there permanently. Doing NS is probably his biggest regret. Made him about 3 yrs behind his peers in terms of work experience, and CASH.<br><br>So i advice u to think it through, if u go NS simply to experience it, u'll probably be disappointed. I suggest that u forget about NS, and think whether u see yourself carrying a SG passport and staying in this island 10 yrs from now.

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe any military organization also has its fair share of screw ups.  Hey look on the bright side... at least we don't have any wars to screw up.<br><br>Besides, I think its a good thing to experience screw ups, whether self caused or not.  Armies are meant to screw each other up.  Its the resilience to carry on despite of screw ups that segregates a proffessional army and an amateur one.</div>

So have no choice but to serve army..and so far he said none of of the first genearation PR willing to serve army, beause they not willing to drop their own country citizenship. Damn, i only hope tht i am 2nd generation PR, then i dun need to consider here and there to serve.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
