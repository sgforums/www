                  BMT</span></strong><br> This 9-week programme trains combat-fit recruits in the basic
                  military skills to prepare them for advanced vocational training.
                  The programme includes weapon training with the SAR 21 rifle which
                  will teach recruits technical handling and marksmanship skills; a
                  Battle Inoculation Course that simulates a real battlefield; a
                  Field Camp which develops basic survival skills; progressive
                  training to complete a 24-km route march which builds combat
                  fitness and endurance; and hand grenade training.<br> <em><span style="font: inherit;">For those who fail to achieve the
                  NAPFA test silver award, they are required to undergo an 8-week
                  Physical Training Phase (PTP) prior to the PES A/B1

                  BMT</span></strong><br> As evidence has shown that obese recruits are able to achieve
                  optimum fitness levels and weight loss in about 19 weeks, the new
                  BMT programme for recruits with Body Mass Index (BMI) scores
                  exceeding 27.0 will be 19 weeks. This BMT programme is designed to
                  help obese recruits improve their physical fitness progressively
                  while equipping them with basic soldiering skills and
                  knowledge.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES B2
                  BMT</span></strong><br> Enlistees who were PES C1 previously underwent a 7-week BMT
                  programme. The new 9-week PES B2 BMT programme will be conducted
                  for recruits who are medically fit for deployment in selected
                  combat and combat support vocations, such as signal operators,
                  combat medics and naval system operators. These recruits will be
                  given a new medical classification of PES B2, in place of the
                  existing PES C1 classification. This is to ensure that the medical
                  classification of our soldiers is consistent with their deployment.
                  The new 9-week programme will include customised physical training,
                  as well as basic combat training to prepare them for their combat
                  and combat support roles.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES C
                  BMT</span></strong><br> The 9-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES C recruits. This
                  programme will include light physical training and vocational
                  training to prepare them for combat service support vocations, such
                  as service medic, and those related to logistics and
                  administration.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES E

                  Education, SAF core values, regimentation and discipline to prepare

              <p><em><strong>Being psychologically prepared is all about knowing
              what to expect and being prepared for it.</strong></em></p>
              <p>To be better prepared, you can participate in Total Defence
              activities and Open Houses organised by the SAF/SPF/SCDF.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you should also talk to your family members and friends
              who have lived the NS experience. The more you discuss with others,
              the more comfortable and mentally prepared you’ll become.</p>
              <p><strong>Because NS life is different from civilian life before
              enlistment, there are many adjustments you need to
              make.</strong></p>
              <p>A good way to cope is to get support from your buddy and fellow
              recruits. They are going through the same tough training as you, so
              talking to one another will help relieve some tension.</p>
              <p>In most evenings during your leisure time, you’ll also have some
              time to call your family or loved ones to talk. They can give you
              emotional support during NS.</p>
              <p>You can have a one-on-one interview sessions with your officer
              to highlight any problems you may have. If you have a personal or
              family problem that need to be addressed, do let the officer
              know—he may be able to give you some advice or time off to settle
              your problems.</p>
              <p>Life in NS revolves around structure, routine and discipline.
              This helps us stay united as a uniformed organisation as well as
              imparts the rigours necessary to protect our nation and
              citizens.</p>
              <p>This does not mean there is just work and no play. In fact,
              after a few weeks in NS and you’ll find new friends and new reasons
              to smile!</p>
              <p><strong>As a soldier, one of the biggest adjustments you’ll have
              to make quickly is in regimentation and discipline.</strong></p>
              <p>Being in a uniformed organisation, you’ll have to obey orders
              from your superiors. Thus some of you may feel a sudden lack of
              freedom to do what you want and you may find yourself having
              difficulties accepting authority initially.</p>
              <p>Regimentation and discipline build strong character and
              toughness, so that you’ll be tough enough to handle difficult
              combat, crime-fighting or rescue situations without giving up or
              breaking down.</p>
              <p>When you first enlist into NS, you may have concerns of being in
              a new territory, with new faces and new things to do. But don’t let
              this get to you. Just remember the saying that “when the going gets
              tough, the tough gets going”.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Following are some
              tips on what you can do to prepare yourself
              psychologically:</em></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Adopt a positive perception</li>
              <li>Build up physical stamina</li>
              <li>Develop good working attitude and habits</li>
              <li>Overcome psychological stress</li>
              <li>Adopt teamwork spirit</li>
              <li>Learn to be independent</li>
              <li>Set realistic expectations</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can also speak to your friends or family members who have
              been through NS. Ask them to share their stories. The sharing will
              help you reduce some of your fears, uncertainties and doubts.</p>
              <p><strong>During NS you’ll be living with different
              people.</strong></p>
              <p>Because these people come from different backgrounds, they may
              not think like you do or react to situations like you would.
              Instead of trying to select your type of people, you should cherish
              the diversity. This is a chance for you to learn more about your
              fellow mates and their cultures.</p>
              <p>You’ll find that you have many opportunities to absorb the
              different cultures—during training, eating, chatting or just seeing
              and listening. Take these opportunities and learn from people
              around you, you’ll have a much better appreciation of Singapore’s
              cultural diversity.</p>
