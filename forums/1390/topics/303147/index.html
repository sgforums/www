            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps it would be more fair to assess what "smarter" really means in this context? If you mean the ability to apply a certain manner of thinking into producing the type of papers thats sought after once you enter your tertiary education, then perhaps. However it wouldn't be fair to judge it based on purely that criteria alone.<br><br>Anyone who's been through NS will tell you that while it is certainly restrictive, often that forces you to be even more creative/resourceful in order to get what you need/want while staying within the boundaries of the rules you encounter. Thinking out of the box, while being in one...so to speak. Thats as valuable a skill as any <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
