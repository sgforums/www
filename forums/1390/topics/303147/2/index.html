You have just learnt to be more intelligent when dealing with stupid people. You do what others want to see you do, and that is perfectly fine in a non-profit organisation.<br><br>Not sure if this is a good example : You throw your cigarette butt on the floor, but when there is a policeman around, you throw into the litter bin.</div>

That kills creativity and the ability to think and analyse... If you do something "creative", your superiors will say... " DOnt gey kiang... follow what the book say will never go wrong..."<br>So for that particular period of your life... you just "follow" the book...<br><br>When you ORD and go university, and you did badly for the exams... Professors told you "Think and analyse, understand the concepts... Dont follow the solutions in the book... Questions twist and turn and you dont know how to do it.."<br><br>It seems that a lot of people lost that "skill" during NS... and most of us go on without realising it...</div></blockquote>I'll qualify this by saying that my experience may not apply to those who served in units that adopt a "yes sir, no sir, three bags full" philosophy.<br><br>As typical of similar units worldwide, CDO breeds rebels - we lived to buck the system.  This was especially evident during BTEC exercises when we changed strategies on the fly and drove both the umpires and the opposition crazy by simplying not doing what we were expected to do.  In barracks it was the same thing - we short-circuited everything, and we had none of the "bullsh*t baffles brains" mentality.<br><br>During NS, whatever abilities I had were finally given a proper environment to be applied - school was a pure "bullsh*t baffles brains" environment.  I took what I learned to university and stayed in the top 5% all the way through, going up from being low-to-average during JC.  By the time I got to the doctorate, I was 1 of 12 students chosen out of more than 1400 Honours graduates worldwide - that's within the top 1% of the top 5% of undergrads.<br><br>I don't think NS made me any smarter - whatever was there has been there all along.  It sure as hell didn't make me any dumber.  I think it's fair to say that it allowed to to take whatever I had on hand and focus it.<br><br>Like I said at the start, though, my unit culture seems unusual when compared to the rest of the SAF, so I'm just speaking for myself here.</div>
