            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, come to think of it, I got a letter from the Air Force to sit some tests for the pilot training program.  After I did the test, I didn't hear back from them until about two months before getting my red beret.  I told the recruiting officer, "Don't call me, I'll call you", and hung up.  Never regretted it either. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
