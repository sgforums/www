              <p>Hello everyone, I have some questions here.<br> <br> I'm a PES E clerk, and have some medical conditions which I did not
                  declare during my medical check-up and CMPB. I suffer from bipolar
                  depression, anxiety disorder and ADHD. The reason why I didn't declare
                  then is because I didn't want to jeopardise my own future, as I'm
                  paranoid about medical records being visible to the government bodies
                  and stat boards when I try to apply for a job next time. I just thought
                  that perhaps I can survive 2 years of NS successfully since I'm already
                  blessed with a PES E for other physical conditions.<br> <br> However, as time went by, my conditions started to surface and I
                  realised that it's getting harder for me to hide them, as I'm starting
                  to feel really awful from day to day. I shall not delve into details
                  here; I'd just like to say that I think I can't hold out much longer. I
                  know you guys must think I'm really useless. I feel useless too, I
                  can't believe I'm so weak that I can't even stand a clerical, sedentary
                  job.<br> <br> I feel scared now everyday; I see sharp objects around all the time and
                  I've got a bad history with them, I think people in the office don't
                  like me, I know I'm just being paranoid but I can't help it. I know I'm
                  paranoid because this isn't the first time. But yet at the same time I
                  know it's true to a certain extent, I know I'm right. I have a record
                  of being missing from school due to long MCs given by my doctor. --doctor's name edited out--<br> <br> I have confided in my chief clerk and my LTC about my condition; my LTC
                  seems bent on making me declare my illness, I can see that he's trying
                  to scare me into declaring with the possibility of charging me for
                  malingering or extending my service due to prolonged MC. This is my
                  first MC; it lasts 7 days. I am aware, though, that without my own
                  declaration, they can't really do anything to 'cure' me. I'm not so
                  sure about charging me though.<br> <br> I've suffered from my illnesses since 2004. I took half a year off sec
                  4, one whole year off JC1, restarted my JC 1 year voluntarily, and took
                  a couple of weeks off with tons of accommodations after in JC2.<br> <br> I'd like to hear your opinions about my declaration --should I go ahead
                  and declare? I don't want to end up being forcefully hauled into a
                  psychiatric ward by the SAF or anything drastic like that to happen.<br> <br> How is the process like? I'm referring to the process of seeing the MO,
                  confessing, going to medical board, getting reviewed and all. Will any
                  good come out of it? Will I be put into the SAF Ward? What if I'm
                  graded PES F?<br> <br> I'm so sorry to be taking up your time. I thank you all so, so much for
                  putting effort into reading this, I really appreciate it.<br> <br> Thank you so much y'all, really.</p>

              <p>dude, your case sounds really serious. firstly, to have mentioned your doctor's name here is kinda...wrong. pardon me if i'm wrong...but i think it's kinda offensive. but that isn't the point i wanna make. i understand your case although i don't suffer such illnesses. i do know of a few people who are like that, but they don't suffer it all. e.g ADHD + depression + blah blah blah.</p>
              <p>dude, the best route is to be treated. you don't wanna be suffering right? from what you are saying, it's really torture man. and hell NO, you are NOT useless. every human being have their own short-comings. those who judge you as useless are either unaware of your medical condition, or are plain assholes. pardon my language, but i take a very strong standpoint on people who judge and bully others. so most importantly is...never ever think of yourself as useless. you did no wrong man!</p>
              <p>i personally feel that you should get help asap. it wouldn't be doing yourself justice if you continue to stay on. my advice is to go get help. all the best dude. God speed.</p>

I think you should declare and get yourself treated in NUH's psychiatric department or if you prefer private psychiatric clinics, otherwise if you go bonkers, you may go to the store and take weapons and do a virgin tech in camp.</p></div>

              <p>What is the difference between seeing the MMI pdoc and my own pdoc while in NS? I'm always very paranoid about seeing pdocs who are from the 'authorities', be it school or army whatsoever; I've got a huge phobia of seeing them I keep thinking they're out to get me.</p>

              <p>I think that's really discouraging 'cos I believe it's a problem of not being suited to the environment; I've survived places that somehow allow me to feel at ease and not so uptight about things. My pdoc has personally explained to my previous school admins and my family about my inability to adapt and survive in certain environments, and my ability to flourish in others where people might feel out of place due to how I'm wired. Furthermore I think civil service army-wise is still different from civil service in other government bodies.</p>
              <p>I shan't argue with you further and I hope you won't reciprocate either. Do not suggest that I might go 'bonkers' or do a 'virgin tech in camp' --I think it's really offensive and hurtful and it's usually people like you who contribute to the trigger for such events to happen. Please don't pass judgment on me or others like myself before you know the whole story. I would pray for my illnesses to strike you but that would make me more inconsiderate than you are.</p>

              <p>Thank you for your reply, I'm so thankful that the people in this forum are taking me seriously instead of classifying me under some group of <em>kengsters</em>.</p>
              <p>1. Since I'm graded PES E1L9 for my physical disability, am I right to say that my PES status would be due to that and not my mental condition?</p>
              <p>2. Do you mean that future employers will need me to specifically sign to allow them to probe further into my medical history? I am aware of the  self-declaration section in job application forms. Is there another section where I sign to allow them access? Or does signing the self-declaration section indicate some sort of silent approval for them to gain access to my medical records?</p>
              <p>3. What will I take with me after my ORD? Will I be visibly 'marked'?  i.e. a written note on some certificate of sorts.</p>
              <p>I'm really grateful for all of you who are helping me out on this. Thank you so much.</p>

                                <p>I always thought the companies would ask for your CoS or
                                something... I know you mentioned that the CoS does not show any
                                medical notes, but  doesn't it show your PES grading?</p>
                                <p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><em>firstly, almost nothing
                                will extend ur ns time period, unless u go db

                                not get extended in the event that I get like a few months' worth
                                of MC by a non-SAF pdoc? My LTC warned me of the possibility of
                                suspecting that I'm malingering/something along those lines, if I
                                take long MCs, and thus that period of time when I'm away will not
                                count as Service.</p>

              <p><em>"Your LTC never refer to GOM on medical classification, ignorance doesn't protect him when you make a complain via SAF Psychiatrical  Centre on scaring the heck out a sick soldier."</em> What do you mean by this?</p>
              <p>What is 'Pre-enlistment FFI'? If you're referring to me not declaring beforehand, it is due to the possibility of jeopardising my own future should I be awarded, say, a PES F, or even if future employers wish to pry into my NS medical records since I'm PES E1L9.</p>

              <p>If you get to meet your SAF pdoctor, kindly refer to him the incident caused by your LTC to traumatised you. You are still going to jeopardise your own future if you don't report your condition during your FFI as it's a chargeable offence.</p>
