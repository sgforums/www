              <p>It's not that I don't want to serve. I think it's quite obvious that I want to serve --I want to be just like any other medically fit/unfit NSF who serves his 2 years in NS. If I didn't want to serve I would've declared everything at my first medical checkup, made a big hullabaloo about it and all. I did not --and still do not --wish to be 'marked' by the government for my condition, which is why I decided to just conceal it and serve.</p>
              <p>I have no intention of escaping and wanting out; I just wanted to know the pros and cons of declaring and weigh the choices against each other. I feel unsafe in army --some sense of foreboding about the possibility of me doing something to hurt myself or others in the near future. I just felt that perhaps by declaring I might create some kind of administrative and emotional safety net for myself...</p>
              <p>Please do not suggest that I will not be able to stand the pressures of
                      uni / society, because I think that's really discouraging and
                      demoralising and totally uncalled for especially when you're speaking
                      to people like me. I appreciate forumers who try to convince me that
                      perhaps I'm still of some use and that I'm not as lousy as I think I
                      am, but people like you just fossilize my not-so-occassional belief that maybe I wasn't
                      meant to be around at all. You're judging me based on this, and I think that's being rather unfair... don't you think so?</p>
              <p>The thing that is holding me back from declaring is the constant fear of being permanently marked and hence trapped by some sort of glass ceiling (or no entry at all) should I decide to join the civil service. I still live with the hope of permanent recovery from my illness, and I don't want a momentary declaration to jeopardise my future if I do recover from this some day... It's like a judgment that stays with you forever...</p>
              <p>I'm really hurt by your posts, and I hope you'll end your insinuations and stop responding if you don't have that many constructive comments... still, thanks for your input on this matter, thanks for taking time to read everything.</p>
              <p>Am I right or wrong in saying all these? I don't know for sure. Perhaps other forumers would like to comment...? A bit lost now...</p>

              <p>Alright... thanks a lot for your advice. I'll see how my first appointment with MMI goes. It's okay if I don't want to tell them everything about my problems right? Can I tell MMI that I'm more comfortable with my pdoc?</p>
              <p>Question: If my personal pdoc issues me 28-day long MCs in between medical appointments (if my follow-ups with him are once a month, and also to avoid review by the Medical Board, endorsement scares me already) that add up to a considerable number of days, will my period of service be extended due to my absenteeism? Or will the MCs still be valid?</p>
              <p>Question: During the endorsement of my MC, the MO said that he'd refer me to MMI, but I haven't heard anything from them so far. Was/am I supposed to collect some sort of written referal or appointment card with MMI from the Medical Centre?</p>

              <p>Anyway, your COS depicted the course that u have taken before. It includes e PES E induction program so your employers will know tt u r a downgraded personnel.</p>
              <p>P cases never get PES F. PES F only 4 schizophrenic people or cancer. PES E includes brain hemorrhage, foot fracture(sometimes) kidney failure, psychiatric cases...</p>
              <p>GO to job dunt show your COS cos it is useless anyway. esp if u going private sector.</p>
              <p>I am also a P case though I havent apply 4 job yet. Dunt worry n be happy. I too am not sure how to explain how I got PES E in the first place.  </p>

              <p>I think that's really discouraging 'cos I believe it's a problem of not being suited to the environment; I've survived places that somehow allow me to feel at ease and not so uptight about things. My pdoc has personally explained to my previous school admins and my family about my inability to adapt and survive in certain environments, and my ability to flourish in others where people might feel out of place due to how I'm wired. Furthermore I think civil service army-wise is still different from civil service in other government bodies.</p>
              <p>I shan't argue with you further and I hope you won't reciprocate either. Do not suggest that I might go 'bonkers' or do a 'virgin tech in camp' --I think it's really offensive and hurtful and it's usually people like you who contribute to the trigger for such events to happen. Please don't pass judgment on me or others like myself before you know the whole story. I would pray for my illnesses to strike you but that would make me more inconsiderate than you are.</p>

              <p><br>I was being kind and giving you good advice. If you cannot take mental stress which is what clerks in army go through, it is a resistance to pressure. Please do not think that the civil service is a piece of cake. So what if it's not military and is civilian? Your problem is you crack when under stress and pressure, not when you see a green uniform. </p>
              <p>Oh you threatening to pray for your illness to strike me? Go ahead, I am not afraid, because my God protects me and not only that, He promised me that whoever who curses me will be cursed back the same thing by 7 times. Let's see if your mouth is more evil than my God is  faithful.</p>

              <p>If you cannot even function as a clerk in NS, and clerks in NS do not have to do combat or handle weapons, i doubt you will have much of a future handling the stress of being in the civil service in a civilian capacity as well, so you don't have to worry about "jeapardising your possible future of employment". I think you should declare and get yourself treated in NUH's psychiatric department or if you prefer private psychiatric clinics, otherwise if you go bonkers, you may go to the store and take weapons and do a virgin tech in camp.</p>

              <p>That is exactly what I thought.</p>
              <p>The maiden post of the thread starter was centred on his "desires" and motives to avoid medical detection, to protect his own future. If your case is genuine, you should be seeking help, not trying to dodge detection.</p>
              <p>Do you think SAF is the only place that can make you crack? Do you believe that just because it's your only full time military stint, the rest of your life after your ORD will not host any trigger points for your condition? Do you believe that this is entirely caused by SAF? I truly think you do based on your response to me when you said your "condition is controlled and you can function well in some conditions and not others". So you think only SAF lah? You think you're going to have a smooth office life in air con lah and so no trigger? You don't think you may crack from one million other areas from relationships, or work stress or tragedy?</p>
              <p>You are trying to dodge detection and you made it so clear, I think that's what make some of us think you have ulterior motives for your own benefit during your NS time. If your condition is real then you need help and not to dodge detection, which is what you're consciously and taking a lot of effort to do.</p>
              <p>Mental illness is the same as any other. if you don't treat cancer, it spreads. If you don't treat a minor fever, it becomes worse and very serious and possibly fatal.</p>
              <p>I offered you advice to tell you to seek treatment and not try to dodge medical detection because of your untested and naive belief that SAF is your only trigger point. That's what you think aint it? That's why you said your 'condition' is only 'applicable' in certain conditions? Like now lah when you're serving NS?</p>
              <p>There are millions of trigger points in life waiting for you. If your condition is genuine you should get it treated. if it's not, you should not chao keng.</p>
