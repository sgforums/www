            <div class='col-md body'>hmm ..i think the canvas cushion the fall alot.i tried the guy it looks high, but when u land your landing on softground like that. the force will make the canvas pullers surge in slowly thus breaking your fall. Not to mention the abilty to land standing up is always a must, those who fall forward or backward will be told to jump again</div>

Due to the shape of the bar, where u slide on the bar to the rope.I remeber doing it at PLC under the famous or rather infamous PTI from 7 BTS last time.<br><br>Its very fun, before u reach the ground or nearing, u got to turn the bar left and right to slow down and start to cycle your legs..when u touch the ground, u should run on the ground hence slowing down and braking.<br><br>The jump that some of us including me were refering to is called the Canvas Jump where the PTI will place a coin (in my time) in the center and the ppl pulling the canvas will pull the canvas really tight, the coin go as high as the jumper's height and then u jump down ..legs shoulder lenght.bents bent and a perfect landing.</div>
