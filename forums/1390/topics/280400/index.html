Back to OCS for 3 months then Pearce AU for 10 months. Then your AFS for 11 months. Thereafter you can defer for studies but not before you sign a 10-year bond with the RSAF.</div>

I heard that the selection for SIA pilot is very competitive, so maybe the extra years of military flying experience will help one get selected over others?<br><br>Also, SAF has a policy of promoting LTAs to CPTs one year after they graduate from Uni right, so does that mean that there are many many more captains than LTAin the squadrons?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Blitzer, you have got some serious questions going on there  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> and it doesn't seem like "only a few".<br><br>If you are really interested in the idea of wearing a green jumpsuit to a co.ckpit everyday, then you should really call on the consultants at CMPB at Depot Road. There are staff there who can readily answer your questions.<br><br>Since you have not served your NS, then I figure you are still ineligible for SIA as they only take adults aged 25 half and above.<br><br>First and foremost, have you sat in a small plane before? Like those 4 seater types.<br><br>The chop rate for RSAF trainee pilots is very high...something like up to 60-70% per batch per phase. No prizes for guessing reasons as the profession is extremely demanding mentally and physcially, especially if one is a fighter pilot.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mrblitzer21<br><br>when i say start from scratch, u really start from scratch, as in a CADET pilot again(OCT). So dont think if you are some big shot LTC, transitioning over to commercial aviation can throw his "previous" experience around.<br><br>FYI, single engine hours (F-16s included) are NOT fully recognised in commercial terms.<br><br>You also dont get to choose when to leave...... like father's airforce....... just before your 12th yr, RSAF offer you promotion to MAJ........ if you indicate u r leaving, rank may not be given to you. And you mention leave after 2nd contract. At 45yrs old, commercial airline may or may not take you in. if accepted, you join your 25yr old coursemates and start all over again....... believe me, its a humbling experience..<br><br>As Rockstar had said, you want more info on RSAF, go CMPB ask from horses' mouth. You want info on commercial aviation, go to the official websites.<br><br>Both military and commercial flying have its difficulties...... both have dropout rates..... both have its pluses n minuses................. its what you want and how you want to live your life.<br><br>importantly, do it cos you WANT to, not becos you HAVE to..........</div>
