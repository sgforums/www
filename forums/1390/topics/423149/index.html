              <p>The NSRA is effective from 29 Aug 2010. National Servicemen who reach the milestones on or after this date will be eligible for the respective milestone awards. For example, full-time National Servicemen whose ORD is on or after 29 Aug 2010 will be eligible for the first milestone award. This includes those whose ORD was originally on or after 29 Aug 2010, but had been brought forward due to the fitness incentive of a two-month reduction in full-time NS duration.</p>
              <p>The award will be paid out to eligible servicemen within two months of reaching the milestone.</p>

              <p>if when at 30, you start ur 1st ICT.</p>

              <p>going thru the 10 years ICT cycle,</p>

              <p><strong>Example 1: 1st Milestone - Early Completion of Full-Time National Service due to Fitness Incentive</strong></p>
              <p>Third Sergeant (3SG) Tan was a Section Leader in an Infantry unit during his full-time National Service. He was enlisted on 9 Oct 2008 and completed his full-time National Service on 8 Aug 2010. His duration of full-time National Service (NS) was reduced by two months, from 24 months to 22 months, due to a fitness incentive.</p>
              <p>As his original ORD, based on a 24-month full-time NS duration, should have been after the implementation date on 29 Aug 2010 if not for the fitness incentive, he is therefore eligible to receive the first milestone award. As an NSF commander, he will be given $3,500 in his PSEA. He can use the award to pay for his education, in accordance with the PSEA usage guidelines. 3SG Tan will receive a notification from MINDEF informing him of his eligibility. The payment of the first milestone award will be made by February 2011.</p>
              <p>Besides the NSRA, 3SG Tan is also eligible to receive his Certificate of Service (COS) and a memento upon his ORD.</p>
              <p><strong>Example 2: 1st Milestone - Completion of Full-Time National Service</strong></p>
              <p>Special Constable Corporal (SC/CPL) Tan is a Neighbourhood Police Centre Officer (NPCO) in the Singapore Police Force. Sergeant Yong (SGT) is a Section Commander in a Fire Station in the Singapore Civil Defence Force. Both of them were enlisted in September 2008 and are due to complete their full-time NS in September 2010.</p>
              <p>As their ORD is after the implementation date on 29 Aug 2010, they are both eligible to receive the first milestone of the award. As a non-NSF commander, SC/CPL Tan will be given $3,000 in his PSEA whereas SGT Yong will be given $3,500 in his PSEA as a NSF commander. They can use the award to pay for their further education, in accordance with the PSEA usage guidelines. They will receive a notification from the Ministry of Home Affairs informing them of their eligibility. The payment of the first milestone award will be made by February 2011.</p>
              <p>Besides the NSRA, they will also be eligible to receive their COS and a memento upon their ORD.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> ===========================================================</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Example 3: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2nd Milestone</span> - Completion of 5 In-Camp Trainings (ICT) with 2 High-Key ICT</strong></p>
              <p>Captain (NS) [CPT(NS)] Mohamad, 27 years old, is an Officer Commanding (OC) in a Guards unit and he will be completing his fifth ICT from 8 Nov 2010 to 19 Nov 2010. This is his second High-Key ICT.</p>
              <p>After his fifth ICT, CPT(NS) Mohamad will be eligible to receive the second milestone award. As an NS commander, he will be given $3,500 in his CPF account, which will be allocated in the same proportions as prevailing CPF allocation rates for the OA, SA and MA, based on his age group (see Table 1). He can use the award to pay for his HDB flat loan and purchase medical insurance, as these are approved uses based on the CPF guidelines. CPT(NS) Mohamad will receive a notification from MINDEF informing him of his eligibility upon completion of his fifth ICT. The payment of the milestone award will be made by February 2011.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> ===========================================================</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Example 4: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">3rd Milestone</span> - Completion of ORNS Training Cycle</strong></p>
              <p>Corporal (NS) [CPL(NS)] Lim is a Driver in an Artillery unit and he will be attending his final ICT required for his ORNS training cycle from 11 Jan 2011 to 21 Jan 2011. This is his 10th ICT. He will be 37 years old when he completes his ORNS training cycle.</p>
              <p>After his final ICT, CPL(NS) Lim will be eligible to receive the third milestone award. He will be given $3,000 in his CPF account which will be allocated in the same proportions as prevailing CPF allocation rates for the OA, SA and MA, based on his age group (see Table 2). He can use the award for any approved usage based on the CPF guidelines. CPL(NS) Lim will receive a notification from MINDEF informing him of his eligibility upon completion of his 10th ICT.</p>
              <p><strong>ROD</strong>: Besides the NSRA, CPL(NS) Lim will also be receiving a gift watch from the Singapore Armed Forces as a token of appreciation for his contributions towards NS.
