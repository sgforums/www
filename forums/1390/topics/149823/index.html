            <div class='col-md body'>I strongly advice against all extreme measures until you have gone through all proper procedure<br><br>First, you need to know that ATEC is very important to a unit and granting of leave or off are extremely rare during this period.<br><br>Since you have already approached your S4, I reckon that it is not approved, still talk to your manpower officer (S1) as he is in a better position to deploy manpower and see whether you are really needed or not. Of course, you must provide prove that you indeed have an exam prepartory course during that period.<br>Let say if you are really needed, ask whether you can then be assign to a low key position to mann so at least you have time for your studies over there at wallaby.<br><br>Gd luck.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i assume you are under S4 branch since this kind of problem you don't go S4.<br><br>Anyway, just to let you know there are directives on NSFs take nights off to go for classes. One of the conditions is that you going night classes does not affect the operational requirements of SAF.<br><br>While i am not exactly sure what you role will be in Wallaby, I am very sure as a non-combatant (therefore, non-estab personnel unless you are CQ, etc) you could be forgone in Wallaby.<br><br>I really believe that the decisions of this kind is made by CO level already. So if S4 does not help you by asking CO for you, I seriously thing you should talk to CO. I am assuming you are HQ personnel.<br><br>Honestly and "legally" speaking, you do not have the right to excuse yourself for your studies because of the nature of the course does not fall into the categories as spelt out by SAF.<br><br>In any case, SAF is gonna ask you to take leave for the period they are in Wallaby and you in singapore studying.<br><br>Perhaps you should try asking the school if they could have a special waiver or arrangement for you given the circumstances.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the s4 has said he also can't let me go because of lack of manpower, but i have clarified this with my IC, we are having regulars coming in from 6d and 4sab, and one from 6d is able to get me a substitute.<br><br>we will be going to s1 and co directly if s4 still doesn't relent.</div>
