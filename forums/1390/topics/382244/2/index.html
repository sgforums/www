              <p>So for MDES, they can 'skip ranks' from ME1 to ME2, they are promoted from 3SG to SSG instantly, and from ME2 to ME3, skip from SSG to WO?</p>

              <p>yes can 'skip', but the promotion time can be abit long... though the prefix aka grade [-X, where X can be 1, 2 or 3 depending on the ME level] after the rank will be changed [rise in pay] as time goes by.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the link. I browsed through it.</p>
              <p>Am amused that ALL RSN combat vocation will be under MDES from now on. So much so for naval pride and heritage of naval ranks. hahaha.</p>
              <p>I also notice that sponsorship for MDES goes up to SMS (MDES) only just like how in the past it used to be SMS (engineering). Once again we can see it's the backwater career path, primarily for service side.</p>
              <p>I say its good for those who are seeking a civilian career that's pretending to be a military career but got higher-than-market-rate military pay, something like air traffic controller.</p>

              <p>ur friend, poly grad. Can he get into uni? if he can, don't sign on. it is not worth it to sign on as a spec. you earn much more as a degree-holding civilian than in the saf as a spec.</p>
              <p>Specs are usually considered as the lower-educated bunch of people in the saf. the pay of a LTA 2 yr into service easily trumps that of a SSG, with at least 6 yrs of service.</p>
              <p>and bear in mind that promotion for spec is somewhat slow, there being so many ranks between 3SG and 2WO.</p>
              <p>Unless, he can somehow get into OCS, and sign on as officer. the pay is much better.</p>
              <p>on another note, if ur friend can't get into uni, signing on as a spec is definitely good, in the sense that its pay is higher than the market rate for diploma holder. and it presents a stable job, for at least 5-10 yrs.</p>
              <p>for MDES scheme, it benefits degree holders more. degree holders can sign on immediately as MDES 4, equivalent to CPT, bypassing the need for many years of service. also, it allows graduates who were man or specs in their NS days to attain the equivalent of officers.</p>
              <p>as for the rank and files, MDES 1-3 is not worth it. you get to work longer, but there is less welfare benefits compared to the military scheme.</p>

              <p>Thanks deathmaster for your detailed and sound advice. He does not know if he can get into uni. He has not tried to apply before.</p>
              <p>He can't make it to OCS.</p>
              <p>On your point on MDES scheme being a boon to graduates who can be emplaced on MDES4 immediately actually is not really a boon, because graduates who profess their desire to sign on, wil sign on as officers and be made to go OCS. I haven't heard of a graduate who sign on as spec. Last I heard the graduates who apply for MDES were made to go OCS. This is similar to previously when graduates who sign on to be engin officers would also sign on as officers and be made to go through OCS.</p>
              <p>Although they should not emplace them on MDES 4 immediately for fairness's sake. Afterall graduates are only given their CPT rank one year after graduation, and not immediately after.</p>

              <p>It really depends on your friend's job preference and capabilities. For combat specialists especially, your friend should know what to expect and not sign better of the higher pay. Not sure about other vocations, for inf/guards, you have to endure almost 3 years of sweat. 9 months of training in BMT and SISPEC, followed by 2 years of sect com tour. All my regular friends agree that this is the stage that you hate most and would most likely toy with the idea of breaking your bond. 2 years as sect com is really no joke as you'll taking on sect com responsibilities as well as having shits thrown at you by CSM and RSM. 3 consective years as a low-life combat spec is definitely no joke. The trainings, outfields, fucked around by higher up like you're a NSF, COS and guard duties, low pay.. This is something the career officers doesn't highlight. However, life definitely gets 'better' after that. Promotion, higher pay, more command..</p>
              <p>I've seen a couple of regulars in my unit leaving Army because they cannot handle the pressure. So bad that one declared depression and was asked to pay up and fuck off. Of course, this is only what I've observed in my NS.</p>

              <p>DXO.... is a no-no.When anyone on the streets thinks of Mindef, who do they think of? what comes to their minds? what do they see in the papers? of course..the uniformed men, the officers mostly, and to a lesser extent sometimes, the WOSE.</p>
              <p>DXO is least glorified, the lapdogs of the uniformed officers, analogy to describe them would be the pharmacists in the hospital (compared to the docs), even lower than the MOs in the SAF. Its the grunt work without the glamour.</p>
              <p>I remember once speaking to a civilian local doctor who is utterly deluded and told me that SAF sign-on docs sure got the "best" career path in the SAF compared to other officers. For pete's sake, they're medics!! Doc or not, in the SAF, they're medics!They're doing service support functions, like
                                          logistics and engineering. And there's actually a dumb twerp who thinks they'll be the
                                          kings of the SAF compared to the people who specialise in what SAF is
                                          doing - Combat. What a retard. Combat service support is just that.. combat service SUPPORT.. its head should not even get a star. Thats why its only a BG estab and headed by a full COL, who's given a nominal star at the end of his service.</p>
              <p>I later learnt why he could be so ignorant..because he wasn't an MO in his NS days, and was a CPL in gayland, music and drama company.</p>
              <p>Gosh so many ignoramuses. </p>

              <p>It really depends on your friend's job preference and
              capabilities. For combat specialists especially, your friend should
              know what to expect and not sign better of the higher pay. Not sure
              about other vocations, for inf/guards, you have to endure almost 3
              years of sweat. 9 months of training in BMT and SISPEC, followed by
              2 years of sect com tour. All my regular friends agree
              that this is the stage that you hate most and would most likely toy
              with the idea of breaking your bond. 2 years as sect com is really
              no joke as you'll taking on sect com responsibilities as well as
              having shits thrown at you by CSM and RSM. 3 consective years as a
              low-life combat spec is definitely no joke. The trainings,
              outfields, fucked around by higher up like you're a NSF, COS and
              guard duties, low pay.. This is
              something the career officers doesn't highlight.
              However, life definitely gets 'better' after that. Promotion,
              higher pay, more command..</p>
              <p>I've seen a couple of regulars in my unit leaving Army because
              they cannot handle the pressure. So bad that one declared
              depression and was asked to pay up and fuck off. Of course, this is
              only what I've observed in my NS.</p>

              <p>I think life gets better from CSM onwards. Let's see. But one thing for sure is that the CSM is like the glue that bond the men with the organisation. And it's hard to come by good ones in SAF.</p>

              <p>Thanks deathmaster for your detailed and sound advice. He does
              not know if he can get into uni. He has not tried to apply
              before.</p>
              <p>He can't make it to OCS.</p>
              <p>On your point on MDES scheme being a boon to graduates who can
              be emplaced on MDES4 immediately actually is not really a boon,
              because graduates who profess their desire to sign on, wil sign on
              as officers and be made to go OCS. I haven't heard of a graduate
              who sign on as spec. Last I heard the graduates who apply for MDES
              were made to go OCS. This is similar to previously when graduates
              who sign on to be engin officers would also sign on as officers and
              be made to go through OCS.</p>
              <p>Although they should not emplace them on MDES 4 immediately for
              fairness's sake. Afterall graduates are only given their CPT rank
              one year after graduation, and not immediately after.</p>

              <p>hmm, MDES 4 can be considered as a LTA rank also, though grades 2 and 3 may be CPT alr.. though currently, officers cpt and above will will be split into grade 1 and 2? [the new scheme tends to emphasize more on the 'grade' as compared to rank? =/] so as to say, graduates' starting pay will be based on 4-1, then subsequently adjusted with the change in grade. [and experience/performance/time too, to justify the rise]</p>

              <p>Its been mentioned that MDES does not bother about your rank so regardless officers of specs they might be graded depending on their skills since MDES is more on skills expertises and not planning etc that officers are used to doing.</p>

              <p>I do agree that signing on with the SAF as a spec is quite good but if the person truly like it. There is a lousy side to it when the serviceman decided to quit the service after the ten year contract end n he might need to start all over again. I talked to a former regular in the air force n he mentioned majority of his frens in the air force have to go back to the same industry as aircraft technician in Singapore airlines cause they have a have a tough time in other industry.</p>

                                                                              organization system is different from the army, each ship consists

              <p>I dont know how is your "service-support service" concept come
                                                                              in.</p>

              <p> The vocations you named on the ship like naval cook (to be renamed chef), engineer, are all service support vocations. The concept of combat, combat support and combat service support is present in ALL three services. For eg, in air force, the WSO (weapon systems officer) or WSS  (weapon systems spec) are combat support (btw he also goes inside the plane), while the pilot is a combat vocation. WSO assists the pilot in the frontline, but he plays a supporting role, like how combat support formations like arty or signals support infantry and armour. An aircraft technician or aircraft engineering officer is combat service support.</p>
              <p>How can everyone in army, navy or air force be combat?? then who  the fuck prepares the logistics and how  the fuck can everyone be combat service support then who the fuck would do the fighting with the enemy? The concept is present in all three services. what an idiot.</p>
              <p>And how can everyone on a RSN ship be ALL in service support and hence, ALL have a corresponding civilian vocation? (Only service support would have corresponding vocation in the civilian world). In that case, who is the commander of the ship? He's not an officer and not in command of the vessel? And if CO of the ship is in service support and have a civilian counterpart vocation, praytell what would that be?</p>
