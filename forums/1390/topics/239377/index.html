Unlike some small, private companies, stat boards have proper HR departments and practices in place. Before they hire any potential candidate, they will run very thorough checks on him/her. And that include past employment history, jail records (if any), educational background, NS records... All these info are readily available to them, given that they are a government board.</div>
