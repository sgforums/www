In fact, this eyewear melds form with function to provide high-technology protection of growing sophistication.<br><br>'The United States Army previously provided protective eyewear to some soldiers, but it was found that they often did not wear it because it just wasn't particularly attractive. It wasn't cool,' said Ms Linda Watson, senior vice-president for marketing and communications at US-based Revision Eyewear Ltd.<br><br>Much has since changed.<br><br>Revision, with its manufacturing facility in the small Vermont town of Essex Junction, is among a handful of suppliers in this specialised market. There are just seven companies that meet rigorous US military standards, with four of these dominant: ESS, Oakley, Wiley X and Revision. Others include Rudy Project in Italy and the German company UVEX.<br><br>Military eyewear normally involves a range of eyeglasses and goggles, often with interchangeable lenses. Opaque lenses are used in bright sunlight, for example, and clear ones are used at night or in darkened interiors. The more sophisticated eyewear also accommodates corrective lenses clipped inside the frame for those with vision impairment.<br><br>The Canadian Army recently expanded this range with the introduction of a helmet-mounted visor. All members of the Canadian Land Forces have been equipped with Revision's Sawfly ballistic eyewear since 2003, and selective personnel are now getting helmet-mounted visors for an additional layer of protection. The aim is to provide eye and facial protection up to the level of body armour and helmets for those in particularly vulnerable positions, such as turret gunners.<br><br>Whatever the style, military eyewear is geared to address two core requirements: ballistic protection and environmental protection. The former refers to projectiles, including shrapnel and bullets. The latter includes ultraviolet light, sun glare, wind, dust and rain.<br><br>They must also be scratch-resistant and provide clear and distortion-free vision without obstruction, together with a comfortable fit. And, more recently, there has been a new emphasis on cool design.<br><br>Ballistic protection is provided by the eyewear's polycarbonate lens, made from a type of advanced plastic. In tests conducted by the US Army in September, Revision's Sawfly eyewear resisted penetration from shotgun, hand grenade and improvised explosive device (IED) blasts at a range of 5m. Products from other suppliers also have similar characteristics.<br><br>Ms Watson said that the market for military eyewear has mushroomed since 2000. 'Part of the reason is the type of warfare now going on. IEDs and close-quarters combat have combined to heighten interest,' she explained.<br><br>Incentives include the human cost, particularly as eye injuries in combat and in training alike are often preventable, and the financial cost. The latter can include workdays lost to injury and lifelong disability payments for those more seriously hurt.<br><br>In addition, eye injuries have become more prevalent in warfare. US military data indicates that ocular injuries as a percentage of total war injuries increased from 2 per cent and 2.8 per cent in World War II and the Korean conflict, respectively, to 7 per cent in the Vietnam War. The rate had grown to 13 per cent for the Gulf War of 1990-91.<br><br>This has prompted a growing range of military forces to consider ballistic eye protection. Aside from the US and Canadian armies, Revision's client list includes the United Kingdom and Belgian defence ministries. Singapore's Special Operations Force, part of the commando battalion, ordered Revision eyewear in 2005.<br><br>US marines sport ESS eyewear while Oakley is popular with the US Special Operations Command. Elsewhere, the Australian Army is due soon to select a ballistic eyewear supplier.<br><br>This growing market has spurred a flurry of research and development activity. Aside from the Canadian Army's helmet- mounted visor, the next generation of military eyewear should feature variable light transition products which allow a lens to change its opaqueness to account for shifts in light intensity. Such eyewear will also allow for a smoother transition between bright exteriors and dark interiors.<br><br>Another innovation in development involves incorporating head-up display systems in military goggles, which will allow for the remote transmission of data and imagery directly to the wearer.<br><br>Then there is the issue of protection against lasers. Laser technology has become intrinsic to a range of weapons, particularly in the area of precision guidance, but exposure to laser beams can cause blindness.<br><br>To address this specific issue, the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, or Inhumane Weapons Convention, was revised in 1995 to include Protocol IV on Blinding Laser Weapons. This outlaws laser weapons whose primary purpose is to cause blindness, but there are two inherent flaws in the regime.<br><br>Protocol IV came into effect on July 30, 1998, but has so far been signed by just 87 countries. In this region, the list of nonsignatories includes Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore and Thailand - six out of the 10 Asean members - with neighbouring Timor Leste and Papua New Guinea equally negligent.<br><br>The second problem centres on lasers whose primary purpose may involve guidance or other functions. Though permitted under Protocol IV, these can also cause blindness through improper exposure.<br><br>The challenge in developing protection against laser-induced blindness on the battlefield lies in the fact that lasers emit beams of varying wavelengths. Several companies now produce laser-protection lenses, made by mixing a dye additive with the pigment when moulding the lens, but these are of limited effectiveness. Most protect against just one transmitted wavelength while some work against two or three.<br><br>This narrow capability is hardly sufficient and efforts are under way to improve the range of coverage.<br><br>'Dielectric stacks represent a new technology now being worked on as an alternative,' Ms Watson said.<br><br>'This could result in the commercialised introduction of a new type of protective eyewear in the relatively near-term future.'<br><br>rkarniol@gmail.com<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>
