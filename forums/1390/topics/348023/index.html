              <p>Lol. Ya lah. If not a man holds a higher responsibility than a 3SGT meh?</p>
              <p>More responsibility means higher pay.</p>
              <p>It's the same as the working world outside. Higher hierarchy like the manager makes the important decisions thus command a higher pay then the office workers who carry out the decision of the manager thus get a lower pay.</p>

              <p>i'm currently undergoing enhanced BMT. i know that my batch is
              expected to go into command schools after POP.</p>
              <p>The thing is that I'm not interested in going into SISPEC or
              OCS, simply because they're not my cup of tea. I'd rather be a man.
              Moreover, I've some problems passing  IPPT and SOC. (I've not
              trained myself at  all for almost one year since NAPFA, hence
              I've some problems to even pass my IPPT =.=)</p>
              <p>I dun understand why ppl actually aspire to get into these
              command schs. Is it because of money? or pride? To me, I dun do
              things for $ if I've no interest in it. And as for pride, well,
              pride for 2 years, does it really justify the tough training u'll
              receive in the 6 or 9 months?</p>
              <p>They say "pain is temporary, pride is forever" but I thought
              otherwise. "Pride is only for 2 years".</p>
              <p>And of how much use is it for u in your future career as a
              specialist or an officer? I just dun understand why ppl want to get
              into command schs. well, unless they're for $, which I dun agree if
              u've no interest in the job.</p>

              <p>now wait a minute ? ..... you have problems passing IPPT and SOC, and you think "my batch is expected to go into command schools" .....</p>
              <p>woah ! ... is your father some mini-star or something ? ... are you a super white horse ? ... if not, what makes you think you are going into any command schools at all ? .... </p>
              <p>get into the command schools themselves first before you start ruminating on such things, you DON'T CHOOSE to go to command schools ... you are CHOSEN for them ... </p>
              <p>and if you can't pass IPPT and SOC, but are dissing and dismissing options that you don't even have ... what does it look like, really ? ... I call it hubris mixed with sour grapes .....</p>

              depends also... you must also look at your NS cycle and not only the 2 years.
              
              yes your batch is supposedly the one with HIGHER CHANCE of going command school but that hardly means anything, it just means more vacancies. doesn't mean apr/jul/oct intake cannot go SISPEC / OCS...
              
              as for ippt/soc, it doesn't matter right? even if you get gold, as long as you indicate that you don't want to go command school, they won't force you...
              
              if i have storemen under my QM platoon who can get IPPT gold, i don't see what the worry is even if you pass IPPT / SOC! or you just trying to make excuse so that when you really not picked to go then you not so lao kui?(,")(",)
              
              sounds offending but yeah, tt's my 2 cents...
