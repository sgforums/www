One of the guys was injured and had difficulties walking, so some smart ass came up wif the idea of "stealing" a vehicle while the rest of the grp followed. The part abt stealing the vehicle is alittle conflicting cos some say they were only borrowing and had every intention of returning back to its owner while others account was that they just wanted to steal the vehicle, drive it to their destination and leave it there. Anyway, the owner found out in the end and din report to the police for unknown reasons. The relative of the owner, who happened to be in the police force, reported the case to the authorities. So in the end, the smart alec who came up wif the idea and the driver of the stolen vehicle were sent to DB for less than 10 days each while the rest of the group OOCed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
