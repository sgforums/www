            <div class='col-md body'>From reading this section in the forum, i seem to get the impression that almost <strong>EVERYONE</strong> here serves 2 1/2 years. Isn't there anyone that actually serves only 2 years? I am an O level holder and hoping to apply for a dimploma course once i get out of national service. The extra 1/2 a year will mean i have to wait one damn year until the next application. So my question is - is there anyway i can ensure i will only serve 2 years and not 2 1/2. <strong>Also if anyone in here actually only serves 2 years please give me some feedbacks so i know it is actually possible <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> .</strong> Much appreciated.<br><br>Btw, i am aware that dimploma and A level holders are supposed to serve 2 1/2 years anyway. And that O - level holders only need serve 2 years but i will assume that SAF love to hold people back from their ORD and that maybe choosing a wrong choice or being posted to a wrong unit or camp or something will result in them gleefully adding 1/2 a year to your service?

How come wuming78 said in the above post <strong>almost all</strong> O levels serve 2 1/2 years because they confirm (almost) become CPL ?
