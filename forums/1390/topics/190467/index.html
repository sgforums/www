After a quarrel over the woman they seperated ...  *hai*<br><br>The commando left and after wandering for 40 years in the wilderness founded the school of commando at hendon until today it is still shrouded in mystery and secrecy.<br><br>After countless generations and genes passed down the guardsman still bears striking good looks among his qualities, the commando though no longer ugly still will ki siao at the sight of very beautiful women or when the sun at 2pm is very hot.<br><br>We guardsmen though not as strong as commando but because born on higher plane of intelligence developed tactics to overcome physical weaknesses to survive in the harsh world and founded more schools and camps and flourished thru out the land.<br><br>But the commando because he too had to survive but couldn't reason very well frequently infiltrated like a thief in the night into guardsmen camp to learn our tactics developed by us to survive in the same harsh world.<br><br>BUT NEVER EVER ON PAIN OF DEATH will we guardsmen ever reveal to outsiders where we train, our tactics, our code, our implements of war WE WILL NEVER SELL OUT our beloved country to the forces of evil.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>but lets make the exception to share the women we conquer ... okie? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
