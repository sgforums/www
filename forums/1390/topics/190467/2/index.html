Do note that this is full tank battalion - ie 3 tank coy and 1 AI coy. Typical armor battle group would be 3 AI and 1 tank coy. That one is siong, no doubt. Usually for my case, one AI platoon was assigned to a tank coy, and we dismounted only for local protection.<br><br>The only time we had company level activity during battalion exercise was for coastal hook or clearing water bodies due to tanks inability to combat on water.</div>
