              <p>Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said the government is reviewing policies
               to help Singaporeans serving National Service feel more appreciated. He
               said said it is important for citizens to feel they have benefited from
               the sacrifice of protecting the nation.</p>
              <p>He was speaking to 
              reporters during the Total Defence Day ceremony on Friday. Total Defence
               Day is commemorated on 15 February as it marks the day Singapore fell 
              to the Japanese in 1942.</p>
              <p><em>Dr Ng also reiterated that foreigners who are not prepared to do National Service should not become permanent residents (PRs).</em></p>
              <p>He
               said: <strong>"If you are not prepared to do national service, don’t become a 
              PR. It’s a very clear message because in our system, if you don’t fulfil
               your NS liabilities, you just can’t pay a fine. The penalties are very 
              severe and it’s way beyond monetary penalties."</strong></p>
              <p><em>He added that the penalties for PRs who do not fulfil their National Service obligations cannot be monetised.</em></p>
              <p>Dr
               Ng was responding to MP for Bishan—Toa Payoh GRC Hri Kumar Nair’s 
              proposal of imposing an annual national defence tax on permanent 
              residents and foreigners.</p>
              <p>He said: "We are really looking at what 
              are some of our policies that we can help Singaporeans feel that when 
              they do NS, they are being appreciated. Two, that there is some tangible
               benefits in terms of what they have benefiting.</p>
              <p>"So, we are 
              re—looking that, and we have heard Singaporeans loud and clear, and we 
              want to respond to that in positive ways in the course of the next few 
              months."</p>
              <p>On Wednesday, Mr Nair had suggested that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>the "national 
              defence duty" is to sharpen the distinction between Singaporeans and 
              non—citizens.</em></span></p>
