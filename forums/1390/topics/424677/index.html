              <p><strong><span class="color--gray font-size--8">SOURCE: The New Paper</span></strong><br><br>THEY were stationed at Sembawang Wharves for an operation that night.<br><br>But the five SAF servicemen treated the place as their private racing circuit.<br><br>They
               took several new Kia Koup cars, which were parked there waiting to be 
              shipped out, for a joy ride – not once, but three times.<br><br>As they 
              raced each other, two of the cars collided when one tried to overtake 
              the other. Later, a front tyre of a third car got stuck in a drain after
               a mishap.<br><br>The men’s antics were caught on security cameras. A worker at the wharves also saw what they did and reported them.<br><br>The repairs to the cars cost about $13,100. Three of the men did not have valid driving licences.<br><br>After
               a court martial, all five men were sentenced last Dec 3 to between six 
              weeks’ and 15 months’ detention by the General Court Martial (GCM) Panel
               at the Subordinate Military Court.<br><br>They pleaded guilty to 
              several charges, including theft of a motor vehicle, driving without a 
              licence, driving without third-party insurance and leaving a place of 
              duty as a sentry without having been regularly relieved.<br><br>Three of
               the men, Third Sergeant Chiam Toon Chong, 24, Lance Corporal Tan Fu 
              Ning, 21, and Lance Cpl Tan Yong Chen, 21, are appealing against their 
              sentences. They had been sentenced to detention of 15 months, nine 
              months and 10 months, respectively.<br><br>Their appeals will be heard in the Military Court of Appeal at the High Court tomorrow.<br><br>Since
               2007, SAF troops have been deployed at key installations, such as 
              Sembawang Wharves, Changi Airport and Jurong Island, as these are 
              considered high-profile terrorist targets. Besides combat training, 
              these soldiers will have been trained in areas such as assessing threats
               and analysing suspicious behaviour.<br><br>The five cars were among 
              those shipped into the wharves from Korea and assigned parking spaces in
               a car yard by the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) between March 11 
              and April 10 last year.<br><br>The five servicemen, all of whom are 
              full-time national servicemen except for 3rd Sgt Chiam, who was a 
              regular at that time, were stationed at the wharves for an operation on 
              Aug 6 last year.<br><br>Two of them, Private Tan Yuan Tat, 21, and Lance
               Cpl Tan Yong Cheng, were on sentry duty at a berth near the car yard 
              from 7.30pm to midnight.<br><br>Half an hour into their shift, 3rd Sgt Chiam, Lance Cpl Tan Fu Ning and Lance Cpl Tan Choon Siang, 21, approached them.<br><br>During their conversation, 3rd Sgt Chiam proposed that they “play with the new Kia cars together”. The other four agreed.<br><br>Pte
               Tan and Lance Cpl Tan Yong Cheng then left their post with the others 
              although they had not been regularly relieved of their duty.<br><br>Around
               8.30pm, the five arrived at the car yard. Lance Cpl Tan Fu Ning and 
              Lance Cpl Tan Yong Cheng got into a silver car and the others into a 
              blue car. The cars were not locked.<br><br>When they found the car keys, 3rd Sgt Chiam taught Pte Tan and Lance Cpl Tan Choon Siang how to start the engine.<br><br>Lance
               Cpl Tan Fu Ning drove off in a red car, with Lance Cpl Tan Yong Cheng 
              as passenger. They were followed by Pte Tan in the silver car – with 
              Lance Cpl Tan Choon Siang as passenger – and 3rd Sgt Chiam in a blue 
              car.<br><br>During the 15-minute joyride, Pte Tan tried to overtake Lance Cpl Tan Fu Ning but their cars collided.<br><br><strong>Conceal damage</strong><br><br>To conceal the damage, they parked the cars in an obscure area of the berth near the car yard.<br><br>Later,
               Pte Tan and the three lance corporals moved two blue cars in front of 
              the red and silver cars to hide the damage from plain view.<br><br>At 
              10pm, after 3rd Sgt Chiam and Lance Cpl Tan Choon Siang returned to the 
              sleeping quarters, the other three men decided to go for another 
              joyride.<br><br>This time, Lance Cpl Tan Yong Cheng and Pte Tan drove 
              the two blue cars that had been used to hide the damaged cars. Lance Cpl
               Tan Fu Ning rode with Lance Cpl Tan Yong Cheng as he had offered to 
              teach the latter how to drive.<br><br>For the next 15 minutes, the three men zipped around the wharves, taking the route they had used the first time.<br><br>When
               they returned to the car yard, Lance Cpl Tan Fu Ning took over the 
              wheel as Lance Cpl Tan Yong Cheng was not confident about parking the 
              car.<br><br>Barely 15 minutes later, the trio went for a third spin. 
              Lance Cpl Tan Fu Ning and Lance Cpl Tan Yong Cheng each took the blue 
              cars they had driven earlier while Pte Tan took a dark-coloured car.<br><br>They
               drove for about 15 minutes. Then, while making a turn, Lance Cpl Tan 
              Yong Cheng drove his car into a drain, causing a front tyre to be stuck.
               Pte Tan managed to free the car and drove it to the car yard.<br><br>But
               their joyrides didn’t go unnoticed. An employee at the wharves saw them
               and reported the matter to the auxiliary police, who inspected the 
              cars.<br><br>The next day, the supervisor in charge of the five cars 
              noticed that they were damaged and not properly aligned. He raised the 
              matter with PSA.<br><br>During a probe by SAF’s Special Investigation 
              Branch, two lance corporals said they had seen the five men driving the 
              cars and they had been told by 3rd Sgt Chiam not to report the matter.<br><br>Two
               other lance corporals who were on sentry duty in the area that night 
              said 3rd Sgt Chiam had told them to say that they had been on duty 
              elsewhere if they were questioned.<br><br>They added that they felt 
              pressured to listen to the sergeant as he was their superior and feared 
              that he would make their lives difficult if they told the truth.<br><br>In
               passing sentence, the three-person GCM panel noted that three of the 
              servicemen “took turns behind the wheel for joyrides and races, treating
               the Sembawang Wharves as their private race ‘circuit’ even though none 
              of them were licensed to drive”.<br><br>Unsurprisingly, the group ended up damaging the cars during their “brazen escapade”.<br><br>The
               panel viewed 3rd Sgt Chiam as the ringleader and deserved the heaviest 
              sentence of 15 months’ detention. Pte Tan received the second heaviest 
              sentence of 12 months’ detention.<br><br>This was also due to their 
              involvement in another incident at Maju Camp on Oct 28 last year for 
              which they were convicted on other charges, including riding without a 
              valid motorcycle licence and theft of a motorcycle. <br><br>Mr Gerard 
              Ee, former president of the Automobile Association of Singapore, said 
              brand new cars shipped out from factories usually have some petrol in 
              them.<br><br>He said: “They would have some fuel because they have to be
               driven from the factories to the ship and there’s a whole team of 
              drivers to drive these cars from the ship.”</p>

              <p>Basically, their charges were:</p>
              <p>1. Multiple vehicle theft</p>
              <p>2. Driving without licence</p>
              <p>3. Driving without insurance</p>
              <p>4. Dereliction of duty</p>
              <p>What made it all the more worse was that it was done out in public, they were witnessed by civillians, and it involved non-SAF equipment.</p>
              <p>At least if this was all done in camp, and they had crashed a couple of SAF Land Rovers or something, their CO could just pack them to DB for a couple of months and write off the repairs or something. But out in public? Their backsides would certainly be buttered good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All in all, 12 to 15 months of DB for the top two ringleaders is already very light.</p>
              <p>If they want to tempt fate by appealing, then that's their choice. If they're already stupid enough to clown about like this, then I guess they can be stupid enough to risk having their sentences increased by appealing.</p>
