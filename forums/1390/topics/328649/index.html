              <p><span id="lblContent">A STOMPer alerted us to this blog entry, where a
              blogger wrote about a wife who wants to petition against the new SAF
              uniform... because her hubby won't look sexy anymore.<br> <br> Wrote the blogger, who didn't name the female party:<br> <br> "The wife of a regular officer wants to petition against the change in army uniform because she don’t find it sexy.<br> <br> <em>Dear all, I’m an army wife and my husband is a SAF regular army officer.<br> <br> One of the many primary reasons I married my husband is because of his
              dashing uniform. We were fixed up by someone we knew mutually and had
              many email conversations over a month before we met. He sent me a
              picture of him in his no.4 uniform and immediately, I fell in love with
              the way he looks in it (i didn’t say i fell for him immediately). I
              felt myself swooning.<br> <br> When we began dating, he invited me once to a parade in his camp and
              when I saw him in person in his no.4 uniform, I was sure and told
              myself I will make this man my husband. The whole get-up made my knees
              weak. On our wedding, he wore his no.1.<br> <br> Anyway, I was horrified to find out that SAF was going to change the
              no. 4 uniform. What was worse is that the new uniform is unspeakably
              ugly. It looks like pyjamas and the camo print is hideous. The colours
              are gross too, with a lot of brown, very weird, looks like crap. The
              colors of the current one are perfect and manly. And the camo print of
              this current one is perfect too. The cut, lapels, badges, collar,
              cutting are perfect.<br> <br> I don’t understand why they would change such a nice and flattering
              uniform. The current SAF army no.4 is the nicest and smartest and
              manliest army combat uniform throughout all the armies in the world.<br> <br> I would like to ask if wives are asked for their opinions before this
              change was decided? Who decided this? As wives of our regular soldiers,
              we are in close contact with the uniforms as much as the soldiers are.
              And it is also a large part of our lives.<br> <br> I fell for my husband because of the dashing and manly no.4 uniform.
              Many many other army wives believe that uniform is extremely flattering
              and sexy.<br> <br> Can we seek some explanation or redress in some way? :( "</em></span></p>
