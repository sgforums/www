              <p>Remember, Please seek your own chain of command to address your issues and not your MPs!</p>
              <p>SAF servicemen can seek redress through the chain of command on all matters arising from his military service and on all matters concerning the SAF, said Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Mr Teo Chee Hean in the second session of the Eleventh Parliament of Singapore.</p>
              <p>If the serviceman is dissatisfied with the action taken by his commanders or the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) department involved, he can raise the issue through the chain of command to the Armed Forces Council, which is chaired by the Minister for Defence.</p>
              <p>Mr Teo was responding to a query on whether MINDEF prohibits full-time national servicemen or regular servicemen from seeking assistance from their Members of Parliament to submit petitions on their behalf to the Ministry.<br> <br>Mr Teo added that these proper prodecures - set out in the General Orders of MINDEF - need to be adhered to in a military organisation, in order to maintain discipline, uphold morale, and protect confidential information.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, SAF servicemen, like their fellow Singaporeans, are free to approach their Members of Parliament for assistance on their personal matters. However, when it concerns matters related to the SAF or their service in the SAF, they should take them up through their chain of command.</p>
              <p>When a Member of Parliament sends a petition on behalf of the serviceman on matters pertaining to the SAF, the SAF will conduct a thorough investigation and, depending on the outcome of the investigation, take appropriate action to address the serviceman's concerns. This includes advising the serviceman to go through the proper channels through which he could seek redress.</p>
