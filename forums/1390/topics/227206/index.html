I wish to offer some balance to the discussion. You need both kind of people to work in the organisation and perharps a more intellectual kind of approach would be more appropriate for senior management in the SAF. The reality is that modern warfighting demands a high level of intellect at a macro level. Things like operations research, planning sustainability requirement, the conceptualising and implementation of a network centric warfighting strategy are not things that Sandhurst or West Point would teach. You need creative leaders in this time of changes, people who are not afraid to challenge the status quo and able to find relations and applications for the SAF among the frantic developments outside the SAF. This may be a general statement but what would be more conducive to incubating such traits? The wild and bohemian nature of the MIT campus or the strict regimental nature of West Point? I am not disdaining the training one gets at Sandhurst or West Point. They are fulfilling what they do best - the training of junior leaders capable of leading their platoons and companies on the battlefield. However, to be in senior management demands much more rigourous intellectual training.....The SAF can teach you platoon and company warfighhting but finds it much more difficult to train the strategic and inquisitive thinkers that the SAF needs ...</div>

But then again, SOPs and other rules exist for a reason. Frankly, in the Military, creativity is bound to the confines of such rules. And yes, I do agree that all organizations should have room for challenging the status quo, but ask yourself this, would you like someone to challenge status quo when you have to lead a platoon to take a hill or a company to clear a city block? Creativity is good, but we have to also be realistic about the limits to which it can happen. Not against creativity but I do believe that Sandhurst, West Point cadets are schooled to think out of the box but within the bounds of military SOPs and Rules of Engagement etc.</div>

But then again, SOPs and other rules exist for a reason. Frankly, in the Military, creativity is bound to the confines of such rules. And yes, I do agree that all organizations should have room for challenging the status quo, but ask yourself this, would you like someone to challenge status quo when you have to lead a platoon to take a hill or a company to clear a city block? Creativity is good, but we have to also be realistic about the limits to which it can happen. Not against creativity but I do believe that Sandhurst, West Point cadets are schooled to think out of the box but within the bounds of military SOPs and Rules of Engagement etc.</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> so we need both then. Some officers who are educated at Oxbridge and the Ivies as well as some leaders who are educated at the West Points and Naval Academies. Thinkers to conceptualised and to plan, Warriors to lead and to fight. Neither one is better than the other but both need each other to achieve the synergy for the SAF. Anyway, how are SOPs and Rules of Engagement promulgated in the first place? They do not pop out of a vacuum.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

I wish to offer some balance to the discussion. You need both kind of people to work in the organisation and perharps a more intellectual kind of approach would be more appropriate for senior management in the SAF. The reality is that modern warfighting demands a high level of intellect at a macro level. Things like operations research, planning sustainability requirement, the conceptualising and implementation of a network centric warfighting strategy are not things that Sandhurst or West Point would teach. You need creative leaders in this time of changes, people who are not afraid to challenge the status quo and able to find relations and applications for the SAF among the frantic developments outside the SAF. This may be a general statement but what would be more conducive to incubating such traits? The wild and bohemian nature of the MIT campus or the strict regimental nature of West Point? I am not disdaining the training one gets at Sandhurst or West Point. They are fulfilling what they do best - the training of junior leaders capable of leading their platoons and companies on the battlefield. However, to be in senior management demands much more rigourous intellectual training.....The SAF can teach you platoon and company warfighhting but finds it much more difficult to train the strategic and inquisitive thinkers that the SAF needs ...</div></blockquote>agreed and very insightful balance to this discussion.<br>I'm not putting down scholars with SAFOS or SAF SMS. In fact, I agree they should be holding key appointments in ops planning and future ops planning.<br>However, due to the inherent career path in the SAF, some mil college trained officers may not get a good career path. And thus why some good officers stay away from going to a mil school... because the chances, realistically speaking, are not as good as going to top universities worldwide under the more prestigious SAFOS or SMS.<br><br>Bottom line is I am for having Oxbridge or Ivy league scholars, for they too will wear green ( or blue or navy) and contribute to SAF, in their own capacity.<br><br>merry christmas<br></div>
