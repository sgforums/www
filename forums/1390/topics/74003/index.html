            <div class='col-md body'>Memories with my 1st wife:<br><br>Just finished my BMT, so here is my experience with my 1st wife...<br><br>Saw her sitting on the shelf along with others waiting for their husbands to arrive at the marriage agency (armskote). Took two of the girls out for inspection for STDs by the armskoteman (I thought they looked for doctors?)<br><br>She looked... special. (But then again, so did all other girls). Anyway, the next day, we were told that they have successfully matched us guys with the girls (so efficient). So I was to memorise her house number (butt number), and her telephone number. To make sure we had a happy date, the forces that be conducted surprise tests, which resulted in many needing blood pumped in their head...<br><br>It was the day of the marriage (read: Rifle Night). I happened to be on Attend C. She was left alone at the marriage agency, sobbing, crying for me. When I booked in later, and passed by the window display, her figure was a contrasted with the empty shelfs around her. Shit, she is the only one left on the shelf...<br><br>The next day, we were to take the wives out for a bath. My friend asked me to safe-guard his wife while he took a leak. My wife protested by threatening to chop off my hand with her formidable teeth... (Hell, women can be vicious!)<br><br>Field camp: Hugging her to sleep was a cumbersome task for me. Her bulk made it difficult to breathe and keep her safe to me. I ended up placing her between my legs, and giving me an unintended arousal... ... ... ... ... On the 6th night, while sleeping in a shell-scrape, I was too tired to satisfy her desires, and left her out cold. She was picked up by the police, who then gave me hell the next day, for "abandoning my wife". Oh well, weekend burnt...<br><br>It was during live range where I found her true nature laid. She was a tiger, roaring, and spitting fire at a high rage. (won't want to get into an argument with her; I think I will lose). Not bad, she managed to spit out 25 figures out of 32.<br><br>The final day was the worst. By some weird will, I was to be divorced (forcefully) of my wife. I had grown attached to her, and cleaning her was almost second nature to me... But when I knew that when I throw her down on the ground after the march past, it would be the last time I will be holding her. It is with some regret that I placed her gently on the ground.<br><br>OH, MY WIFE!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Disclaimer: This is a piece written by a lunatic who has (by some obscene chance) happened to be a loving husband. Please refer all questions to this forum.... (Does BMT drive people nuts?????)</div>

I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me.

We will hit...<br><br>My rifle is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its barrel.
