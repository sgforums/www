            <div class='col-md body'>Moxie's right - it's the bulk of the 84, rather than its weight, that's a pain in the arse.  At one point while charging up a hill in an exercise, we ended up throwing the damned things, running a few steps, picking them up and throwing them again.

BY RIGHT, as a support weapon, the 84 should be deployed at a firebase position, and not chiong up the hill with the rest of the main force. so any form or manner of "chiong" they do is usually limited to "chiong-ing" up the firebase position - clearing the place and all, before setting up. but usually that is done with ample time, and with the help of a security force attached.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree the weight of the 84mm (and for discussion sake also, the GPMG) is not that bad. It is the awkward shape and length and the protrusions from the weapon that make you confused as to how best to carry it on the march.<br><br>Frankly, I think infantry units should change to the disposable bunker busting launchers , I think there are a few types that carry an explosive charge bigger than the LAW. Afterall, the 84 mm is nowadays mostly employed against hardened shelters and softer armoured vehicles.  A soldier can carry 3 or 4 disposable launchers on a " H" frame on his back. His assistant can carry the same which will already be a good mission load.<br><br>The commander / officer who makes the 84mm section charge up an objective during an attack,  is tactically unsound, unless he wants to "train" up the troops. The only time I can think of when you want the 84mm to quickly marry-up with the rest of the company is at "Re-org !". Anyway, I was only an infantry PL sgt, so any company OCs here,  plse correct my understanding.</div>

Basically, it is a section or platoon size force tasked to engage enemy reinforcements trying to reach the area of engagement, or like what the Americans are doing in Fallujah now, to engage enemy forces retreating from the area of engagement.  Usually the support platoon will detach some elements including 84 or GPMG team , depending whether the attacking force can spare them , and together with some "lobo" infantry, they will form the block force detachment.<br><br>There are bigger disposable missiles than the LAW (which is obsolete)...  late Vietnam war era.
