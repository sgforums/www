            <div class='col-md body'>I say those ncc kids should stop wearing camouflage. Give them something like temasek green uniforms instead. They have no idea what serving the nation is all about. They think that marching around under the hot sun and doing leopard crawls is equivalent to the sacrifice real SAF personnel give toward defending the nation. They think they are all ready to fight and as well-trained as combat troops are. (Words from ex-classmate of mine.)<br><br>They have no idea what it feels like to freeze in under 0 degrees temperatures or bake in near 40 degrees for several days straight and still have to do your duties right. They don't yet know what it's like to endure these extreme climates, sleep 3 to 4 hours each night and still expected to do do your jobs right. I know because I have and so do most of us who have been overseas for training.<br><br>True the boys will eventually serve but until then, they are NOT serving. It's sad when kids do really dumb stuff like falling in right in front of MRT stations one fine morning! I saw with my own eyes how the ncc kids from Naval Base Sec did that at Khatib MRT! Their commanders (kids as well) were shouting around like they owned the place. And I was wearing my no4! Imagine how ashamed I felt. They have completely disgraced our uniforms.<br><br>Or another time on a train, when a ncc SSG in uniform, was bragging (obviously lying) about how he reprimanded an NSF Corporal in public because he felt the CPL looked sloppy?<br><br>What the hell are these kids thinking???<br><br></div>

Give them something like temasek green uniforms instead. They have no idea what serving the nation is all about. They think that marching around under the hot sun and doing leopard crawls is equivalent to the sacrifice real SAF personnel give toward defending the nation. They think they are all ready to fight and as well-trained as combat troops are. (Words from ex-classmate of mine.)<br><br>They have no idea what it feels like to freeze in under 0 degrees temperatures or bake in near 40 degrees for several days straight and still have to do your duties right. They don't yet know what it's like to endure these extreme climates, sleep 3 to 4 hours each night and still expected to do do your jobs right. I know because I have and so do most of us who have been overseas for training.<br><br>True the boys will eventually serve but until then, they are NOT serving. It's sad when kids do really dumb stuff like falling in right in front of MRT stations one fine morning! I saw with my own eyes how the ncc kids from Naval Base Sec did that at Khatib MRT! Their commanders (kids as well) were shouting around like they owned the place. And I was wearing my no4! Imagine how ashamed I felt. They have completely disgraced our uniforms.<br><br>Or another time on a train, when a ncc SSG in uniform, was bragging (obviously lying) about how he reprimanded an NSF Corporal in public because he felt the CPL looked sloppy?<br><br>What the hell are these kids thinking???<br><br></div></blockquote>haiz... nv ending shit... another good SAF soldier<br>onli ppl who dunno anything abt ncc will keep comparing btw the 2 n keep criticising the poor CCA organisation n feel sad tt their beloved no.4 is being abused by these children, n worry abt how foreigners n aunties dunno how to differentiate (n wat will they do? complain to mindef?).<br><br>if the 350000 or so SAF soldiers haf died in a war (shld it happen), den u haf to pin ur hopes on these children to save ur womenfolk or other children while u r alrdy in heaven(or hell). at least they haf undergone technical handling n IFC traning. (hope it helps)<br><br>haha, those children at khatib mrt r realli overdoin things. but at least they bothered to "gather in a file" rather than be a crowd of rowdy disgrace. can complain to the sch. u can go over n tok to them, n they haf to greet u sir leh..<br><br>like i haf said, shld educate NSFs to differentiate btw SAF n NCC personnel in case they salute to a CLT (or get scolded by a SSG(NCC)) . even NSFs dunno how to differentiate, not to say foreigners n aunties.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, i'm a S/CLT from NCC.<br><br>I do not deny that a number of cadets from our side tend to think that wah, just because i put on an army uniform and do some basic army stuff, i must be respected as any other soldier. Most of us will never get to understand what a real NSF goes thru until BMT.<br><br>I also agree that a large number of cadets tend to put us in the wrong limelight like doing loads of stuff that obviously should not be done such as plaing LAN in No.4, or blasting MP3 in public areas. I make sure my own cadets do not behave in such ways.<br><br>But I refuse to be dismissed as a mere kid who should be denied the Singapore tag, or even the uniform, just because some bugger who went thru NS thinks he deserves respect for being put under lots of crap for 2 years, and later feels its a waste of time anyway.<br><br>In NCC, we do not train like NSF. Instead of digging trenches, we do paintball. Instead of doing proper camoflage, we try to stuff as much leaves in our pockets, hide somewhere and hope not to be seen. Instead of combat simulations using live ammo, we lay prone and fire 20 rounds once or twice our whole NCC time in few years.<br><br>But we learn to be leaders in our corps, just like officers and specs learn to be leaders of men(although what we learn definitely doesnt stack up to them). We learn not to complain when the going gets tough, just like recruits going thru their BMT. Most of all, we learn TO TAKE PRIDE IN OUR NATION, just like EVERY SINGLE NSF, NSMEN OR REGULAR IS EXPECTED TO.<br><br>Granted, what we do is a small fraction of the real SAF, and we may not deserve as much respect as SAF personnel do. But that does not mean we should be shunned as kids who know nuts about serving their nation, because contrary to what many believe, the things we do in a way still does contribute to the nation, albeit being limited to age-friendly activities. And we learn to love and respect, and serve the nation as much as any SAF personnel or even Singaporean should. I daresay, on a personal note, that even in my age, should Singapore go to war, I'll gladly drop my studies and volunteer for early service(I am of age for voulntary service), as I love and want to fight for it as much as any grown personnel would. Call me immature and naive if you will.<br><br>I do not have the Singapore tag on my uniform, but I would like to get it as soon as I can, because I take as much pride as any other SAF personnel serving Singapore in my own way. Do I deserve the tag? You be the judge.<br><br>P.S Some things for your clarification:<br><br>1) NCC cadets and cadet officers such as cadet lieutenants are lower in rank then any SAF personnel. Please do not salute any CLTs. Cadet officers can be differentiated from NCC Teacher Officers by the white stripe on their epaulettes.<br><br>2) I'm not sure what the instruction is for SAF personnel, but NCC cadets and cadet officers are to salute NCC officers.<br><br>3) With regards to personal bearing in public, NCC cadets are expected to follow the same guidelines as SAF personnel, and I believe that MPs can catch these cadets should they violate the guidelines.<br></div>
