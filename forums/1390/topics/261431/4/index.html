My reasoning is rather simple. I usually see one whole bunch o NCC recruits (you call them recruits or what?) hanging around shopping malls.<br><br>If they can hang around in a bunch of 10+ people, then isn't this about half the sixe of a normal NCC platoon (you call them platoon or what?) in the school where they come from?<br><br>Please correct me if I am wrong. I have assumed that a normal NCC unit in a normal secondary sch will consist of 20 odd teenagers.</div>
