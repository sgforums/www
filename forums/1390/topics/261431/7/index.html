There was once where we got knocked under our school clock tower during afternoon tekan session when we were late for fall in and the brick floor was dam hot, when we recover that time some of my platoonmates had skin peeling off from their palms. That time we really hated our PC but after that for a long period of time we made sure that we were punctual.<br><br>oh and our sch has PDS, we are performing in this year's ncc day parade in amoy quee camp. Haha quite fun coz we get to use the fireworks when we spin our rifles</div>

Normally, they are recommended by their PC to be in NCC as they are deemed not suitable for units as commanders or in schools as instructors.<br>So i won't be surprised that they gave all sorts of sadistic training or unreasonable punishments.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

If we adhere to the rules everyone would climb over the NCOs' heads. For part c cadets 1 mistake during uniform check already 15~20. Late 1 second 1 push-up( last time there was one time our PC dam pissed with us being late that 1 sec late 6 push-ups). In fact our school camp is far more shiong then in HQ. The recent spec course that i went to in HQ felt more like a holiday camp. In my school ncc camp changing parades of 5~6 times could be given, in nearly impossible timings ( e.g pt kit to no 4 in 3 mins, and that was when we were still in part as). After every changing late how many sec then pump how many times. Worse still some of the bunks were at the 3rd storey...<br><br>Anyway, I dont really care if we are wearing the singaproe tag or not, because from what i see, most of our young men dosen't seem to have much pride in our army anyway...<br><br>P.S lol we are going off-topic... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>You wana know why Camps are slack in HQ now? Its because of the rules passed down. Thats why the CLTS dont dare do anything to the kids.<br><br>Once they could even book out every night.</div>
