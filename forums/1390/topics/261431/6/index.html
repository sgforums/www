For part c cadets 1 mistake during uniform check already 15~20. Late 1 second 1 push-up( last time there was one time our PC dam pissed with us being late that 1 sec late 6 push-ups). In fact our school camp is far more shiong then in HQ. The recent spec course that i went to in HQ felt more like a holiday camp. In my school ncc camp changing parades of 5~6 times could be given, in nearly impossible timings ( e.g pt kit to no 4 in 3 mins, and that was when we were still in part as). After every changing late how many sec then pump how many times. Worse still some of the bunks were at the 3rd storey...<br><br>Anyway, I dont really care if we are wearing the singaproe tag or not, because from what i see, most of our young men dosen't seem to have much pride in our army anyway...<br><br>P.S lol we are going off-topic... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
