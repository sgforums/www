However, objectively speaking and all things being equal, there were two key errors of judgement that cost your brother dearly.  The first was that he overreacted to the situation.  Dehydration is not an emergency, and even if the team was out of water, Brunei is not a difficult place in which to find water.<br><br>The second is that he made the misjudgement of taking the car - that was an error on three levels.  First, he assumed that the car was abandoned - this was a failure on his instructors' part because they should have instructed your brother better about the circumstances in Brunei.  The SAF trains there upon the goodwill of the people of Brunei, and as outsiders, SAF personnel must have respect for property there in order to maintain the goodwill.  Second, your brother would already have seen that the people in the jungle are not rich - there is no reason that they would abandon a working vehicle, and in rural areas people are not as security-conscious as in urban areas, so finding cars unlocked is not unusual.  Third, in any situation, a vehicle is not an insignificant piece of property, and as an officer cadet your brother was expected to have the sense to understand the implicatons of taking it without permission - the taking of such a piece of property would unquestionably be a chargable offence.<br><br>I sympathise with your brother's situation, but ultimately the penalty is pretty difficult to argue against.  In his position, the one person I'd have a real problem with is the guy who got dehydrated because there's no reason for him to have gotten himself into such a state.<br><br>This may sound harsh, but from experience I'd say that Brunei's a very comfortable environment if you take care of yourself, and that kind of trouble is entirely avoidable.  It's each man's responsibility to ensure that he doesn't create trouble for his mates.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This story sounds very familiar.  My opinion on the matter is the same as the first time I heard it.<br><br>Fact: That a theft indeed did occur.<br><br>There is little else that can be said about it.  It doesn't matter whether your brother THOUGHT it was abandoned or not.  He took something that does not belong to him.  And it turned out that the owner saw him, and caught him.<br><br>What you THINK cannot justify your actions.  Otherwise, I could intentionally murder an innocent man, and justify my actions by saying, "I THOUGHT the man was a terrorist trying to kill me."<br><br>Common sense also dictates that a working car with fuel definitely belongs to someone.  Your brother cannot simply take possession of other people's property without asking.  This is not even allowed in War, unless the Emergency Powers are invoked.<br><br>True, your brother may have THOUGHT it was a life-threatening emergency. But whether he stole the car really out of good faith in response to an emergency is difficult to prove.  Especially so when the emergency did not seem so life threatening after evaluation.<br><br>Unfortunate matter, but its time to let go.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gotta' agreed with Ged. on his viewpoints<br><br>back in 01' when I was in brunei, a guy in my section were showing symptoms of heat disorder (pale, body cramps) while we were taking a rest in the jungle...<br><br>we unbuttoned his shirt and sprinkled water on him but that didn't help. Seeing his cramps got worst, we decided to comms HQ informing them of the situation.<br><br>Luckily our rest point weren't too far off ZEBU, so HQ despatched a CASEVAC party to rendevous with us to extract that guy.</div>
