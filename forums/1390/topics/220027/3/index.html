            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyah, try to see the entire SAF more of a machine then some system with compassion and you will feel a lot better about getting caught in the cogs from no fault of your own.<br><br>But I'm sure we all had our suck-thumb experiences. Mine happened when I was in SISPEC, we were doing topo and going rather well when one of our detail members lost a radio antenna. The joker behind him wasn't doing his job in noticing stuff that he dropped... but how he lost it is still a mystery. After that no morale liao, but still completed that test anyway.<br><br>The OC unfortunatley, was one of those kind of emperors that not only kill those responsible, but also their family and friends. Thought the other half of us were not directly responsible for the loss (and by virtue of our appointments as front scout and navigator) we still all kenna killed by him, ended up taking two confinement plus 1206 pay cut for the antenna for something we couldn't have prevented unless we were psychic.<br><br>But you know the SAF, how they like to cover all bases. I guess we could have cut our losses by insisting that the loss was not our fault (being new to the SAF and stuck on Tekong, weekends were VERY important), but we decided to stick it out with the joker lost the thing, must be some twisted platoon ethos at work.<br><br>Anyway that incident (on top of others) totally killed my passion for the SAF. Some people are go-getters, they believe in getting rank for personal achievement in the SAF and hence they might take this pretty well. But for me I came in with the naive idea that I would happily be my best for the system defending the nation, but that incident pretty much destroyed that motivation and I started to slack off in like any wiser NSF.<br><br>I guess that made me into that Infantry Specialist who was always finding ways around the rulebook and slipping unoffical "cheat" tips to the recruits under me in BMTC to more TRULY prepare them for army life... as opposed to much of the wayang recruits often learn in Tekong.<br><br>But oh well, that time is over.

If it was in a dry area like Kanchanaburi, maybe, but there's just too much available water in Brunei for there to have been a problem.  Besides, it's hard to imagine everyone going completely dry during a navex.<br><br>As for the vehicle, hell, when I was a kid I made the mistake of taking a bike that was leaning against a tree in Punggol.  As it turns out it wasn't abandoned, and people in the area were simply not used to having to lock everything up.  The case would be even more applicable in Brunei, and in any case, the rule of good tactical sense is to leave things alone and leave no trace.  I expect that the dead livestock would have been the real clincher, though.</div>

I suppose I'll have to be blunt here.<br><br>As someone who's not only done LRRP tours in Brunei but have firsthand experience with a range of heat injuries up to heat exhaustion, I find your brother's platoon mate's claim of dehydration highly unlikely to the point where I'd say point blank that the bugger was malingering.<br><br>Let me put it to you this way.  On a 35 km route march, my section commander noticed that I was weaving about and showing the signs of dehydration and got about half a bottle of water into me immediately - I managed to complete the remaining 6 km at forced march pace.  If a simple, timely remedy like that could work so effectively, I don't buy for a minute that your brother's platoon mate was ever in any danger at all.<br><br>Note that I'm not saying anything about your brother's decision - it's most likely that he got conned by his platoon mate who just wanted to keng, and it's a crying shame that malingerers like that can get commissioned as officers.</div>

We even saw local kids running around with SAF Long 4, if you want to get an idea of how some soldiers are desperate enough to reduce their load.<br><br>It's not unknown for some daring soldiers to try getting a faster means of transport by making arrangments with the locals to hitch a ride. And did end up harbouring <span style="font-style: italic;">in</span> the dewllings of the locals and getting cosy with them.<br><br>So a joyride does not sound strange to me at all, a lot of stranger things have been done by NSFs.

No one simply abandons a car with the keys and all in a drivable condition in the middle of nowhere. Your brother should have radioed for help and attempted to manage the person's condition... assuming he was telling the truth to begin with.
