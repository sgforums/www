              <p>after medical checkup doesn't really meant you cannot defer. I had a friend who's during in ITE went for medical checkup and was supposedly going for enlistment oready but he got into laselle in august this year and his enlistment is deferred. but what ever it is, be sure to ask your school to do a deferment letter for you as you are going for NS.</p>
              <p>but thats just what I know, thats just my 2 cents...</p>
