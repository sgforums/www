              <p>Hey man...let us put it this way,a dead person can't argue back.They can claim a bazillion and one things during their investigation,even if its an SOP fault,they will isse a gag order,and things will just go on.Personally,just my 2 cents...I feel that SAF owe's nick's parents a full account of what happened,the truth,no holds barred.</p>
              <p>Lastly,treat every accident however minor as a lesson,do not take near-misses as nothing big for they will grow into something big in time to come.Be safe.</p>

              <p>According to my transport spec friend, vehicles are sent to Seletar camp for corrosion protection and not repairs so there shouldn't be problems with the brakes. For a vehicle to roll back, its most likely no wheelchoke was used since if there was a wheelchoke, the vehicle won't be able to roll back that easily and even if it does, there should be ample time to notice and get out of the way.</p>

              <p><strong>SAF jeep driver arrested</strong></p>
              <p>A 19-YEAR-OLD full-time National Serviceman has been arrested in
              connection with the death of Second Lieutenant Nicholas Chan Wei Kit.</p>
              <p>It is believed that he is the driver of the Land Rover that killed 2LT Chan at Seletar Camp last Friday.</p>
              <p>The 21-year-old officer was pinned under the vehicle after it rolled backward and hit him while he was inspecting it.</p>
              <p>A recovery vehicle was dispatched, though Mindef would not say how long after the incident, to lift the vehicle off him.</p>
              <p>But he later died of his injuries in hospital.</p>
              <p>Details surrounding 2LT Chan's death remain hazy, such as whether
              the handbrake had been applied or wheelchocks put in place at the
              wheels to prevent the vehicle from moving accidentally.</p>
              <p>The 19-year-old, who is out on bail, was taken in by the police for
              causing death through a rash act. He is currently assisting police in
              the investigations.</p>

              <p><strong>SAF jeep driver arrested</strong></p>
              <p>A 19-YEAR-OLD full-time National Serviceman has been arrested in connection with the death of Second Lieutenant Nicholas Chan Wei Kit.</p>
              <p>It is believed that he is the driver of the Land Rover that killed 2LT Chan at Seletar Camp last Friday.</p>
              <p>The 21-year-old officer was pinned under the vehicle after it rolled backward and hit him while he was inspecting it.</p>
              <p>A recovery vehicle was dispatched, though Mindef would not say how long after the incident, to lift the vehicle off him.</p>
              <p>But he later died of his injuries in hospital.</p>
              <p>Details surrounding 2LT Chan's death remain hazy, such as whether the handbrake had been applied or wheelchocks put in place at the wheels to prevent the vehicle from moving accidentally.</p>
              <p>The 19-year-old, who is out on bail, was taken in by the police for causing death through a rash act. He is currently assisting police in the investigations.</p>

              <p>maybe that guy was merely sitting in the land rover and didn't even touch anything in the jeep? maybe the rover just rolled off the slope itself.</p>
              <p>in any case, we can be sure this guy is gonna be screwed badly by MINDEF for "killing" officer.</p>
              <p>i feel sad for this 2LT, but i feel even sadder for this guy who got arrested.</p>
              <p>suppose he's really innocent, what will happen to his future and family??!?!!</p>
              <p>just because he was forced into conscription, he's now also having to eat severe punishment?!</p>
              <p>i feel sad for him. i think MINDEF will let him eat at least 5 - 20 years of DB / civilian jail.</p>
