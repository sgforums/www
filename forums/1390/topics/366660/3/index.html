              <p>Let's say if a recruit accidentally misfire a live round, killed his friend and as a result, is sentenced to DB for a few years, is it justified?</p>
              <p>You may argue that the person who got into DB doesn't deserve it since he was forced into conscription in the first place. But then again, the person who died was forced into conscription too, and he too, don't deserve to die just because he's serving the nation.</p>
              <p>No matter where you are, outside world or in the SAF, if your mistake or neligence caused a major lost to someone else, you will have to answer for it.</p>

It's impossible that the driver was not aware that the vehicle rolled back and onto someone's body.

              <p>The legislation and nature of the country, are independent of its politics. The judiciary, armed forces and other non political attributes of the government are non-partisan. That's why the judiciary can prosecute a politician. And the armed forces can oust a political party. Even if tomorrow an opposition party overthrows the incumbent, the nature of the country and need for conscription remain the same. You have confused politicking, which is about party politics and running for office and voting, with many non-partisan attributes of the country which include defence, public policy and legislation. If you're smart enough, you'll know what I mean.</p>

              <p>your entire first paragaph is totally groundless and un-necessary since people who never serve NS before have no right to post such crap. u want us to listen to you, u go serve 2 years of NS in NSF rank-and-file position. then we can talk. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>seriously, who are u to tell us what to do? u keep telling people to leave SG? what for? so that more foreigners will replace us locals? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>and btw, there's a possibility that the guy is innocent; we never know.</p>
              <p>for goodness sake, stop venting your anger on the guys here.</p>
              <p>vent it on your hubby. i really pray and hope u two are getting on better terms now. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
              <p>get real, dude......no man with self-respecting pride would like to be forced into doing something he hates, and furthermore, it's 2 freaking years.</p>

              <p>The legislation and nature of the country, are independent of
                                          its politics. The judiciary, armed forces and other non political
                                          attributes of the government are non-partisan. That's why the
                                          judiciary can prosecute a politician. And the armed forces can oust
                                          a political party. Even if tomorrow an opposition party overthrows
                                          the incumbent, the nature of the country and need for conscription
                                          remain the same. You have confused politicking, which is about
                                          party politics and running for office and voting, with many
                                          non-partisan attributes of the country which include defence,
                                          public policy and legislation. If you're smart enough, you'll know
                                          what I mean.</p>

              <p>If you are going to support the right of an army to overthrow a political party, well, we can all see where this is going..left field to the realms of fantasy. </p>
              <p>Nikar7, if you have a gripe with TheMissus, take it to the PM. We already know what your views on your own behavior in war-time, you don't have to keep on harping about it here. This is a thread for condolences and reflection, not a debate on the ethical foundation of National Service.</p>
              <p>Please, everyone here have some respect for the deceased, whether or not you agree with the way things are carried out. It's called human decency not to bicker, flame and quarrel in such a circumstance.</p>
