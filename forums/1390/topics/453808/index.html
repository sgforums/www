              <p>There's been quite a few queries about MDES in this forum so let's start the ball rolling. Have cut and paste some of my replies from previous threads. Mod pls make sticky.</p>
              <p>Picture of MDES ranks here <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2009/oct/07oct09_fs.html">http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2009/oct/07oct09_fs.html</a></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span>Deputy Prime Minister and 
              Minister for Defence Teo Chee Hean announced the introduction of a new 
              scheme, called the Military Domain Experts Scheme (MDES) in May 2009.  The new scheme, together with enhancements to the existing 
              officers' and warrant officers' schemes, would allow the SAF to recruit,
               develop and retain able and committed people to build a strong, capable
               and dynamic 3rd Generation SAF.<br><br><strong>Key Features</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Military Experts</span>.
               The MDES is a uniformed scheme for SAF regulars, designed to allow 
              Military Experts (MEs) to develop deep expertise and specialisation in 
              key military domains like engineering and intelligence. These MEs can 
              enjoy a full career up to age 60. As military personnel, MEs will 
              continue to bear arms and be deployed in operational roles when 
              required.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rank Structure</span>. The MDES has an 8-rank 
              structure, from ME1 to ME8, to cater to different job levels and skill 
              requirements. There will be two main entry points at ME1 and ME4. ME1 is
               primarily for those holding diploma qualifications and below, while 
              university graduates may come in at ME4. Salaries for the MDES will be 
              competitive and benchmarked against similar jobs in the private sector. </span></p>
              <p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MDES Vocations and Route of Advancement</span>.
               The MDES vocations cover a wide spectrum of specialisation. Taking the 
              example of the Engineer vocation, MEs in the Air Force can specialise in
               fields such as Aircraft &amp; Weapons Systems and Airfield Operations; 
              MEs in the Army can specialise in Electronics, Armament and Automotive; 
              and MEs in the Navy can specialise in Naval Engineering and Naval Combat
               Systems.<br><br>The career progression of an ME is based on his degree 
              of expertise and work performance. For example, a diploma graduate 
              joining the MDES in the Engineer vocation will start off as an Assistant
               Engineer (ME1), as shown in Figure 3 below. Throughout his career, 
              there will be ample professional development opportunities to prepare 
              him for higher appointments. As a uniformed personnel, he will go 
              through various courses to attain leadership skills and military 
              knowledge which will enable him to operate with his other military 
              counterparts in the SAF as an integrated force. He will also attend 
              Domain Specialisation Courses to deepen his specialist knowledge. </span></p>
              <p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scholarships/Study Awards and Continuing Education</span>.
               There are numerous academic sponsorships and continuing education 
              opportunities from diploma to post-graduate studies for the MEs.<br><br>a.
               Personnel joining the MDES can look forward to a range of scholarships 
              and study awards to pursue academic courses locally and overseas.<br><br>b.
               MEs who have performed well and demonstrated potential can upgrade 
              themselves academically through a range of study awards, from 
              polytechnic diploma to post-graduate degrees. <br><br>The scheme is scheduled to take effect from 1 April 2010.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Q1. Is there an age limit to sign on under MDES?</strong></p>
              <p>A1. No.</p>
              <p><strong>Q2. Are MEs entitled to salute?</strong></p>
              <p>A2. Yes, for ME4(A) and above.</p>
              <p><strong>Q3. Do MEs go to OCS?</strong></p>
              <p>A3. Yes, for ME4.</p>
              <p>Strictly speaking, ME are neither officers nor WOSpecs in the
                                      sense. However, there is a corresponding rank for each of the ME
                                      grades, and ME4 and above receive the same protocol as commissioned
                                      officers.</p>
              <p><strong>Q4. So does Army Engineer build bridges, clear minefields, etc? </strong></p>
              <p>A4. The MDES Army Engineer is NOT a Combat Engineer (i.e. those in
                                      the 3_ SCE). The only similarity between these two vocations is the
                                      word 'Engineer' :P</p>
              <p>MDES Army Engineer refers to those under technicians /
                                      maintenance.</p>
              <p><strong>Q5. What is the equivalent non-MDES rank for each of the ME ranks?</strong></p>
              <p>A5. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces_ranks#Military_Domain_Experts_Scheme_ranks">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces_ranks#Military_Domain_Experts_Scheme_ranks</a></p>
              <p><strong>Q6. Do MEs go through a 'watered down' version of OCS?</strong></p>
              <p>A6. MDES training is by no means
                                      watered down. Unless you already went through at least BSLC in
                                      SISPEC or Foundation Term in SCS, you will go through the full
                                      Common Leadership Module and part of the Service Term at OCS. You
                                      will then go through the full Professional Term. The requirements
                                      to successfully complete the course are the same regardless of
                                      whether you are an OCT or ME4 Trainee.</p>
              <p><strong>Q7. Do MEs participate in Commissioning Parade?</strong></p>
              <p>A7. Fortunately or unfortunately depending on your point of view, there is no commissioning parade for ME4. Instead you have a
                                      Senior Military Experts Appointment Ceremony during which you
                                      receive your ceremonial sword from the Minister and your epulattes
                                      put on your uniform by your family members.</p>
              <p><strong>Q8. Do ME4 receive a ceremonial sword? Are they eligible to conduct a military wedding?</strong></p>
              <p>A8. Yes. In fact, you can get officers (of equivalent rank) to form your sword party as well.</p>
              <p><strong>Q9. ME will be grouped together as a wing and not
                                      together with other OCTs directly chosen from BMT right?</strong></p>
              <p>A9. No. MEs train together with the OCTs. The training regime,
                                      treatment, etc are all the same.</p>
              <p><strong>Q10. advisable to sign RSAF with a degree and be AFE or sign as other
                                      AFE like flight enginner with diploma then go uni study and they
                                      will promote you once you got a degree to ME4? </strong></p>
              <p>A10. There are two paths:</p>
              <p>1. Get a degree first and then sign on as an ME4. (It can also
                                      work in the way that you apply when you already have a place in the
                                      U... can apply for other cool stuff like MDES Study Award
                                      etc..)</p>
              <p>2. Get a diploma and sign on as an ME1. After getting a
                                      university placing, it is not guaranteed that SAF will sponsor your
                                      studies and it is also not guaranteed that you will be emplaced to
                                      ME4 once you have gotten your degree. You have to go through a
                                      process in order to qualify for emplacement.</p>
              <p>Compare the two and decide which one is better for you...</p>
              <p><em>Source: SAF Careers Centre</em></p>
              <p><strong>Q11. How is the MDEC course like? (For those who signed on as ME4)</strong></p>
              <p>A11. MDEC Course is for those who have a recognised university
                                      degree. They will be appointed as ME4 after the course.</p>
              <p>It depends on what kind of military experience one has prior to
                                      the course. For a fresh applicant, he/she will go for BMT followed
                                      by the MDEC (Phase 1) which consists of the OCS Service Term
                                      followed by specialised domain training. The total duration would
                                      be the same as the OCS course. During this time, he/she holds the
                                      rank of ME4 (Trainee), which is a thick white bar surmounted by the
                                      MDES insignia in white.</p>
              <p>Upon completion of MDEC (Phase 1), he/she will be promoted to
                                      ME4 (Apprentice), which is equivalent to 2LT and will wear a thick
                                      gold bar surmounted by the MDES insignia in gold.</p>
              <p>The next step will occur after the trainee returns from
                                      university studies. There will be a 4 week MDEC (Phase 2) after
                                      which the trainee will be promoted to ME4.</p>
              <p>Slight differences may occur between the services. Hope these
                                      information helps.</p>

              <p>A12. Haha! Not to worry, the training is progressive i.e. will start slow and progressively become more challenging. We have had personnel in their mid and even late 30s, so it can be done!</p>
              <p>A13. I think this question touches on how employable are ex-SAF regulars, MDES or non-MDES, after leaving the service. I can't really answer this question at the moment, although I would think that for MDES, we have technical knowledge and the skill set which will be an asset to employers.</p>
              <p>Maybe someone who was formerly from one of the MDES vocations can comment?</p>

              <p>TS: I am assuming that you are currently the MDES scheme?</p>
              <p>I went through some of the threads that you wrote about a year ago and would like to use it as a basis for some of my questions.</p>
              <p>1. Are there any MDES enlistees who are fresh graduates from universities? In particular, graduates from North American universities with a liberal arts degree? What I have been hearing thus far is that the overwhelming of people who signed on have engineering degrees.</p>
              <p>2. Are MDES considered to be on the combat or service side?</p>
              <p>3. I went through PES C BMT, and ORDed with PES C status. What are my options if we taking into account that I could possibly upgrade my PES status?</p>
              <p>Thanks in advance.</p>

              <p>i can help TS to answer this one in red first, since this thread is deserted for days.</p>
              <p>Combats remains in old rank system.</p>
              <p>Service side depending on nature of vocation, some under MDES scheme some are not.</p>
              <p>Engineering side by far and large all asslimated into MDES scheme.</p>
              <p>This is my perception of views towards MDES thru what i have known, those who know better are welcomed to correct me. Like LKY said , i stand corrected.</p>

              <p>i find this scheme very interesting, unlike the traditional way of signing-on. coz specialist and officers can switch over to this MDES. so let's say if i'm very interested to sign on as MDES after becoming spec/officer, there is still good rank, good pay. but sometimes before u sign on MDES we gotta look deeply into the scheme first.</p>
              <p>MDES is slightly different from the specialist and officer route. If u think u got what it takes to sign-on, whether as spec/officer or switch to MDES, then y not? Perform very well, ur peers look up to u in camp and outside camp, the members of the public even look up to u, fwwaaaah definitely worth the rank right? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>Furthermore, if u have background in Uniform Group (NCC), even better! Most probably u get the MDES rank, then can progress faster, or even better get study grant from Saf. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Hi sorry for the late reply.</p>
              <p>Yes I am currently under the MDES scheme.</p>
              <p>A1. Yes, we have fresh graduates from universities, mostly engineering degrees. For the university you have described, I think you can consider applying under the Intel vocation.. http://www.mindef.gov.sg/joint/io/  http://www.mindef.gov.sg/content/imindef/careers/job_opportunities/io/specialist.html</p>
              <p>A2. Service side.</p>
              <p>A3.Be prepared that you would have to go through Enhanced BMT, be selected for OCS on your own merit, and subsequently commence your MDES training at OCS.</p>
              <p>With regards to Jedimaestro_alsyafiq.91, background in UG does not mean faster progression in SAF. It just means you have an easier time adapting to the military life and regimentation.</p>
