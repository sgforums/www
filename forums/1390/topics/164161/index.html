After informing the authorities of his intention to return, he came home in April for a court hearing.<br><br>The hearing lasted 30 minutes but he had never been so nervous in his life. 'It was very, very nerve-wracking,' he said.<br><br>To his relief, he was asked only to pay a fine.<br><br>He claims that he cannot remember the amount.<br><br>Under the Enlistment Act, those who evade national service can be fined up to $5,000 or sent to jail for up to three years, or both.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Although Mr Tan became a British citizen in 1978, he was still a Singapore citizen when he failed to fulfil his NS duties, making him answerable for the offence in a Singapore court.</span><br><br>In 1994, The Straits Times quoted a lawyer who said that one of his clients, a 39-year-old French citizen, was arrested at the airport on arrival, fined and made to complete nine months of training.<br><br>Mr Tan, who has an elder sister, was studying at Anglo-Chinese School when he left Singapore to study at the Yehudi Menuhin School in Sussex. He was then 12 years old.<br><br>After he finished his course, he stayed on in England to study at the Royal College of Music instead of coming home to serve national service in 1977.<br><br>He said: 'When I was at the Royal College and I got my final call-up, I was just on the brink of starting a career. I thought about it and thought about it and realised that I was not going to get this chance again.<br><br>'So I made that very difficult decision to not return. It meant I could never come back.'<br><br>Mr Tan first made his mark in the classical world with his performances on the 19th-century fortepiano, the precursor to the modern concert grand.<br><br>In the 1980s and 1990s, he produced a series of recordings that popularised the early music movement, regarded as a slightly eccentric niche within the music world.<br><br>He has about 30 recordings to his name and a regular touring schedule in Europe.<br><br>Along with Seow Yit Kin and Margaret Leng Tan, he has helped Singapore to gain recognition on the global piano scene.<br><br>The pianist is wasting no time in reconnecting with the Singapore music scene.<br><br>He goes back to England tomorrow, but will return early next month to sit on the jury of the National Arts Council's biennial National Piano and Violin Competition, which starts Dec 7 and ends Dec 18.<br><br>He said that he is getting to know Singapore, which he describes as 'unrecognisable', all over again. And, of course, he has been feasting on his favourite foods such as popiah.<br><br>But the best part about being able to come home as a free man was showing up at his mother's 80th birthday party on Thursday.<br><br>His parents still live in his childhood home in Lengkok Angsa, off Paterson Road. 'There were a few tears,' he said. 'She was just delighted. It was the best birthday present she's ever had.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1stly, he's 49 liao. How petty u people want to be?<br><br>2ndly,<br><br>"After he finished his course, he stayed on in England to study at the Royal College of Music instead of coming home to serve national service in 1977.<br><br>He said: 'When I was at the Royal College and I got my final call-up, I was just on the brink of starting a career. I thought about it and thought about it and realised that I was not going to get this chance again."<br><br>this is true. perhaps for u people aiming for a 'normal' career, u can afford to start a few years later. but for a career such as this, this sort of chances don't come twice. even a break in practicing can mean ruin. U can say he can explain to the people and put it on hold etc, but the fact is the world doesn't wait for u just because u are singaporean. I personally am very glad he choose to follow music instead of coming back and ending up as some small-fry musician in singapore for the rest of his life. If we want singaporeans to achieve great things, then some of them must be given leeway.<br><br>In any case, u can make noise u can say not fair, fine. Understandable considering u all have served etc, but u should stand in his shoes n try to understand the sort of choice he had to make back then.</div>
