Nobody in his right mind would want to waste their youth sitting in a jail cell. So if there wasn't the risk of a jail sentence sitting over his head, I'd say he would have returned to serve. As it is, it was the 70s, things were even more draconian and inflexible then. So circumstances being what they were, what happened happened.</div>
