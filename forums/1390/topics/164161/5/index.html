            <div class='col-md body'>On radio 93.8FM today an ex SAF manpower officer called in and said that under the enlistment act, any defaulter who did not register for NS can be fined up to $5000 or jailed or both, but it is for the courts to decide the punishment.<br><br>IF the person has already registered, then he falls under the SAF act. And if found AWOL, also carried fines and possible jail terms. He didn't say clearly which was more harsh, the civilian law or the SAF legislation.<br><br>He also then said that if the person who did not register for NS is caught or surrendered himself, he would have to serve the remaning liability of his NS. For other ranks it is up to the age of 40, and for officers up to age 50.<br><br>In this pianist's case, he is already 49 and hence need not serve NS as he is beyond the age requirement<br><br>What this tells me is that I would advise my son not to serve NS. Don't register. Stay away from Singapore till he is 41 years old. In the meantime obtain a foreign citizenship, and when he is aged 41 he can return to Singapore, pay $5000 and get Singapore citizenship and still keep his foreign citizenship (in essence dual citizenship with no NS served!). Isn't that fantastic?<br><br>Very very good. We learn new things everyday.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Although 5k is a bit too light a punishment, you people have underestimated the hardships in a pianist's training.<br>There are a lot of grade 8 / diploma "pianists" (or wadeva instruments) around in singapore who no need practice a lot still good enough to show off to friends... Comparing to these people may give you an illusion that they training is enjoyment.<br>But to become on top of the world a pianist needs to play AT LEAST 5 hours per day, plus listening may hours to other pianists play.<br>EVERYDAY.<br>Such is the meaning of WORLD CLASS, and this applies not only to musicians but also sportsmen or any other fields where it takes hours of practice everday.<br>If you think one can depend on talent to be world class, or after 2 years still can catch up with practicing, then you have not tried any training that is required to be the best in the world, be it in music or sports or wadeva stuff that needs NON-STOP practice. In fact there are countless sportsmen/musicians who try as hard but still fail to achieve such rarefield level, which is why I sympathize with those who tried but do not get recognition. And also those who do but still kena suan by ppl.<br>These training are no less though than many NSF's training. Many NSF spend time sleeping in bunks anyway. Moreover, if he is to spend 2 years in SAF, even if he is to get an 8-5 job, yes he can still be a professional pianist but he is not going to be world class.<br>The argument against this particular pianist Melvyn Tan is that he gets away to do what he enjoys and still get red carpet treatment. So I think maybe instead of fining him merely 5k, maybe should let him give free concerts for NSF guys for 2 years! Or teach piano lessons to those guai pianists who stay in s'pore to serve army. Such "punishment" makes him pay back in terms of time rather than money, and somemore making full use of this time and his skill acquired by skipping NS. This has to be more reasonable.</div>
