Although it was just a wayang training session outfield, but with proper leadership displayed by the commander, even the slacker in my section are willing to display his garangness. So I guess, leadership is one of the critical motivational factor. No wonder it is placed so high up in the core values. hehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

First day morning, debus at a foot of a mountain where there is sort of a small village, then proceed to climb up and down those bloody hills until you reached the sungei batu ah poi where you do river crossing. Suay suay after river crossing where the coy is deployed to stay for the night, rain came down just before sunset. Eat ration in the rain, no poncho and sleep through the rainy night in the mud on the ground. Second day, proceed on foot again towards objective. Reached back of the objective where we need to climb up one arga 60 - 70 degrees hill to the objective at the top and we had a couple of hours of firefight in the damn rain again. I forgot what's that hill name liao... something with the word Pasir in it i think. This hill is just behind the camp I think, because when we finished the exercise, we went back to the camp through It's back gates if I remember correctly. I didn't try Biang, but I guess Biang must be the shackest of them all...<br><br>I did not remember the details of the exercise liao, maybe it's 3 days coz' it's too long ago, but that's all I can recall now.

            <div class='col-md body'>Not that easy for the enemy to bomb us -- our RSAF is quite powerful, by regional standards. Enemy artillery also may not last long against our own artillery -- see how fast they can siam before we shoot back. I think our families will be quite safe, though some stuff will probably still get through.<br><br>Of course, the real question is, are you willing to attack other countries? Because that's more or less the plan, in case your specialists and officers didn't tell you (was told to me so many times starting from BMT). You are more likely to be attacking into another country than to be fighting in the streets of Singapore, unless you are a reservist in the PDFs and the war is almost lost. We will attack before we are attacked.<br><br>Can you stomach that? Do you think you can leave your family behind and charge over the border to seize enemy objectives (like, for example, water pumping works)? When the Gov't and your officers tell you that the time is now, and even though there is no direct threat to your families yet, will you go to war? Because we won't wait till we are already under siege to start fighting cos that is dumb and hopeless. Will you believe the Gov't? Will you follow orders? Will you risk your life when there is no clear threat yet (sounds like Iraq)? Can you handle being the aggressor (or at least, engaging in "preemptive defense" ) ?<br><br>That's the real question.<br><br>For me, I have no problems fighting once the enemy is inside our borders. For my family, and my buddies on my left and right, I will keep fighting until I am dead. I don't want to see if they decide to be nice overlords, or run a second Japanese Occupation on us, thank you -- the risk is not worth it.<br><br>But attacking preemptively? I am not so sure. That's where the SAF's morale will probably be most fragile. Everyone will fight like crazy when cornered, but not everyone is so obedient and disciplined as to go to war when commanded.</div>
