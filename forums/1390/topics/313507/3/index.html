              <p>I was posted to the police and i wasnt happy about it. Same reasons here, wanna sign on as officer in OCS. Let me be honest with you alright. If you were drafted into police direct intake, chances for OCT selection is close to zero. So i exercised what many like minded will do, go see my mp but it wasnt successful.</p>
              <p>Let me paint you a picture of what you will learn in PA on top of your physical conditioning and drills.</p>
              <p>1) Live Firing (taurus M85 revolver, fortnightly). Contary to popular believe that revolver firing is easy, it is not. I was subsequently trained in rifle, submachine guns etc and revolver firing is in my opinion the hardest. BTW, marksmen speaking here.</p>
              <p>2) Unarmed Combat. Depending on your instructor, your training in unarmed combat can be very very comprehensive. My squad was under the care of a extremely siao on PTD instructor and boy we hate the lessons. However we were trained much more than the average squad on a few tricks and i dare say it is useful when you are out there.</p>
              <p>3) Penal Code. For the next 3 to 4 mths, you will be drilled with the bloody code with examinations and test (MCQ and structured questions) till you are bloodly familar with it. Till today, i have some of it at fingertips and trust me, it is a good-to-know when you are back as a civilian.</p>
              <p>It realli depends on your intructor if you are interested to know how whether is basic training slack in the police. I dare not compare it to the SAF or the SCDF but if your squad is promising and is under the charge of a good instructor, you have ur time worth. I have seen miracles in the SPF eg, zero fighters morped into to pull-up heros, bobo shooter to marksmen. It realli depend on your instructor and your attitude on how much you wanna learn.</p>
              <p>Pay wise, SPF is better than the SAF. A sgt in SPF can match his salary with a SAF's logistic officer. The govt isnt stupid. They wont pay you a salary that is not worthy of your effort. If the pay of a PNSF is that high, you can say that there must be some grounds considered on the amount of risk, amount of effort the NSF have to bear and shed. Considering my point, i doubt you can say SPF is realli slack.</p>
              <p>Is the SPF for losers whom murdered themselve by flunking their CMPB test? I bet no one dare give you an official answer but let me share my observation. I have seen realli stupid people in the SPF. Honestly, the stupidest people i have seen on earth are those i have seen in the SPF. But on the other hand, i have seen extremely smart people of all races, scholars and ever a future doctor being drafted into the police. My course mate whom is a doctor was of course placed out of course then thrown into NUS half way through his NS.</p>
              <p>In terms of experience, i will not go into it as our friend had already told us his experience and i dont think there is any need to add on with mine. Just let me say, the sky's the limit for what you can see.</p>
              <p>I understand your frustration and your worries. It is very common for boys in Singapore. Most were frustrated because they dont wanna serve NS, others were afraid because they will be stepping into the unknown. Be mindful that no matter how many people had went through it and whatever people say, it is still fearful for some to take the plunge by themselve.</p>
              <p>I admire you for your eagerness to serve the nation as you are a dying breed but dont forget, our country need brave and committed police officers as much as we need brave and dedicated soldiers.</p>
