              <p>IMO, being a policeman is better than being a soldier for an NSF. Physical training is still tough in SPF, but not as vigorous as in SAF. You don't have to bear 30 to 40 kg of gear and tough it out in the jungle for weeks at one go. Somemore you may get a chance to learn civilian driving if you haven't. Important too is that police work in maintaining public order is something that's tangible. If you're a soldier, chances are that you won't be deployed for actual ops, hopefully...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you really must change over, here's a real story. My poly mate was first sent to SPF, but he failed his final semester and deferred his NS. He waited for one whole year before being recruited by the navy divers' mono intake. So, it seems you do have a choice...</p>

SAF is only gd for u if u have a SAF scholarship and u r damn fit, be it combat or physically fit, or else life can be quite bleak if u r a farmer officer.. becoz' u will see younger scholars leap-frogging u to be ur superiors..</span></p>
              <p>btw i feel that SPF is much better, as it allows u to see the society better and it's closest to corporate life and u will definitely feel tt ur work is worth it all</p>

              <p>Dont bother, really.</p>
              <p>I wanted to join SAF during my NS but i got into SPF instead. (And to think i was pissed that time. lol.)</p>
              <p>I can honestly tell you that for NS, SPF &gt; SAF, IMO.</p>
              <p>Gimme another chance and i'll still choose SPF for its exposure.</p>
              <p>During which i was, a staff assistant who oversees the inner-workings of an NPC, a security guard @ minister visits, an avid drug addict spotter(arrested alot lol), operations with CNB, chasing illegal immigrants and an unforgettable late night police car chase thru serveral red traffic lights.</p>
              <p>Not to mention being deployed to find Mr Mas during my reservist recently... lol...</p>
              <p>I still get to hear interesting stories from mates being posted to other areas, Coast guard, Prisons etc.</p>
              <p>And if you think Police NS is slack... heh heh heh... get into my posting and you'll see.</p>
              <p>Lucky i got into PNS. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>

              <p>Mental or Physical doesn't matter to me.. i don't wanna slack
                  two years of my life away. I am considering signing on if i'm in
                  ocs.</p>
              <p><br> Which means i have to purposely fail my law exams and wait for 1
                  year to get into ns..? is there anyone i can talk to about this ?
                  like the minister or something ?</p>
              <p>i'm really desperate to get into the army.</p>

              <p>if you don't want to slack, it's no problem.</p>
              <p>fight to go into the inspector course in SPF as ur NS vocation</p>
              <p>2 of my frens are in the course soon..</p>
              <p>soon to be graduating with the rank of 2 Diamonds..</p>
              <p><br>in police, as long as you can represent yourself well, high chance you'll get into the Officer of SPF Course at Home Team Camp at Old Choa Chu Kang Road.</p>
              <p>Upon graudation, you will be staying out, but be prepared, although rank is high, but there's a lot of duties to perform. It should be to your liking.</p>
              <p>Moreover if you're good at studies.this suits you best, as it's daily PT training cum studying of Law etc.</p>
