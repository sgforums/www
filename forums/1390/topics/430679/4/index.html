              <p>I am from 1992 batch, <span>NSF CDO</span>, volunteered
              for <span>CDO</span> during enlistment interview.</p>
              <p>From experience, the <span>CDO</span> officer are
              looking for certain attiude and very postive minded guy.</p>
              <p>So I would say to Sheradine, if you interest in joining
              <span>CDO</span>, do spend more effort and make more
              enquiry to <span>CMPB</span>. You need to show them you
              are committed. The rest is up to them.</p>
              <p>For Cyberr1981, if you dun like uniformed group, so be it, but
              no need to influence other wanna-to-be. To be fair, to each his own
              mah.</p>
              <p>As for injury, so long as not life threatening, injury is norm.
              But everybody there just take as a pinch of salt, laugh it out,
              recovered and rejoin again. We are trained to endure more pain.
              Even my <span>SOF OC</span> also injured his back for
              6mths despite his solid experiences on static parachuting.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>It's not influencing, it's actually shedding light on the DARK and UGLY side of uniformed groups which few people will talk about so that Sheradine can make a more informed choice.</p>
              <p>There you said it, injury is NORM in commando because "they don't care what was done as long as the job was done" - they don't care about safety, proper procedures and lives of soldiers which are just minor statistics to them.</p>
              <p>To them when 0.5% of the cohort DIES, it's nothing. It's a place where human life is cheap.</p>

              <p>If CDOs dun really think abt safety, then how can we acheive 100% full chute opening record for so many yrs? As far as concerned, nobody died from static parachuting but injury is unavoidable and norm as I said earlier. Accidents do occurs.

              <p>I wouldnt worry abt injury that muchÂ if I really want to experience the life of CDO. No pain, no gain! When I volunteered for CDO, I only want red beret, airborne wing and those adventuous events which other units can provide me. It is tough, painful but at the same time, fun too.</p>

              <p>Whether u like it or not, don't have to accuse other units of this and that. In fact SAF always had this saying "U can do whatever, just don't get caught". U believe other units did not did what the CDO did in the past even now? I certainly don't believe it.</p>

                      whatever, just don't get caught". U believe other units did not did
                      what the CDO did in the past even now? I certainly don't believe
                      it.</p>
              <p>As for the death rate, u only noe abt the CDO rate, what about
                      the other units?</p>
              <p>You may not find been a CDO pround, but some find pride in them.
                      It's up to each individual anyway.</p>

              <p>To people around here, you are just been sour grapes, perhaps u got rejected by CDO or maybe your good friend met some serious injuried while he's in CDO?. You go around asking what's the fatallity of the CDO? I'm not saying that fatallity does not not exist or 0.5% is low. U can be injured even if u are not a CDO. In my NS tour, I think I seen enough injuries that I believe you are very unlucky one if u met any accident. Of cos there are some admin/training lapse. But still I think such things does not applied to CDO alone.</p>

              <p>I'm not worked up, it's u who keep tell abt the risk in CDO, I'm telling u it's everywhere regardless it's CDO or not.Â  As for ICT, whether what vocations there's always how u see relax and stress. For physically unfit personal may find it stress to charged up the hill but to those physically fit may find it ok. To you maybe strees but to some maybe a good time to get off work.</p>
              <p>I find it offensive becos I think you are a bit biased toward CDO. TS wanted to go CDO maybe he like it. So what if he express interest in going CDO, he may not get in anyway. Because you kept mentioning abt the risk in CDO is higher, I wanna ask u, what make you think if TS go to some other vocation like NDU or guards the risk is not as high as well? I'm just telling u, every vocation had it risk, you must know how to take care of yourself and also when you had reach you limit.</p>
              <p>Personally I know friends from CDO and NDU, all come out in one piece, yes accident do happened, but it can happened anywhere as well. So I'm telling you it's still on luck.</p>

              <p>No, and luckily I was not even selected for their tests and I don't have to be in commando to know how hellish their trainings are - imagine for warm-up exercise, 300 jumping jacks (siao), 60km route march, SOC in fullbatt....etc. This are just the "formal" trainings only, wait till you hear about their tekan sessions and "torture" trainings.....</p>

              <p>during my time, we did 1000 jumpingÂ jacks (spread out in a day)Â and 72km route march (once before red beret presentation)Â instead but not for warmup exercise.

And those trainingsÂ wereÂ not siao becos we are fully trained and fit to do things which you think was siao.Â And SOC full battle is not a formal training but a training aimed at co-operation and teamwork and we only did twice. Tekan sessions? Pls tell me which unit dun have tekan sessions?Â Tekan training isÂ a compuslory growing up stage in army. By the way,Â did you completed your NS or not? I wonder? And which unit were you from?</p>

              <p>Quick of you to dismiss it as wrong information. Seems like you're no different from that guy.</p>
              <p>Yes, so "fully trained" until got life-long injuries and so many deaths in cdo.</p>
              <p>Quick of you to compare it as same with other units, tekan sessions in cdo are much worse than other units.</p>

              <p>I'm not worked up, it's u who keep tell abt the risk in CDO, I'm
              telling u it's everywhere regardless it's CDO or not.Â  As for
              ICT, whether what vocations there's always how u see relax and
              stress. For physically unfit personal may find it stress to charged
              up the hill but to those physically fit may find it ok. To you
              maybe strees but to some maybe a good time to get off work.</p>
              <p>I find it offensive becos I think you are a bit biased toward
              CDO. TS wanted to go CDO maybe he like it. So what if he express
              interest in going CDO, he may not get in anyway. Because you kept
              mentioning abt the risk in CDO is higher, I wanna ask u, what make
              you think if TS go to some other vocation like NDU or guards the
              risk is not as high as well? I'm just telling u, every vocation had
              it risk, you must know how to take care of yourself and also when
              you had reach you limit.</p>
              <p>Personally I know friends from CDO and NDU, all come out in one
              piece, yes accident do happened, but it can happened anywhere as

              <p>Anyway if u don't think it's luck, let me tell u a story, during my NS time, my camp was built with a golf course inside, one sat morning one trainee went to the medical centre becos he got hit by a golf balls.

He don't call that luck, also just u may luck to noe, that route was used by lot of other units for morning run, nothing happen to the rest except him, u don't call that luck? Just because a couple of death cases in CDO, u start blaming the CDO blah blah blah. If u don't noe the whole story pls don't make a mountain out of a mole hill who know maybe it's the trainees fault. Because what we read in the newspaper maybe it's part of the story.</p>
              <p>I know stories of certain deaths in SAF, because there are some investigation reports that are send to unit which is mark a big X and I happened to saw some of them.

              <p>He was on the kerb and I don't think it's funny, you are so uncaring maybe that's why u are so hated by your unit that u turn against SAF.I telling u if u are in bad luck anything can happened, CDO or not, in or outside camp. If u think CDO so much danger, how come still got so many people pass out every year? Mind u I'm not saying danger does not exist or low, but certainly if u follow instructions right u should be ok, but if certain things still happened, u want to blame on SAF or yourself? It's BAD LUCK right? U really bear so much grudge with CDO?Â  for what? it only made your life miserable.</p>
              <p>TS, I can tell if u wanna join go ahead, forget about what cyberr1981, he's too negative minded in doing things, but you must understand that CDO is an elite unit, certain exercise does have certain degree of danger, if u not sure, ask don't monkey see monkey do.
