              <p>I'm more than happy to attribute my personal success to what I learned at 1CDO, but could you please quote where I said that ALL businessmen should be ex-Commandos?  There's no such quote because you're making things up.</p>
              <p>Let me put the right perspective on your argument.  Being too negative comes off as an inferiority complex and a sad distortion of the positive truth.  Just because you had a bad time in NS doesn't mean everybody has to.</p>
              <p>We don't know each other from a bar of soap, but some of the guys on the forum know the story of my entry into Commandos well enough.  You're right - I didn't want to go to Commandos at the time I got called up for the VA.  I tried my best to not get selected, so when the interviewing sergeant asked me if I wanted to go to Commandos, I asked him if I had a choice.  When he said no, I said, "What the fuck are you asking me that question for then?".</p>
              <p>As it turns out, it was a major miscalculation because that was precisely the attitude they were looking for. I found myself in the company of likeminded hellraisers who didn't care what was done as long as the job was done.  We made our own rules, ran our own show and achieved our own goals.  So sure, I had a great time, even if it was by accident.</p>
              <p>I'm just curious - what have you achieved with your life to date?  I can't see how you would have done much seeing as how you're so bitter and twisted.</p>
              <p>Anyway, while we're in the mood for being blunt, when it comes to Commando-related matters, I'm speaking from personal experience, while you're making wild postulations and accusations.  I'll leave it at that and let the TS make up his own mind about who's got a good grip on things and who's off with the fairies.</p>

              <p>You mean, all who went to CDO will always become successful and don't who didn't will be losers?</p>
              <p>So those who are bitter and negative about NS will always be failures in life?</p>
              <p>Since you deem I'm a loser, then why do you bother so much with this loser? Yes, I didn't go CDO and I feel I'm lucky that I didn't and I'm perfectly fine that way.</p>

              <p><strong>To Sheradine (threadstarter):</strong></p>
              <p>After all the exchanges in this thread, I hope you have an understanding how most armies in the world work:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The blunt and harsh truths.....</span><br>1. They don't care about your injuries unless you're dead<br>2. They don't care if you're really not coping well or tired unless you're dead<br>3. They don't care about safety, they don't care about proper procedures/process (in paper, they talk like they regard safety but it's all bullsh*t).</strong></span></p>
              <p>If you still interested to go cdo or even sign on as a regular, I sincerely hope you'll be lucky enough to ORD alive in one piece and then join the ranks of Gedanken to rejoice that cdo training is good. Hope you won't be unlucky to suffer life-long injuries or even die due to the harsh, relentless, unprivileged and merciless conditions in the army.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, it is YOUR choice. Bless you, you need lots of good luck in the army.</p>

              <p>You see, there are also politics and "dirty play" in army, even
                                      worse than civilian life's politics because politics in army can
              cost you a limp or a life!</p>

              <p>Such words are nice to say, nice to read but totally unpractical in real life. Save it for poetry corner.</p>
              <p>To be blunt/direct: whether an event is positive or not, it takes 2 hands to clap.</p>
              <p>If 1 hand (army) keep on holding needle between fingers to jab the other hand (servicemen), yes it can still clap but VERY PAINFUL. And, you can still lie by saying that it's not really painful and say what's most important is the 2 hands clapped successfully &lt;--- this is what most shallow "positive" people says.</p>
              <p>Yes, I enjoy being blunt rather than to lie that I'm sharp just for the sake of being nice.</p>

              <p>This is where the authorities are wrong...</p>
              <p>If people express interest to the "siong" units, they should allow. Why force unwilling people like Gedanken to where they don't like to go? Then the regulars would have an easier time with NSFs who are willing.</p>
