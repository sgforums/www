              <p>I heard that some of these "goals" are as simple as moving by

              Singapore (or somewhere in the exercise host country). Whatever the

              <p>Navexes do make for a nice break, but once you’re operational that’s just the warm-up for overseas exercises.  <br> <br> The goals I’m talking about are what’s actually listed in mission 
              statements, e.g. “By 0300 hrs on 20110615, Company X will destroy Target
               ABC”.  The more quickly and efficiently we achieve the goal, the 
              better.<br> <br> Case in point is a BTEC (I believe they call it ATEC these days) 
              exercise we had against an unnamed Guards unit.  While most of our guys 
              were fighting a textbook battle, four clever fellows found a gap in the 
              Guards’ lines, strolled right into battalion HQ and took out the CO, S2 
              and S3.  Game over, and we saved ourselves a couple of hours of running 
              about.</p>
              <p>Yes, it was a training exercise, but it illustrates what I mean, and besides, we do have to mind OSA, don't we?</p>

              <p>You are from a unit <strong>"who didn't care what was done as long as the job was done"</strong> and you are indeed lucky to ORD in one piece and actually enjoyed it. Do spare a thought for those who are not as lucky as you!</p>
              <p>The tone you talked to me reeks of sarcasm and arrogance. Just because you're lucky doesn't give you the right to look down on others. Since you already deem everyone who are non-commando as "losers" why do you bother to continue replying to me?</p>
              <p>Same usual trick, nothing to say, call other's opinions as "amusement". If what I've been saying is "amusement" or even funny to you, then you must be really sick. If it happened to someone close to you, I don't think you will call a funeral as "amusement".</p>
              <p>commando is still human, not superhuman, not immune to injuries/death. Hope you continue to be lucky and your brother/son are as lucky as you.<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong> </strong><strong><br></strong></span></p>

              <p>You are from a unit <strong>"who didn't care what was done as

              <p>The tone you talked to me reeks of sarcasm and arrogance. Just
              because you're lucky doesn't give you the right to look down on
              others. Since you already deem everyone who are non-commando as
              "losers" why do you bother to continue replying to me?</p>
              <p>Same usual trick, nothing to say, call other's opinions as
              "amusement". If what I've been saying is "amusement" or even funny
              to you, then you must be really sick. If it happened to someone
              close to you, I don't think you will call a funeral as
              "amusement".</p>
              <p>commando is still human, not superhuman, not immune to

              <p>Here we go.  Where shall I start?</p>
              <p>What I find terribly amusing is how your "blunt truths" simply highlight your hysteria.</p>
              <p>Unlike you, I'll go with straight facts instead of some megalomanic claim to "the truth".  210 men went through training with me, and in 21 years, one man has experienced significant injuries in the course of our work.  Don't get too excited - this guy worked his way back from near-death, is still serving in the formation and is still a major advocate for the unit.  Since his injury, he has mentored plenty of officers across the SAF, and he's nothing short of a bloody inspiration.</p>
              <p>You're obviously logic challenged, so I'll spoonfeed you with the math: this one guy represents less than 0.5% of my cohort.  Sure I'm glad I have my health, but "lucky to ORD in one piece"?  The numbers themselves show how absurd that is.</p>
              <p>Look, if you're so terrified of injury and death, who do anything at all?  After all, you could get hit by a bus while crossing the road to the chicken rice stall, and if you were "lucky" enough to get to the other side in one piece, you could choke to death on a chicken bone while having your lunch.  By your reasoning, you may as well pack it all in right now. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Death is a part of life, and for people who do our kind of work, it simply comes with the territory.  We're not cavalier about it, but neither are we morose about it.  I perfectly understand that you're too much of a nervous nelly for that sort of thing, so it's just as well that you can leave it to the guys who are grown up enough to deal with it.</p>
              <p>Now, if you want to cry about me calling you a nervous nelly, knock yourself out - it'll just get lost in the mounds of rubbish that you spew anyway.  Note, however, that I have at no point called you a loser.  That's a term that your inferiority complex has slapped on you, and seeing as how you and your complex are having a neurotic love-fest over there, I'd much rather stay out of it if it's all right with you. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Does YOUR cohort represent 100% of the unit? Your tone you speak to me is getting worse to worse, now you sound like jeering which makes you sound absurd.</p>
              <p>The reportings of deaths in cdo from the newspapers (over the decades) are the proof and who knows how many accidents and deaths in cdo are "unreported". I use "unreported" because cdo unit is "talented" in "covering up". Remember that year when cdo was found <strong>cheating</strong> and banned from best unit competition? Totally in line with what you said - <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>"who didn't care what was
                                              done as long as the job was done"</strong></span></p>
              <p>Names calling again: "rubbish that you spew", " nervous nelly"...</p>
              <p>If I'm what saying is rubbish, why do you keep on replying to me? To entertain this "rubbish"?</p>
              <p>Anyone would be anxious about his/her own safety. Even a mother would be anxious if her son is going to cdo even if she have other sons. It shows a human life is very valuable, which I think you don't value human lives very much from what you said. If a trainee of yours died, would you think it's only "<strong>less than 0.5% of your
                      cohort</strong>"? (your exact words quoted)</p>
              <p>Again I phrase it back to you, if that trainee is your brother/son, would you think it's only "less than 0.5% of your cohort"? So, only if it is 50% of your cohort who got killed in cdo training, otherwise you won't even care since it's only a tiny percentage?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Really sad to see a thing like you to degrade human lives as statistics!!!!</strong></span> You're not even fit to be called a HUMAN!!!</p>
              <p>Yes, I could be kill by bus or chicken bone, thanks for reminding me. But the risk of getting killed in cdo unit is much much higher than those 2 since the unit <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>"didn't care what was
                                              done as long as the job was done"</strong></span> and hence not caring about proper procedure and safety.</p>
              <p>With a thing like you being the trainer, I would really worry for anyone (even if he is not related to me) who got enlisted into cdo.</p>

In ANY uniformed group, the juniors were literally treated like dogs!!! Even if they died, compensation is only "peanuts" to the state. During NS, I was treated like a dog too. Thinking of past events in the army, it still bring tears to my eyes. I was still hurt emotionally and some events really scarred me for life!!!!!!</p>
              <p>If you have a choice and value your life, mental well-being and your family, I strongly recommend that you don't come back at all!!! This tiny island is not really a great place or big deal in the event you're banned from entering. What this island have, other countries have it better.</p>
              <p>Since you're physically fit, I suggest you concentrate on just being a trainer or instructor, at least you're in control of your life, activity and dignity.</p>
              <p>Best Wishes.</p>

              <p>"without drama" because nobody specifically asked them about the trauma, hardships, disruptions to their life, pain and emotional hurt they suffered.</p>
              <p>Again, you only see the deaths of NSmen as minor statistics, tail end of bell curve. Again I say the same thing to you, if the tail end is your father, brother, son who died, will you still think it's just minority or "tail end"? You have not answer this question since I asked you previously.</p>
              <p>Names calling again.... yes I'm pathetic, you're commando, you're great. *bows to the red beret who haven't died yet*</p>

              I am from 1992 batch, NSF CDO, volunteered for CDO during enlistment interview.
              
              From experience, the CDO officer are looking for certain attiude and very postive minded guy.
              
              So I would say to Sheradine, if you interest in joining CDO, do spend more effort and make more enquiry to CMPB. You need to show them you are committed. The rest is up to them.
              
              For Cyberr1981, if you dun like uniformed group, so be it, but no need to influence other wanna-to-be. To be fair, to each his own mah.
              
              As for injury, so long as not life threatening, injury is norm. But everybody there just take as a pinch of salt, laugh it out, recovered and rejoin again. We are trained to endure more pain. Even my SOF OC also injured his back for 6mths despite his solid experiences on static parachuting.
