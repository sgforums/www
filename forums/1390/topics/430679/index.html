              <p>Hello!<br><br>I've been looking around for some information regarding this topic, but there seems to be very little information to be found.  I'm a Singaporean living in Australia who's due to enlist within the next year, and after hearing stories from friends who've been through NS, I'm very interested in joining the Commandos.  However, I hear that they are almost exclusively a mono-intake, and selection criteria is stringent.<br><br>To give a little background on myself, I'm a Eurasian who's lived in Australia for most of my life, and my standard of education would probably be considered an 'A' level equivalent back home.  I believe I'm capable of meeting the physical and mental requirements for the role: I consider myself very fit, I am a marathon runner and work as a fitness instructor.  I have not undergone any formal fitness testing under Singapore's system, but I believe I will perform well.<br><br>As someone who's based abroad, what would the best course of action be to secure a place in the Commandos?  I do not wish to sign on in order to do so, and I understand that a small cohort of NSFs are chosen to join them.  Are there likely to be any factors that would hinder my chances, such as my living abroad or my race?  Should I simply make my intent clear when I undergo my medical examination, or are there additional steps I can take, such as perhaps, speaking to someone within the army prior to enlistment?<br><br>Thanks for reading!</p>

              <p>There's little you can do - as an NSF, selection's pretty much a case of "don't call us, we'll call you".</p>
              <p>Depending on how close your arrival is to your enlistment date, your being abroad could work against you.  In my day, the selection tests took place 4-5 months before enlistment, so the shortlisting for the selection tests would take place some time before that.  If you're in Singapore for less than six months before enlistment, chances are that whoever's doing the shortlisting would put you in the "not enough time to select" basket.</p>
              <p>Race won't be an issue - we've had our share of Missions and Galistans in the formation.</p>

              <p>i don't think it is even possible if a person were to volunteer for it.</p>
              <p>from what i got to hear from my poly fren who graduated from commando training in the past, they only accept a few hundreds of pre-selected candidates yearly.</p>
              <p>just basic red beret requires 9 months of training, commando officer requires 1yr  5mths of training..as for the in-between of sergeant, i didn't ask.</p>
              <p>they only accept individuals whom they have already pre-selected based on the security clearance from the track-record dating back not only from an individual but also to family background, status and track record as well. (the same goes to any of local important position holders)</p>
              <p>but 1 thing is for sure..you don't need to be medically fit to be selected for that..for my friend had injuired his knee prior to the mono-intake..but he still pushed on and pass out lah..</p>
              <p>neither do they have any slots open up even if you were to sign on..i don't think there's a way that you can choose..except for the general position la..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the only thing that u can choose is - Air-Force Fighter Pilot, can sign on, but if you fail the test, govt will dis-continue the bond, and you just serve either longer or repay the excess amount of salary if you have already spend it away and can't return the excess you accepted as a regular status.</p>

              <p>I just thought, if you have no ties or future interest in singapore and desperately want to serve as a commando, why don't you renounce your citizenship and join a foreign military?</p>
              <p>So many people in AUSNZ have done it and we won't turn you away in future, being so hard up for foreign talent. You can Australia's army or the French Foreign Legion.</p>

              <p>Seals, Spec forces. Covert missions are all overly used in today's context. </p>
              <p>I doubt most of the people here has ever heard of the US Navy's UDT or frogmen,as they would like to call it . I also dare say that most people will just think that these guys are just "another unit" and that they don't kick ass as much as the spec forces do. </p>
              <p>Well. In the olden days, after going through Buds training these guys are just assigned to UDT or SEALS. Simple as that. People are just hyping all these things up.. comparing and weighing which one is the best. the simple ans to it is they are best at what they train for.</p>
              <p>Go watch some documentries from National Geo about them - What the seals and spec forces of the united state military go through.. It's a brief picture of how the training is really like. Yet brief as it is. I shudder infront of my screen after seeing the intense mental and physical stresses these candidates have gone through</p>
              <p>Mind you, the guys that go over there for training are some of the most experienced, fittest battle harden warriors with service bars and medals to prove. They also have many years of service to get to where they are.. their ranks and their achievements etc.</p>
              <p>So what makes you think, the Seals will just open the doors to you and give you a free pass to immediately train with them?  I doubt the us dept of defence will just accept any give citizenship to any tom dick and harry.</p>
              <p>Also. A sergeant there != to a sergeant here. Getting to the rank of sergeant there takes years.. so go ponder.</p>

              <p>Hi Sheradine, hope you're still there...</p>
              <p>To put it bluntly, I 
                          wouldn't advise anyone to join ANY army in the world unless you're a 
                          masochist (a person who enjoys being controlled and physically abused).</p>
              <p>Ignore
                           people who tells you all about pride, honour of joining army that 
                          you're doing a noble task to serve your country - it's all bullsh*t!!!!</p>
              <p>In
                           fact, in civilian world, nobody will give a h3ck, nobody will respect 
                          you as soldier and will see you as "2nd class citizen" (when you're in 
                          uniform) and have higher expectations of your behaviour like "you're a 
                          soldier, you're a REAL MAN, you cannot sit on seats on the mrt/bus, you 
                          cannot take escalator, must take stairs"....etc.</p>
              <p>A soldier's life 
                          is an underprivileged life, with lots of inconveniences, hardships and 
                          hassles. You will not have freedom to do whatever exercises you wish to, like in 
                          civilian life. You won't even have a choice of when to rest. When you 
                          have illness/injury, you will be expected to resume training unless 
                          you're dead. In ANY army, they don't care about your illness/injury 
                          unless you died.</p>
              <p>And, it's not just about physical fitness. You must also be able to take great pressure, have great mental endurance and must not break down and cry easily. You must also be able to do intense and highly complicated military operations and must not screw up. Once you screw up any thing or make any big mistake, there goes your career in the army!</p>
              <p>If you're serious about fitness and gymming, you should just stick to being an fitness instructor and DO NOT join ANY army!!!</p>

              <p>I don't think Bill Gates or Steve Jobs (or any successful businessman at the moment) had training OR even need to have training at 1CDO to be able to outlast competition for that matter.... By what you said, then all businessmen should be ex-commandos!</p>
              <p>I have to put it bluntly to you - CDO training is redundant and unrelated to success of any businessmen. You had no choice because you got selected to be in CDO that's why you had to "come out positively of it" to make full use of it. Sheradine, the threadstarter here, have a choice.</p>
              <p>Every year you are compulsory to return for ICT, it's not because you have great time.</p>
              <p>I certainly don't think those people, who have life-long injuries OR even died due to CDO trainings, had a "great time".</p>
              <p><strong>To Sheradine:</strong> This Gekan guy paints a very beautiful picture of the army with his positive thinking. Being positive is good but being too positive it comes off as fake and politically correct and blurring the blunt negative truths. Do consider thoroughly before joining any army.</p>
