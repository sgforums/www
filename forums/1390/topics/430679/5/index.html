              <p>He was on the kerb and I don't think it's funny, you are so
              uncaring maybe that's why u are so hated by your unit that u turn
              against SAF.I telling u if u are in bad luck anything can happened,
              CDO or not, in or outside camp. If u think CDO so much danger, how
              come still got so many people pass out every year? Mind u I'm not
              saying danger does not exist or low, but certainly if u follow
              instructions right u should be ok, but if certain things still
              happened, u want to blame on SAF or yourself? It's BAD LUCK right?
              U really bear so much grudge with CDO?  for what? it only made
              your life miserable.</p>
              <p>TS, I can tell if u wanna join go ahead, forget about what
              cyberr1981, he's too negative minded in doing things, but you must
              understand that CDO is an elite unit, certain exercise does have
              certain degree of danger, if u not sure, ask don't monkey see
              monkey do. Many a times this lead to accident.</p>
              <p>Btw cyberr1981 u still had not said why u bear such a deep
              grudge against CDO? Lost out in ATECH?</p>

              <p>Yes, but in cdo, the risk as multipled many many times.</p>
              <p>Many people also suffered life-long injuries and many also died in cdo training.</p>
              <p>What grudge? I don't even care about achievements in the army. I haven't even gone to ATc yet.</p>
              <p>Seems like every ex-cdo I conversed with in the forums doesn't seems to be in the right frame of mind. Threadstarter can also see for himself what we've discussed.</p>

              <p>Many died? how many? Don't just made up any number? just becos u read 1 or 2 stories u saw in new paper, just like when people got robbed in JB, don't tell me you are going to get mugged every time u go into JB? Don't just becos u heard u assumed. I told u if you followed everything correctly and yet such accident still happened, it's BAD LUCK. U heard of armour the tank overturning? Or chambers explosion in range? or a bomb goes off in live firing area and people got injured? Such things can happened anywhere and anytime.</p>
              <p>Anyway I don't think I wanna get into such argument with such a thick head</p>
              <p>TS, just don't be like him, if you very negative from the start, you'll going to find NS miserable. Just be positive you'll find your life more enjoyable anyway it's 2 years.</p>

              <p>I was referring to 300 jumping jacks in a row without break as warm-up.</p>
              <p>Quick of you to dismiss it as wrong information. Seems like you're no different from that guy.</p>
              <p>Yes, so "fully trained" until got life-long injuries and so many deaths in cdo.</p>
              <p>Quick of you to compare it as same with other units, tekan sessions in cdo are much worse than other units.</p>

              <p>Hey, u were the one who said 'so many death's, so where is the data from?</p>
              <p>Aiyo, boy, if you can do 1000 in a day, what is 300 in a row, so what? Imagine u cant even do 300 jumping jacks, i think nobody will believe u r CDO. Do u know wht is progressive training? U kept on saying there is no safety procedures in CDO, becos u r not 1 of us, I shall enlighten u. From BMT, we started from 30 JJ (jumping jacks), everyday increase bit by bit,  by end of BMT, we already able to do 1000. This is safety. If a camp without safety and caused a lot of deaths, can u answer me why Hendon camp is always full of confidence, highly morale unit?</p>
              <p>Tekan can help to strengthen your mental strength, especially if you are a POW. Everything u do in camp comes with a reason, ok? It up to you how u think!</p>
