              <p>I have a colleague doing his part time mechanical engineering degree with NUS. Its 3 times a week, mondays, tuesdays, thursdays, 6-9pm. Its quite siong on him considering our occupation requires lots of unscheduled OT. Imagine the workload, on top of his school work, and lab sessions. Its really tough.</p>
              <p>He had his exams recently, had to take almost 2 weeks off, to study, and for the exams. So do consider, that if working class has to compromise so much, serving full time national service isn't going to be easy either.</p>

              <p>Just remember: you are an NSF first. National Service <strong>Full-Time</strong> is exactly what it sounds like.</p>
              <p>Your superiors may close one eye to allow you to take external courses, with the proviso that <em>it does not interfere with your duties as an NSF</em>. If your unit is on a lull phase, your supervisors may allow your to attend your course.</p>
              <p>However, if your unit decides that it needs you on a particular day, then you have no right to object, even if you happen to have an exam on that day. </p>
              <p>So.... if you want to take an external course.... it's at your own risk.</p>

              <p>yes, its part-time degree. usually it will take around 2 days a  week, 3-4 hour per session.</p>
              <p>are you sure you want that? it is a long term commitment, and quite taxing, if you have irregular working hours. even though clerks are supposed to work 8-5, it is not uncommon for you to stay back still 9+pm should your unit need something to be done.</p>
              <p>and it would be unfair for your colleagues who have to cover your work for you, should you be allowed to be dismissed early for your studies. might put a strain on your working relationship with your co-workers. and you wouldn't want that, since you will be stuck with the same bunch of people for 2 yrs, and you won't like them giving you hell.</p>
