              <p>I guess those two who are enlisting are just wanting to try for it lar. Let them try lor. During first day of enlistment all recruits will want to go to OCS, but one week into BMT some don't want to go anymore. after field camp more will say don't want...But there was some who stick through all the way and they deserve a place there lar. </p>
              <p>But 9 months of OCS is a diff story <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> During the nine months, you will know who are the one who deserve to be there, who are those who don't. Sad to say, there are some who OOC not because they did badly, but medical reason lar. Got one guy in my ocs batch was super super good (SOH or SOM kind) but due to injury, have to OOC, not sure if he recourse. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif">  </p>

              <p>There are some truth to what you say at the last part, good results is not everything. I did not do well enough for my poly (Not good enough to go local uni ) I still ended up in OCS.( I am not trying to be proud lar. Just telling you what I been through) How you perform daily during BMT will matter alot and not forgetting, SOC, IPPT, peer appraiser, commander recommandation.</p>
              <p>Well, let's just put it straight, be yourself, help your buddy and peers when you can and be helped when you need. Take care and look out for eachother, don't be rude, do well for IPPT, during SIT test stay focus (Know what you want and don't do solo. Getting information from everyone and put the ideas together and assign the task to each if you are incharge) </p>
              <p>But ultimately, if you don't get to command school. Just be happy that you did your best. It's the experiences and friendship you made that you will remember. It's not the end of the world if no command school. :)</p>
              <p>Don't need to care about what others do( If those want to suck up, let them, just care about what you do.)</p>
              <p>All in all, let's just say I was blessed with a great buddy who helped me through BMT and great sections that's why I ended up in OCS and commissioned later on. :)</p>
              <p>Just take care and have fun!  </p>
