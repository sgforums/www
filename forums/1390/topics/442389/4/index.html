              <p>I guess those two who are enlisting are just wanting to try for it lar. Let them try lor. During first day of enlistment all recruits will want to go to OCS, but one week into BMT some don't want to go anymore. after field camp more will say don't want...But there was some who stick through all the way and they deserve a place there lar. </p>
              <p>But 9 months of OCS is a diff story <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> During the nine months, you will know who are the one who deserve to be there, who are those who don't. Sad to say, there are some who OOC not because they did badly, but medical reason lar. Got one guy in my ocs batch was super super good (SOH or SOM kind) but due to injury, have to OOC, not sure if he recourse. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif">  </p>

              <p>would very much like to forgive alan for being too stupid to think but i simply hate folks who arent human lest we be victims of another kind and type of PAP of the future.i mean what i said about alan.perhaps when he is 30 years older and went to prison a few times then only he will start to think properly.meanwhile,i am not going to have things screwed up with folks like him.</p>

              <p>its pretty much the same in real life.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>when i went to tekong..the trainer was suprised i could handle a weapon carelessly and still get on target.they were also surprised i could build a bullet proof area without any training.....and i could camouflage myself like a professional soldier better than the rest!if u  r not a soldier or a reincarnation of a professional soldier...all the command school would be virtually useless..even ocs would be a waste of time for everyone.</p>
