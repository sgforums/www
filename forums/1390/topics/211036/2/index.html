            <div class='col-md body'>to clarify..part of the reason why i wasn't able to follow my planned leave forecast was because of a major shoulder op. after i unexpectedly dislocated my shoulder during training...haha...it probably; in a way, made me feel rather bad...because i still had alot of unfinished lose ends but i also wanted to consume my lengthy 2 mths mc...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey guys, i reproduced the following from ns portal..is there any truth in the extract posted below?<br><br>Q1. Under the 1979 leave scheme, what is the formula for commutation of leave into pay?<br><br>Based on the existing policy, the rate of commutation is as follows:<br><br>Number of leave days to be commuted/286 x monthly salary as at 31 Dec of previous year (ie: year the leave was meant for) x 12<br><br>Q2. I am a unit chief clerk and would like to know how to submit my servicemen's leave balance for commutation into pay?<br><br>a) If your unit is using the Unit Admin System (UAS) Pay Module (ie. DIVMIS, GMIS and NAVMIS), you have to raise pay occurrence (P15-Leaves) in Jan/Feb each year to submit the leave balance for your servicemen. Salary Services Centre will process the payment strictly based on the electronic occurrence received via UAS in Feb/Mar respectively.<br><br>b) If your unit is using AIMS, you are to ensure that the leave records updated in system are correct. No action in raising occurrence is required as any leave balance for your servicemen will be transmitted automatically to Salary Services Centre for processing leave commutation to pay.<br><br>c) If your unit is not a UAS Pay Module user, you have to submit the leave balance to Salary Services Centre using the standard Excel template.<br><br>Please refer to the administrative instructions/checklist for military regulars in the MINDEF Intranet before submitting the returns.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I see it differently and I don't like this new leave policy (where NSFs can't carry forward their leave balance to the next calendar year).<br><br>For the last 9 months the senior regs in my unit were very reluctant to let their men take leave as they probably didn't see the urgency to. Lots of my friends were turned away when they requested for approval to go on leave.<br><br>Now there's a mad rush to clear everyone's leave balance (more often than not it's still in the double digits), sometimes in the middle of courses. I have a feeling a few who are a tad slower in seeking approval from their superiors will be forced to eat their balance. It used to be evenly spread-out in the past when the bulk was cleared at the end of one's NS.<br><br>And what happens if someone gets a long-term MC before he can clear it all at the end of the year? Turn the balance into off days which you can't use to go overseas, or can be cancelled by superiors?<br><br>If understudies and new personnel arrive early enough there'll be enough time for them to learn the ropes and then disappear. But that doesn't happen often enough.<blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gordonator:</div><div class="quote_body">it's strongly advisable to plan your leave carefully. ideally is to start taking them 1 month before u ORD.<br><br>in my case, because the unit is very short on manpower, i wasn't able to enjoy 1 full month of continuous leave and have to come back every now and then in between leaves.<br><br>it was a very bad experience coming back in between leaves. cos 2 month before me and my batch were to ORD, our power/appointment was already handed over to the next generation.<br><br>in the past we lao jiao were the ones calling the shots, now the younger generation are "commanding" me. all of sudden i felt so powerless.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote></div>
