            <div class='col-md body'>I just like to share with you my experiences as a combat medic after i was posted to my unit in Pasir Laba Medical Centre. That was from November 2001 to June 2003.<br><br>Well it may be farnie that you may say, how is it that a combat fit medic lands up in a medical centre. Well, that the problem, it is not a rosy picture as some of the other ex medics have painted i.e. being posted to a medical centre is a luxury.<br><br>I guess Pasir Laba Medical centre is unique in her own ways because it supports all the major live firing areas near PLC, which includes, firing ranges, mortar ranges, GMPG, mortar and other explosive rounds denotation firing ground. Due to this reason, Pasir Laba Medical Centre (PLCMC) is a 24hr operational medical centre. Being 24hrs operational, it means we also support all after-office hours patient consulations from camps like, Jurong camp, Safti MI, Tuas Naval Base and Armour camp.<br><br>Thats not just it, we have several high profile schools in Pasir Laba camp, and they are 1) School of Military Intelligence(SMI), 2) School of Infantry Weapon(SIW), 3) ATEC and 4) School of Physical Training. These schools have frequent outfield exercises and they request for medical cover from PLCMC.<br><br>So as it sums up, you can see that it is challenging to serve in PLCMC as a combat fit medic because you get to do medical cover in outfield, and also in-house medical centre duties.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For the Outfield:</span></strong><br>You have to go for outfield exercises with SMI, which conducts frequent recce missions, stretching for weeks in tekong or other areas, or go for day and overnight live firing exercises conducted by SIW. So physically, it is draining to cover these units.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For the In-house medical duties</span></strong><br>Everyday, there will be 2 duty medics who are on a 24hour shift. In the daytime, the duty medics have the support of the entire medical staff, but once it hits 6pm, the 2 duty medics are on their own. There will be a medical officer posted to the centre. And these 2 duty medics are expected to handle casualties throughout the night. As far, there have been many casualties treated after office hours. The most memorable one was a Safti cadet, who while climbing up the flagpole to retrieve a stuck flag, slipped down the flag pole, and his testicle skin was ripped apart by the flag pole Hook ( the hook where u tie the excess of the string to the flag). So that was memorable, as the casualty came in, we had to use ice packs to preserve his testicles, wrap his testicles in sterile dressing and evacuated to SGH asap.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lessons Learnt</strong></span><br><br><br><br>1) Make sure you print and display the ER number of all the vinicity Govt Hospitals on your medical centre's notice board,on the medical centre phones and also store it in your mobile phone. So if u have really severe casualties, you can call the ER in that hospital and ask them to standby.<br><br>2) Make sure you have the mobile number of your ambulance drivers. At any one time, there should be one ambulance driver posted in the medical center at all times. Please ensure this is done. It is horrible if u wan to evacuate but your ambulance driver is missing.<br><br>3) Make sure you check your medical orderly pouch is updated, especially your IV fliuds. I recommend you to pack the following items needed for an IV into a ziplock bag; these includes alcohol swabs, one 16gauge and 20 gauge, tornique,and strips of tapes. So in emergency, it comes in handy, one swoop and everything is out, you will not miss anything for an IV.<br><br>4) When you are dispensing the medicine in the dispensary, please ensure you write down the full name and rank of the MO who signs the prescription form. Also ensure that if you cannot read the MO readings, clarify and clarify.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong></strong></span><br><br>1)	Always have an insulator of ice in your safety rover. Pack at least 12 packs of  ice into those mini zip lock bags<br><br>2)	Heat related injuries are the most common kind of injuries. Please ensure you recognize symptoms of Heat related injuries, like heat cramp, heat exhaustion and heat stroke. If unsure, always treat it as a heat stroke. First check Airway, Breathing and Circulation, if all these are not clear commence CPR. If ABC is clear, take temperature of casualty. While waiting for the thermometer to beep, insert the ice packs as follows:<br><br>2 packs to the groin, one on each side,<br>2 packs underneath the armpits, one on each side<br>2 packs on the neck, one on each side<br>1 pack on the forehead.<br><br>Then insert IV line, and evacuate.<br><br>3)	Please learn to open the folded stretcher in less than 30seconds. My record is 28secs. This is a highly useful skill.<br><br>K, thatÂ’s all. I share more when I can recall.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>first of all i totally have no interest in the course too much thing to study. this is juz my 1st week and i find it soo boring.<br><br>instructors there very "yaya" and i cant take it when they pump me. not becoz i cant do it, but the fact that they are juz a medic. and they show no leadership, or rather commader quality. one example is during one of the water parade (bmt style) sumone's bottle was not filled to the brim and the sgt pour all the water away thus making the poor trainee having to go refill again so while waiting for the trainee to fill up the bottle, the sgt recovered a 3sg (he also a trainee) and said that becoz he deserve his rank so he can recover. LOL indirectly he meant that we dun deserve our coporal rank?<br><br>previously i was from sispec. over there they treat us as a commander to be, but over smti i feel that im back in tekong, worse than a a smelly recruit.<br><br>whats worse, the instructors do things w/o telling us the rationale. eg is when after lectures we have to walk all the way down, march and go back up to our bunk when the lecture room and our bunk is juz one stair case apart. thats so dumb<br><br></div>
