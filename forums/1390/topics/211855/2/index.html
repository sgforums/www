For one yes it can boost confidence for future shoots. However, if too many times you get a one-shot-one-kill, it can actually backfire when the time comes when you get a vein that's hardly visible. Since you're so used to shooting 1S1K, then when you miss, its hard for you to get it right again.<br><br>But well done for getting through the first-week in SMTI.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
