Go for breakfast, come back to bunk to do area cleaning till 7.15.<br><br>7.30am -&gt; First Parade with our beloved medic song.<br>Medics all are we, the medics of the field, we serve the wounded and the sick~<br>kk, enough.. =\ You'll learn the pledge and song soon.<br><br>By 8am you will be sitted in the audit for lectures. 9.30-10am usually is admin time and getting back to audit, lectures again till 11.30 than go for lunch. Back to bunch till 1.15pm, pack abit, fall in for practical lessons held in training shed @ 1.30pm. 3pm-3.30pm again usually are admin time than back to study at training shed till dinner which is @ 5pm.<br><br>Usually after dinner, you will just wait for last parade or not, it will to computer lab for some revision on medic stuff.<br><br>Anyway, the tricky one in the course in the exams, but somehow rather, mug for a lil bit and you will get your way out =D<br><br>--Anyway, i just graduated out.. less than a year--<br><br>Life as a medic really start when you're posted to units.<br>Let me elaborate abit from here on, (Splitted into different groups).<br><br>Combat Medic;<br><br>HQ Medic- do basic covering of activties and building on the BCS in ATEC. BCS would be deployed with your HQ Medical Platoon with MOs and so usually kind of shiong. The good part here is that you stayed in the Medical Center 90% of your time and will be task, given roles. (Eg, treatment i/c, dispen i/c, MOPA).<br>When coy medic do live I/V outfield, under the hot sun, you shoot I/V in sickbay.<br><br>Coy Medic- Which is what i am now. Commonly known as Platoon Medic. To be frank, it's very shiong to be a coy medic as you're tasked with combat duties adding onto ur medical duties. For eg, people chiong with SBO rifle helmet, you add on ur MOP, Strecher and follow the Platoon Sergeant. You dont frequent the medical center that often but you'll always take chance to go there and slack. keke. Most of the time, in a combat active unit, you're just like normal MAN. Doing sai kang most of the time, and if not, training with them under the hot sun. A coy usually has 4 medic so it rotate. 1 will be doing cover whereas the other 3 will be chionging as well, which is quite shiong and shag for medics. So all coy medic, please take care of yourself and train up. IMO, it's very important.<br><br>Service Medic;<br><br>Well, Basically stay in the medical center. 8-5 job. Just wait for ORD.<br><br>I hope the above give you guys the understanding of being a medic and what it go through. Of course, small detail stuff i've left out but these is wat roughly it is.<br><br>Last and for most,<br>Be proud as a medic as what you learn is a life-long skill.<br>80% of my course mate doesnt want to be a medic but till we pass out of course, we pass out with honor and pride.<br>Drill this in ur brain and spread it around,<br>" Medics are not weakling. You think medics are sissy than help your platoon medic carry his strecher in exercise and stop whinning. Stop shouting for medic when you only need them "<br><br>Seek Save Serve, MEDIC!</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fudgester:</div><div class="quote_body">During my time, the 12-week combat medic course (CMC) was split into two parts: Paramedic Phase (6 weeks) and Combat Medic Phase (6 weeks).<br><br>In the Paramedic Phase, you will be learning the exact same syllabus as the SCDF Level I Paramedics. It focuses more on civillian paramedic procedures. There will still be PT lessons, of course... you can never escape PT in the Army. At the end of this phase, you will get your Paramedic Level I certificate.<br><br>In the Combat Medic Phase, you will be learning first aid procedures similar to the paramedic phase, but this time in a military context. For example, you'll learn stuff like setting up a BCS, casualty evacuation through obstacles, etc.<br><br>Generally I'd say the course was pretty slack during my time. The tough part comes after you pass out from the course - you'll be expected to carry a stretcher and MOP on top of your SBO during missions. Your SBO attire will pretty much be like other people's FBO.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can say, medics are often being looked down upon in units as most tend to think they are slack and do nothing, that is true for medical centre medics, i hate them myself. I was a medic spec, and i was a company medic, was in one of the SIRs,  that time my SIR got the best combat unit for the work year, so even if you cannot make it they'll also push you until you make it.<br><br>As medics, i think it's up to us to prove to everyone that we are as good as anyone, show your mental strength and skills in those long exercises, gradually, people will come to respect you. I mean, if i can take it with one of the heaviest loads all the way in brunei, and still stay alert enough to treat the injured guys, who is to say medics cannot make it? By the time we were fighting atec, i was treated like one of the commanders and invited to join commanders' briefing, even though it didn't really concern me, since my encik was supposed to take care of things, but they respected me enough.<br><br>So, medics, remember we are one of the most important, don't groan at your vocation, be proud of it!</div>
