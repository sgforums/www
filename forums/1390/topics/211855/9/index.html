To rectify this, don't be afraid to push in deeper a little bit more once backflow is attained and also to decrease angle of needle to about 20 to 30 (for 20G needle)<br><br>This happens more likely with the 16G as the needle is sometimes about 60% the size (diameter) of the vein. In the case of 16G, try to go in at a much smaller angle then the 20G.<br><br>And one tip, the most obvious veins (those that sticks out of your friends arm without tying the torniquet) may not be the best ones.<br><br>Choose veins that are just visible before tying the torniquet, and won't 'run' when you try to push it with your fingers.<br><br>Last but not least, don't be afraid to approach your instructors for help and most importantly, make every IV practical count!</div>

Maybe you met some running vein. In IV topo means the veins cannot be found after you have poke it, so have to try find the vein using the needle.</div>

Then most of the time my sergeant had to "topo" the vein for me instead of me getting the backflow the moment I insert the needle, how do you do this topo-ing? </div></blockquote>You must first understand the purpose of the torniquet.<br><br>When you tie the tourniquet for IV, you're tying a Veinous Torniquet;means you tie just enough to stop the blood from flowing back to the heart. Therefore, veinous blood from the tip of your fingers to the point where you tie the torniquet, will flow slowly through to the point it will stop flowing.<br><br>As you know blood flows from the heart to other parts of body via Arteries and from other part of body to the heart via Veins.<br><br>So, when the body detects that one of the vein does not have blood flowing back to the heart as fast as it should (due to the torniquet), it will adjust the blood flow by redirecting the blood to another vein with a much faster flowrate, thus causing the vein with the slow rate of blood flow will have less blood passing through it. Eventually, the vein will collapse.<br><br>That is why, you are not advised to tie the torniquet too long.  And do not tie your buddy's arm, and wait for your SGT to come and watch you do. Only tie when he is ready and sitting beside you.<br><br>So. identify the vein first, then tie torniquet, swap and carry on IVing, don't waste time.<br><br>"Topo"ing is not an overnight skill to learn. It comes with experience. Usually, whenever people have "one-Shot-One-Kill" during IV Practice session in BMC, I don't usually give them that much credit. I prefer trainees to miss, then able to find back the vein and manage to get backflow; Now that's how you guys should learn IV. Always vary your buddies with each IV session, ranging from visible veins to barely visible to can't-be-seen veins.<br><br>Basically, topo-ing is when you can't hit the vein the first time you poke, and then with the needle still in the arm, try to find the vein with your other free fingers and guiding the needle to that vein.  Sometimes you just need to turn the needle a few mm to the left/right; sometimes you need to lower/increase the angle of needle to the skin.  But do realise that once you start to topo, you better find the vein fast as the the vein may collapse very fast due to prolonged torniquet tying.<br><br>Always remember, even if you managed to get "one-Shot-One-Kill" for all 10 IV practices in BMC, if does not mean you will get it again during your first IV to a real-life casualty.<br><br>--&gt; I feel like I was giving IV lesson at Training Shed 702.. lol</div>
