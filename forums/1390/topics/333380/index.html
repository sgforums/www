              <p><span id="intelliTXT"> During my service as an NSF I
              was classified as a PES B. After this initial classification, I have
              met with several unfortunate accidents and have injured my hand and my
              leg on separate occasions. As I was on MC for about 6 months for
              recovery and this period stretched over my ORD date, I am unsure if SAF
              is aware of my medical condition and if my current PES status is
              appropriate for me since a formal review of my injuries was left undone.<br> <br> Recently, I have been told that I will have to take my IPPT before my
              coming birthday. This is the first time that I have been requested to
              take IPPT since my ORD date in 2002.<br> <br> Few days ago, I went to see the MO at my camp, i was told that there
              was no records of my injuries on file and that I was currently a PES B
              and was required to take the IPPT. I then highlighted to him about my
              injuries and how it would prevent me from taking the IPPT without
              causing pain and possibly aggravating my injuries. The MO informed me
              that a specialist review and certification letter was needed for a
              review of my PES status. An appointment to see a specialist at SGH was
              scheduled. Upon further enquiry, I was informed that I would have to
              bear the full cost of consulting the specialist at SGH, which i felt was unjust. (Sidenote: This MO asked if a corrective surgery was done. I replied yup, of
              course, they put plates in to hold my bones together. DUH! Then he
              said, "Oh.. Corrective surgery is supposed to correct your injuries so
              you should be fit for IPPT." WTF?)<br> <br> <br> I am sure that any specialist will certify that I am unfit for IPPT
              since I have broken my leg big time and once had 15 screws and metal
              plates in it. But my gripe is why is SAF making me pay to get a piece
              of paper. I have got about 20 pieces of X-rays showing my bones from
              all angles, but i didnt bring it that day. I did not ask for a letter
              from the specialist after my operation because I didnt think i'll need
              it.<br> <br> Here are my queries.<br> <br> 1) As I have clearly highlighted my constrains on taking the IPPT to an
              SAF MO and a request for SAF to review my medical condition, and since
              it is SAF who wants to verify that I am unfit for IPPT, why is the
              financial responsibility of getting the opinions of a specialist on me?<br> <br> 2a) Assuming that I do not have the money for the consultation with the
              specialist at SGH, does it mean that I will be ordered to take my IPPT
              regardless of my medical condition?<br> <br> 2b) Who will be responsible for any
              possible injuries that I may sustain, including future complications
              that may arise, whilst attempting the IPPT.<br> <br> 2c) Who/Where should I seek medical attention from? Also, who is responsible for the financial cost incurred.</span></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">3) After seeing the MO at the camp recently, I was given an excuse from IPPT for 3 months. However, My window is closing in 20 days, hence I am not allowed to take an IPPT. Because I am unable to take the IPPT, and have not taken any yet, I will be charged as an IPPT  defaulter. What should i do?<br> <br> Thanks in advance!<br> <br> Cheers!</span></p>

              <p>2b) If any injury is sustained/aggravated during IPPT/RT/IPT (even as a reservist), u r advised to file an in-service training injury report to seek compensation claims (just like an insurance claim) and once approved, in future, all medical fees incurred in any govt restructured hospital will be fully borned by Mindef with the issurance of a Service Injury card.</p>

              <p>"Medical Excuse and Examination</p>
              <p><span><strong>Q1 What if I am injured or medically unfit to take my non-ICT IPPT during my qualifying window? </strong><br>It
              is important that you seek medical treatment on your own should you be
              injured or is medically unfit. The medical certificate that your doctor
              issued to you is recognised as valid medical excuse. However, you can
              only be exempted from the annual IPPT if you have a 6 months
              consecutive or 9 months cumulative of valid medical excuse within the
              same IPPT qualifying window. You are advised to contact your NS Unit to
              request for a medical review if you have more than 3 months of medical
              excuse for a particular injury that prevents you from taking your IPPT.</span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Q2 What if my 6 months consecutive or 9 months cumulative medical excuse straddle across two IPPT qualifying windows?</strong><br>You
              would be dealt with as an 'IPPT Defaulter' in the 1st qualifying
              window. Hence it is strongly encouraged that you should book your IPPT
              immediately after your qualifying window has started."</span></p>

              <p>My window is 1Nov 07- 1Nov 08.</p>
              <p>As I have not yet taken an IPPT session, and received a 3 month excuse from the MO on the 10th Oct 08, wouldn't that mean that technically I am still a defaulter and will still be rightfully charged once my window is over in about 20 days? Funny thing is that, now with the 3 months excuse there is no way out for me even if i am willing to take and pass the IPPT tomorrow, I can't.</p>

              <p><br>4) It'll be better for u to go for the SGH appt as scheduled, in which the referral is the same referral procedure from a polyclinic.<br>On the other hand, if u r to file an injury report, there is a part where u have to provide a brief detailed description on how the injury happened. This is where u can write the long story of the injury, as told in your 1st post here.<br><br>5) From the moment the injury report claim is filed till its approval,  most cases took an approx. few months, while a handful of complicated cases can take up to a year to be verified and processed (during my nsf time a couple of years ago).<br>U can file the injury report at the PTI office, or your respective NS HRC.</p>

              <p>So let me get this straight (since it's more immediate for you). </p>
              <p>You have 20 days before your window closes, but you also have a valid medical excuse yes?</p>
              <p>Technically, you should be safe. Technically you won't be charged as an IPPT defaulter. </p>
              <p>However, because this is NS, murphy's law applies. Anything wrong that can happen will happen. Do not be surprised if you received a letter charging you for defaulting even though you have a medical excuse. </p>
              <p>If this happens, remember to appeal. This is a grey area which i think an MO can clarify better than me. Since you are on excuse, you are not medically fit to take ippt. However, i think mindef's guideline is that a person can only be excused ippt for the year if he has 6 months cumulative MC or 9 months of non-cumulative mc.</p>
              <p>The situation might be that mindef can say why for the 11 months when ur window opened, you did not attempt your ippt, why you wait till last minute. however, u can also argue and say that you have many commitments that prevented you from taking ippt. </p>
              <p>you have 20 days or less before your window close, i suggest you call ns.sg, call your unit, do whatever it takes IN YOUR power to get an answer. i.e. unit clear you for ippt for the year. </p>
              <p>anyway, just refer to the thread that eac linked. you can read more about my/other forumers' experiences.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the replies.</p>
              <p>Here is an update. After i wrote in and called in to www.ns.sg</p>
              <p>Someone called me up saying that I will be exempted from IPPT since my excuse was issued by the MO at my camp. She also specifically mentioned not to go for the IPPT that i have booked because their "system" has flagged me as one who has an excuse and with an IPPT appointment (since i booked one just to prove my point). I guess its a grey area, and given their reputation, i won't be surprised if i receive a charge letter. As matchless has mentioned, Murphy's law applies here.</p>
