              <p>Hi guys,I'm a PR and currently 18years old,studying Secondary Three with 2 other buddies who are PR and same age as me as well..</p>
              <p>I want to ask that must i join NS after my O level as i will be 19years old by then. Can i defer it to A level??</p>
              <p>If i can,that would be the best..</p>
              <p>If can't,what will happen after i served NS,can i still study A level at age of 21? That sounds insane but yeah,i guess that's what will happen to me and 2 other buddies.</p>

              <p>Hi <a href="../../../users/59445">eac</a></p>
              <p>"NS liable persons will be granted deferment for GCE 'A' Level
                                      studies (and its equivalent) if they are able to commence the
                                      course before 19 years old (for Secondary 4 Express Stream
                                      students) or 20 years old (for Secondary 5 Normal Stream students)
                                      at Junior Colleges/ Centralised Institute, as at 1st January of the

              <p>I'm studying in express stream now..and I will graduate when I'm 19 years old,which means i will commence the course at age of 20..So does that mean i will not be granted the deferment??</p>
