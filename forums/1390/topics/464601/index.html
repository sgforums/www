              <p>Hi, I am a pre-enlistee, going for my NS CMPB medical checkup in a few days time.</p>
              <p>I have history of a dislocated shoulder. <br>The last known time it
                          popped out was about 2 years ago. <br>I was not able to pull
                          anything or even do pull ups and if I did, it pops easily.
                          <br>However for the past few years, I've been training up the muscles and can now do
                          pull-ups. Also, I am a little heavy, but not obese
                          but borderline above normal BMI range.</p>
              <p>Must I declare my conditions?</p>
              <p>I don't want to spend 2 years doing less physically active combat support vocations. <br>I am
                          actually aiming for command schools (SCS/ OCS). I prefer to get into vocations that are xiong/ siong/ gang-ho/ garang/ cheong sua type rather than PES B2/ C/ E vocations such as medic, signaller, driver, storeman, clerk...etc.</p>
              <p>But if I get into PES B2/C, should I upgrade to at least a
                          B1 with a hospital specialist memo which certified me fit? </p>
              <p>Will Mindef/ SAF take responsibility and compensate me if should I injure my shoulders without declaring honestly and truthfully to CMPB?</p>
              <p>Can I claim any insurance/ training injury compensation from SAF? <br>If I don't declare, SAF insurance policy is null and void?</p>
              <p>What do you think?</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>

              <p>Well you can either risk injuring your shoulder again and a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>possibility of doing permanent damage to your body for the rest of your life (even after you ORD from NS</em></span>), or declare honestly and truthfully to let the MO see if you're combat fit to whichever suitable PES.</p>
              <p>Please don't have the misconception that less physically active vocations means you're not doing something for the country towards nation-building. It isn't that easy either, and there's a lot of things for you to learn albeit not being on the combat frontline deployment.</p>

              <p>No, No, No . Always declare whatever medical problem you have. It is up to them to decide what Pes status to give you. And not for you to decide your own Pes status.</p>
              <p>It got to do with insurance, compension, operational capability and other issues. Don't be narrow minded about it. </p>

              <p>I will tell you the same thing I will tell every person who does not want to declare an old injury or preexisting medical condition: wake up your ideas.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>If you injure your shoulder again, and MINDEF finds out that you did not declare your old injury, they will not take any responsibility for your injury.</strong></em></span> Even if it means your arm was wrenched right out of its socket.</p>
              <p>You may think that you are being selfless by wanting to serve in the frontlines in spite of injury. But from experience, I can say that such an attitude is actually really selfish. As a combat medic specialist I've had to spend far too much time and effort attending to casualties who did not previously declare they were ill or injured because of their gung-ho ness.</p>
              <p>Please do not tie up frontline resources because you want to be siao on. Declare your old injury during the pre-enlistment checkup, and let the MO decide what's best for you.</p>

              <p>long time ago during my BMT. My fellow recruit also dislocated his shoulder... now his palm is permanently facing front, which normal should be facing your thigh.... and he never have doslocation problem before till bmt... can your shoulder take, carrying your weight plus say another 60kg? and do pull-up? can your shoulder take full battle order and doing monket swing? can your shoulder take unarm combat?</p>
              <p> </p>

              military skills to prepare them for advanced vocational training.
              The programme includes weapon training with the SAR 21 rifle which
              will teach recruits technical handling and marksmanship skills; a
              Battle Inoculation Course that simulates a real battlefield; a
              Field Camp which develops basic survival skills; progressive
              training to complete a 24-km route march which builds combat
              fitness and endurance; and hand grenade training.<br> <em style="font: inherit;">For those who fail to achieve the NAPFA
              test silver award, they are required to undergo an 8-week Physical
              Training Phase (PTP) prior to the PES A/B1 BMT.</em><br>  <br> <strong style="font: inherit;">PES BP BMT</strong><br> As evidence has shown that obese recruits are able to achieve
              optimum fitness levels and weight loss in about 19 weeks, the new
              BMT programme for recruits with Body Mass Index (BMI) scores
              exceeding 27.0 will be 19 weeks. This BMT programme is designed to
              help obese recruits improve their physical fitness progressively
              while equipping them with basic soldiering skills and
              knowledge.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><br> <strong style="font: inherit;">PES B2 BMT</strong><br> Enlistees who were PES C1 previously underwent a 7-week BMT
              programme. The new 9-week PES B2 BMT programme will be conducted
              for recruits who are medically fit for deployment in selected
              combat and combat support vocations, such as signal operators,
              combat medics and naval system operators. These recruits will be
              given a new medical classification of PES B2, in place of the
              existing PES C1 classification. This is to ensure that the medical
              classification of our soldiers is consistent with their deployment.
              The new 9-week programme will include customised physical training,
              as well as basic combat training to prepare them for their combat
              and combat support roles.<br>  <br> <strong style="font: inherit;">PES C BMT</strong><br> The 9-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES C recruits. This
              programme will include light physical training and vocational
              training to prepare them for combat service support vocations, such
              as service medic, and those related to logistics and
              administration.<br>  <br> <strong style="font: inherit;">PES E BMT</strong><br> The 4-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES E recruits. This
              programme will focus on, vocational training as well as National
              Education, SAF core values, regimentation and discipline to prepare
              recruits for combat service support vocations.</p>
