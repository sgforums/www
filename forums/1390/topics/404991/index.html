              <p>If you're going for the technical services, like technicians and what know then you would need the relevant qualifications. These vocations would most probably be at the Specialist (Sergeant) level or the newly devised Military Expert Rank Structure.</p>
              <p>The pay scale and what not can be found on the Mindef/SAF recruitment websites. Should be quite easy to check out.</p>
              <p>But if you have any queries, just call the Army Recruitment centre of the recruitment centres of any of the services for queries. I'm sure they would be more than happy to talk to you. They might even invite you down to CMPB to see the brochures and talk to them or what not.</p>
              <p>The Payscale will be according to your rank structure and qualification, i.e degree holders will get a higher pay from diploma holders while holding the same rank and position. </p>
              <p>For Officer and Specialist ranks, you have to start at the bottom and work your way up and your pay will increase with rank. </p>
              <p>For the Military Expert Ranks, i believe they can let you enter even in the middle of higher up depending on your qualification and experience. You'll have to check the Specifics with the recruitment centre of the websites cos i'm still unfamiliar with the exact position you'd enter with a diploma, since this is still a relatively new concept.</p>

              <p>if you're a diploma holder, when you sign on you will get the Military Expert 1 (ME1) rank, equivalent to a first sergeant.</p>
              <p>if you'r a degree holder, you will get the ME4 rank, which is equivalent to a second lieutenant rank.</p>

              <p>Unlike what tarutaru said, there is no guarantee that you will go to OCS if you already applied. Note that you can only sign on the dotted line if you make it to OCS. But there's definitely a higher chance. So apply first, then go BMT, and that will increase your chance. Once confirmed to be in OCS, then you sign. That's the path.</p>
              <p>If you already applied, you can actually clear the necessary tests/medical etc, before you enlist for BMT. So after BMT, what's left is your signature. </p>
              <p>The usual waiting time from BMT to OCS is about 2 weeks. That's not enough time for you to complete your application and sign on etc. I'm talking about if you want to sign on as an air force officer. So you might have to wait in army OCS till the air force side is confirmed.</p>
