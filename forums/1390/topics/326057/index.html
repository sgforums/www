              <p>Hi friends,</p>
              <p>  I'm an NSman, noob to the forum here but i've been lurking around and I find this place very informative, as well as (at times) entertaining...anyway i've a few questions for those well-versed in ICT rules, would appreciate some help!</p>
              <p>-I might be going overseas next year for approx. 3 years. Are there any circumstances under which I might not successfully be granted disruption? (e.g. IPPT, RT obligations) </p>
              <p>-For those who've successfully disrupted, is the process a complicated and time-consuming one? I was from the Navy, btw  =)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks in advance!</p>

              <p>first need to make sure your NS is with NSPC, there you will have no unit. thus no training</p>
              <p>if you have unit, you need to clear IPPT as usual, need ICT also SAF 100 will still be serve to your house address,</p>
              <p>only excuse MOB, cause your name not in unit nomial roll any more, due to you already apply exit permit, or even if you make information of oversea trip notification.</p>
              <p>during MOB activation, area IC will still call you inform of activation, but if you call back unit NSHR, they will inform you if you need to report back, usually area IC list &amp; NSHR list updated version not same.</p>
              <p>best is to serve together with same buddy, for 10 cycle</p>
              <p>if not make up training all new buddy, need more time ice breaking</p>

              <p>I have a qns of my own regarding overseas work trip and ICT.</p>
              <p>As far as i know, I have to travel overseas around Dec 2009 for 3 wks. I heard from my unit that our ICT would be held around Dec 2009 too.</p>

              <p>However, in the event that I do not know whether my overseas trip would clash with my ICT till (say) 5 wks before my ICT, will I still be able to defer my ICT?</p>

              <p>I'm concerned abt my disruption cos i happen to be an officer, so dunno if the requirement would be more stringent.  And i've been going to the gym in case i fail my IPPT and somehow tt becomes an issue. Haha.</p>
