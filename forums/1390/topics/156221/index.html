            <div class='col-md body'>make firm decision base on your judgement, do what u think is right. afterall u are professionally trained. in this case, what if the soldiers are really suffering from heat injury? can the commander simply block u from evacuating them just because he thinks they are chao kenging? lives are at sake here.</div>

If the soldier later diagnose to has malingering intent, <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> .<br>And to answer your question, it be good if a soldier can tell the difference between illegal order and actual order. In general, a soldier should not follow an order that is illegal in nature blindly but do note that in actual operation, certain orders are only made known to a few as it may has an adverse effect on the overall operation strategies and battle outcome.
