              <p>I know it's stupid to ask this question but this is what I will be probably facing in 2 months' time. I failed my IPPT and was required to attend RT. Howver, due to my abnormal working schedule and hours, I had not attend a single RT session and I am now left with only 2 months to complete my RT. The current RT program requires NS Men who failed their IPPT to complete 20 sessions in 2 months which means it's 3 times a week on average. </p>
              <p>I am a daily-rated NEA/Security enforcement officer who has been working on a 6 days/week schedule and due to this hectic schedule and my working hours which runs from early evening till middle of the night. I will receive no pay if I do not work for the day as I am not a full-time worker. I did my best finding an 8-5 job but to no avail! Hence, this is the only job I am holding. My dad just got retrenched a year ago and I have to bear a lot of the family expenses! I simply can't skip a day of work! </p>
              <p>Most RT sessions are catered to office hours working NS Men and not to people like me who work irregular hours. Only weekend sessions are in the mornings and even then, I will be too tired to get up in the early hours for RT as I had worked till middle of the night and even if I forced myself to go through those weekend sessions, there will not be enough time for me to complete 20 sessions in 2 months.</p>
              <p>Therefore, I am preparing myself for a charge from CMPB. I am worried about how the charge might turn out! How much will I be fined as a 1st-time RT defaulter? Will the officer even bother buying my explanation and let me get away with a defered RT schedule?</p>

              <p>Friend, I don't know the penalty but even if it were just a fine, it would be more per sesson than your daily wage.</p>
              <p>If it were cheap, lots of people esp the rich would be paying it off.</p>
