              <p>What I was thinking was, to try getting a pilot position (try the compass test and pass) if possible, get into WSO (Fighter) because i am actually into fighter planes more than pilots but dun mind being pilot cos pay is o.o I also know that its tough to get in, so I was wondering, what if i fail... are my choices left with only rsaf vocations?</p>
              <p>I dun mind trying out ndu if i cant get into pilot, i know its another tough unit to get in, but im just trying to rank all these according to pay wise. i dun mind those chionging which i think i can endure. i use tink cos i haven tried, yes i havent. dun tell me 'you cannot tink, you MUST endure' or things like tat. my decisions cant let me try first cos too many. YES i cant make up my mind, thats why im having this thread so dun tell me if i cant make up my mind better dun sign on, im just here to enqure thanks :)</p>
              <p>IF lets say cannot, i was tinking of cdo officer or maybe just a normal officer if no choice. all these are ranked by pay wise. I just wan to know is it possible to 'try'. like just go for assessment, but what if pass or wad or wad or blahblahblah, are there any backup plans.</p>
              <p>i know i am not the one to choose the vocation becos i talk like i can get into this and that, im just saying...</p>

              <p>you dont need to think so much. just go for the pilot assessment and if you can make it in the first few round, then you can go anywhere if you OOC. if you cannot fly the plane, they will ask you shoot  missile, if not fly chopper, or technician support. </p>
              <p>The point is not about money. The point is if you like the job. </p>
              <p>Have you go camping in jungle during your NCC, NPCC days? do you like doing it for the rest of your life? </p>
              <p>Do you like patrolling 3 am in the middle of the night in the jungle, eating combat ration, wet, muddy and not being able to bathe for a week plus? </p>
              <p>I just meet my friend yesterday, leaving her office at 6 pm sharp. Compare to her previous job as a Navy officer, certainly it is better than doing a night watch at 3 am in the night? Even for a lower pay, obviously she is more cheerful and happier. </p>
              <p>The only thing that restrict you is your medical health and mind. If you are medical fit and "interested". the rest can be trained up. </p>

              <p>Lokey:  yah i believe that whether or not i like the job its one of the factors, but i also believe that money plays a big part too. im just trying to find out more of the paths so i can make a clearer decision on what i want to do. I am also trying to find my interest in private sectors, but nth seem to interest me. So im tinking, maybe just look at pay and try to become interested in what i do, because i dun have one to begin with.</p>
              <p>stellazio: haha yah i will definitely try my best for a pilot, but i believe everyone that went to try for a pilot did their best, but many failed. so what if i also failed, i wanna know are their any other vocations i can choose other than airforce</p>

              <p>Don't listen to that rambling idiot named Lokey. He's renowned for talking shit in the forum and trying hard to convince everyone that he flunked in his NS stint but is doing so well with his farmer qualifications in the "private sector".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nobody in the private sector who leaves the office at 6pm (except for traders, and that's because they start work at 5am) is worth any salt, so you can ignore the bullshit that he spewed to you about his "friend" on "nightwatch" either. He's just a jealous bullshitter pretending to dispense "objective" advice to innocent young boys interested in the SAF so he could convince himself he isn't the loser that he most certainly is. </p>
