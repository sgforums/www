            <div class='col-md body'>lol@venny again. Did I condemn all MPs because of what happened this COG? I suggest you <strong>reread everything</strong>, I said this bunch of xin jiaos acting like clowns and their chief instructor is the biggest clown ever in SPDS history. Unless you're the chief instructor that I'm flaming, I don't think you have to respond with such vigilance as if you were the founding father of SPDS.<br><br>By the way, Saint was saying some commanders act without considering issues of manpower and experience, I merely agreed. You need to L2Read forums properly.<br><br><blockquote>do you even know wats the req to get that drill badge?</blockquote> wowh4x apparently I don't know what's required but somehow that badge is my closet along with a #1, peak cap + accessory.

            <div class='col-md body'>venny, you seem very upset by us flaming those performers. However, if you were really old school, you'd be as enraged as we are. This kinds of makes me suspect that you aren't old school, perhaps you're even on of the performers. In which case, i apologise for the harsh criticisms, since its true there are so many factors that are to blame (ie the guys are too new, their workload too much...)<br>but however, LOL at the sgt standing in front. really no excuses for him... he's a regular and hes been in apc for some time.... this one i know for a fact.</div>

I reckon that this SPDS be disbanded and that 1sg be punished, to save further humiliation to old timers..... this is really sad...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>u mus be never gone for many ndp rehearsals before. the air force contingent shows the best drills every year de... navy always the worst....  (dont quote me on that)  </blockquote>Nope, I kena three national parades before. NDP both years during NS (albeit one as mobile column) &amp; a Military Tattoo during reservist. If you wanna count all rehearsals plus the real thing, then my ante is 20-plus trips to the National Stadium *sob* Taught a mono-intake batch &amp; performed for a military funeral too. Hence long-realized how Hokkien peng tend to be completely clueless with the Malay language, let alone unfamiliar drill commands.<br><br>Of course, you're referring to the GOH contingents. They're more conspicious &amp; generally solid, but IMO not as sharp as those Police units I've seen. Mata side really drill siong-siong! Even NCC Land cannot fight with NPCC, in my days. Then again, it's our Malay brethen who get posted more to wear the blue, so they have the advantage of both language &amp; a proud historical heritage.<br><br>As for the drill snafu, I'm more bummed that it was caught on video. Meaning it's recorded for prosperity, leaving SAFPU one heck of a mess to live down. But they know the occasion was the Istana COG, so WTF happened?</div>

Now the strength have downsize but the requirements of a simple contingent stays . Which equates to having divided dedication to perform more demanding tasks. LIke i said, some jobs that need to be specialised , have to be specialised . But the higher ups refuse to acknowledge the severe situation n choose a convient n short-term solution to solve a long term problem. They making every1 jacks of all trades masters of none n they wishes to uphold the reputation with these shiit ?? They make a mockery out of the command n end up punishing the overworked nsfs over the mistake they failed to point out 1yr ago.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>that's why when such things happen, it is up to the direct superiors of the NSF performers to help defend their men. Shouldn't the OC, 2I/C or PC of these NSFs help voice out the implications such a downsize would mean to the higher ups? In which case I see that these NSFs were pushed to do all thes shit because their direct superiors fark care them and this is dereliction of duty by their commanders. Im sure the higher ups would listen and take into serious consideration the consequences had the squad's commanders voice out their concerns since this involves the reputation of MP command.</div>
