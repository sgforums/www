            <div class='col-md body'>i second melmoth's point. hmmm. i was once from mp too. it was my friend that informed me of this youtube video. not totally venny's fault too but venny, judging by all the comments posted, i think 1 or 2 are previously or currently mps. i don't see much flaming but its only natural that if points of views can't be gotten across face to face you tend to get frustrated at all these wretched changes taking place yet you feel you can't voice it out. and even if you've voiced it out, nothing seems to have changed- the irony of it all eh?<br><br>judging from that video- i was there with my mates that very sunday. i tell you. the claps sounded forced unlike last month's all the many months before then. anyone without prior knowledge in 'spds' would have known that all of them were making grave mistakes. this isn't a state event. but the purpose of this COG - change of guards is to project our old dying traditions for the world to see..and these performances obviously should have reached a certain standard before you project it for all to see. look at the previous few youtube videos [b](seriously you gotta see the difference)[b] -<br><br>1) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2VYc59lUSM - april cog 2006<br>2) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mHk-2oTpS0 - september cog 2006<br>3) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa_Vwe5SmMA - JANUARY cog 2007<br><br>even a date as recent as january.<br><br>i'm a firm follower of strict discipline and hardwork hence reaping rewards on stage. none of these 'rewards' would have been possible without conscientious effort or the willpower to overcome weakness in the human spirit. i've been following the change of guards performances very closely and always waiting for new videos of spds to be posted. but the recent one that was posted was horrific. venny..if you're able to find 100 spds performers from the past, chief instructor or not, i'm sure all 100 would tell you the same thing.<br><br>they can go f -u-c- k off. its the cold hard truth. no 2 ways bout it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>venny, you still fail to realise that COG is performed on Istana grounds and is hence a major affair. So what if u've seen bigger parades with foreign dignitaries and pple making mistakes and gettting charge? have u actually seen the video? its not one, two or three mistakes, the entire squad was screwed up, by comparison, this is worse than a bigger parade but with 2 or 3 mistakes. Well, i sure hope the instructor gets charged for disgracing the show when the performers are <strong>supposed to be the show</strong>...<br><br>hey u can check out the comments left on the video, pple are saying that NCC can do better etc, if you get that kinda comments, then we're certainly not making a mountain out of a molehill....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah looks like people have really started talking bout it. lets hope also that this sorta spur them on to perform better. i don't ask for much. no need to impress me with different or new and fanciful drills. just do a safe performance without errors, and i believe that is the only way that would truly silence the world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>not going to speculate who is the 1sg, but it should be pretty obvious by now<br><br>and the whole squad are NSFs except for the 1sg....<br><br>training, uniform, boots, conduct are wholly managed by NSFs. All the instructors are NSFs, they are the ones who conduct trainings, and yes, training is very very xiong, rifle warm ups, running around parade squares, all these are conducted by NSF instructors. All these are done the same way since 1984, when SPDS was first passed onto Singapore by Taiwanese trainers. so far, standards have been high until this recent show....<br><br>and there is a spds spec whom the NSF instructors answer to. A squad's morale and capability hinges on the SPDS spec. IF the SPDS spec is up, then the men are up, but if SPEC cui, men also cui...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there is an OC officer in charge who picks the SPDS spec but basically he leaves the running of the whole SPDS to this spec because officers are not trained in SPDS.At least in our time that was the case.<br><br>Generally the Spec would not go out and perform because the men would have better drills then him because they train more/harder.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it simply doesn't sound right. who on earth passed down the instruction for the removal of the video? by right this video belongs to the poster- the host. if they've requested to remove the video, on what grounds do they have to ask for such thing? simply outrageous.<br><br>army amazes me the way it works.</div>
