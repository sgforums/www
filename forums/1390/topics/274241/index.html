When the whole farking thing screws up, it means they aren't ready. And if they aren't ready but they are made to perform, that means upstairs are farked up.

            <div class='col-md body'>the manpower issue should not be a pathetic excuse for the horrendous show put up on Istana grounds. Many Singaporeans old and young head down to the istana every 1st sunda of the month to watch this tradition and the least the spds members could do is to put up a decent show to impress the crowd and not let them come down in vain.<br><br>But I do not place the blame entirely on the performers, judging from the show, i say that they lack practice and experience and all these could be accomplished if only they were allocated enough time and given the right instructors. I blame their superiors more than anything else. The men cant do shit if their commanders are a bunch of bumbling fools who think that SPDS is of secondary importance.<br><br>This is really shameful, their OC should be punished...</div>

Many Singaporeans old and young head down to the istana every 1st sunda of the month to watch this tradition and the least the spds members could do is to put up a decent show to impress the crowd and not let them come down in vain.<br><br>But I do not place the blame entirely on the performers, judging from the show, i say that they lack practice and experience and all these could be accomplished if only they were allocated enough time and given the right instructors. I blame their superiors more than anything else. The men cant do shit if their commanders are a bunch of bumbling fools who think that SPDS is of secondary importance.<br><br>This is really shameful, their OC should be punished...</div></blockquote>probably, cos i haven seen what drills those guys did , thus i have no idea on the degree of horrendous-ness u said . Well, sad but true on ur 2nd point, the commanders r really F*** up imo . To redeem their own mistakes , they simply pull ppl here n there to piece up the require 72m or whatever number is required for a contingent . It is pathetic, i have friends prior ording in 3mths going to parades whom did not go through spds at all. They r just the sacrifical lambs to the horrible restructing of mp comd. Men is severly lacking in numbers yet the workload seemed to be increasing. Spec on the other hand has not been hit as much. Imagine GD, 8m 1spec. The ratio says it all .<br><br>Im not seeking any pity or what here , but merely voicing a inner voice for many of the fellow mps who have n are suffering but who the hell knows? Even the new COs oso bo chap , just wan to implement this n tat not knowing how hard it hits. Like u burn wkends for combat shoots , u get off inlieus , the same applies to burning wkends for parades but they r denied. Maintaining the standard requires smart microing at commander's lvl , u give us the sweets u get the fruits of labour.With morale at all time low we just want to fark off fast from mpcomd lol <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in the past SAFPU has shown flexibility and postphoned the Istana COG when there were manpower/standard issues.Perhaps that should be done until something is done about the present situation(whole show looking like a bunch of clowns in white helmets-the only thing missing is after screwing up the whole show they actually burst out laughing cuz that's what it looked like what was about to happen..that'll make my day man)</div>
