            <div class='col-md body'>Anyone who has watched a defencewatch video will know that SAF SNCOs and officers, whilst adept at talking down to troops and generally shouting alot, seem to melt into bluberring, stuttering shades of their normal selves when they have a big black mike and cam shoved into their faces.<br><br>Look for eg at this video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iB68p6fz3Wc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iB68p6fz3Wc</a><br><br>The 42 SAR CO, a major no less, is obviously in need of more media training. He very clearly suffers from nervousness and can only manage halting english. (<span style="font-style: italic;">edit: Just had another look, another person interviewed, the 'Commander' of 4 SAB is an LTC and he is worse than the Major</span>)<br><br>(IMO the 3SG was great - he sounded confident and fluent)<br><br>Similarly, looking at the SAF Urban Ops video (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yU2OgjmyDU)" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yU2OgjmyDU)</a>, we see an OC ( a capt I think) and a PS (IIRC 1SG) being interviewed about SAF's urban Ops capability. They looked and sounded really bad. More importantly, they sounded unconvincing.<br><br>These videos have been put up on the net and are available for viewing by just about anyone with an internet conenction. They very clearly do not put the SAF in the best possible light. I think that there is much improvement to be made here.<br><br>I would suggest that OCC and PS course include a module on handling the media. If it already is being taught, then I have to say someone somewhere is not doing their jobs because from what I have seen these people need more coaching. Perhaps every battalion and above should have a media liaison Officer. He, being part of the unit, will know who is fit to appear before the camera and who isn't. He can also be in charge of arranging media training for those scheduled to appear on camera.<br><br>Some would of course argue that OCs should be taking on this role already but it is apparent that they are not very good at it - in the first video, only the 3SG appears fit to appear on camera. The CPT. commanding a Bionix II looks the part but I haven't heard him speak... Maybe a few more 'directives' should be let loose into the SAF email system to remind OCs..?<br><br>Thoughts?!<br><br>[PS: You can submit this to GEMS and claim all the credit but keep the thread updated on progress! - a portion of the prize money would be nice too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ]</div>
