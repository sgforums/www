              <p>As far as I know, SAF only recognised NTU, NUS and SMU.</p>
              <p>If you sign on as a diploma they would not let you do a degree, as this is irrelevant to them. I dont think they also let you disrupt for degree either, as you are already full-time employed. You can get a local merit award and do uni. This road is different from the scheme A and B.</p>

              Hi Winston nga93, 
              1) Not advisable to sign on with a diploma if you eventually plan to get a degree. As a diploma holder, you would only be able to sign on as a specialist or junior military expert. You will NOT be automatically converted to an officer or senior military expert upon getting a degree.
              
              I have a few specialist friends whom I know who got a degree and ended up leaving the service.
              
              If you are considering a field such as engineering, PM me for more info :)
              
              2) Haven't heard of local merit award. But here are the requirements for local study award.

              Ah, I stand corrected. Diploma holder who sign on as officers will be on Scheme A and Degree holder who sign on will be on Scheme B.
              
              I would suggest you check with Army Recruitment Centre (http://www.mindef.gov.sg/arc/ or call them at 1800-OUR ARMY (687 2769) ) for exact details on the officers' scheme.
              
              Yes, you can get selected for OCS or SCS as an NSF provided you meet the requirements.

              I am a regular now and have many friends who have gone through different education routes in their SAF career. Let me map out some of the routes you can take as a diploma holder thinking of signing on.
              
              Route 1: Sign on as a diploma holder as serve as a officer with diploma as your highest qualification. You will be placed into scheme A, which is the lowest paying officer scheme. I'm not sure how long the bond is, you can check it out online or call mindef recruitment. 
              
              Route 2: Sign on as a diploma holder and get into a recognized local university, NUS, NTU or SMU, or any recognized overseas universities, Australia, US, UK or Canada etc. As long as you get a place in any recognized local or overseas universities, mindef will give you the Local Study Award (LSA) which provides you with school fees. Mindef will only give you the amount equivalent to local university rates, so if you're thinking of studying overseas, you'll have to top up with your own money. The LSA bond is 4 years.
              
              Route 3: Sign on as a diploma holder. If you did well in poly, you can try for the SAF Academic Scholarship (SAS) Local or Overseas. SAF will then pay for your university. If you get the SAS Local and want to study overseas, you'll have to top up like the LSA. If you get the SAS Overseas, then Mindef will pay your full school fees for an overseas unviersity and give you monthly pay. The bond for SAS is 6 years may it be local or overseas.
              
              Route 4: If you do extremely well in Poly, you can try to get the SAF Merit Scholarship (SMS). This is more difficult to get. if you want to know more about it you can ask.
              
              Hope this helps!

            <div class='col-md body'>Oops i forgot to add. If you decide to sign on with your diploma without going to get your degree, you'll be placed into Scheme A. If you have a degree from any recognized university both local or overseas, you'll be automatically be placed in Scheme B. If you get the SAS Overseas, SMS or SAFOS scholarships, you can go for an interview to try to get into Scheme C. If you fail the interview, you'll be placed into Scheme B.</div>

              <p>SIM hold the course but it is awarded by other university.</p>
              <p>For example: Bac of Business (Marketing) is awarded by RMIT university. So the cert is printed with SIM and RMIT logo.</p>

              <p>These guys are right. Why make a decision to sign away 4 years of your life at the age of 18, before experiencing a day of military life, when you can make a more informed decision after your studies.</p>
              <p>BTW you can get an additional bounty only if you sign on during BMT (not a day later). Repayable if you break the contract. That's something I would not be tempted by.</p>
