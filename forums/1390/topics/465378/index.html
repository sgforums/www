              <p>As a NSman, you may be called up for various NS activities, one of 
                      which is the In-Camp Training (ICT). Every ICT aims to strengthen you in
                       a set of specific skill and there may be slight variations in the 
                      conduct of the ICT in different formations. <br> <br> <strong>What is the nature of ICT Notification?</strong><br> During the first 6 months after you completed full-time NS, you may be called up for NS activities not more than 4 hours. <br> <br> Thereafter, every NS work year, you may be called up to a maximum of 40 days of Operationally Ready National Service (ORNS). <br> <br> Or in the case where you are called up for more than 40 days in one work
                       year, you are required to seek agreement with your employer for this 
                      extended service. Both you and your employer will then have to sign an 
                      undertaking to indicate acceptance of the arrangement.<br> <br> The duration of your call-up may be as follows:</p>
              <ol>
              <li><strong>Low Key (LK) Training and Make-Up Training (MUT)</strong><br> These refer to trainings that are between 2 to 6 days and you will be notified 3 months in advance.<br> </li>
              <li><strong>High Key (HK) Training</strong><br> These trainings are usually 7 days and longer and you will be notified 6 months in advance.<br> </li>
              <li><strong>Call-Up Activities</strong><br> These activities may last 1 day or less and you will be notified 2 months in advance.<br> <br> <strong>What are the types of Call-Up?</strong> 
              <ul>
              <li>In-Camp Training (ICT)</li>
              <li>Flexi-ICT/Multiple ICT (for Air Force NSmen or doctors)<br> </li>
              <li>Upgrading Courses<br> </li>

              <li>Make-Up Training (MUT)<br> </li>
              <li>Re-Training </li>
              <li>Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT)</li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              </ol>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>How will I be notified of my training?</strong><br> You are required to update your personal particulars in <strong><a href="https://www.ns.sg/nsp/web/esvcs/mindef/selfupd/main">eSelf-Update</a></strong> on NS Portal (<a href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a>). MyCall-Up (MCU) will broadcast your NS call-up notifications either through SMS or email to your provided personal details.<br> <br> Your NS call-up notifications will be broadcasted over 2 consecutive 
                  days at 2115 hours. You are required to acknowledge the call-up on NS 
                  Portal (<a href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a>) or by 
                  calling the 6-HINSMEN (6446 7636). Failing to do so after 10 days, a 
                  hard copy SAF100 will be sent to your official address via registered 
                  mail.<br> <br> Upon receipt of the call-up, you have to inform your employer either via
                   a printed copy or forwarding the soft copy of the eSAF100 on NS Portal (<a href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a>) as official documentation as their reference.<br> <br> Sample of the broadcast message:</p>
              <div class="pic_box" style="width: 250px; float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
              <div class="big_pic" style="height: 278px;"><img class="cq-dd-image" src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/content/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/nsmatters/nsmen/roles_as_nsmen/requirements/_jcr_content/par/expandcollapse_0/expandcollapse_par/textimage_1/image.cuimg.250.278.png/1348648765931.jpg" alt=""></div>
              </div>
              <p>You will receive advance notification before every ICT so as 
                  to minimise disruption and inconvenience to your work schedules and also
                   allow your employer ample time to make necessary arrangements, if 
                  needed.<br> <br> Note that if you do not attend your scheduled NS training without 
                  official leave, you will be tagged as being “Absent Without Official 
                  Leave” (AWOL) from your place of duty. Disciplinary action will be taken
                   against you.</p>
              <p><strong>What happens if I am unable to attend ICT?</strong><br> Every NSman’s role is vital for a cohesive training with other NSmen 
                  from your unit and it is therefore important that you refresh your 
                  skills to ensure smooth operation as a team.  As such, your absence from
                   ICT will affect the training and operational readiness of your unit. 
                  While MINDEF exercises flexibility in granting deferment, every case 
                  will be carefully assessed and weigh against the impact on operational 
                  readiness. <br> <br> Having assessed the genuineness and severity of the case submitted, 
                  considered the training requirements, your proficiency level, attendance
                   records and past performances, the unit commanding officer may grant 
                  you a deferment.<br> <br> <strong>What is a deferment and how do I apply?</strong><br> Deferment refers to a postponement of a specific In-Camp Training (ICT).<br> <br> You can login to <a href="https://www.ns.sg/nsp/web/esvcs/mindef/mydefer/main"><strong>MyDeferment</strong></a> in NS Portal (<a href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a>)
                   to apply online. You are responsible for your own deferment application
                   and all supporting documents and information by your employers or other
                   sources much be attached together with your application.<br> <br> <strong>What are the considerations for deferment application?</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>New employment or newly established business<br> </li>
              <li>Marriage and Honeymoon<br> </li>
              <li>Compassionate grounds (e.g. wife’s delivery, serious illness or death in the family)<br> </li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>How does this work?</strong><br> The NS Training Cycle is a <strong>continuation of your active unit training cycle</strong>.
                       As such, you are expected to still be able to apply your military 
                      skills and knowledge when you return for your In-Camp Training (ICT).<br> <br> This is a 10-year NS Unit Training Cycle and each stage will last for 3 
                      to 4 NS years. The NS Unit Training Cycle is divided into the following 3
                       stages:</p>

              <div>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Stage 1: Strengthening Stage</strong><br> This stage focuses on individual and team proficiencies with the aim to 
                      maintain Ops Readiness. It is also termed as the ‘IHL years’ as many 
                      will be pursuing IHL studies.<br> </li>
              <li><strong>Stage 2: Sharpening Stage</strong><br> This stage focuses on unit proficiency culminating at each Unit’s ATEC 
                      evaluation, in which the entire unit will be evaluated on its war 
                      fighting capabilities.<br> </li>
              <li><strong>Stage 3: Sustain Stage</strong><br> In this final stage, it is to continually focus on <strong>Ops Readiness and integrated training</strong>.
                       The milestone event will be to phase the NS Unit to Army Operational 
                      Reserves and the NSmen to MINDEF Reserves (MR). This is usually 
                      commemorated during a <strong>MR Parade/Ceremony</strong> in the presence of the NSmen’s families and employers.<br> </li>
              </ul>
              <p>During each ICT, your Unit Commander will stipulate a set of 
                      performance standards to be achieved. You are encouraged therefore, to 
                      train yourself up physically and be mentally prepared for the tough 
                      training. <br> <br> Note that if you fail to meet the required performance standards, you 
                      will be subjected to corrective training. That is, your Unit Commander 
                      may decide to serve you additional NS call-up for Make-Up Training 
                      (MUT).<br> <br> <strong>What are the Training Institutes?</strong><br> For a more holistic and effective training management for the various 
                      arms, the NSmen’s training are now managed by the respective Training 
                      Institutes (TIs). You will then report back to your respective TI for 
                      your NS training during your ICT:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Armour Training Institute (ATI)</li>
              <li>Army Logistics Training Institute (ALTI)</li>
              <li>Artillery Institute (AI)</li>
              <li>Commando Training Institute (CTI)<br> </li>
              <li>Engineer Training Institute (ETI)<br> </li>
              <li>Infantry Training Institute (ITI)<br> </li>
              <li>Signal Institute (SI)<br> </li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>What happens after I completed my NS Training Cycle?</strong><br> Once you have completed your NS training Cycle, you will be posted to 
                      the MINDEF Reserve (MR) List and be presented with a Certificate of 
                      Appreciation. You may also be given a watch upon the completion of your 
                      10 years of ORNS or your ORNS training cycle, whichever is earlier. <br> <br> While in MR, you may still be activated during operational exigencies. 
                      As an Officer, you remain liable for NS up to age 50 and 40, if you are 
                      an Army Warrant Officers and Specialist (WOSE). Note that you are to 
                      disregard your previous unit’s mobilisation codewords as you are no 
                      longer required to report for mobilisation activation for your previous 
                      units. A new codeword will be assigned to you accordingly should you be 
                      mobilised while you are in MR. If you are travelling overseas for 6 
                      months or more, you are still required to apply for Exit Permit.<br> <br> <strong>How can I be in contact?</strong><br> You are encouraged to remain your contact with your NS Unit and buddies 
                      so that they can be your source of help should you require any queries 
                      pertaining to your ORNS matters. <br> <br> Alternatively, you may refer to the followings:</p>

              <p>7 high and 3 low is correct. But we must understand the meaning if the high and low first. High means if not mistaken more then 7 days ict while low means no ict or up to 6 days ict.</p>
              <p>next high also means not exceeding 40 days per year. So means they can actually call you 2 times or more per calendar year but not exceeding 40 days. </p>
              <p>Next must understand saf calendar yr is from April to march. So if 1 ict in jan they can have another ict in April .</p>
