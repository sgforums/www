              <p>Nowadays the economy is very bad very hard to find jobs.</p>
              <p>I am thinking of taking this time to write a storybook based on the true story on my army life. I want to write about how I chao keng in the arm, how my superiors chao keng etc and how I managed to survive my 2 years in the army without getting any extra duties, confinement etc. If the storybook can become very popular I might just end up as a millionaire.</p>
              <p>I think alot of people will be interested in buying the book espically young singaporeans who have not yet served NS as they will be interested on some tips on how to survive NS and the book will give them some ideas on how NS is like so they can be mentally prepared when it is their turn to serve NS.</p>
              <p>Do you think this is a good idea.</p>
              <p>Even though I have already ORD, I am still liable for reservaits. I am afraid that the army wouldn't let me off and charge me if the book is really published.</p>

              <p>as for being sued etc., relac lah.....u can always call army hq and confirm with them first before you start writing.</p>
              <p>heard there was a similar book published some years back and nothing happened, as long as you don't include pics / instructions / maps of the individual army camps and and other SAF secrets.</p>

              <p>Remember when all of us ORDed, we signed the Official Secrets Act. The way i see it, the Government will never allow a book that tells all about NS, dirt and all. Nevermind that the book does not reveal SOPs or other classified material. They would just say the book will demoralise currently serving NSFs or some other bureaucratic nonsense,</p>
              <p>Try publishing it in Australia or some other country. But then it wont be exposed to Singaporeans cos it would probably be banned. Use pseudonyms and nom de guerres for the contributors.</p>
              <p>United Kingdom did do the same thing when one of the Bravo Two Zero members wanted to write a book about the experience, but the member finally did manage to publish. Its called "Soldier Five" or something like that. The member was a former UK SAS soldier born in New Zealand.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>From what I remember that blog detailed quite a lot of sensitive information about SAF overseas exercises, complete with pictures. It sounds like your book is more like a handbook for people who want to chao keng. To be honest, even if it doesn't contravene any SAF official secrets act, it serves to demoralise incoming NSFs and definitely goes against the spirit of why NS was conceived- first national defence and second bond building. So, yes you will not be allowed, and if you tried, even if they don't hunt you down and slap you with charges (which I doubt they will), your book will be recalled.</p></div>

              <p>It's natural to want to help others, but do bear in mind the context of what you are writing. <br><br>First and foremost, organisational goals run contrary to what you deem as beneficial, simply because "chao keng" actually harms effectiveness of any military.</p>
              <p>Think about it logically, while books have been written about experiences in NS, you can be sure they will be quite dismissive of any attempt to instil a sense of malingering in the soldiers-to-be, in this sense.</p>

              <p>I totally support you TS...just that, I know of a book named NS
              something journal. It also is somewhat like the book you most
              probably are going to publish. I saw my 3SG reading it in office.
              Didnt have a chance to see what the content was, but is roughly
              about army, recruit life, what will happen after BMT, etc.</p>
              <p>If I managed to find the title, I let you know again...see if
              anyone knows about this book.</p>

              <p>I think I know which book you are referring to, it was quite a nice read.</p>
              <p>But like I said, and many others have mentioned, a book about chao keng-ing is another matter all together.</p>

              <p>Nowadays the economy is very bad very hard to find jobs.</p>
              <p>I am thinking of taking this time to write a storybook based on the true story on my army life. I want to write about how I chao keng in the arm, how my superiors chao keng etc and how I managed to survive my 2 years in the army without getting any extra duties, confinement etc. If the storybook can become very popular I might just end up as a millionaire.</p>
              <p>I think alot of people will be interested in buying the book espically young singaporeans who have not yet served NS as they will be interested on some tips on how to survive NS and the book will give them some ideas on how NS is like so they can be mentally prepared when it is their turn to serve NS.</p>
              <p>Do you think this is a good idea.</p>
              <p>Even though I have already ORD, I am still liable for reservaits. I am afraid that the army wouldn't let me off and charge me if the book is really published.</p>
