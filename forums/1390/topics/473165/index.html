              <p>Hi!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I just went for my medical checkup today and all was fine.</p>
              <p>Then proceeded to the room to take the MAPAS/VAC test.</p>
              <p>Whilst doing it, happen to calculate slower on some questions or overthink on some of the questions which led to it being skipped by accident, question is. </p>
              <p>Would accidentally skipping (automatically) or having some incomplete questions affect my future vocation postings?</p>
              <p>Anyone encountered such issues before? Due to the system going onto the next question coz you take a lil more time than usual? </p>
              <p>Thanks!</p>

              <p>After you have completed the medical screening, you will sit for a 
              computer-based Manpower APtitude Assessment System (MAPAS) test. MAPAS 
              consists of a series of tests (e.g. psychomotor skills, mental-spatial 
              ability, etc.) to assess the mental abilities of <abbr title="Full-time National Servicemen">NSFs</abbr>.
               The test scores are used to place servicemen in vocations/appointments 
              where their abilities can be best used. The entire test is about 2½ 
              hours.</p>

              <p>The Vocational Assessment Centre (VAC) conducts a battery of
              tests called the Manpower Aptitude Assessment System (MAPAS) to
              assess your mental abilities. This is so that we can maximize our
              limited manpower by putting people where their abilities can be

              which include assignment to a vocation and selection to be a

              tests well and accurately, as this will not only help the nation
              maximize it's limited manpower, but also help us place you into

Some of the mental abilities that we measure include memory, speed of responding, abstract reasoning, following complex instructions, solving mathematical problems, mental spatial ability, and psycho-motor skills. Please click on the following links to try out some of these tests.<br><br>a) Word analogies<br>b) Number reasoning<br>c) Picture reasoning<br><br>All the sub-tests are computer administered. Most of the sub-tests will present a problem or question on the screen and you will need to respond accordingly. Some sub-tests however, measure speed or hand-eye co-ordination and may look like simple computer games.<br><br><strong>How long is the test at VAC</strong><br><br>Since we have to be as accurate as possible, we need to measure as wide a range of your abilities as is possible. Thus, the testing will require about 2 to 2 1/2 hours of your time.<br><br><strong>What to do</strong><br><br>Do not worry too much. All we require you to do is to do your best. Each sub-test has instructions to guide you on what to do.<br>Ask for help: If you have problems understanding any of the sub-tests or the instructions during testing, there will be people on-site to help you.<br>Get a good night's sleep.
