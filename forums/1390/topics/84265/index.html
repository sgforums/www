            <div class='col-md body'>149 Squadron<br><br>149 Squadron, formed on 1 Jun 1985, is one of RSAF’s air interceptor squadrons.<br><br>The Squadron operates the F-5S/T Tiger, a highly manoeuvrable, supersonic fighter aircraft in RSAF’s inventory. Equipped with state-of the art avionics, the aircraft are capable of carrying out Air-to Air and Air-to-Ground missions. In Air-to-Air operations, it is employed to patrol and maintain the sovereignty of Singapore’s airspace. In Air-to-Ground missions, the F-5S/T aircraft are capable of strategic interdiction, battlefield air interdiction and close air support.<br><br>In work year 03/04, the Squadron participated in several major exercises such as Major ADEX, which involved the Five Power Defence Arrangement (FPDA) countries. In addition, the Squadron also participated in other exercises such as Cope Tiger and Commando Sling.<br><br>The Squadron achieved an unprecedented zero non-conformance record during the work year 03/04. This first ever achievement by any Squadron is one of the reasons why 149 Squadron clinched the best fighter Squadron award for the 4th time since its formation.<br><br>The Shikra is 149 Squadron’s adopted mascot. Swift and fearless, the small yet aggressive falcon strikes her prey with lightning speed and deadly attacks. The Squadron’s “Steadfast” motto parallels the Shikra’s assertive and bold nature when it’s home is disturbed.<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/safday/2004/images/bestunits/149sqn1_sml.jpg"><br>The fighting Shikras celebrating their 4th win since the formation<br>of 149 squadron.<br><br>-- <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/safday/2004/awards_fighter.asp" rel="nofollow">SAF Day Website</a></div>
