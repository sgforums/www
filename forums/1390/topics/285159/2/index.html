Its mostly JC intake with abit of poly and maybe ITE who were left out of the previous intakes, graduated later than the rest or PHD (poly halfway dropouts) School 1 and sch 2 will normally split up the intakes but my time sch 1 seems to take in mostly the mild obese since the batch after mine had 4 company of mild obese and 1 severely obese batch. If you are not obese then i think you would mostly land up in Bronco, Charlie, Falcon, Hawk or Jaguar.<br><br>2. School 1 is nearer to the jungle etc but i don't really think you get that much more mosquitoes. Its during field camp and Sit Test that you should worry about those 'commando' mosquitoes.<br><br>3. Regarding facilities, nothing much to compare to me. Besides the bunks which school 1 might have been build earlier, the rest of the facilities are mostly shared. School 2 canteen and cookhouse is better than school 1 though according to most people.<br><br>4. BMT systems is hard to really say, for my time at least, it seems that all the sch 1 coy don't do 5BX in the morning. The only time i did 5bx was only during 1 morning in field camp and thats all. Heard that school 2 needs to do it all the time if not often but that was during my time which is already over 2 yrs back.<br><br>5. During my time, F and J were said to be more xiong, B was a warrent coy which normally seems to be better than the 2LTs which likes give wierd punishments, H used to be quite welfare (i was there) but i heard the OC and CSM changed already so things might be different now. C i have no idea.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Socks Policy : Changed in 2004 when new CO/Comd agreed that its stupid to issue Sch 2 recruits white socks and not use it.<br><br>Soap Policy : Ok to use it, no more "wayang" stand by bed. Just don't drop it in shower.<br><br>Mosquito : School 1 more mosquito because nearer to jungle. Any fumigation attempts have not really got rid of mosquitos.<br><br>Xiongness Policy : BMTC is a ISO-9002 certified entity and BMT program is ISO-9002 certified.  Any degree of xiongness is hence the discretion of OC/CSM. Otherwise "in theory" xiongness is the same.  Warrant Companies tend to be "more slack" not because they are, but rather because they are experieced in training and hence impart to you what is needed and more organised.<br><br>Google Earth Picture : Not update, but if you log into Google Earth nowdays it will show the land reclamation progress. The jetty is like in a Bay now.<br><br>Repainting : BMTC was entirely repainted as of earlier this year. no more bright pastel colours.<br><br>Batches : First half of the year generally JC batch since they would just finished As. Second Half is Poly. This only apply to BMT with Leadership Package. PES C/E BMT is mixed. Twice/Thrice everyyear there will be a batch for O level or less, but typically warrant companies.<br><br>Viper : For the longest time the CSM was KE Chua. But the current OC is a female now.<br><br></div>
