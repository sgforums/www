              With so many elite scholars in the SAF still cannot keep people from quiting?
              
              Either the elite scholars are not working or there are really serious problems in the SAF

              <p><br>in places like SAF and SPF, you require a LOT of kar kia and a few leaders...</p>
              <p>unfortunately, in the SAF and SPF, we have truckloads of lea-duhs and not enough kar kia... and they pay the kar kia a pittance to do the majority of the work while they pay the lea-duhs unreasonably huge salaries to be parasites...</p>
              <p>you think the kar kia won't leave in droves?</p>

              <p><br>Actually, if you look at this from another angle, we should all be glad we don't have a "customer" to serve.. Else all of us will either be typing our messages on sgForums with one arm only, or sitting on wheelchair typing, or type with alot of typos coz we lost an eyeball.. Worst still, no one might bother checking sgForums coz we're all busy "serving our customer"..</p>
              <p>But job-wise, yea.. It really is boring not having a "customer".. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>
