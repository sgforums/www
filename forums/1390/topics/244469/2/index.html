Perhaps the RN brass believed that it would be a repeat of the 2004 incident?<br><br>The BBC had an embedded reporter on the HMS Cornwall, and the staff of the warship, especially the Commodore, all believed that it would be prudent to wait. The Marines set out in RHIBs, and I believe, in a squadron of 3 RHIBs. What is unknown is the distance that the Cornwall was from the site of arrest, and granted that 15 Marines in RHIBs, only armed with boarding weapons and light arms, could not necessarily resist against the Iranian patrol boats without getting injured.<br><br>Next, the US Navy theatre commander commended the RN for her patience and for her sailors' calmness to avoid a firefight. Now, it puts Iran in an interesting position, given that the RN and the USN have not saberrattled, which is a rare thing in itself. If Iran does more harm to the sailors right now, there would be less public opinion swaying against any harsh measures that the UK or USA might make further on.</div>
