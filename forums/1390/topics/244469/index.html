Don't think too much about it, the UN troops are contributed by different countries.

Commanders on the ground will not send the balance troops to conduct rescue.

            <div class='col-md body'>First response Diplomatic channel thru third countries --- like Indonesia best buddy in SE Asia with Iran.  Possible together with UN approach to secure the return of SAF men.<br><br>I think UK and US does not have any politcal will to open a new front. Blair and Bushs' terms are coming to an end politically. So no military solution.<br><br>So if SAF were to mount a special ops it has to do it Solo. I do not think we have the resources. Even we get support from US , UK on intel.<br><br>To bring 15 person back you need  transport, air support, possible naval support. It would bring the deployment to a whole new level.<br><br>I would prefer boarding party start firing....support by UVV. mother vessel calling in for air support thru coalition in the region. It woudl escalate the region to a new level. Blood would spill. Than it is a matter of resolve.</div>

As long as they engaged in self-defense, and were acting within their UN task req before the engagement, I'd think we should simply stand firm, maybe apologise for a misunderstanding, but we should never ever hang our boys out to dry.</div>
