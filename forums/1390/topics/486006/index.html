              <p>Hi Brothers who still taking IPPT,</p>
              <p>I find that the new scoring system seems easier for me to get a PASS hehe <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"> Just that there seems to be too many combinations that can help me achieve that award. So I went to Google Play and hope to see an application that can easily help me with the listing of all possible combinations. Sadly there was none... All those apps only accept your current fitness inputs and then give you the award.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>What I want is the reverse! I give you the award... you tell me the combinations! All combinations should be the <span style="color: #ff0000;">minimum</span> I need to do to achieve that award!</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So I did an application during my free time, <a title="IPPT Target" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.accxis.ippttarget&amp;hl=en">IPPT Target</a>, which did just that and share with some of my friends. It is very well received and I think I should share it with the brothers in this forum as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This application will be:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Forever FREE</li>
              <li>No bullsh** ADs</li>
              <li>No need upgrade to PRO version</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I welcome any suggestion or feedback. Just that I may need some time to implement them as I am not full time doing this.</p>

              <p>NSmen who have failed their IPPT can now choose to participate in 
              sports such as football, or activities such as a weight-loss regime, 
              under a modified remedial training scheme.</p>
              <p>Channel NewsAsia understands that the new scheme has started in phases, and it will be fully implemented on September 1.</p>
              <p>Currently,
               NSmen who fail their IPPT have to go for remedial training lasting up 
              to 20 sessions. The training usually focuses on helping them improve on 
              stations that they failed in, such as chin-ups or the 2.4km run.</p>
              <p>The
               new remedial training scheme will give them five training options to 
              choose from. These include a sports and games programme where they get 
              to play football or touch rugby, and a training regime that helps them 
              lose weight.</p>
              <p>NSmen can also opt for a programme that improves 
              muscular endurance, in which they train using medicine balls and 
              kettlebells, or one that addresses cardiovascular fitness. They can also
               choose to undergo training that is specific to IPPT.</p>
              <p>This 
              improved scheme comes on the back of changes made to the IPPT 
              preparatory training, or the IPT scheme, that went through a trial phase
               a month back. Both the revised remedial training and IPT schemes will 
              be implemented in all four SAF fitness and conditioning centres in 
              Khatib, Maju, Kranji and Bedok camps.</p>
              <p>Some fitness instructors and NSmen told Channel NewsAsia they were briefed earlier on the new remedial training programme.</p>
              <p>Physical
               training instructor Khairuddin Rahmat said: "So, at least when they 
              come, they know what they want. If let's say they can't run, they can 
              improve on their running, if they wish to improve on their running, they
               can select it. If they don't wish (to), they find all the training 
              boring, they can try for the sports and games."</p>
              <p>An NSman who 
              declined to be named said: "It was the PTIs, the physical trainers, who 
              briefed us about the stations two weeks ago. I think it's a positive 
              development. You know if they give us a chance to choose whatever 
              stations we want to do, I think we're motivated to work harder and try 
              to pass our test."</p>
              <p>Ministry of Defence had announced a new IPPT 
              format that saw the scrapping of standing broad jump and chin up 
              stations. The new IPPT scheme will consist of only three stations - a 
              2.4km run, sit-ups and push-ups. The aim was to keep NS personnel 
              healthy and help them pass the annual IPPT test.</p>
