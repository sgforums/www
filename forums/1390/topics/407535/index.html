              <p>It is not a simple question.</p>
              <p>Case A: You are Ah Beng, through the CMPB, they will still enlist you but since you are involved in gang and have violence tendency, you will be refer to psychologist.</p>
              <p>Case B: You are already having depression or some form of psychosis, before you are enlisted you will be watch out for and the MO and whoever will take special care for you.</p>
              <p>Case C: You are having insomina or some issues, you have been seen by camp MO for a while and drugs, like diazepam does not seem to help, they will refer you out to MMI eventually.</p>
              <p>Case D: Your PC/CO/Counselor/Bunkmates/Buddy find you something wrong and decide to bring you to the medical centre </p>
              <p>Mental health issues are not clear cut as it involves many people. Usually people who is having psychosis, will not know that he is having one.</p>

              <p>Do the usual things... For example, you are having depression, you see the doctor, doctor refer you to IMH, then you will receive treatment. Then if SAF when call you up, you correspond by refering your medical status to them by a formal specialist letter.</p>
              <p>Usually if you can "volunteer" to go check it out yourself on your own, it is a small case. </p>
              <p>Mental issues are no jokes, they will cost you alot in insurance premium.</p>

              <p>Insomnia..</p>
              <p>This is problematic..</p>
              <p>Insomnia is considered a minor case as it can be treated with valium.  After half a year, if you still have insomnia then see how.</p>
              <p>Usually this is a wait and see case.</p>
              <p>There is a sleep disorder clinic, neurology department at SGH that deals with sleeping disorder, which you might want to refer to.</p>
              <p>Insomnia can recover one, like flu or fever, so they dont usually warrant a downgrade. Unless, you come in with black eye rings and shivering, it is obvious that you have not sleep for weeks. Then you get MC and that is it.</p>
              <p>For your infor, I had insomnia on Friday night, and I am alright, because I drank too much coffee. </p>
              <p>What is your case?</p>

              <p>You should be concern about your illness and not about downgrading,</p>
              <p>If you have fever, you are tired and weak and therefore cannot work. But it is only that few days. If you take the mental illness as equivalence, what do you think?</p>
              <p>It is not about downgrading, it is about being functional. You cannot function, you cannot function and therefore you need to be downgraded as a lower pes means you are not fit.</p>
              <p>Your T-shirt is now dirty, you go and wash, then you can wear. But if your T-shirt is torn, prehaps you still can wear but it is not so good. If your T-shirt is completely torn, and you cannot wear, so it is useless. If your T-shirt is too old, it is also useless. You can completely ignore the fact that the T-shirt has a hole, but people can still see it and tell you that your T-shirt is torn.</p>

              <p>To ts, best thing is, if you want to keng, get outside doctor, get memo/letter, go mmi downgrade.</p>
              <p><br>When you ORD, go back the outside doctor, get another letter to be discharged (cleared of your condition).</p>
              <p>Of course, this depends on your condition, if it's an incurable one, don't do it.</p>
              <p>I think liddat government job can't get, cos they can access your army records/medical records etc.</p>
              <p>But private job i think they dun care de la, as long you dun have NS liability and can work can liao.</p>

              <p>Case 1: Insurance company X reject the person A as he has depression in the army.</p>
              <p>Case 2: University X reject the person B as he has depression, unfit for study.</p>
              <p>Case 3: I see a man shouting to himself (a imagined person?) at MRT station, on fri evening. Obviously he does not know he is talking to himself. And he is not acting. As he do not know what he is doing that himself.</p>

              <p>NS is the most slacking period I have in my life. I have physically gained 5 to 10 kg. It is not stressful compared to JC life, Uni life. And it is not as stressful now in working life. So if you cannot handle stress in NS. It really reflect that you are NO GOOD.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you really have a problem, your surrounding people will notice, you dont have to declare, they will drag you to the medical centre. </p>

              <p>Then there's a medical board held at MMI to decide the PES status.</p>
