            <div class='col-md body'>Guards are obviously the light strike infantry which have to guard or "tong" an area of key strategic area untill the main infantry comes.<br><br>Traditionally, it can be explained this way:<br><br>Normal infantry is like normal footmen, so to speak.<br><br>Armor Infantry is like armor knights, paladines.<br><br>Guardsmen are like hoplites, or phalaxes, with the largest shield they tahan en masse  of force whcking they with the main infantry footmen support behind them.<br><br>Commandos are just like the hero/ general to go fight the one-on-one combat. That's why it is for honour and glory. But of course, saying this, heroes don't always win. If they lose, army moral will normally drop.</div>

Infantry is purely infantry riding onto their armour vehicle and transport them to their objective faster...i.e bronco and terrex...One of the different is that these APC main objective is just to transport troops to their objective nearer to enemy territory and not right into the territory......Because they only with basic defensive weapon i.e MG ....Just enough to protect them from light assualt from infantry troops.....And their armour protection is much more light than IFV.......They are just act like war taxi.....<br><br>Armoured Infantry ride and fight with their IFV.....I.e BX and M113 IFV...They will transport troops right into enemy objective and fight together with the aid of AIs....Because IFV armed with more offensive and powerful weapon than APC i.e 40/50 and 25mm........And their armour protection is much more stronger than the APC.........<br><br>Can t further describle to you here....Will go against the rules here......Never know who is the spy here......<br><br>You wanna to know more can go to web site and find out more...about other country......<br><br>Got it??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They call Guards the Elite Infantry cause they will be the first to charge into a battle followed by the infantry and all. They also do heli insertion and will be the first to land on a beach assault. All this make them "Elite".  Do also consider there 3 months Guards conversion course, that course is tough!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The reason why Guards are called Guards.<br><br>SAFGU was formed on 1st June 1968, and the main role of this unit was to provide guards for vital SAF installations as well as for ceremonial duties including the provision of the Guard-of-Honour and Prestige Guard for foreign dignitaries visiting the Republic.<br><br>Eventually, besides guards and ceremonial duties, the officers and men of SAFGU were also given infantry training to prepare them for a larger operational role. It was intended for the unit to be trained in order to assume the tasks of an infantry battalion.<br><br>On 1st July 1977, SAFGU was renamed 1 Guards and came under the command of 7 SIB.<br><br>1 Guards ceased its ceremonial duties at the Istana as of 1st Mar 1980 to concentrate on her operational role, and the duties were handed over to the SAF Provost Unit.<br></div>

Airborne infantry are infantry units trained for parachute operations, once on the ground, they like other infantry units, but more well trained, motivated and experienced. Commando operations are different. Another example or contrast is the US marines and UKÂ’s royal marine commandos.<br><br>Guards units are elite only in the local context. By international standards, our guards units are considered as special purpose units only. Other examples of such units around the world include the various amphibious, parachute and airmobile infantry units. Check out the units from IndonesiaÂ’s Kostrad and marines, MalaysiaÂ’s parachute brigade, etc.<br>Guards units are used for a wide range of roles Â– ordinary foot infantry, strategic reserve troops, airmobile or amphibious flanking operations, mechanised infantry, etc, etc. ThatÂ’s what IÂ’ve done in a guards unit.<br><br>Armoured units, and mechanised infantry units have been described by others.<br></div>

The other way, simply by being in the unit. The term "rapid reaction" through seabourne, heliborne and faster movement/contact, imagine the kind of training and sweat to achieve that. Of cos. CDO need even more rapid reaction with secrecy, hence tougher training.</div>
