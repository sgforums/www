Two months later, it moved from its original location at Headquarters Singapore 3rd Infantry Division (HQ 3 DIV) to Seletar West Camp. At that time, there were only four officers, five specialists and a few clerks. On 24th December 1975, the first Brigade Commander of 7 SIB, COL D R Jambu, PPA, was appointed.<br><br>A year after her inception, 7 SIB took command of the Infantry Training Depot (ITD) on 1st January 1976. The 7th and 8th Singapore Infantry Regiments (SIR) came under its command on 9th February 1976.<br><br>On 1st July 1976, 7 SIB was officially declared operational. In view of its operational role, ITD was removed and the SAF Guards Unit (SAFGU) was added to the remaining 2 battalions. On 14th November 1977, President Benjamin Sheares presented the Inauguration Plaque to the Brigade Commander, then COL Kwan Yue Yeong during a ceremony held at SAFGU, Portsdown Camp. This signified the official opening of 7 SIB.<br><br>SAFGU was renamed 1st Battalion Singapore Guards (1 Guards) in 1977. A year later, 8 SIR was renamed 2nd Battalion Singapore Guards (2 Guards). 7 SIB was accorded elite status on 1st April 1978. The sub-units then included 1 Guards, 2 Guards, School of Commando Training, 1st and 10th Commando Battalions. 7 SIR was transferred to 3 SIB.<br><br>On 6th April 1979, a special parade was held at 1 Guards with the Chief of General Staff (CGS), then MAJ-GEN Winston Choo, presenting beret with the new Cap Badge Backing to 7 SIB. CGS explained that the backing was designed for the use of the Guardsmen as a symbol of elitism.<br><br>On 1st July 1980, the Commando sub-units were transferred out. 7 SIR was reverted to 7 SIB and renamed as 3rd Battalion Singapore Guards (3 Guards). On 31st July 1980, the men of 7 SIB were presented with Stable Belts, an elite symbol the men deservedly earned for their excellence in training, performance, discipline, conduct and bearing.<br><br>President Devan Nair presented l, 2 and 3 Guards with their unit colours on 11th June 1983 at Jurong Stadium. The old Colours of SAFGU. 7 SIR and 8 SIR were retired.<br><br>The presentation of the Guards Tab to the Guardsmen on 23rd June 1989 marked another milestone towards the recognition of the Guardsmen as elite soldiers of the SAF. 9th June 1994 saw the Guards vocationalists honoured with the distinctive Guards Khaki Beret.<br><br>On 17th December 1991, the 7th Brigade Training School (7 BTS) came under the command of 7 SIB. However, from September 1996, all Basic Military Training (BMT) was undertaken by Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC), and 7 BTS was closed down.<br><br>11th October 1994 marked the formalisation of Guards as a formation. A parade was held at Nee Soon Camp to mark the inauguration of HQ Guards as Senior Specialist Staff Officer (SSSO) HQ with the Chief Guards Officer (CGO) at the helm. Henceforth all Guards vocationalists, including 7 SIB, came under the administration and command of HQ Guards.<br></div>
