            <div class='col-md body'>Right...now that certain...inconsistencies have been ironed out, let's get back to why Guards are being labelled 'elite'. Do they still deserve that label?<br><br>[Note: Academic argument here. Don't gert personal]<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by trueno86:</div><div class="quote_body">Check out the most basic requirement like IPPT, CDO/GUARDS/DIVERS share the same gold award standards, which "SIMPLY" the only way for people out there to see the difference. The other way, simply by being in the unit. The term "rapid reaction" through seabourne, heliborne and faster movement/contact, imagine the kind of training and sweat to achieve that. Of cos. CDO need even more rapid reaction with secrecy, hence tougher training.</div></blockquote>Unless the SAF says that all guardsmen -must- attain gold in IPPT, your point is as pointless as a blunt pencil. It would be like saying 'Guardsmen are Elite because we say they are'.<br><br>Ditto the point about being in the unit.<br><br>Re insertion, IMO, insertion methods does not mean anything much. Parachuting into enemy territory does not make one elite. It qualifies one to hold the title of 'cannon fodder'. After all, we do not call suicide bombers 'elite' do we? Selfless, brave, courageous, dedicated, maybe. But not elite.<br><br>What would make those soldiers elite would be the level of trg and selection each and everyone of those soldiers have been subjected to. Can we say that about our Guardsmen? I hardly think GCC qualifies someone as elite. Commandos? Probably since we have all heard about how sh1t their BMT is. Soldiers of the British Army's Parachute Regiment? Probably.

            <div class='col-md body'>I see we have moved from Why are Guards called Guards to Do Sgp Guardsmen deserved to be called elite....<br><br>let me answer the first question first... "Why are Guards called Guards? "<br><br>In the past, the sorveign's personal body guards are elite soldiers, their selection is more stringent, some of them have to serve in normal line regiments and do well before they are put into the guard units. Also their training/pay etc are supposed to be better. And the unit is suppose to be better motivated and have higher combat value then normal line units.<br><br>For eg, Napolean's Imperial Guards are all veterans of many campaigns. B4 Waterloo and after he came back from exile in Elba, all the french line regiments have to nominate 30 of their best men to join the reformed imperial guard. And he used them as his "knockout" punch in a battle, reserving them until the last moment.....<br><br>As to whether sgp guards deserve to be called elite, i know that in the past, the "intake" for Gds are more stringent then the normal SIR units. minimum height, eye sight etc etc....  now i am not sure...<br><br>but i guess they can be called elite because their roles are different... and are slightly more "complicated". but since we are all conscripts and the quality of the recruits are the same really can't say that one is more elite then the other....<br><br></div>

So ur a commando? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway IMHO, our Guardsmen are elite Infantry, much like the US Rangers (btw, US Rangers are not considered SF) difference being the Ranger's airborne status, and of course the duration of the RIP is maybe a month longer than our GCC. End of the day it's all about operational roles and requirements what. Just like Warcraft, you won't use a PEON to do a Berserker's job right? So let it rest about who's more elite lah...knn u all can kpkb until kingdom come, once u all ORD already also like that, bo chap bo hiew. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
