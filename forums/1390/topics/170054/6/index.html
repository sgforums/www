Do they still deserve that label?<br><br>[Note: Academic argument here. Don't gert personal]<br><br>Unless the SAF says that all guardsmen -must- attain gold in IPPT, your point is as pointless as a blunt pencil. It would be like saying 'Guardsmen are Elite because we say they are'.<br><br>Ditto the point about being in the unit.<br><br>Re insertion, IMO, insertion methods does not mean anything much. Parachuting into enemy territory does not make one elite. It qualifies one to hold the title of 'cannon fodder'. After all, we do not call suicide bombers 'elite' do we? Selfless, brave, courageous, dedicated, maybe. But not elite.<br><br>What would make those soldiers elite would be the level of trg and selection each and everyone of those soldiers have been subjected to. Can we say that about our Guardsmen? I hardly think GCC qualifies someone as elite. Commandos? Probably since we have all heard about how sh1t their BMT is. Soldiers of the British Army's Parachute Regiment? Probably.  Since we know how hard the selection is and we know everyone of those soldier have passed selection.<br><br>-Lies down in hastily prepared shell scrape and awaits incoming -<br><br></div></blockquote>Does SAF require all Cdos to be IPPT gold? I am very sure not all Cdos can get gold, at least on 1st try. However they will be train till they get it as a unit requirement. What I am trying to say is SAF requires Grds to be on the same par with Cdos at least in IPPT gold, but of cos not all Grds can get it, and it's not die die must get gold like Cdos. That is why half f**k Cdos comes abt in Grds.<br><br>I am not too particular about "elite" status, but being term as "simply" infantry with a bit of helo ops, sea ops and a bit of rapid reaction and nothing much else is too easier say than done. We definately have tough level of training with those extra little things you mentioned, those in the unit will know.<br><br>In my time, we dun really care abt status. We dragged our boots during training, but not in ATEC, that's where the fun comes.<br><br>No worries, nothing personal of cos. Getting old liao. I type this message also a little bit siong for the eyes.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It would be good if you guys, in discussing the training, capabilities and modus operandi of the Guards units, stick to what is considered public domain information.  If you're unsure, do a quick search on the interwebby to see if it's available from reputable sources, eg. MINDEF, JANES, etc. (individual's sites/blogs and forums don't count)<br><br>I have no doubt that the Guards ORBAT, capabilities and role can be deduced from public domain info.

They are those that tong e place for 1 week b4 our main blockforce comes..<br>5) Due to their believe in them being elites, they are fucking garang, thats e main diff in mindsets<br>6) They are taught to fight differently, as in formation, etc<br><br>Thats about it.<br></div></blockquote>First, Infantry men go through AIT and CSB as well.<br><br>1) No big deal, not strenous by any stretch of the imagination.
