            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>The true pain about army is the body. Exercise without resting. Keep on jogging, Push-up, Chin-up, Running up and down. And worse is that. The body never recover and everyday do the same thing. Over and over again until the pain is forget. Everyday wake up is tired. Everyday wake up with a body feeling just after RUNNING 2.4KM. Feel like resting and yet still have to do the chores. Cleaning up. Marching under the sun feeling want to faint but cannot faint. ( Because faint go to JAIL ). Training. Attend lesson when you feel like sleeping.<br><br>Once you sleep. Suddenly, wake-up with Officer saying to you. " YOU SEE THE TREE THERE ? RUN THERE AND DO 20 PUSH-UP AND COME BACK !"<br><br>The night finally come. Time to sleep. Just when you go into bed. Knock out. Your mind still feel you haven't rest enough. Wake-up already. 5am in the morning. Time for your morning jogging, warm up, and.... the day begin again !<br><br>If you cannot pass your IPPT. Your officer will start to stress you. Calling you names and SABOT KING. Your BODY is tired. Your pride getting hurt. Calling your mates to help you or they be in trouble. How trouble will that be ? Telling them they are not able to book out in weekend. Confine with you. Your ARMY BUDDIES and mates WILL HATE YOU. Their gf waiting for them outside to meet them. Some have love relationship problem. So you SABOT THEM ! They goes crazy enough to beat you up. Blanket over our head and hit you.<br><br>That is when you go crazy. Like you are bring the whole team down. You want to pass your IPPT. But no matter how hard you try. Seem never work for you. Helpless. You hope officer will only punish you. But he don't. Because he want to force you to your edge. Force you to pass.<br><br>In other parts of the world. You can quit. But in Singapore. You can't ! It's the law. No escape. So end-up some Break their leg by jumping down high stairs. Some break their finger to get out of army. Some eat toothpaste to get fever to escape a few days. Some goes crazy doing funny things like SH!Ting in the open field and public. One I met, During Field camp. Rice drop on the mud. He still pickup and eat. Talking to himself. Every answer he make is just " YES SIR, NO SIR ".<br><br>You want to complain. Nobody help you it's part of the Life in ARMY. You want to leave. There is no escape this is Singapore. You want to rest. There is no rest. You feel like beat the officer. But.... if you do it. You go inside prison. You can never enter NTU or NUS again after all your hardwork studying for A-LEVEL. Getting good grades. Etc.<br><br>DAYS like WEEKS. WEEKS like MONTHS. MONTH LIKE YEARS. Finally for people who cannot take it. They kill themselves by jumping off the building. Jumping down from 4 floor. Shoot themselves in the head in RANGE with the M16. Happen in the ARMY. Officer tried to prevent by kicking the rifle away but it shoot through his body. Died with tears in his eyes and he is just 18.<br><br><a href="http://www.youngpap.org.sg/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=5222" rel="nofollow">http://www.youngpap.org.sg/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=5222</a><br><br>Is this true??<br><br></div>
