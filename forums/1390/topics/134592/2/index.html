            <div class='col-md body'>Just to c0ntribute to this forum.<br>My advice to all is not to take enlistment to army is kinda of scary stuff, it can be quite fun at times, when u reflect back on it.<br><br>1) Place where guys stop their whinning in sch and home + gf<br>2)Boys become man and able to make decision making on their own.<br>3) Serve their countries (sound patriotic?)<br><br>Some may feel 'du lan' regarding the above points. But, pls think back... SAF has been trying very hard to make life easier for nsmens. the medical corp has also try to improve on their medical equipping, ie AED (if u guys know what it is).<br>Death in SAF is just like accidents on the streets everyday. U cant possible control anyone or everyone's health condition. Each and everyone should be responsible for their health being. That's why living and training conditions in the army have improved, so that soldiers are able to adapt and lived comfortably despite the tough trainings. Commanders are also trained in basic medical skills so that they can cope or deal with any emergency situations.<br>I agree that medical corp should do some reinforcement regarding the competence of the medical and the basic trained commanders.<br>I just hope that most of us think maturely instead of blaming SAF on all the things. The oganization has been trying very hard, do give them chance.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
