              <p>hello, </p>
              <p>i know this question has been asked a billion times, but because there seems to be a different answer each time, i'm still confused:</p>
              <p>I have severe myopia (1250/1200) in both eyes. I have no family history of blindness or retinal detachment, and after a retinal photography procedure taken recently, i've been informed my retina is healthy, with no likelihood of spontaneous complications. I have NO other underlying medical conditions (I've been for a medical assessment by my doctor), and my napha test earlier this year was gold + i exercise regularly. </p>
              <p>Does anyone know what PES status i might end up with? is it confirmed PES C and below? or might i have a shot at PES B? </p>
              <p>and do i have any chance of going to combat school at all? </p>

              <p>Yours is really severe, but you got a Gold for NAPFA and no other conditions. B2 will be a good bet.</p>
              <p>As for command school, it depends on your PES.</p>

              <p>most likely you will end up in some combat support vocations like storeman, driver.</p>
              <p>as for command school, at best will be CQ, driver spec or technician. up to 3sg.</p>

              <p>Hope I can answer your question.</p>
              <p>You should be under PES B2L3. And by right PES B2(aka C1) are considered combat fit, however need to see what level you are in (L what). L3/L9 not considered combat fit.</p>
              <p>Upgrade of PES is unlikely, as SOC itself are considered high risk activities that might caused trauma to your head, which can cause retinal detachment, unless you are willing to bear any consequences if something happen to your eyes after you up PES.</p>
              <p>Normally C1L3/L9 will not be under any combat units. Technicians, Service Medics, Drivers.. etc that are not of combat nature. (Unless you suay la)</p>

              <p>Hi Andrew,</p>
              <p>I am sorry as I cannot tell you for sure what are your chances to get a combat vocation posting, though if you actually get PES B2 L3/L9, the chances will not be very high. However, if you still have quite some time before being enlisted (Haven't been asked to go for your Medical Checkup yet), you may wish to try having Lasik Surgery.</p>

              <p>problem is the TS want to up, but most cases of 1k+ myopia without any other medical condtions/bad history [at most only asmatigsm to go along with it] will result in B2L3/9 [previously C1] immediately when a pre-enlistee's eyes/spectacles are screened at cmpb.</p>
              <p>btw for a PES A physique, what is the cut-off for their eye degree? i know of 1 guy who qualified for PES A but bcos his eyes req him to wear specs of 800 per eye, he become B instead. though training still same la..</p>
