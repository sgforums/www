              <p>yes, i know the importance of having sixteen years old and above boys to attend 2-years compulsary army. it is to strengten their loyalty and patriot to singapore, and yes, it is to ensure singapore to have its own army to be more secure, and yes, it is to also build up boys to be a more stronger person.</p>
              <p>lately i see my cousin, we were at our usual family gathering. he going to army soon, just finish his A lvl, when ask him how he feel about going to army, he was groaning " sian ah, go army, waste of two years sia, go there sure die de.."</p>
              <p>common to hear that,  as i watched my friends go army, they say life is tough there, some complain that there isnt any meaningful thing there to do, some complain their own officer- in- charge isnt happy with them, and gave them a super hard time. those "who wasnt that built" suffer due to the toughness of army, and the harsh surrounding.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it leave down to this question. who are we trying to build up loyalty and patriot to? or are we just trying to force in this altitude to people, and causes them to have a different lessons taught to them?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as i mention above, the purpose of army is to let boys have more loyalty to this country, and make our country safer. but if we force a person to do something that he doesnt  want, it leave a different mindset on him, and he does not do his best to do the things. in the end, the loyalty and patriotness isnt there,  and just a feeling being trap.</p>
              <p>so the end result? generations after generations are moving out of singapore. adults imbuded with a mindset, "is either my children waste  2 years of his life, or he can go to other country for seven years and get a better education", in the end people will sort of "leave singapore" for "own decision to life".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what do you think about the compulsary army, do you think it shall be make optional and nt compulsary, give in your view...</p>

              <p><br>I don't believe that anyone would truly enjoy serving... especially when your girlfriend has a high tendency of leaving in the midst/low pay/weekends burnt/doing what you are not willing/not physical type/cannot handle stress and most importantly... dunno how to keng...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>i think every guys understand the feeling of 2 weeks before enlistment. sleep cant sleep, eat cant eat.. play cant play. 24 hrs a day become 2 hrs a day bcos time seems to run so fast, so many things havent do yet little time to do it.</p>
              <p>honour, glory, patroism(spelling) aside, army really teaches a lot of things that no professors in the world could have taught u. the best teachers i came across is not from schools but from all the experiences, stories and lectures i got during my 2 yrs there. besides that, you mixed with 123587606th different kind of human beings out there. you think its so easy to be independent yet under discipline? it harder than one would think of. how many occasions will u see a JC nerd to sleep beside a siao ah beng in the same room? hardly. but army provide this chance. mixing people of different background creates mutual influences and created opportunities for one to learn from another. army don't just teach u to clean bunk and foot drills or charge that knoll.</p>
              <p>i seriously feel that those who always think that serving the army is a boring, tough and out of your own will to start thinking again. its really a playground for men and its a place where boys become men or if worse, boys continue to be boys.</p>
              <p>2 years is just a snap of the finger. it will come as fast as the 2hrs u suffered before enlistment. the day u walk out of ur camp for the final time for ur ord.. u will feel with joy, memories and life skills that u will forever cherish.</p>

              <p>Same as always. Most girls only know how to talk. When you ask them whether girls must go NS they all give stupid excuses. Little do they know that the reason they don't have to go NS is because we are serving it for them. But girls serving NS? I doubt it will happen, unless some stupid rule comes out in the future.</p>

              <p>yes, i know the importance of having sixteen years old and above boys to attend 2-years compulsary army. it is to strengten their loyalty and patriot to singapore, and yes, it is to ensure singapore to have its own army to be more secure, and yes, it is to also build up boys to be a more stronger person.</p>
              <p>lately i see my cousin, we were at our usual family gathering. he going to army soon, just finish his A lvl, when ask him how he feel about going to army, he was groaning " sian ah, go army, waste of two years sia, go there sure die de.."</p>
              <p>common to hear that,  as i watched my friends go army, they say life is tough there, some complain that there isnt any meaningful thing there to do, some complain their own officer- in- charge isnt happy with them, and gave them a super hard time. those "who wasnt that built" suffer due to the toughness of army, and the harsh surrounding.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it leave down to this question. who are we trying to build up loyalty and patriot to? or are we just trying to force in this altitude to people, and causes them to have a different lessons taught to them?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as i mention above, the purpose of army is to let boys have more loyalty to this country, and make our country safer. but if we force a person to do something that he doesnt  want, it leave a different mindset on him, and he does not do his best to do the things. in the end, the loyalty and patriotness isnt there,  and just a feeling being trap.</p>
              <p>so the end result? generations after generations are moving out of singapore. adults imbuded with a mindset, "is either my children waste  2 years of his life, or he can go to other country for seven years and get a better education", in the end people will sort of "leave singapore" for "own decision to life".</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Freedom is not free. It comes at a price. Making it optional, will only imply any sane person will simply choose to skip serving NS. This is on the premise that each and every soul will only choose decisions that benefit themselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Conscription is the only way to go. National Security aint a democracy. Unless we are a big ASS country like the U.S.A, who can afford a volunteer army.</p>

It really depends on whether you want to acquire good experiences and values during your national service, that will groom you into a better person.

Such issue has been asked by many people but no proper answers given by the authority which concerns.
