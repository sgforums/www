              <p>I'm now in Mono-intake, Armour Battalion. </p>
              <p>Thinking of sign on mainly due to the 1-time sign on bounty bonus payment and stable pay to fund my life and private studies during and after the 6 years bond.</p>
              <p>Honest speaking, I'm thinking to sign on is mainly because of
                  not-so-good family background. I need to be financially stable
                  before I can further my studies to pursue my dreams.<br> <br> So I guess SAF can provide me with that as the sergeant specialist
                  contract bond is 4 years. That means 2 years additional regular
                  service on top of NSF 2 years. It lets me save up and be financial
                  independent. For 4 years of service, I think I can get my private
                  certificate.<br><br>I will need to serve a <strong>Minimum Term of Engagement
              (MTE)</strong> of 5 years, which includes my 2-year National
              Service liability.</p>
              <p><br> <br> Is it still advisable to do so?<br> <br> Do you think I will have job satisfaction even if I have no or
                  little passion for SAF?<br> <br> If I have NS duties rostered/ the NS unit has outfield exercises,
                  can I still apply for permission/ "off" pass to go to school?<br> <br> Is it duties above studies that I need to forgo classes to be in
                  the forest jungle/ guard duties?</p>

              <p>Your idea is totally flawed.</p>
              <p>You sign on for the money so that it can fund your diploma study. However, after 6 years, your pay will be more than twice of what a fresh diploma would get. Why do you want to quit army and get a diploma then?</p>
              <p>When you get a private diploma, it is worhless in the goverment sector. The starting pay is only a thousand plus. LOL. A Nitec cert is more recognized.</p>

              <p><br>Why did you start your basic "training" by running around with "ali baba" bag with weight inside around the running track field, drink a full bottle of water for water parade without wasting a drop of water and stand still in the field for "N" number of hours just to prepare for BMT ? If you enjoyed all these, then you sure have the "burning desire" to endure for the whole 6 years, otherwise I didn't think you even understand what the other forumer's here trying to tell you.</p>
              <p>And just to add (touch wood), in case if you have any accident happen during your SAF career, most insurance will not covered you, not only will you be discharged if it affect your performance, worst if you sign an bond with MINDEF, you also must pay them back whether the accident is caused by other factors or parties.</p>
