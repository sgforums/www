And many times, it requires physical stuff, and PES E being usually deploy in offices, basically, u are asking them to know about Fighting In Build-Up Area (FIBUA, which PES C dun even do), these all requires training and many times physical stuff (even u dun do it with the M16).<br><br>The thing is the medical review done before and during ur NS period. This brings me back to my point earlier, if these soldiers can fight with their medical condition then they should be already be graded PES C, the fact that they are given PES E means their medical condition even prevents them to do arms handling.</div>

Special Forces insertion and raid<br>2. Somehow our defence lines had a gap and we got flanked by the enemy. But SG size is so small...<br><br>Back to the point. If it's SF raid, then PES stand no chance. therefore, firearms not necessary.<br><br>If it's normal forces, giving the PES E people some kind of firearm will help. Not really physically, more or a morale boost such that you don't go round thinking in war time that "I'm unarmed, I cannot defend myself".<br><br>that said, Don't give M16s to PES E people. Give them something easy to use, and something lighter to use. (That is, if SG every willing to spend the cash). MP5 will be fine in the close quarters of a building. (The PES E will not be running out in the open will they?) Furthermore, don't forget that the PES E will NOT be wearing SBO/LBV and Fieldpack and whatnot... it's even lighter for them. All they are carrying will be the gun and the magazines. Give em a chance.<br><br>For those PES E with epilepsy, I just want to clarify a point. If they go into fits it's unlikely that they will continue to hold down the trigger during a fit. The main worry is grenades. If the pull the pin and then go into a fit, gone case.<br><br>Why bother about FIBUA training for PES E? the weapon/firearm you give them is already a LAST RESORT.</div>
