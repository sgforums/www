              <p>Ask your dxo's whether they would rather choose to be in the office doing admin jobs or in the jungle digging trenches should give you the answer. I don't say SAF can survive with only combat fit soldiers, but if everyone is combat fit they will be even happier. The reason why there're clerks is because not everyone is combat fit and they've to create a appointment for you if not it will be unfair if uncombat fit personnels won't even need to serve NS. And stop all those jokes bout clerks being so important to NS because who will handle the leaves, G50 etc.. A combat fit solider can do it also if he is given the chance too but the country needs him for more important roles. you guys are only there to support the combat fit soliders and help in the paperwork which exists in every organization. but it is not something that only you guys can do please don't overrate yourself. The face of the SAF are the soliders and not you guys. period.</p>
              <p>The whole point bout the SAF is National Defence which means soldiers. You will understand the important of clerks in a wartime. You think you still have paperwork to do and do clearances for leaves? They will probably throw you a rifle and ask you to guard the camp or something while the combat fit personnels go to fight the war. This has nothing to do with malingering or not, i understand that not everyone can be combat fit but i think you guys probably suffer the shame of being a clerk because of those people. I make myself clear, the post of a clerk is not shameful but don't make yourself sound indispensable like what some of the posts here sound.</p>

              <p>Ask your dxo's whether they would rather choose to be in the office doing admin jobs or in the jungle digging trenches should give you the answer. I don't say SAF can survive with only combat fit soldiers, but if everyone is combat fit they will be even happier. The reason why there're clerks is because not everyone is combat fit and they've to create a appointment for you if not it will be unfair if uncombat fit personnels won't even need to serve NS. And stop all those jokes bout clerks being so important to NS because who will handle the leaves, G50 etc.. A combat fit solider can do it also if he is given the chance too but the country needs him for more important roles. you guys are only there to support the combat fit soliders and help in the paperwork which exists in every organization. but it is not something that only you guys can do please don't overrate yourself. The face of the SAF are the soliders and not you guys. period.</p>
              <p>The whole point bout the SAF is National Defence which means soldiers. You will understand the important of clerks in a wartime. You think you still have paperwork to do and do clearances for leaves? They will probably throw you a rifle and ask you to guard the camp or something while the combat fit personnels go to fight the war. This has nothing to do with malingering or not, i understand that not everyone can be combat fit but i think you guys probably suffer the shame of being a clerk because of those people. I make myself clear, the post of a clerk is not shameful but don't make yourself sound indispensable like what some of the posts here sound.</p>

              <p>face it, combat depends on support for weapons and food and other stuff. support depends on combat for protection and peace of mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think that the recognition for clerks is not as good as those combat soldiers. maybe MSD who is monitoring this thread right now can voice it out to the relevant authorities to make everyone who serves NS be filled with pride and not with the chao keng mentality.</p>
