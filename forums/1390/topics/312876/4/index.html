              <p>Pls respect to all vocations/support personnels. everyone in SAF are given jobs to do and its up to them to do it well. for the most of them who are doing well, keep up the good work. those who not, pls pull up your socks<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>Actually I don't think all clerks = chao keng, but most of them do....especially you been to the sport councils gym...lot of SAF No 3 uniformed take off the uniform their body shape is better than some of the combat personal...But I think saf4life u should respect all vocations. Every vocations play it's part in order to works, imagine if there no clerks in a combat unit, u may have to do documentation yourself you want it to be like that? </p>

              <p>in the british army, the logistics motto is 'the power behind the punch' or something like that. gives us something to think abt eh? but after so much talking, it's the egg and chicken problem. admin need combat to protect, combat need admin to function properly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>saf4life has no respect for the support side, he deserves to get his rifle malfunction during war time, w/o anyone to help him. deserves to try and break an arm or 2 and have all the medics in the med centre taking their own sweet time. if saf4life is indeed a cdo, he's a disgrace to all of them. even my teacher who is a cdo recognise the efforts the clerks put in cuz w/o us, u think he can defer so easily?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>not everyone wants to be pes c or e, im a good example. i fractured my leg before, that's y i got into pes c. wanted to try and slim down a bit as im overweight, but during 3rd day of bmt, i dislocated my arm. so totally no chance to exercise besides marching to and fro to places and climbing up and down the stairs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>like ts said, trying doing your own g50 and dun seek guidance from any of the clerks. let's see how u fill it up. every new mofo that comes into my office, have to ask me for help to fill up the form and sometimes even need me to teach them how to key their particulars and submit it to msd.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the service side is seriously overlooked by many. most people only see the front that all those combat fellows show. they do not understand the stuff service personnel do to ensure that everything during those ops, exercises and what not run smoothly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>there r alot of combat personnel who keng too, how come no one ever starts a thread on them?</p>

              <p><br>Nice display of patriotism, but in the end you're just another combatant who discriminate clerks whether they chao keng or not (whether you want to admit or not), because we do not have to go to the frontlines nor will we be the one to spill the first blood during a war.</p>

              <p>I didn't know S'pore got war. The only war i know of is during the Great singapore sale where the women are fighting.</p>
              <p>What if the clerk becomes a big entrepreneur in s'pore and brings in the biggest investment you can think of to s'pore and contribute largely to the economy of s'pore, would he still fail his duty as a son of Singapore? Hmmm... looks like your regular who eats on taxpayer's money and is super counterproductive is a more legitimate son of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Btw, there's no stay out vocation but only stay out unit. So if your unit is a stay out unit, consider yourself lucky :)</p>
