              <p>My Chief Clerk heck care about these matters one, lol.</p>
              <p>It's another WO officer who is in charge and I don't want to talk to him....</p>
              <p> Well, over here the morning traffic is not that bad so I can get to camp quite fast.</p>
              <p><br>Similar over here. But my colleague is due to mental problem.</p>
              <p>Once in the army, you would compare and look at the surface only.</p>
              <p>Got one guy who is short in my camp but he is combat fit but my colleagues can't believe he is a fighting soldier.</p>
              <p>That friend of you who played intense sports, is he a clerk too?</p>
              <p>There is this mindset in SAF, when you're a pes e clerk = you can't do sports or anything that would risk hurting you like we're some fragile items.</p>

              <p>There are quality of staying in as a Unit and operate as a Unit.  If you stay out you will always seperate your livelyhood with your unit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is the soldier after hours training that break the bonds and get to know you. Go out together play together get prostitute together, sleep together that bonds takes time to develop and we expect them to fight for one another together.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You cannot decifer yourself as a function by catergory of vocation in the unit.  It doesn't served the purposes of team building. You don't think like a unit. Your point of reference and decision has to be understand your unit. If a war breaks up you are a lone Ranger a Clerk material isn;t much of a Rambo material either.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So look at the herd of animal they always stay closed together so that the chances of survivor are greater from predator.     </p>

              <p>yoz you dunno it is saf's aim to eventually make everyone stay in???</p>
              <p>Meaning whether you are in ICT, clerk, rifleman, storeman, you will be told to stay in once your food and shelter is ready.</p>

              <p>Hello all, I ORD in 2002 so i guess i'm some sort of the middle batch in between the arguably "xiong" and currently "slack" SAF.</p>
              <p>I think we must be fair also lah, don't keep thinking clerk = sinang. Personally i was from armored brigade. I got my share of shit life outfield. Then halfway they transfer me to HQ side, i see the people there like very slack no need to go outfield so i very happy. In the end wat happen?</p>
              <p>Also xiong!!! Not physically, but mentally. Especially when all the cb kia officer regulars wanna talk big but push the work to NSF. Then when things cock up, push the blame to NSF also. I dunno sign 7 how many times already in HQ side. So please don;t think support side very sinang. Is also damn fucked up. For me i see both side so i feel more sympathetic for both combat and non-combat. Really lah people, cannot just brush off this clerks as tuangster</p>
