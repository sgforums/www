              <p>booking out is a privilege and not an entitlement. that's what my encik keep telling us and we all know it's true also.</p>

              <p>im a formation hq clerk in the past and even though i used to complain my camp is so far from my home that i rather stay in, after 1-2 months, i find that being able to book out is much better even though the travelling sucks.</p>

              <p>at least if i go home, i can slp on my own bed, use the computer and do my personal stuff. as for those who keng, all i can say is that they have no integrity and dont take pride and responsibility in themselves and whatever they do. most of the time, they will not go far in life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as for clerks staying in, i do agree a small handful of them have to stay in to make sure there is someone who can response to any immediate problems, eg. company clerks, BN clerks. but that doesn't mean all of them have to stay in.</p>

              <p><br>I feel like support personnels are the most looked down upon and least appreciated.</p>
              <p>So what if I get to see action? Most of the glory goes to combatants. How many times have you seen a support personnel in SAF advertisments as compared to a combatant holding a gun?</p>
              <p>The whole mentality of combat "beats" support in SAF is obivious.</p>
              <p>But yes, I know there are combatants who appreciate support personnels for handling all the paperworks so that they do not have to.</p>
