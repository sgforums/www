            <div class='col-md body'>It's normal to be apprehensive as your BMT draws near. I dare say every single one of us would have doubts and apprehensions when were were all at your stage.<br><br>The key thing here is to have a positive mindset and keep telling yourself that it can't be all that bad. And truthfully, while I found BMT tough, it wasn't really as bad as I initially thought it was.<br><br>And most importantly, remember that you're not in this alone. There will be 40++ people in your platoon sharing the exact same experience as you do. As you're in push-up position in the mud in the hot afternoon sun, remember that the people next to you are suffering alongside you as well and that no matter what, it will eventually be over.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there's nothing to worry about and be afraid of. just what are u afraid of anyway?<br><br>afraid of the training? as long as you are moderately fit, the training is manageable. don't worry.<br><br>afraid of not being able to make friends? try to be friendly, helpful and easy going, u'll get to know new friends very soon. don't worry.<br><br>afraid of not be able to see your loved ones? take this as a time to learn to be independent, get out of the comfort zone. u can't rely on your parents forever right? don't worry.<br><br>there're lots more harsher challenges in life in stored for u in future, NS is just a small part of it. take this as a opportunity to overcome your fears.<br><br>remember, laugh in the face of danger and prevail. take care and good luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, it's perfectly normal to be nervous at such a time - this is going to be a whole new experience, and apprehension is a logical response.<br><br>Tips?  Do your job as instructed, don't mouth off, and help your section and platoon mates with any work if you're not otherwise occupied.

            <div class='col-md body'>It is perfectly alright to be nervous, since this is a huge turning point of your life. My people will be nervous too, but everi thing gone first time one, so dun scared.<br><br>Some points to take note.<br><br>1) ensure safety is always presence. For example, since most of the trainers are NSF themselves, they may not be experienced and watchful as the lao jiaos. Some may even do things to satiate their bravado instincts. Some of ur platoon mates may be a little playful, thus neglecting safety. An example is with computer games like CS being so common, some ppls might like to ani o how point their rifle at others while in the bunk machiam like CS, this is veri dangerous as if one develops this type of habit, it is veri dangerous at the range. Also I believe most units have converted to SAR-21. Please do not treat the LAD and point at other ppls eyes, it will lead to blindness, not kidding!!<br><br>2) don't be to wayang or hao lian. Don't be the first to finish the task nor be the last to complete the task. If u are the last, u are the platoon sabo king. If u are the fastest, some ambitious OCS wannabes might gang up with others to rate u poorly during poor appraisal. Think carefully whether u wannabe a commander or a men during the whole BMT course, if u choose to be a commander, work hard to achieve it. Things like IPPT, sit-test, peer-appraisal must be good if u aim OCS. If not, IPPt so so can liao, if not dun get things like silver or else.................u get some siong vocation.</div>
