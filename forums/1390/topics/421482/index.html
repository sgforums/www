              <p>SINGAPORE: A full—time National Serviceman (NSF) has died from an in—camp accident.</p>
              <p>A Defence Ministry spokesman said 20—year—old Lance Corporal (LCP) Eugin Wee Yong Choon, a Signal Operator, was hit by a truck driven by another serviceman in Jurong Camp 1 at about 7am on Friday.</p>
              <p>LCP Wee was about to unload stores from the back of the truck when it reversed into him.</p>
              <p>MINDEF said a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) medic attended to LCP Wee immediately.</p>
              <p>At 7.05am, an ambulance was activated to evacuate LCP Wee to the National University Hospital (NUH).</p>
              <p>He was sent to the hospital at 7.15am and arrived at NUH at about 7.45am.</p>
              <p>LCP Wee was pronounced dead at 7.59am.</p>
              <p>At his home, Wee’s distraught father described him as helpful and cheerful.</p>
              <p>The oldest of two children, Wee had won many debating awards in school</p>
              <p>He had just taken an SAT test last Saturday and had intended to study law at the Singapore Management University (SMU) after his national service.</p>
              <p>"My son is a very good boy. He bought me a wallet (on my birthday)... just this December. I still haven’t used," said Wee Thiam Chye, the victim’s father.</p>
              <p>MINDEF said it’s still investigating the incident.</p>
              <p>It added any action on the serviceman who was behind the wheels of the truck will only be taken after investigations are complete.</p>
              <p>"I just want the army camp (to) give me a report, (to) know actually what happened. It’s my son. (Was) he standing at the centre or the side? (Why aren’t there) any commander behind the three tonner say whether is it clear," said Wee’s father.</p>
              <p>A similar incident happened at Seletar Camp in 2009.</p>
              <p>Then, a motor transport officer died after being pinned down by a land rover.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Maybe its really true military vehicle are slow and causes traffic to slow down for them bt do the drivers have a choice? Thats just the speed limit that is given to them. I sure nobody in this world would be happy to drive at 50km/h and get charge if they go over 50km/h blaming on SAF just wont wake up the dead. Im a nsf myself frm what i see SAF do take safety seriously.Maybe its nt just SAF that shud practice more safety it same goes to the public.Maybe SAF drivers dont really have a good driving skills bt they try their best to practice safety.Nobody wish to see a lost of life on a book out day futhermore chinese new year is just around the corner.But lets just hope the family will get over it slowly although it really hurts to lose someone you love. Lets just nt concentrate on the human error people make why nt lets just hope for the best and wish that similar things dont occur again. And i just dont understand why singaporeans just hate the people who train hard just to make sure that we are safe to be here knowing that we have a army who risk their life to protect us.And my greatest condoselence to the family of the deceased. Hope that he will be happy in the other world. - DyDyKun</p></div>

Btw I often seen such thing happened in parking in the car park, when a car is reversing some people just like to walk behind the vehicle. Of cos in this case we do not know where the serviceman was when the vehicle is reversing, let SAF do their investigation and no point kept pointing finger at SAF safety policies.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>lets just say even without the SAF vehicle on the road it will still be dangerous. Singaporeans are nw rushing every single minute public road users dont even have the time to look around for hazards all they think about is drive to the destination a.s.a.p. Why not just reflect on the public first and not making it seem that all the accidents in singapore is cause by SAF driver. No doubt the ford everest do not hav any engine brake but touch your heart and ask do all the drivers in singapore uses their engine brake upon reaching a down slope. Im nt here to debate about hw great SAF is bt im just here to let people know that SAF drivers dont have a variety choice of vehicle to choose frm they just live with what they are told to drive. Maybe a little consideration by giving way to military vehicle when necessary will help to lessen road hazard and not forcing the SAF drivers to make a dangerous decision just because people are not giving way to them and lets just not totally point fingers on anyone futhermore we are all living together as a singaporean y cant we just unite to make roads safer fr evry citizen.</p></div>

              <p>sometimes, both sides are to blame on such incident, of cos nobody like such incident to happened let alone the victims. Btw I often seen such thing happened in parking in the car park, when a car is reversing some people just like to walk behind the vehicle. Of cos in this case we do not know where the serviceman was when the vehicle is reversing, let SAF do their investigation and no point kept pointing finger at SAF safety policies. But I quite sure the driver will land himself into DB but for how long? May the deceased RIP.</p>

              <p>if you ever get wind of SAF polices on driving, you would realise it's way beyond common sense.</p>
              <p>Like wat I mentioned abt SWD. Just over SWD beep and subsequent braking, create accident and massive jam on expressway. Who to blame? SAF. Why? How come vehicle no engine brake, no situational awareness (poor training), so harsh on SWD still.</p>
              <p>Outside we just let go of accelerator... Even TP dun book at 61kph.. They give u like +10kph tolerance.</p>
              <p>Implementing policies is something those scholars are willing to do it themselves (the instruction itself).</p>

              remind me of 2 incident too.
                  The CSM conduct change parade and my bunk is at the most top floor. One of my bunk mates rushed down and fall down from the stairs and fractured his legs. But the whole incident was covered up then. I tot change parade need a medic and safety rover on standby?
                  Another was we kana pumped jialat with FBO. Tink got at least 100. One of my platoon mates pumped until fractured arms and his chin also hit the ground. Was given dunno hw many stitches on his chin too.
                  Last time ppl scare so nv say out but now cannot covered up liao..!!
