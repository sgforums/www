              <p>Like wat I mentioned abt SWD. Just over SWD beep and subsequent
              braking, create accident and massive jam on expressway. Who to
              blame? SAF. Why? How come vehicle no engine brake, no situational
              awareness (poor training), so harsh on SWD still.</p>
              <p>Outside we just let go of accelerator... Even TP dun book at
              61kph.. They give u like +10kph tolerance.</p>

              <p>What nonsense, if its a military vehicle and the sticker sticks 50km/h then it will travel consistently at 50km/h, so will the vehicle behind it. Even if the vehicle brake due to SWD/Transponder beeping it will still be around 50km/h. No reason why the vehicle behind will ram into it.</p>
              <p>If u are behind the vehicle and end up ramming into it, its YOUR own fault for tailgating and not paying attention. No one driving any vehicle be it MID or not will brake till a standstill unless due to breakdown on the e-way.</p>
              <p>The punishment guidelines for a count of SWD jump is only 1x extra or a confinement, how is that harsh? And most of the time it is justifiable and waived unless u go more than a count.</p>

Like evryone really want to go db we are humans to im sure nobody want to waste their life following regimental rules and get charge evry sgl time mistake were made. Maybe one day when you guys get married and conceived a son and in time to come he will go to army and then you know what nsf are really going through waking up evryday counting to you ard date thats all we do evry sgl day. And yes thanks fr bringing up the tailgating matter is was great to know someone do really understand.Welfare wise i guess its true but i cant really say its totally true maybe partly but i do really think public should really know whats happening in SAF .</p></div>

              <p>i think alot of u misunderstand the why SAF truck still travel at 50km/h.. given by the duration, as per compared to civilian driving lesson and test, and further more the young and inexperience NSF drivers, they have to drive such a big truck, tonner etc. and therefore the safety limit of 50km/h is there, not to hog the road but to ensure that the vehicle is always under control by the driver. like what the other guys said, unless u tailgating, if not u wont hit the back of the military vehicle..</p>
              <p>can u imagine a big truck travelling at 70-80km/h?? i have seen those commercial truck travelling at way beyond that speed in the morning, and it is weaving in and out of the traffic.. super dangerous..</p>

Even if the vehicle brake due to SWD/Transponder beeping it will still be around 50km/h. No reason why the vehicle behind will ram into it.</p>
              <p>If u are behind the vehicle and end up ramming into it, its YOUR own fault for tailgating and not paying attention. No one driving any vehicle be it MID or not will brake till a standstill unless due to breakdown on the e-way.</p>
              <p>The punishment guidelines for a count of SWD jump is only 1x extra or a confinement, how is that harsh? And most of the time it is justifiable and waived unless u go more than a count.</p>

              <p>Have you driven a military vehicle with swd/transponder? You have 9 beeps to slow down after hearing the first beep, each of them with a interval of about a second. The SWD count is only given when you exceed 10 beeps. Even if u are daydreaming and only hear the beep after the 5th beep, you have ample time to slow down and even come to a complete halt within that 5 sec. How is that not reasonable? Most incidents where someone gets a count that i know of is due to the driver trying to push the limit (i.e. let it beep 7 to 8 times before braking)</p>

              <p>Yes, i do agree that no one will brake for no reason. But the point is not to tailgate, you'll never know what road conditons are ahead. And for alize who suggests to Jam brakes to slow down, you can do that, no one will stop you, but do note that the actions are being closely monitored.</p>

              <p>Ok sure. If you drive a car, try slowing 10kph in 5 seconds. It seems gentle but the driver behind still needs reaction time. If he bang you, he must be a daydreaming cock but chance of an accident still increases. If he is going down slope, higher chance too.</p>

              <p>Lets do some math here, slowing 10kph in 5 secs.</p>
              <p>At 60km/h you would travel 83.3 meters in 5 secs.<br>60km/60mins = 1km/min</p>
              <p>While at 50km/h you would travel 69.4 meters in 5 sec.<br>50km/60mins = 0.833km/min</p>
              <p>The gap between vehicles would have to be Less than 14meters in order for the rear vehicle to hit your rear if he did not react at all.</p>
              <p>Seems pretty likely for an accident? But wait, thats not all.</p>
              <p>Dont forget that you need time to Acclerate to 60kph. You already spent 5 secs slowing down, so that means you only have 4 secs to acclerate.</p>
              <p>4 secs is quite alot of time to acclerate, but what about the rear vehicle? Unless you are tailgating (which means you are already paying attention to the front vehicle), otherwise you would simply have not reacted within in that 4 secs to even catch up with the MID vehicle infront to 60kph.</p>
              <p>Basically, what im trying to say is that a momentarily increase of speed from 50kph followed by a momentarily decrease of speed to 50kph within 9 seconds would not be enough to create rear-end collision because the driver behind would have have seen your brake lights faster than he can catch up.</p>
              <p>Thats the way saf wants it? Follow Law? Good soldier, saf has taught you well! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Well, to be honest with you, its true that this is a problem limited to vehicles with transponders. The old SWD used to beep faster the faster you go, but the transponders beep constantly at a beep per sec.</p>
              <p>This tends to end up with drivers who arnt bothered with the speed until few beeps later, where as the old SWD you wouldnt want to go faster, because it will beep even faster.</p>
              <p>And as sbst275 mentioned, the newer OUVs lack some "rolling resistance" especially when going down a grade.</p>
              <p>This tends to end up making drivers stepping on the brakes only at the last moment which creates a "jamming the brakes effect" you mentioned.</p>
