            <div class='col-md body'>1) Zero your weapon properly<br>2) Hold near the thickest part of handgrip<br>3) Have a firm hold on your rifle, but don't use excessive strength, make sure comfortable position<br>4) Don't keep aiming at the target, wait until they say "firer, watch your front" then concentrate<br>5) Breathe normally, see target liao, let out 1/3 breath, front side tip at the middle of your rear sight, slowly squeeze trigger<br>6) If range abt 100m, then aim slightly lower than where you plan to hit, coz' round will fly abit higher initially<br>7) Before night shoot, take lighter to heat up your front side tip, that small green thing<br><br>That's all to it, make sure weapon zeroed properly.

DUN WEAR CONTACTS thats stupid... imagine if one drops out... good luck man<br><br>2) next, tighten your webbing before going to range to ensure it doesnt swing about too much when u do run downs. V useful..just like for SOC<br><br>3) practice aiming at a small target using your weapon in your free time. try to aim at keeping your rifle still, so that your foresight and your rearsight stay in line. start in your pt kit. then move on to long 4. then finally don your helmet and webbing.<br><br>4) practice your firing technique! there are quite a few points here:<br><br>a)breathing technique<br>b)triggering. remember to hold your breath before u squeeze of. balance a coin on your muzzle while gently squeezing your trigger. when u squeeze your trigger, feel for the double clicking. next dun snap your trigger. or rather, when u pull your trigger use a firm pull not a quick and "snapping" action. snapping would cause your rifle to shift slightly off aim, causing your barrel to shift and therefore causing your round to fly off in every other direction other then the one u aimed at.<br>c) hold the rifle firmly to your body but not squeeze it in tightly. the firmness is for you to maintain a stable grip. squeezing it too tightly would cause your rifle to shift off aim due to every small movement off your body.<br><br>actually there's a lot more to it then what i've just mentioned. however they deal with more specific problems. if any of you do have problems please dun hesitate to PM me. i'll be willing to answer them to the best of my abilities.<br><br>for those that are using the SAR21, please insist on zeroing it. i can't say why as it's restricted information. any other queries i'd be happy to respond to once i verify that you are on a need to know basis.<br><br>other then that, if u have difficulty understanding my advice above, print it out and show it to your PS or PC. they would understand. if they too have difficulty understanding, ask them to give the SAF Shooting Contingent a call.<br><br>SAF Shooting Contingent,<br>Shoot To Win.</div>
