              <p>Hi all brothers and if there is any MO here,</p>
              <p>i wanna ask this ar...Recently, i'm signing on as regular as signals spec but while during the checkup, i cant really hear high frequency in my left ear. my right ear is ok. but MO referred me to go JMC for specialist check, then JMC spec told me to go for MRI, which i had already done.</p>
              <p>but the thing is that before i ord, i was PES A, but i really want to sign on as my financial is very very stable and at least if i sign on, i could at least save quite a lot. (that is my belief la). then oso due that my father is not in his health condition, he also could not work and my mother is the caregiver other than me. my parents encouraged me to sign on so to have a stable job too.</p>
              <p>but brothers here, i just really want to know what pes status can i get because i really need this job a lot. attaining PES B is the min criteria here.</p>
              <p>and having said that, i was quite depressed for over these few days. been finding work for 4 months but unsucessful before deciding to sign on.</p>

              <p>well, don't be depressed! even if you can't sign on eventually, i'm sure there will be a suitable job out there for you. besides, think about the pros and cons of signing on and finding employment outside.</p>
              <p>hope your checkup turns out well, if not, don't fret. continue to seek employment. </p>

              <p>Hi XenOSaga,</p>
              <p>looking at your topic title makes me worry for you. if you have really no passion/ interest in a career, i would recommend that you don't do it. yes, the money is there every month on the 10th for you. but if you really have no interest, at the end of the day you will ask yourself "what am i doing here?". As a regular your Officers/ WOSPEC will expect alot from you not like a NSF.</p>
              <p>The SAF is paying regulars for the time and commitment they have put in. Are you ready to give? If you are, i really hope that you will get your desired PES status and join the force.</p>

              <p>maybe he really cant get a job outside with all foreigners snatching up all and every job.only job the foreigners cant snatch is jobs that require security checks and other basic requirements b4 goin fer interview.</p>
              <p>i know plenty of foreigners who abandoned their spore permanent residence and some want to come back and buy house in spore and work again in spore as foreign talent.</p>
