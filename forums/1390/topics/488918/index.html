              <h1>SAF Dress  General Instructions</h1>
              <br>
              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>The public image of any armed forces depends not only on its 
              proven or potential fighting efficiency in times of war but also equally
               on its appearance and conduct as a disciplined and unified force. 
              Therefore uniformity, correctness and smartness on all occasions are 
              essential in projecting the desired public image.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>Personal Appearance</h3>
              <p>Every service personnel must maintain a neat and clean 
              appearance and be smartly dressed on all occasions while in uniform. 
              Uniforms worn are to be neat, clean, properly fitted and pressed/ironed 
              to portray a smart military image. The uniform must be worn properly at 
              all times.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>Acceptable Haircut in MINDEF/SAF</h3>
              <p>Our military bearing, turnout and conduct reflect the level 
              of discipline and professionalism in the SAF. Apart from facilitating 
              operational readiness, it is therefore crucial for us to upkeep SAF’s 
              image with good military bearing and professionalism. Every serviceman 
              is expected to maintain appropriate bearing and turnout, and acceptable 
              haircut is part of it. Refer to Annex A for Acceptable Haircut in 
              MINDEF/SAF.</p>
              <p>Sikh personnel wearing the turban and patkas, and practising 
              Sikhism prior to enlistment for Full-time National Service are allowed 
              to keep long hair due to their tradition. However, they are to ensure 
              that the hair showings below the turban are neatly tucked in and that 
              beard and moustache are neatly groomed.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>Wearing of Uniform</h3>
              <p>All SAF uniformed personnel (including Regulars, NSF, NSmen 
              and SAF Volunteer Corps) are not allowed to wear the SAF uniform or any 
              part of the SAF uniform, when overseas except when on official duties.</p>
              <p>A Regular, NSF, NSmen or SAF VC is not to wear the uniform or any part of it except when:</p>
              <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
              <li>performing military duty and when proceeding to or from a place of military duty,</li>
              <li>attending a ceremonial function, or a social function of a purely military service in nature or</li>
              <li>any other occasion as directed by MINDEF/SAF.</li>
              </ol> <br>
              <p>The SAF Day marks the importance of defence and the role of 
              every soldier in defending Singapore. To increase public support for 
              defence and NS, all NSmen are encouraged to wear their SAF uniform to 
              work on 1st July.</p>
              <p>Temporary excuse from wearing uniform may be given to service 
              personnel for medical reasons certified by SAF Medical Officers.</p>

              <h1>SAF Dress  Military Wedding</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>In military tradition, all Commissioned Officer (including NSF 
              and NS officers) are eligible for military wedding. All applicants are 
              required to seek approval from their respective Services' R&amp;D.</p>
              <p>The term military wedding is generally used when the groom and 
              the groomsman are in military uniform and the bride and groom pass 
              through under the traditional Arch of Swords. The tradition of the 
              military wedding inherited from the British is usually the choice of the
               bride and groom who wants both colour and ritual ceremony. It can be a 
              spectacular memory for those who are authorized to be married in a 
              military wedding.</p>
              <p>A military wedding follows the same custom and format as a 
              civilian wedding with the exception that the groom/bride is in military 
              uniform and there is an Arch of Swords formed by officers. A military 
              wedding is usually the choice of the bride and groom who want a ceremony
               with military decorum.</p>
              <p>As a military wedding follows certain aspects of military 
              decorum and drill, the wedding proceedings should not breach military 
              protocol and regulations. Only commissioned officers are entitled for a 
              military wedding.</p>
              <p>Military wedding is a privilege presented to the Officers of 
              the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). Donning No. 1 Dress accompanied by 
              Sword Bearers forming the Arch of Sword makes the event memorable and 
              adds to the military grandeur. Traditionally the bride and groom walk 
              through the arch of swords, signifying the couple's safe transition into
               their new life together.</p>

              <h1>SAF Dress  Badges</h1>
              <br>
              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>The principle of wearing the SAF badges is that the vocation badge or the badge of highest precedence will be worn <strong>closest to the heart and above</strong> all others when more than one badge is worn. All SAF badges, except for
               Identification badges are to be worn on the left side of the uniform. A
               maximum of three badges can be worn on the left chest area and a 
              maximum of two tabs and two badges on the left shoulder sleeves.</p>
              <p>Approved foreign badges are to be worn in accordance with how 
              they are worn on the awarding country/foreign armed forces’ uniform, 
              except that they are worn on the right side of the uniform. A maximum of
               three foreign badges may be worn on the right chest area, two foreign 
              badges may be worn on the right pocket flap and one foreign badge may be
               worn on the right beast pocket of the uniform. A total of three badges 
              including Identification Badge may be worn on the right chest area and a
               maximum of three foreign badges may be worn on the right side of the 
              uniform at any one point of time. One foreign skill tab may be worn on 
              the right sleeve.</p>
              <p>SAF badges are categorised into the following groups:</p>
              <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
              <li>vocation badges</li>
              <li>arms badges</li>
              <li>skill badges (including skill tabs)</li>
              <li>proficiency badges</li>
              <li>incentive badges</li>
              <li>identification badges</li>
              <li>formation/unit badges</li>
              </ol> <br>
              <p>Within each category, the order of precedence is according to 
              Service, for example, Army personnel will wear the airborne wings ahead 
              of a diver's badge while Navy personnel will wear them vice-versa.</p>

              <h4>Notes:</h4>
              <ul>
              <li>Maximum of three SAF badges may be worn on the left chest area.</li>
              <li>A single badge is to be worn centrally on the left side of the dress on the left chest area.</li>
              <li>Where Two badges are mounted side by side, the vocation badge or the badge of highest precedence will be worn <strong>closest to the heart and above</strong> all others when more than one badge is worn. In the event of a vocation
               badge or the badge is too large for this manner of mounting, they are 
              to be mounted on two tiers.</li>
              <li>Three badges are to be mounted in the form of a pyramid.</li>
              <li>The numbering of 1, 2 and 3 in the pictures denote the order of precedence of the badges.</li>
