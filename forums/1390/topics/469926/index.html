              Hey guys would like to ask a few qns about PTP and other stuff. Any help would be greatly appreciated! 
              
              Im 18 this year and im going to take my A lvls this year. Unfortunately, I didn't manage to get a Silver for NAPFA because I got an E for my SBJ but I did fine for the others(AABCC), trained so hard and yet for some reason still fail. I've always had a strong interest in a military career(esp. joining commandos/SOF) but sadly, I wear specs( &gt;100 for both eyes). 
              
              One question is that is there any chance they would at least invite me for a selection test for CDO in my current state? (going for medical checkup in June, most prolly PES B/A as I certainly have no health problems(I passed a previous medical checkup for SYFC, if not wrong, was a fighter pilot medical checkup) other than being myopic)
              
              Do they only accept people with AAAAAA for NAPFA? Im the youngest boy in the family and im really interested in being a cdo/sof as a career.
              
              Now another question regarding PTP, would joining a PTP platoon greatly lower ur chance of joining OCS? Would they still stereotype u as being weak even though after the PTP training u become equally or more fit than the Enhanced BMT ppl? I really hope not or I would be greatly disappointed on how they select.
              
              Once again, any help would be deeply appreciated. Thank You! =)

              for recruits who are medically fit for deployment in selected
              combat and combat support vocations, such as signal operators,
              combat medics and naval system operators. These recruits will be
              given a new medical classification of PES B2, in place of the
              existing PES C1 classification. This is to ensure that the medical
              classification of our soldiers is consistent with their deployment.
              The new 9-week programme will include customised physical training,
              as well as basic combat training to prepare them for their combat
              and combat support roles.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES C

              training to prepare them for combat service support vocations, such
              as service medic, and those related to logistics and

              Education, SAF core values, regimentation and discipline to prepare
              recruits for combat service support vocations.</p>

              <p>The only way is to express interest to volunteer for Commando (CDO)/ Naval Diving Unit (NDU) is to call the 24/7 NS hotline at 1800-3676767 to request a customer service officer to insert your name

              <p>Wearing spectacles will not affect you from selection/ shortlist to join the commandos. I have a friend who is in 1CDO BN also wearing glasses, so it is fine.</p>
              <p>If you are PES A/ B1L1 and shortlisted for VA, you should receive an invitation notice to attend the VA interview and trial physical test to gauge you on some static IPPT stations to test your reflexes. If you really want to join the commandos, then in the interview, tell the interviewers there to express your interest to join the close-knit family. But no guarantee, some here have vented their frustations to tell us that they aced the physical test and express interest in the interview, yet they didn't get in due to the interviewers are looking for the right attitude, personality and character to join them. They even appealed to CMPB to be re-considered/ 2nd chance, but they are still posted to Tekong BMT, abeit in the Enhanced Leadership batch which is eligible for a shot to OCS/ SCS to be officers and sergeants though.</p>
              <p>To dispel the PTP rumours/ myth/ fiction, the truth is PTP just means more physical trainings to make a fitter you. PTP is full 24 months of NS than the 22 months of NS to those who gotten their NAPFA 'fitness cut' incentive for staying fit and healthy before NS enlistment.</p>
              <p>Hope this helps.</p>

              <p>Really?</p>
              <p>To dispel rumours and urban myths, doing PTP in Tekong is just and fair on equal footings with recruits with NAPFA silver/ gold. Nothing bias.</p>
              <p>By the way, during my time, almost half of my PTP platoon section mates made it to command schools to be officers and sergeants where 2 out of 15 made it to OCS.</p>
              <p>Anyway, CDO recruits are screened for prior military security clearance even before you are shortlisted for VA interview, whether you failed or did not turn up for the interview or not.</p>
              <p>If you are not selected for CDO BMT eventually, you will either get posted to a direct intake NS unit/ Tekong BMT. In my case, I am in Recon/ Reece platoon. Nearly half of us had been called up for the VA interview. Most of them either turned it down/ not selected even if passed, but ended up in Scout platoon.</p>

              Im glad to hear this good news from you guys! May I ask eac, the moderator, whether do I call the hotline after my medical check up or can I do so now? Roughly how long after my medical check up would I know I have been shortlisted for VA. Is it immediately after my check up? I would like to know the estimated waiting time so that I would know im not shortlisted and can call the customer service to insert my name. 
              
              Thank you so much for the replies guys, I appreciate it very much!

I did approach the customer service counter after my checkup about a month ago to check whether it was possible to volunteer for the CDO VA and the lady said yes. She gave me the CMPB enlistment number to call too. Maybe it was just the telephone operator. I'll try calling again another time. Ill probably wont be heading down to CMPB anytime soon as I live pretty far away. Thanks anyway for your help! =)</div>
