            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Monday May 21, 10:17 PM</span><br><br>SINGAPORE: The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) has been given additional powers to deal with the changed security landscape.<br><br>This follows an amendment to the SAF Act.<br><br>But in the parliamentary debate before the Act was passed, MPs expressed concerns at how such wide-ranging powers would be carried out.<br><br>The security landscape has changed since the September 11, 2001 attack in the US.<br><br>The new reality now - unconventional threats where perpetrators may not even be in uniform or carry guns.<br><br>So the SAF has been given new powers, to act alongside domestic agencies like the police.<br><br>A select group of SAF personnel - some 2,000 of them - are being specially trained and will be able to search, detain and use reasonable force against terror suspects under special situations.<br><br>Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean told Parliament that this was necessary to address the new security threats.<br><br>He said the existing domestic legal framework was not adequate.<br><br>But MPs had some concerns.<br><br>Among them - how would such personnel be identified, would they be discreet and what about the possibility of impersonation or even abuse?<br><br>MP Indranee Rajah said: "I appreciate that the servicemen cannot stop (a person) on the spot and call back for orders and say 'Excuse me, can I search the person?'. I think the point I want to make is that it's not just the methodology of carrying out the search procedure, but the training in when to exercise the discretion, how to exercise the discretion, particularly when dealing with civilians."<br><br>MP Ong Chit Chung said: "In the London underground, a person was shot by mistake, suspected wrongly of being a terrorist. Would there be clear rules of engagement for SAF servicemen and how well would they be trained to handle tricky and delicate situations? Bear in mind, mishaps cannot be ruled out."<br><br>MP Michael Palmer said: "Almost every male Singaporean owns, or has in his possession, a camouflage No. 4 uniform. In fact, it is readily available for purchase at various army surplus stores. Does this mean that once the order is made, we must allow everyone in No. 4 uniform to stop, search and seize and arrest us without warrant? How will we know which serviceman has the authority to act under Section 201 (C) order? How will we know whether a serviceman is or isn't on duty even if he falls under the Act?"<br><br>The Defence Minister stressed that additional powers will be clearly identified.<br><br>Mr Teo said: "SAF personnel on security operations will wear an identification like an armband that says 'Military Security', much like the military police band today. In addition, we'll issue a Military Security identification card to SAF personnel conducting military operations. This card will have a photo of the military personnel, his name and his NRIC number. The card will be issued to the military personnel for the duration of the operation."<br><br>Mr Teo added that unlike a police warrant card which has wider powers, the Military Security identification card gives SAF personnel limited powers for checks in a defined area to conduct specific tasks. - CNA/ir</div>
