Fortunately, because the members of the SAF are thoroughly integrated into society at large, there are no major military/civilian issues.</p>
              <p>Apart from such minor divisions, a more important dichotomy is observed between officers who are polytechnic or local university graduates (<strong>Farmers</strong>), and former scholarship holders who studied overseas (<strong>Scholars</strong>). This phenomenon exists because of fast-tracked careers, quick promotions, a dual-track career in the Civil Service after mandatory retirement offered as enticement for young men to take up SAF scholarships. While this state of affairs has existed since the Singapore government started giving out scholarships, the issue was mentioned in <span style="color: #000000;">Parliament</span> for the first time in a speech decrying the class-consciousness and social stratification resulting from the existing policies<sup><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">from:<br></span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces_ranks"><span style="font-size: x-small;">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces_ranks</span></a></sup></p>

              <p>About 4 to 5 is given out. its only given out to the cream and top brains..but none of them sign on as combat service support (medical, logistics, engineering) so you don't have to worry about them.all of them sign with combat or combat support arms only</p>
              <p>your question is very strange, almost like you just crawled out of a rock.. its as if you thought its everyone's dream to be a LSA farmer. you sound detached from reality..you need counselling from teraexa, the bumpkin</p>
              <p>the absence of scholars in service support arms like engineering,
                                      logistics and medical is a double edged sword. farmers don't have to
                                      worry about scholars cos scholars don't go there, it's farmer's world
                                      over in service support, like your own paradise, but it's a cycle.
                                      Scholars don't go there because service vocations CMI and play second
                                      fiddle to combat vocations and arms like pilots, armour, infantry and what not. So yea what you
                                      think is a pro is actually a con to begin with.</p>
              <p>BUT though people languishing in service support arms got less luminous and more crappy career in SAF, compared to farmers in combat arms they enjoy higher employability and transferrence of skill sets upon retirement from SAF. This is a well known fact, i hope you're smart enough to figure out. Its less regarded in SAF because it's less specialised to SAF, thats why is service support. But it also means more currency in civilian world for farmers. A lot of them apply to and work in SIA engineering, SATS engineering after retirement.</p>
              <p>This means for those signing on with service support, it's not a bad deal as farmer. You get to be in your own world while in SAF, though less glamour than combat but it's ok, just mind your business in your world and then unlike the farmers in combat, you have an easier transition post retirement.</p>

              <p>everything else u say is correct but this would be incorrect. local masters is farmer with master's that's all. This is cos SAF completely disregards master's degrees for both scholars and farmers. it doesn't affect or do anything to CEP or starting &amp; subsequent pay. SAF scholars say even if they didn't do their master's they will get the same starting pay as doing it, but they do it cos it's all paid by SAF anyway. if both degrees are completed within 4 years, the post grad will also be borne by SAF. Not doing it just means coming back earlier to start working. All do because of a richer academic experience for the same opportunity cost (not say you come back in 3 yrs with just bachelor's you serve shorter bond).</p>
              <p>99% of PSC scholars (which means SAFOS, police rejects SPFOS and OMS) in history do master's before they come back as do statutory board scholars (I know none who didn't). one of them even squeeze a PhD while doing his bachelor's within 4 years and then came back, he became a bit of a mini legend during that time http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/printfriendly/0,4139,69035,00.html although he sounds nice there, he is really a dick in person. i know 2 SMS who did not do master's (just cos it won't affect or help career or pay), further reinforcing how SMS are farmer-scholars with this kind of mentality......as has been established here..</p>
