              <p><strong>Original Topic Title (before topic was moved and renamed): Male Gender-Inequality and The Current Sexist NS Conscription Law</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription#sexism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription#sexism</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gender equality should apply for both genders and not only on women.</p>
              <p>Do you think it is fair for only male-persons to be forced into grossly underpaid service (+ lots of weekends burns, sometimes psychology trauma, + having to go back for reservice every year, with all the related restrictions, i.e. have to cut hair short, no dying of hair, etc), and impact on work (especially researchers and people who's income depends on commission, etc), while all females are spared?</p>
              <p>I had to serve 2.5 year. Hence that makes a total of 3 years wasted (considering the waiting period for my transistion into NS, and then into Uni). While females would have the opportunity to get ahead with their careers due to this sexist policy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Staying in the kitchen, and become a housewife is no longer a gender role requirement for females in the modern age. This is a great thing. So why should backward silly machismo sexist gender roles for males still apply? Why are male-persons still expected to be strong and brave to expend their lifes in the frontlines and haven a significant 2.5 + reservice years of their lifes taken away, when we no longer live in a savage and babaric world?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not all males are necessarily stronger or fitter than females even though it might be a majority. Even Pes Cs or Es still have to serve while Pes A and B females have a choice.  </p>

              <p>Precisely because it is macho motivated, and macho men (like the above posters) are terrified at the thought of being called sissies, therefore there are not enough men to protest. (And women... Just how many of them do you think will fight to do as much as the men do? Women are not so stupid. They will only fight for rights that benefit them, not for rights that will cause them to lose out on something.)</p>
              <p>Dear Singaporean men, please stop acting macho, be SMART and fight for your rights. Only idiots willingly throw their rights away thinking that it shows manliness. I think, more than manliness, it shows STUPIDITY.</p>

              <p>Sorry but this to me is a not a valid argument against gender equality.</p>
              <p>It is silly IMO to assume that all females will automatically get raped, and also that THAT somehow justify every female not to sacrifice the best part of their life to NS. Further men could too suffer insane torture and death during war. In a real war, everyone's a casualty regardless of gender.</p>
              <p>Immigrants who did not serve should too pay NS-compensation tax, to compensate people who had already sacrificed a significant part of their youth to NS. Especially those who had already sacrifice more (2.5-3yrs) to NS and got treated a lot worse than what it is now.</p>

              <p>the purpose of ns to protect the country from invasion, and it
              has failed utterly, all thanks to our government opening up the
              floodgates for foreigners to invade.</p>
              <p>out of a population of 5million, 45% are foreigners(PRs and work
              permit), not including newly converted citizens.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">in WW2, all it took was 20,000 japs to invade and
              occupy singapore.</span></p>
              <p>today, we have more than 2,000,000 foreigners on this tiny
              island, 100X the jap invasion force in 1942. and by that
              definition, singapore should now be considered an occupied state.
              thus, so why bother to have NS?</p>

              <p>I, just like you served 2.5 years too. Back in my time, if you were LCP and below, you only need serve 2 years. So everyone kind of prayed they didn't get a promotion to CPL and above.</p>
              <p>The only things I would hope for now to replace the existing system is a bigger incentive cut from income tax, and preferably, no more annual IPPT.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> I enjoy reservist in camp training very much although it is physically tough on my ageing body, but its a really good break from work life. The best part about it is you get to work with a bunch of people on the same frequency as you, to get things done good and fast.</p>
