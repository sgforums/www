              <p><br>depends. if in sch or non bn unit also can posted to bn. all depends on whether there is a shortfall of clerks in a particular unit anot. ts: u will be clerk lor. i can tell u when u become nsman, excused all the lan sai also they dont really care one. i excused guard duty cuz of my med problem during my 2 years, my csm keep forcing me to do till i dulan ask my chief clerk to settle for me. after that my csm super hate me. see me will keep staring.</p>

              <p>sorry , it asked abt reservist is because I have got tonnes of problems fitting into those hokkein soldiers environment (my ex unit tekong ), I am worried that reservist i might encounter lots of them .</p>
              <p>I am also warded into SAF ward in my old unit .</p>
              <p>this is a problem acknowledged by saf doc my pdoc .</p>
              <p>I din really elaborate on that during the MMI session .</p>
              <p>my new unit is finally OK but does nt mean reservist will be like that .</p>
              <p>do have some problems with bathing all these . cant bathe without doors .  tekong PS made me bathe alone at 11 , he help me guard the room .</p>
              <p>I mean next time at my MMI review , i would tell and discuss with the SAF psy .</p>
              <p>i really think this is a problem . the ICT thing .</p>
              <p>and when i go to new places , i get very tensed . reservist all is strangers leh , I am worried because of all these .</p>
              <p>and i only do simple office duties in my camp shred paper , cut paper , photocopy , fax m simple filing , parade state half of what normal clerks do , ICT ppl wont bother abt ur problems . they also wont know u are p tagged and ur history right ?</p>

              <p>will4: i can't tell u when cuz i myself not sure. but i can tell u almost no one wants a p tagged personel. not that im looking down on anyone who is p tagged(my buddy in my unit was p tagged too) and my best fren in the office is p tagged too.</p>
              <p>goldevil: just curious, how have u coped with your life so far? i dun mean any harm, but in this case, try to keng till u get a pes e or better still, pes f. then u shall be free from this misery. but will have alot of other complications in the future when u want to look for a job or look for future partner bla bla bla. get what i mean? my best advice though, is to try and change your mindset. what's there to be nervous abt?</p>
              <p>i've seen a guy who was pes e and was a direct enlistment into my unit. for the 1st few days, he didnt dare to talk to us. but we tried to talk to him and joke with him. all of us look upon him like a little bro and try to help him whenever we can. he has some kind of phobia of humans. but when i ord, at least he takes the initiative to try and talk to others and all. he even smile at us! it's possible to change. thats all i can tell u. if u need someone to talk to, u can pm me.</p>
