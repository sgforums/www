Whatever parts you may get at Beach Road, is not range-certified nor may it stand up to safe usage in your exercises.<br><br>If you lose your pins, go to the armskote specialist and work something out with them. Normally they are quite understanding. It is BMT, and your instructors will understand if these things happen, of course they will yell and curse and throw you extras.<br><br>But do understand, a rifle is a lethal weapon, and a rifle requires working, rated parts to function safely.<br><br>This is a safety issue affecting not just you, but for your fellow mates as well. The parts in your rifles have been tested for metal fatigue and structural rigidity before being certified for live-firing usage.<br><br>I don't really want to see a thread about dead recruits and exploding rifles here.<br><br>Thanks.</div>
