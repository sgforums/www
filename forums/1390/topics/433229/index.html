              <p>Hi all, I was PES B and I am undergoing my BMT now.</p>
              <p>I am doing enchanced leadership BMT and I really cannot take it. After enduring 7 weeks of BMT, I finally cannot take the training and become very depressed. Hence, I tried to use cut and kill myself. I was admitted to Institute of Mental Health (IMH) and was OOT from then on. The tekong MO also arranged for me to go to SAF ward psychiatrist specialist.</p>
              <p>I had a few questions regarding my situations right now as followed:</p>
              <p>1. Do you think it is likely that I can get a down PES?</p>
              <p>2. If I can get a down PES, what PES do you think I will get and will it be permanent or temporary?</p>
              <p>3. What vocation will I most likely be assigned to?</p>
              <p>4. Do I need to recourse my BMT? If yes, will I recourse enchanced leadership BMT course again or will I get other types of BMT? Also, do you know when will be the likely time for me to recourse my BMT? (eg, 3 months later, 6 months later, before I ORD)</p>
              <p>I also have a few concerns right now. I am a scholarship holder and got a quite competitive course in NUS. Also, I am intending to go overseas such as US or UK for university. Thus, I have the following concerns:</p>
              <p>1. What will be written in the testimonial after I completed two years of NS?</p>
              <p>2. Will they reflect my depression, suicide attempt and admittion to IMH in my testimonial? I know superficial illness such as flu will not be reflected. However, given the severity of my incident, will they reflect?</p>
              <p>3. Does university and employers in future look at my NS testimonial? How important is it for my future career?</p>
              <p>4. When I go to see SAF phychiatrist, should I request for him to downgrade my PES? I am thinking that if I behave normally in front of the doctor and insist I am ok and I do not need a down PES, he will think I am ok and will not reflect this incident in my testimonial or to other people.</p>
              <p>However, if the case is that he will reflect about this incident in my testimonial regardless of whether I down PES or not, I would rather insist the doctor to down my PES and lead an easier life in this 2 years.</p>
              <p>Thanks a lot to people who can help me. It will be better for people who have already completed NS to answer me because they would have received their testimonial and will know what it comprises of. I am really concerned about my scholarship. I am scared if the scholarship discovered this incident, they will nullify my scholar.</p>
              <p>Thanks once more for helping me out!</p>

              <p>1. depending on MO</p>
              <p>2. If down sure will be C but which depending on how severe your depression.</p>
              <p>3. Vocation by luck.</p>
              <p>4. Of cos u need to recourse BMT but B or C BMT depending on your pes status.</p>
              <p>As for the testimonial, I think all illness is not reflected inside there but will it affect your scholarship I cannot be too sure, I wouldn't be surprise if it does. Always think before you do something stupid, suicide is the most stupid thing, especially in NS. Btw what scholarship u got anyway, if SAF, I think it's over for you for sure.</p>

              <p>Ok, Depression is graded from PES C to E.</p>
              <p>If you are downgarded to PES C , then you recourse BMT.</p>
              <p>If downgraded to PES E then maybe you are liable for one month PES E BMT.</p>

              <p>If you are diagnosed to have mental disorder, no insurance or university would like to accept you.You will be kick out of scholarship. This is confirmed.</p>
              <p>There have been real cases of students commiting suicide and died, students killing professors and died. The universities are very careful about this type of medical cases. </p>
              <p>So I suggest if you have real mental problem, do get it resolved. Mental problem will only get better if physiological session is given and medication is taken. </p>

              <p>Thanks everyone for answering my questions. I am very grateful to all of you.</p>
              <p>my scholarship is not SAF, but it is governmental scholarship. So i think it's quite risky and thus im very concerned.</p>
              <p>Also, till know nobody tried to answer my fourth question which is:</p>
              <p>4. When I go to see SAF phychiatrist, should I request for him
                                          to downgrade my PES? I am thinking that if I behave normally in
                                          front of the doctor and insist I am ok and I do not need a down
                                          PES, he will think I am ok and will not reflect this incident in my
                                          testimonial or to other people.</p>
              <p>However, if the case is that he will reflect about this incident
                                          in my testimonial regardless of whether I down PES or not, I would
                                          rather insist the doctor to down my PES and lead an easier life in
                                          this 2 years.</p>
              <p>I really need help to decide whether I should insist on down PES when i see the phychiatrist next Tuesday. I would need some help here urgent as the appointment is only 4 days away. Any tips or advice or past experiences?</p>
              <p>Thanks a lot!</p>
              <p>(I must clarify that I do not have mental disorder, it is just a bit depression and the fact that I cant get used to the regimentation and pace of NS.  However, I was forced to be sent to IMH which is for mental disorder patients. People normally associate "warding in IMH equals to mental disorder". Thus I am scared that I am tagged with this bad reputation and thus it will affect my future.)</p>

The tekong MO also arranged for me to go to SAF ward psychiatrist specialist.</p>
              <p>I had a few questions regarding my situations right now as followed:</p>
              <p>1. Do you think it is likely that I can get a down PES?</p>
              <p>2. If I can get a down PES, what PES do you think I will get and will it be permanent or temporary?</p>
              <p>3. What vocation will I most likely be assigned to?</p>
              <p>4. Do I need to recourse my BMT? If yes, will I recourse enchanced leadership BMT course again or will I get other types of BMT? Also, do you know when will be the likely time for me to recourse my BMT? (eg, 3 months later, 6 months later, before I ORD)</p>
              <p>I also have a few concerns right now. I am a scholarship holder and got a quite competitive course in NUS. Also, I am intending to go overseas such as US or UK for university. Thus, I have the following concerns:</p>
              <p>1. What will be written in the testimonial after I completed two years of NS?</p>
              <p>2. Will they reflect my depression, suicide attempt and admittion to IMH in my testimonial? I know superficial illness such as flu will not be reflected. However, given the severity of my incident, will they reflect?</p>
              <p>3. Does university and employers in future look at my NS testimonial? How important is it for my future career?</p>
              <p>4. When I go to see SAF phychiatrist, should I request for him to downgrade my PES? I am thinking that if I behave normally in front of the doctor and insist I am ok and I do not need a down PES, he will think I am ok and will not reflect this incident in my testimonial or to other people.</p>
              <p>However, if the case is that he will reflect about this incident in my testimonial regardless of whether I down PES or not, I would rather insist the doctor to down my PES and lead an easier life in this 2 years.</p>
              <p>Thanks a lot to people who can help me. It will be better for people who have already completed NS to answer me because they would have received their testimonial and will know what it comprises of. I am really concerned about my scholarship. I am scared if the scholarship discovered this incident, they will nullify my scholar.</p>
              <p>Thanks once more for helping me out!</p>

              <p>Hi Almond Cookies,</p>
              <p>the IMH psychiatrist cannot make a decision on whether I can be down PES or not. He can only assess my situation and write a report accordingly.</p>
              <p>Then it is up to the SAF psychiatrist to decide based on the IMH report and his assessment on me when I meet him</p>
              <p>So, I do not know whether I should insist on saying that I cannot take the training and request for down PES, or I should just assure him that I am well and I can take the training in case he writes more serious mental disorder on my record for me to get down PES. I cannot afford more serious mental disorder in my record if I want to save my scholarship. However, if he will reflect about this incident
                                      in my testimonial regardless of whether I down PES or not, I might as well down PES and get an easier life in NS.</p>

              <p>I hardly think your scholarship is conditional on the sponsor reviewing your NS testimonial or certificate of service.</p>
              <p>But if it is, then you might spend your 2 years strategizing how to 
              defend your scholarship IF someone asks the question. If not, keep quiet
               and enjoy it.</p>
              <p>Also, a medical condition will probably not be recorded on either document. Some testimonials are written by commanders, some by the NSF himself, some people don't have one. Throw it away if it's not flattering. Everyone has a COS and you should look at what your peers have written on theirs.</p>
              <p>That aside, attempted suicide is a relatively common thing, but don't count on it not being stigmatized.</p>
