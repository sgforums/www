            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding the new armour, there are technologies out there that are about 6kg with vest, packs and plates with floatation systems.<br><br>We need to train with these, better than in my days, I carried dummy mags for 6.5 years, they simulate full combat loads and we clear 10km SOC with full packs of 15kgs with an SBO of 10kgs plus 3 kg of drinking water which we try to gulp up as much as possible during the run, spilling on the way....we all know the tricks.<br><br>But to our boys now serving in Afghanistan, we need to give them the best money can buy.<br><br>A new hybrid system using the best of russian, dutch and american technologies can make the vest very light. With nano materials, lower the trauma.<br><br>I have known a chap in Afghanistan, he was shot in the chest by an SPD Dragunov round (this thing is more siong than an GPMG round with steel core!). When he got up from his near 30 sec of passing out, he was shot again in the back and throwing him 2m forward to eat dirt. He wrote in to the armor company thanking for the OTV he was wearing.<br><br>In fact, the new OTC program allows some weight transfer and you won't feel the weight as compared to our useless non ergonomic field pack.<br><br>There is a company in Singapore that developed a new nanotechnology that can produce a IIIA helmet (something that SAF do not have....our korean crap is only for fragments) that is so thin, only 3mm thick that now helmets can be made smaller and harder to hit and more comfortable to wear.....not to mention that since now less materials are used, it is also a lot lighter, some 50% less heavy max.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know whats the sad thing? Unlike the US or other coalition troops, if they find that the protection they have is inadequate, they have the option to buy non-standard issue stuff at their own expens such as the Dragon-Skin BA, enhanced gun-sights etc.etc...all aftermarket stuff. But if our boys (possibly myself in the near future) were to be sent to operate, I won't have that luxury to  further protect/equip myself even if my family can afford such stuff. Thats the sad thing.<br><br>Can you imagine what you as a buddy have to tell his parents if he gets waxed during an ops? "Sorry Sir, Mdm...we were told to use only the standard issue equipment." I say that any soldier that goes into battle deserves the best that money can buy,even if the state doesn't sponsor them, at least make available this avenue for them to procure at their own expense. Life first...money is a secondary issue when faced with a torrential rain of lead.</div>

For jungle warfare, I'm more skeptical.<br><br>The "thorough" body amor you're describing is something I envision, say, what today's SWAT teams would wear. If the SAF wants to outfit it for its infantry, let's first see what kind of formal battle strategy it adopts for. For example, there's a fundamental difference between siege warfare (i.e. attritional street fighting, which was what the DSTA usually alludes to when introducing all the new technology) &amp; "shock &amp; awe" conflict (i.e. shock/assault troops, which is what our RDF units -- &amp; given the limited manpower, perhaps the whole combat side -- shall be deployed for).<br><br>That said, as with a lot of the Robocop equipment at 3 SIR now, IMO things like groin &amp; shoulder armor have limited practical use in the "bush." The latter environment has its own indigenous conditions &amp; requires a completely different way of engagement fire -- which, if you've ever trained alongside US or Australian troops before, we South-east Asian armies are actually the lao chiao peng. You'll more likely to get a sucking chest wound or a bullet hole in the head instead, cuz any enemy round that hits the soil or a nearby tree will likely be bored there instead of ricocheting.<br><br><blockquote>But if our boys (possibly myself in the near future) were to be sent to operate, I won't have that luxury to further protect/equip myself even if my family can afford such stuff.

Sometimes the ROEs maybe overly inflexible for the man on the ground to exercise better judgment of it to decide when it goes out the window. He will probably be thinking, can i fire at him because he's armed? Can i fire at him because he's weapon is pointed in my direction or can I fire at him as he's shooting in my direction. and you never know when it can and will happen. Thus i'm in for BA.</div>

If you think that BA is a bloody waste of time and money for the majority FINE. But i will tell u whats a bigger waste! Spending money of all the techie witch shit like carrying a bloody computer/pda in your pack with some lcd screen hanging off your helmet that requires battery power to work. The system no matter how advanced, requires batteries to work. And if BA is considered useless to a fool like me...perhaps you would like to talk to the fools in DSTA and get them to wake up their idea. Saving lives is definitely more important than saving money on necessity items. To those whom believe that quality training investment is better den investment on equipment, sorry to say in this day and age, both works together. Voluntary or not our participation, i strongly believe each and every trooper deserves the best protection that we can afford considering that he/she is putting their lives on the line for us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I came from one of the SIR which is new and have a very good branding, we were the ones who went for real non-sensitive operations island wide, the BA were a necessity mainly the reasons: 1) Basic protection for troops, 2)  Confidence for the troops 3) Reflects professionalism and pride of our army and lastly 4) Make the investors and visitors feel safe that our troops are well armed and equipped to protect them. But BA for conventional warfare, sounds weird, thought dunno how well the lads can handle that.. still prefer to walk ba long long in the jungle wif full battle order..</div>
