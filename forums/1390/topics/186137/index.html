            <div class='col-md body'>Donchoo, I myself enlisted early under the VEES Voluntary Early Enlistment Scheme and therefore was an early enlistee myself, I would like to share some things with you.<br><br>The reason why I enlisted early was because I did not do JC or Poly in Singapore, I did a one year Matriculation Pre University course in Sydney Australia. And after that came back to Singapore to enlist and it had to be under the VEES cos I was still just a 17 year old kid!<br><br>I discern a few areas of concern here. One is probably if one at such a young and tender age will be able to take the rigours of army training and life or not. Well, if I could survive so can you!  I definitely DO NOT say that army life will be a bed of roses and piece of cake but that even at a younger age, if one puts in the effort and trains, one can take the training.<br><br>Another area is the maturity of the brain. I definitely acknowledge that someone at around 22-23 years of age has an advantage in being more mature to be able to survive in the army compared to a 17 year old kid, However if one is willing to learn the ropes of the military life fast and be willing to adapt fast to the environment and the army way of life, then one can also survive well in the environment and be as savvy as one who is older.<br><br>Remember, no matter what your ages are, you might be the younger one, BUT all of you are fresh recruits. Your rank is the same, you are a recruit, they are a recruit, they have NO RIGHT to push you around and order you around, your corporals and sergeants and officers are the ones who are your superiors NOT your fellow recruits.<br><br>Unfortunately there might be some recruits who try to act the big boss, do not give them face cos they have no right to do so. This is all based on personal experience.<br><br>Well, so much for the downsides and how to overcome them, I shall move on to the advantages, for one thing the younger you go in the younger you ORD and leave the army and the younger you can move on to your next stage of life. I ORDed when I was just 19! When so many others at that age have not even enlisted yet!<br><br>One last thing, about the talk on being able to get an easier vocation for those who early enlist I am not sure and never really heard of such a thing. There is no guarantee about it and if anyone else can verify such a policy please do tell.<br><br>If there is anything else you wish to know please ask!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>All the best! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Just like to add, being an early enlistee does not mean anything significantly different or hardly anything different in terms of training/treatment from those who enlist upon being 18 or above who have done JC/Poly. One will be treated the same as the other recruits.<br><br>So life as an early enlistee will not be anything really different from the others and my best guess it will not be anything worse than the other enlistees.<br><br>I again state that I am not sure about that statement about early enlistees being given easier vocations after BMT and if anyone can verify it please do state here.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
