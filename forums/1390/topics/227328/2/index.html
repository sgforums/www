Like they always will.<br><br>just my reflections after 2 weeks.<br><br></div></blockquote>Wa lao... 2 weeks only and u give it a death sentence! You judge too quickly. SAF does have it's merit. Go talk to those who have gone through SAF and you may realise that  those who go through positively will gain from it and these ppl often do also look forward to the reservist period. Go through it negatively and u will just waste 2.5 yrs of your life!<br><br>As u grow up, u will realise that life is harsh and not a bed of roses. Life is also not about individualism but is mainly about group and community. There is always the contradiction that what u want may not be what the group wants and it is usually the leader who dictates the direction and goals. The position of a follower and that of a leader is also very different. If you want the army to be what u think should be, then u must be a leader (a small one at least) in the organisation and u got to prove yourself to be one with qualities that the organisation wants.  If you do not aspire to be a leader in that organisation, you will have to FIT IN as a follower. You can be a good follower or a bad follower. A bad follower in army gets punished often and he will not be a happy one. This is in general is the principal with which I believe is how most organisations function.<br><br>Of course the values and goals with which in organisation looks for can be vastly different because these are what that will bring it to meet it's goals better. U are intelligent and surely know what are the goals and values in the army. The fear and regimentation is not senseless and has a strong purpose of instilling strong discipline. The pain is necessary for training of great endurance. And pride will come when there is a achievement together.<br><br>In any case, I am sure u will go through and perhaps may even be the officer u want to be because I think u already got 1 trait of a leader and that's the ability to analyse. But that is just one trait and with which u have to further use in analysing the situation during training. Of course, there are also several more impt ones that determines whether u can be a officer.</div>

Or maybe its the change in the type of life, sigh. The regimentation, and the facades that you sometimes have to put up to get along with your bunk mates, and sometimes the age difference of more than 5 years have been problems that i've encountered. it is as if recruits are only allowed to feel these simple emotions of pain, happiness and fear. a feeling's worth more than dogs. in the end, you end up more ignorant of the real world outside, learning so called life skills, which if so properly indoctrinated, why are these sergeants who sign up end up so CMI in the real world?<br><br>i know thousands have been through it, but i can foresee army scarring me psychologically and mentally for the rest of my life already. you may survive biologically without doubt, but you may change forever. a part of yourself is missing...vulgarities commonplace, doing things out of fear and not pride, the senseless regimentation, which, ironically makes me lazier in the civilian world.<br><br>Sigh, why does SAF run on a system of fear, and not the inherent motivation for soldiers to perform out of pride...pain. pain.<br><br>The only thing that comforts me is that all these things will come to an end. Like they always will.<br><br>just my reflections after 2 weeks.<br><br></div></blockquote>Its normal to feel that way. We have all been pampered so much that when we are treated the way we are in the Army, we think its going to be scarred for the rest of our lives.<br><br>Thing is, the sooner u realise the Army is not a holiday camp, the faster u will adjust. Of course it is tough. But then again, there are thousands others who are serving like u, and they are going through the same thing. And the thing about doing things out of fear and not pride? Since when have we done things because we are proud of it? Do u go to school because u feel proud to study? Do u work because u feel proud to work? Of course NOT. You do all these out of necessity. Its call life, and u have to go through these as part of life.<br><br>I, like u, was apprenhensive about Army initially. I wonder why guys must do NS, why must I be born in Singapore. But then after u finish these 2 years, u will realise that although u may not have gained much out of it, but at least your 2 years was not a complete waste. You learn much about life, how different things operate. Trust me, when u finish NS, and u go on to work/study, u will find urself talk about NS life quite often, and when u talk about something so often, that's often because its a pleasant one.</div>
