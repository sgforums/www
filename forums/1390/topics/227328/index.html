Knowing people for 2 short weeks, you cant honestly be totally frank with them to ask them to fuck off when you dont like em, or otherwise. Being nice and candid, at the same time not compromising my principles, is part of my conduct. I dont think i am being hypocritical in that aspect, for i do not know much about my mates as yet to be totally telephatic in our conversations. the same can be said of them.<br><br>There is such a thing called being principled. Putting up a personable facade, as part of portraying a good impression, is pivotal in starting a good friendship. Then what do you expect? Bemoaning to your mates about how filled with agony the first few days were? True, i was rather down in the first few days, but do i go around whinging about the lil' shortcomings of army everyday? Complaining about how you miss your civilian life? You think diplomats will tell one another to fuck off (im not specifying examples lest i get charged) in the face during congress meetings? You ignoramus.<br><br>Friendships TAKE time to develop. At the end of the day, do you want a BMT to be rifed with puerile misunderstandings, petty quarrels over the slightest of misaligned personalities, or one which people are compromising with each other, accomodating, and at the same time, celebrating differences? I prefer the latter thank you. I dont need a good peer appraisal, all i want is to be true to my feelings, enjoy the journey and everyone to POP successfully. Not getting into command school isnt the end of the world, i can contribute in ways that the commanders deem i am more effective in.<br><br>"You are doing things out of pain rather than pride". Goodness, you totally miscontrued my statement. I said i seem to be doing things of out FEAR rather than pride in your profession. You think the greatest feats in the world are done with there is a superior (eg coach) barking at athletes? Or Tiger Woods consistently being insubordinated by his coach? OR through having pride, passion in what they do? If your thinking is the former, then you are so wrong. Seek to think, if commanders were to motivate us, fill our trainings with more positive remarks, psychological encouragement, saying things like "You can do it, its all in the mind!", rather than "Lan Lan Suck Thumb", dont you think the results would be dramatically different?<br><br>Lastly, I am not blaming the army, just articulating my opinions, and perhaps suggestions on how the system can be improved. Different systems have their unique style of governance, and i respect that.<br><br>To the rest: I thank you for the advice/encouragement, I'm mentally psyched up to book in tommorrow. God bless you all, and i'll continue to chronicle my experiences here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Classicist:</div><div class="quote_body">I think you are absolutely assuming things. Knowing people for 2 short weeks, you cant honestly be totally frank with them to ask them to fuck off when you dont like em, or otherwise. Being nice and candid, at the same time not compromising my principles, is part of my conduct. I dont think i am being hypocritical in that aspect, for i do not know much about my mates as yet to be totally telephatic in our conversations. the same can be said of them.<br><br>There is such a thing called being principled. Putting up a personable facade, as part of portraying a good impression, is pivotal in starting a good friendship. Then what do you expect? Bemoaning to your mates about how filled with agony the first few days were? True, i was rather down in the first few days, but do i go around whinging about the lil' shortcomings of army everyday? Complaining about how you miss your civilian life? You think diplomats will tell one another to fuck off (im not specifying examples lest i get charged) in the face during congress meetings? You ignoramus.<br><br>Friendships TAKE time to develop. At the end of the day, do you want a BMT to be rifed with puerile misunderstandings, petty quarrels over the slightest of misaligned personalities, or one which people are compromising with each other, accomodating, and at the same time, celebrating differences? I prefer the latter thank you. I dont need a good peer appraisal, all i want is to be true to my feelings, enjoy the journey and everyone to POP successfully. Not getting into command school isnt the end of the world, i can contribute in ways that the commanders deem i am more effective in.<br><br>"You are doing things out of pain rather than pride". Goodness, you totally miscontrued my statement. I said i seem to be doing things of out FEAR rather than pride in your profession. You think the greatest feats in the world are done with there is a superior (eg coach) barking at athletes? Or Tiger Woods consistently being insubordinated by his coach? OR through having pride, passion in what they do? If your thinking is the former, then you are so wrong. Seek to think, if commanders were to motivate us, fill our trainings with more positive remarks, psychological encouragement, saying things like "You can do it, its all in the mind!", rather than "Lan Lan Suck Thumb", dont you think the results would be dramatically different?<br><br>Lastly, I am not blaming the army, just articulating my opinions, and perhaps suggestions on how the system can be improved. Different systems have their unique style of governance, and i respect that.<br><br>To the rest: I thank you for the advice/encouragement, I'm mentally psyched up to book in tommorrow. God bless you all, and i'll continue to chronicle my experiences here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>Yo NS boy! Be proud of what you are going through. Even though the small things like area cleaning may seem pointless to you, the fact that you are doing NS is to "protect" our country, our way of live, our women, etc.<br><br>I know it sounds far fetched lah, but we've all done it, are proud of ourselves, and will continue to be proud of those that keep up the "tradition" of NS.<br><br>I read your posts. I think you are just disillusioned. You have good english. Like what i said to you before, in army, english no need to be so powerful. Anyway, back to the main point. You sound educated, and idealistic. Sad to say, the army is not a place for creativity and idealists. That is why people like you feel sad. It's ok. Many have also gone through those feelings.<br><br>Just know that time will pass, and soon, you will POP! Then soon, you will be lance corporal! and so on and so forth.<br><br>Ok lah, if the training is really too tough for you. Then i suggest you find a way chao keng and get downgraded.

Unless you are medically unfit, then you should downgrade. To find means and ways to skive often is a bad reflection of one's character and moral standing. of course this sounds very idealistic, but i think we sg people should look beyond what the nation can do for you.<br><br>On a side note, SAF is making more room for creativity and so called idealist. Though change is at a glacial pace, it's something at least! Be happy we're not in armies that follow a strict line of decorum and regimentation.<br></div>

You can internalise certain positive values, and let the rest slide off you like teflon.<br><br>Believe me, idealism is something that is nice to have in the SAF, but the organisation suffers no idealist, nor contemplative souls. I learnt that the hard way. However, it didn't mean that I had to throw those things away. It's about channeling your strengths to deal with the issues you face.<br><br>Those sergeants are just in their role. Believe me.
