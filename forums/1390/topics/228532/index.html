It can be easy for you to lose your balance especially if you're carrying lots of heavy equipment. However, since you said that there are no MG/84/medics among you guys, then maybe it's not such an issue to you.<br><br>Just go slow and watch your step. My company had a lot of no-duff casualties at Mt Biang and the Seven Knolls. Dislocated shoulders, ankle sprains, broken wrists, broken leg bones... you name it.</div>

At one point we had to use our toggle ropes to hoist our full packs and signal sets up.</div>

It doesn't just apply to Mt Biang - it applies to all downhill slopes as well. So please release the branch gently and make sure that there no one behind you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Another possible danger is that the slippery ground may cause your feet to slip forward while your arms are stretched far back. This happened to my Encik while we were descending Mt Biang. As a result, he dislocated one of his shoulders from the sudden jerking motion.<br><br>I patched him up and stabilised his shoulder as best as I could. He was forced to carry his entire load on one shoulder for the rest of the way until the river crossing point, where I handed him over to the safety medics there.
