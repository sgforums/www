              <p>Hello all from Australia..<br> I'm an Australian PR with a Singaporean passport.. so i do have to serve
               NS obviously. My time is coming up soon unfortunately and i just had a 
              few questions to clear up some anxiety..</p>
              <p>1.) I've been booked to 
              go back to take my medical in early Oct 2012, which requires me to fly 
              back.. but i was wondering how long should i stay for? is 10 days 
              enough? Because i know there's other stuff i have to do like aptitude 
              test?</p>
              <p>2.) When do you reckon I would be most likely required to 
              enlist? Because i have already paid for a holiday from 28 nov to 8 dec..
               which is non-refundable (silly me i know..)  </p>
              <p>I think thats all for now.. ANY information would help a great deal because I'm booking flights etc... thank you!<br> <br> (Additional info: after my stay in singapore for my medical i am flying 
              back to Australia and will only go back to singapore when im required to
               enlist)</p>

              <p> <strong>2LT Sherman Pay, ROS Commander with 128 Squadron,
              RSAF</strong></p>
              <p>It was to be a decision many Singaporean boys who have grown up
              overseas, would have to make – whether to return home to Singapore
              and serve National Service (NS). Not necessarily an easy decision
              for any 19-year-old Singaporean; not when you’ve lived the last 11
              years of your life overseas. </p>
              <p><strong>Home Away from Home</strong></p>
              <p>For Sherman Pay, home had been in the Chinese city of Xiamen in
              Fujian province where he lived with his family. They would return
              twice a year to visit their relatives, often during Chinese New
              Year and the summer holidays. Save for his relatives, Sherman had
              hardly any friends in Singapore. Not surprising, given that he had
              spent most of his growing up years away from Singapore.</p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/IMG_2290%283%29.jpg"><img style="width: 380px; height: 318px;" src="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/IMG_2290%283%29.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="241"></a></p>
              <p><em>Sherman is ‘focused and ready’!</em></p>
              <p>His parents had made known their preference for the family to
              remain as Singaporeans. He recalled his mother signing him up for
              tours that took him around Singapore’s landmarks during his visits
              back as a child.</p>
              <p>While serving NS, Sherman lives with his uncle. However, being
              away from his immediate family does take its toll: “Sometimes I
              really miss them. I have learned to appreciate them more,
              especially  when I am feeling lonely. There would be times
              when I feel really down. But for me, my mom had brought me up to be
              independent and that really helped”.</p>
              <p>‘<strong>What-Ifs’ and ‘How-Woulds’</strong></p>
              <p>Prior to Sherman’s decision to return home to serve NS, his
              parents had concerns. Their uneasiness rubbed off on Sherman as
              well: “My mom was worried that I might get bad influence as there
              were people from all walks of life serving NS. She was also afraid
              that I couldn’t blend in and it would be hard for me to make
              friends. I was worried that I would be quite alone as I didn’t have
              friends (in Singapore) to begin with. I didn’t know how physical it
              (NS training) would get as I didn’t have my physical education
              here, so I didn’t know how (physically) fit I was compared to
              Singaporeans here. I didn’t know if I could keep up with the
              physical standards. My mum was worried about cultural differences
              because I don’t interact with Singaporeans that often. She was also
              worried I may not adapt to it.”</p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/MVI_2531.jpg"><img style="width: 410px; height: 250px;" src="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/MVI_2531.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="175"></a><br> <em>All geared up behind the ROS</em></p>
              <p>As for his father, he was worried as to whether Sherman was both
              physically and mentally strong enough to endure the training and
              demands of a soldier and if he might be bullied by his platoon
              sergeants. “I think it was because he believed Army trainings mean
              harsh treatments by the sergeants, but in reality, the trainings
              are carried out professionally with safety as a priority,” Sherman
              says with a grin. It helped that Sherman had Singaporean friends
              he’d grown up with in Xiamen who’d returned ahead of him to serve
              NS and they were able to cope well in NS.</p>
              <p><strong>Flying High In Many Ways</strong></p>
              <p>Sherman has been doing well in NS since his enlistment two years
              ago. The well-respected officer with the Republic of Singapore Air
              Force (RSAF) is addressed by his men and superiors in the 128
              Squadron as ‘2LT Sherman Pay’. He makes no qualms about aspiring to
              be an officer prior to his enlistment. “I have a few cousins who
              went to OCS (Officer Cadet School), so they told me, ‘If you can,
              try to be an officer as the experience would be more enriching.’
              Therefore that was my goal during BMT; I was very motivated.”
              Despite the initial anxieties, Sherman felt that serving NS has
              been a good and positive experience for him and it has made him
              mature from a boy to a man.</p>
              <p><br> It wasn’t just a positive attitude and hearing about success
              stories that got Sherman geared up for life in military fatigues.
              He credits his superiors who were very supportive and maintained an
              open communication channel with him during his Basic Military
              Training (BMT): “My supervisors did a good job. My OC (Officer
              Commanding) in BMT (Basic Military Training), he tried to engage us
              overseas Singaporeans, on enlistment day and told us that if we had
              any problems, if we couldn’t blend in, to look for him and he would
              help us. When we’re down, he’ll always motivate us. Although your
              family is not around, but during the time in NS, you have your
              so-called ‘brothers’, your bunkmates (and) they’ll also motivate
              you.” Yes, training will get tough, but the recruits will have to
              support each other to spur on and pull through together.</p>

              <p><em>Setting up the ROS</em></p>
              <p>These days, Sherman literally has a bird’s eye view on things
              through the videos by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which would
              be fed back to the Receive-Only Station (ROS) that he operates with
              his team. The video feed, when relayed to the ground commanders,
              provides better battlefield situational awareness and enhances
              mission effectiveness.</p>
              <p><strong>Appraisal to be Well-Adapted</strong></p>
              <p>Sherman’s immediate supervisor Major (MAJ) Sam Ong, the OC in
              charge of ROS for 128 Squadron, says that Sherman has adapted very
              well in the Squadron. He believes Sherman’s positive experience in
              BMT and how those who had returned from overseas to serve NS were
              actively engaged by their superiors, set the foundation for a
              smoother transition for the recruits. “Those things are very
              important because the initial phase is when these overseas
              Singaporeans will need to adjust to the change in environment and
              that’s when engagement must come to the forefront. When Sherman
              came to the unit, I didn’t feel that he had any problems adjusting
              to the operational requirements of 128 Squadron. That foundation
              served him well and enabled him to adapt to the operational tempo
              without any difficulties” says MAJ Ong.</p>

              <p><em>Sherman with Major Ong</em></p>
              <p>MAJ Ong regards Sherman as “a very outstanding NSF who’s not
              just able to lead when he’s required to, but he’s also a very
              capable team player. Sherman’s positive attitude and his
              willingness to take on challenges and overcome them will serve him
              well in the future”.</p>
              <p>Does MAJ Ong feel that Singaporean youths who return from
              overseas to serve NS are disadvantaged in some way? He doesn’t
              believe so as information is readily available in this age of
              connectivity and ease of access to the internet, where “you’re able
              to sift out information pertaining to NS. It’s this sense of
              wanting to find out what’s ahead that makes the difference. Perhaps
              years ago when information was limited, that would have made it
              more difficult for overseas Singaporeans to find out more about
              NS”.</p>
              <p><strong>Seeing Significance in NS</strong></p>
              <p>The most memorable event for Sherman was when he was
              commissioned as an officer. “My parents came back to attend my
              commissioning parade and they were very proud of me. After being
              commissioned as an officer, you will take up a leadership role. So,
              you’ll need to exercise a lot of your leadership skills. When you
              have to inspire people to be more capable beyond their normal
              abilities, make them go an extra mile, that’s when it feels very
              rewarding,” he says, beaming with a sense of accomplishment.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/IMG_2376.jpg"><img style="width: 450px; height: 300px;" src="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/IMG_2376.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="192"></a> <br> <em>Posing beside a UAV</em></p>
              <p>How this contrasts to his initial scepticism of how serving NS
              would help in the defence of a small nation like Singapore. That
              faded after Sherman underwent the National Education programmes
              conducted by his supervisors. It then dawned on him the crucial
              role each serviceman, himself included, played in national security
              and the defence of Singapore. MAJ Ong believes that the key to
              creating a positive NSF experience is to make sure the NSFs
              understand and internalise their role in national defence”.</p>
              <p>But it is easy to think that two years serving NS is two years
              too long. In Sherman’s perspective, “If you think of your career,
              your studies, it’s a postponement of two years. So before I
              enlisted, I was also thinking, ‘You waste two years of your life.
              People already get their degrees and you’re still studying. People
              are already working’. But after I enlisted, I realised I learnt a
              lot during NS. I learnt about leadership, having a positive
              mindset, how to overcome hardship – these kinds of things. The
              experience was enriching in many ways, and in the end I felt I’ve
              become more mature and better equipped as a person. My two years in
              NS wasn’t wasted”.</p>

              <p>When we hear of National Service (NS), it is often assumed that
              it relates to the time spent with the army or the SAF, but that’s
              not always the case. “Growing up, my father always talked about the
              SAF and his time there, so I always thought that I would be joining
              the SAF. So when I received my enlistment letter and found out that
              I was to join the SCDF, I was definitely surprised!” Such was SGT
              (Sergeant) Raphael Tan’s initial response when the enlistment
              letter indicated that he was to join the Singapore Civil Defence
              Force for two years of NS. In this <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/articles/d/ns-through-the-lens-of-an-overseas-singaporean-part-1">second issue</a> of ‘NS through the Lens of an
              Overseas Singaporean’, we met up with Raphael Tan, a Singaporean
              who lived abroad and came back home to serve NS in the SCDF.</p>
              <p>Since his birth, Raphael has had to adapt to both Western and
              Asian cultures due to his parents’ commitments in missionary work
              and overseas businesses. “I was born in Cardiff, Wales and spent a
              couple of years growing up in the UK and in Sweden before coming
              back to Singapore for pre-school. Following that, we left for
              Bangkok, Thailand in which I spent 13 years there.”</p>
              <p>When it was time to return for his NS stint and not knowing what
              to expect, a nervous Raphael went on to find out as much as he
              could about the Singapore Civil Defence Force. “Despite being a
              little worried, when I found out that they train fire-fighters, I
              was actually quite excited about it,” revealed the young sergeant.
              For those unfamiliar with the SCDF, this uniformed organisation
              belongs to the Ministry of Home Affairs and plays a critical role
              in Singapore by providing fire-fighting, rescue and emergency
              ambulance services. They also oversee the implementation of fire
              safety and civil defence shelter matters.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/photo%203%282%29.JPG"><img style="width: 620px; height: 363px;" src="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/photo%203%282%29.JPG" alt="" width="288" height="168"></a><br>  <em>SGT Raphael Tan (left) demonstrating a training
              drill with two of his trainees</em></p>
              <p>When enlistment day arrived, a sense of uncertainty could be
              felt among the new recruits, “I was quite nervous but I wasn’t the
              only one because on the first day, you see many other nervous boys
              as well.” He was quick to reassure though, saying, “The instructors
              were quite kind and understanding as they were once in our shoes as
              well, so it wasn’t too bad actually.”</p>
              <p>What helped Raphael was that his overseas experience allowed him
              the opportunity to meet different people from diverse backgrounds.
              This made interacting with others in the SCDF much easier for him,
              especially when certain situations force you out of your comfort
              zone. “We had a training stint at Outward Bound in Sabah,” recalls
              Raphael, “and did hiking treks into dense jungles. A lot of us were
              placed out of our comfort zones and because of that, you could
              really see what people were really like. It was a real eye-opening
              experience where we learnt a lot about ourselves and of each
              other.”</p>
              <p>Following his basic training phase, Raphael is now a Fire and
              Rescue Specialist trainer. “I’m in the fire-fighting branch, so I
              instruct trainees on how to fight different kinds of fire.” Fires
              like flashovers and backdrafts are just some of the many thermal
              accidents that fire-fighters encounter and have to deal with. One
              of the ways to do that efficiently is to ensure that they are
              well-versed in their drills, in which our trainer/resident expert
              and his team will give you a sneak preview of in our <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADOJUT6TwBk"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">video.</span></a></p>
              <p>Having almost completed his two-year NS stint, Raphael now looks
              forward to becoming a Physical Therapist in the field of Sports
              Sciences and will take the skills that he has learnt from the SCDF
              with him wherever he goes. He reflects, “There are many things that
              I’ve gained from the SCDF and a lot of what I’ve learnt can be used
              in most emergency situations in our daily lives. I’ll bring along
              all these knowledge with me and touch wood, if I need to draw upon
              them one day, at least I’ll be mentally well-equipped.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/photo%202%281%29.JPG"><img style="width: 620px; height: 424px;" src="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/photo%202%281%29.JPG" alt="" width="288" height="196"></a></p>
              <p>While there are some who might still feel that NS is a
              hindrance, both to their career and study plans, to Raphael, NS is
              an opportunity to continue learning new life skills in an
              environment that is unlike any other. “You’re going to go through a
              lot of new experiences so take it all in and you’ll learn a lot of
              new things. Embrace it because a lot of what you will experience
              here, you won’t get a chance to do so outside of NS. Once you
              leave, you might just miss the time you’ve spent here.”</p>

              <p>Thanks eac for further clearing it all up, will dig further until mind is at peace. <br><br>As for bikeforceful, give me a break. <br>I'm just clearing my doubts, considering I've been in Aussie for over 9 years with less communications with relatives/ friends (since I no longer have any in Singapore) about NS, and parents who knew little about the new NS syllabus, with all the changes that have been introduced recently.<br><br>A 17 years old youth has to book flights, work around accomodation, notify girlfriend of date so she can adjust her appln for varsity exchange to Singapore to suit both of our time here, set date to give a note to employers on when I'm leaving due to working shifts to support myself financially in Singapore where I'll be working on the day I leaving on a jet plane...etc.</p>
              <p>I realised that every Singaporean son goes through the NS as do I. Fair enough, but seeing as I have a little much more to organise and plan, I think my questions are reasonable enough. Think about the situation first.</p>
