            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think so all kinds of accidents can happen in the army..just look at the number of NSFs that have died...even weird deaths like due to bacteria infection, some are paralyzed for life.  Even professional players from Manchester United get injured, are our NSFs any better than those professional players?<br><br>you also mentioned guy gets injured, fracture ankle, etc. at most thru his life he just tone down his activities. unless he unluckily fall off "the gate" and hit his testicles and can't be a father anymore. that's just unfortunate.<br><br>after that you said for guys, the inevitable injury is nothing more than a fracture, ligament tear. but at least their "seeds" are safe. Isn't that contradictory?<br><br>like i said earlier, if they choose to sign on they should be professional abt their jobs. They should know very well that army isn't a risk-free injury place. If there is a station that might cause inevitable injuries then the training methods should be reviewed. I don't think the pain of being paralyzed and having to pay medical fees for life is any less worse than those who can't bear children due to the army.<br><br>Your post seem biased and very sided towards females. If they are getting higher pay without doing much work and get to rise ranks quickly, thats discrimination, even tho discrimination already exists in the army in the first place.  I always wonder how is it that according to info available on the net, females consist of only 10 per cent of the members of the SAF and yet<br>many of them have high ranks in the army. Pretty fishy to me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>K, though you do have a point, i am not trying to be biased. Not wanting to sound aggresive, I just want to say that why some of the "better" treatment they get are warranted.<br><br>I am not arguing between NSF or Regulars and they should accept certain risk because they volunteered.<br><br>This is what i meant...<br><br>e.g. Girls skip the "gate", guys clear the "gate" with SBO.<br><br>i am not the MO nor was I the G6 guy who said girls can skip the "gate", but this is my understanding....<br><br>lets say guy clears the gate with SBO PROPERLY according to prescribed methods...  he does it many times, or countless times PROPERLY. No long term harm can happen to him.<br><br>but in the case of girls, they do so the PROPER way (assuming the "guy's method), they do as much time as the guy did. Even though how proper, they will sustain injury due to the fact that their bodies are different and can handle less stress.<br><br>Even if they can handle less stress, it is not recommended to be subjected to stress as some point in their life they will need to bear children. It will be an unfortunate event if she encounter complications during the pregnancy or worse fracture her pelvis while giving birth.<br><br>I hope you see the point i am trying to put across.<br><br>In my opinion, females can actually do SOC with SBO, i just think that SAF don't want to be liable for anything.<br><br></div>
