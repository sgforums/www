            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it wasn't the fasting month during BMT for me, but I did fast while at my unit.<br><br>From what I remember they gave tons and tons of food for sahur. I think they pretty much combined breakfast and lunch for sahur. Personally, though, I find it extremely difficult to eat so much solid food at 4am in the morning. A normal breakfast would have sufficed for me.<br><br>Do try your best to fast as much as you can, for I'm sure you don't want to make up all the days that you missed. At the same time, though, if you really have to break your fast, then use your own discretion. It won't do to have you fainting under the hot sun for lack for food and water.<br><br>I personally had to forgo two days of fasting when I was starting to black out while doing strenous training out in the jungle. I'm the freakin' company medic, and surely the last thing anyone wants is for the medic to pengsan. Just be sure to make up for whatever days you've missed.<br><br>Here's a tip: during water parades, instead of drinking the water, pour it all over your head.</div>

Muslims who are fasting aren't gonna drink the water anyway. Might as well help them cool off by pouring the water on the head.<br><br>If he thinks that wasting half a liter of water is the greater evil compared to having a concussed trainee, then he really ought to get his head checked.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
