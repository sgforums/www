              <p>Polish whatever skills you have and gain more confidence. As you're posting in this forum, you're still a medic, I would have hoped that you have at least the sense of responsbility to know that, technically, you're suppose to be trained in your particular vocation, and that you should be, I won't say a professional in it but at least skilled in the basics.</p>
              <p>As much as you can try to siam, sometimes, when you're suay, there will be situation that you will be unable to siam. And that soldier's life depends on your efficiency. To save or indirectly ruining a life is in your hands.</p>

              <p>theres only 1 treatment medic and thats the ic.  i heard im
              gonna take over treatment room when the IC gonna ORD in 6mths..
              worse thing, i will be 2IC.  cos theres nobody else. 
              this is really hell.. i cant sleep.  besides that, most of the
              time during duty.. i will bo chap, cos i dont know whats going
              on.  once i was criticesed by a 24-hr med ctr medic when i
              sent a patient there at night.. they said like "u didnt even give
              the patient any form of oxygen, knowing that he has
              breathlessness?".  wah i damn tulan. i wanna punch him in the
              nose.  i know lor that i dunno how to do all these life-saving
              things.</p>

              <p>You keep complaining about not knowing all your basic life support skills and yet you refuse to do anything about it. I believe it was my medical ctr which u sent your patient to since i had a collegue complaining to me about someone sending a oxygenless SOB case to us. You were lucky the patient's condition wasn't very serious and no formal complaint was sent out, or else your wish of DB would long have been fufilled.</p>
              <p>If there is more than 1 medic around who doesnt know to give oxygen to SOB case... god save us.</p>
              <p>Why don't you volunteer to stay in everynight if possible and help handle all the E-cases that comes in? As the saying goes... practice makes perfect, even the most blur medics at my medical ctr knows what to do after a few high intensity duties.</p>

              <p>Ignore the people who tell you to suck it up or endure. It isn't worth risking permanent (or even temporary) mental health issues for NS.</p>
              <p>Speak to your superior and if that fails speak to the equivalent of the CO. Note down your problems and ask if he can help you. I know of a few people who were posted to be clerks after having spoken to the CO. One of them even tried to commit suicide.</p>

              <p>If you cock-up as much as you say you do, then you better get out before you get someone killed or seriously injured, and land in DB or worse. Some people here are telling you to "suck it up" and grow a third ball and other stuff, but if you're as half as bad as you claim to be you shouldn't even have been permitted to be a medic. For one thing, I would definately not want to be treated by you, and neither would anyone else here - even those who are telling you to practice more. (Would they say the same if you were to "practice" on <em>them</em> or their loved ones...?)</p>

              <p>squier,i understand how u feel.i too feel the same.the tremendous weight of my responsibilities scares me.when i first passed out of my course(po35),i felt tat i was ready for my responsibilities as i did quite well in my course but a simple test by my MO destroyed tat illusion of mine.he gave me a case which i managed to handle but in my heart,i knew tat were the simulation of the case given to me real,the person could have died.i ended up crying in the toilet after that incident.the MO told me tat i did well but i knew tat i cocked up.after tat incident,i have never taken my responsibilities for granted.i am in fear of my armband and i said as much to my MO.instead of moping ard,i instead took it upon myself to learn as much as possible to ensure something like tat doesnt happen in real life.although i have been acknowledged as the best when it comes to medical theory by my MO,i have never acknowledged myself to be the best.my advice to u is to instead of fearing it,face it instead(the fear).go up against ur fear head-on and defeat it for it is wat i am now doing.the fear is still there for me,but i am not gonna allow it to defeat me and so should u.</p>
              <p>ps.being a rifleman is noot as easy as u think!many now feel depressed of their vocation as it taxes even the fittest of individuals.</p>
