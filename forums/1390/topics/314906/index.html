              <p>Hi all!</p>
              <p>By enlisting in the later half of the year, am i right to say that u guys are poly grads? If i'm not wrong, there should be a window whereby pre-enlistees need to submit their NAPFA results by a certain date. Your Napfa is conducted by school right? Then they should have sent the results for you. Its only when you miss the test or didnt get minimum Silver that you need to book another Napfa test conducted by SAF. Let's say you got bronze for poly napfa test but managed to get silver for the SAF-conducted one, then you need to send the result to mindef to qualify you for enhanced batch. But there's still a cut-off date for submission, otherwise like del_co said, ppl who already got their enlistment date into PTP can last minute submit an improved napfa test result and cause administrative havoc over at CMPB.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For del_co just wait a while, the letter should arrive soon, its not because you didnt take napfa, cos by their cut off date, if you have no results submitted to CMPB, you straight away PTP liao. Just prepare yourself, at least you guys' mindset of training up is correct. Mental training is more important because towards the end of BMT, your body is almost wrecked because its constantly worked without sufficient rest. So even if your mind feel fresh, your body is not. This affects your ippt in BMT. I failed my ippt in bmt, even the retest, but on the first day i got posted to my unit, i took my ippt and managed to pass the stations that i fail in bmt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For Chris1988, no offence, but i personally feel that chances of bringing forward the enlistment date are quite slim. The administrative and logistic work required should be immense for a major exercise like enlistment, such that everything can be prepared months before an intake. Not only tekong side, you also have to remember there are loads more enlistees enlisting into mainland units. </p>
