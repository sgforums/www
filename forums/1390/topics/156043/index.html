            <div class='col-md body'>They don't really look much at the education level though you must be able to have a certain level of understanding and command of the english language. As long as you acn understand and speak it's ok le. What education level you are is just used to pre-judge what kind of language capabilities and maybe your level of critical thinking skills you possess....<br>But then again, they aren't just are brawn and no brains. They are one of the most efficient troops we have in the SAF.<br><br>Deciding to go for the selection is just step 1. Do train yourself to a certain level of physical fitness before you turn up for the selection, you don't need to be very fit to pass the selection because phyical fitness can be trained up. They are looking for qualities other than fitness too. Things like, mental strength, psycho-motor skills, are you a team player and many more...<br>But having good physical fitness will put you in good stead during the selection. Oh, you need to be proficient in swimming as well <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good Luck!</div>
