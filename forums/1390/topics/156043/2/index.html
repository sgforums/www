Heard from him tat there isnt any quota for the selection. During his selection last yr, 8 out of 80 trainees were selected. But for the sebsequent selection, only 1 guardsman pulled thru. Anyway, I can be sure tat so long as u make it through the selection and the 1-yr long training, U will be an SOF member.  As for the academic requirements, I can only say tat they accept pple from diverse academic backgrounds.</div>

Tats all i can tell u cos the exact things u will do during the selection are classified, I think. Actually my advice for u now is to continue to improve on ur physical fitness, do well during ur bmt be it in tekong or wif the cdos. I've seen many guys being so keen abt signing on or becoming part of the elite units b4 enlistment and during bmt, perception of SAF just changed completely. There's a role for everyone to play in the SAF, doesnt mean u have to become a commando to contribute. If u dun get into cdo, just continue to have tat "positive" mentality and I'm sure u will do well else where.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tot Special Splint asked about SOF??<br><br>Imagine IF you are one of the SOF trainers, what would you be looking for in a potential SOF trainee?<br><br>I make up a list here for discussion.<br><br>Physical fitness? Yes, but no need to be like Rambo or Arnie or some body builder type. I think triathletes will do nicely. Triathletes are well balanced i think.<br><br>Intelligence? Yes, above average intelligence can already. No need very high education. Flexible thinking, or the uni call lateral thinking, or i like to call street smart.<br><br>Attitude and Aptitude? Proactive (overkilled word?). Mature in thinking. Excellent problem solving skills. Optimists. Never-say-die (another overkilled word?), or some of you call WILL POWER. And of course team player.<br><br>Others? Maybe a PSYCHO TEST also? Make sure you not PSYCHO? (Kekeke...too late?! No la. Just kidding.) But then maybe you HAVE to be a little psycho to join?<br><br>MENTAL STRENGTH!  To <strong>IGNORE</strong> that <strong>GDBH</strong> (God Damn Bloody Hell) little <strong>BELL!!!</strong> To <strong>NOT</strong> see it even when it's right in your face!!! Tell yourself <strong>"IT'S NOT THERE! IT'S NOT THERE!"</strong> Or maybe you should wake up and RING MY BELL .... RING MY BELL! (Remember that song? That goes on and on and on and on ....... just like the endless marches ....... on and on and on .........) <strong>NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF THE BELL.</strong><br><br>Eh?! Think im going PSYCHO myself just writing it!!<br><br>Oh, and don't be afraid of heights.<br><br>Anything else to add? Feel free to add to the list. Maybe we can submit to SAF for consideration?<br><br>Btw, i believe SOF is open to all services. Need people with different skills right? Cannot everyone come from Commando right? Anyway you can't be SOF forever .......... or can you? Kekekeke...........<br><br>But what do i know? Just a little ORCA in a BIG BIG OCEAN! Hope the SOF guys out there don't mount any BLACK OPS against me!<br><br><strong>YOU ARE ALL VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE.</strong><br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">ORCA<br>DE OPPRESSO LIBER<br><br>I WILL ALWAYS PLACE THE MISSION FIRST<br>I WILL NEVER ACCEPT DEFEAT.<br>I WILL NEVER QUIT.<br>I WILL NEVER LEAVE A FALLEN COMRADE.</span></strong></div>
