            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Guys,<br><br>My dad just opened a new army store in Bukit Timah Plaza about 2 months ago and I'm thinking of bringing his business online for him. His army store sells mainly army items from SAF and gifts and souvenirs and also camping equipment.<br><br>I just need some advice here. Would there be good response if he brought his business online? We were thinking of cash on delivery and still working on market response. Please help.<br><br>Thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bringing your dad's shop online is a gd idea. However what are the products that u wish ppl to buy online ? Most of the stuff i usually get is 1 or 2 rolls of blacktape, several arc of fire sticks, L torch, equipment for standby like mini toothbrush,toothpaste,soap,shaving kit, sewing kit etc.....<br><br>Then how are u going todeliver it to their house ? Delivery or postage ? it ain't cheap right ? If things are going by the weight .<br><br>1 area u might run into is the type of consumer.Half or just slightly more (not too sure of how many stay-in combat vocations NSFs are there as we will prob. never know).<br><br>1) Being active unit NSFs, most of them don't have the option of going home daily.<br>2) NSFs don't have a stable income, its just an allowance.If u were to implement an online shopping chart, what are your means of accepting money ? PayPal ? BPay ? Most of such services require you to have a creditcard, which NSFs don't usually have unless they use their parents card for such transactions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, thanks alot for replying.<br><br>I've been talking alot to my dad about this and what we plan to do is to accept cash on delivery. That is, on our website there will be a form whereby you inform us which are the products you want. we will then delivery it to you not by postage but personal delivery itself (saves alot of money too). As for the kind of products, the products you've mentioned we have them in store and we're gonna bring them online too. We have other stuff like admin tee, duffel bag etc. most of it you can find them in the e-Marts. My dad owns 18 e-marts in 18 different army camps so i guess, product wise, it shouldn't really pose much of a problem. Furthermore, we will be selling other stuff like camping equipment, dog tags, SAF souvenir items etc.<br><br>The only thing we are worried about is the targetted consumer group. We are aware of the possible low responses of NSFs and thus we are not only planning to target the army guys but also NCC cadets and other school activites. What other consumer groups are there?<br><br>These are only part of the plan. We are not really sure yet and still testing market reponse. Thanks for your contributions guys. Helps alot.</div>

But dont worry, your feedback is much valued. We'll try to improve on them as much as we can.<br><br>Bank transfer is a good idea. Maybe we could ask for customers for their preferred payment method and whichever is more convenient for them. Think that is a good idea? Prices will be reasonable. That, no worries.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If we keep giving discounts we will be losing big time. Products in the e-Mart are supplied by the same supplier as BTP. Frankly speaking, the credit system is to facilitate better convenience for army guys. And army shops outside are for army guys who find it a hassle to go into camp just to purchase an army product and of course for the convenice of other people. Therefore, if you have enough credits to afford a GP shoe, I suggest you get it using credits. If you think about it, there really is no difference.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Yes, my dad operates the e-Marts but it's all two different business. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is important.</span></strong><br><br>We dont sell explosives or flare guns in the shop. That I'm sorry. I believe even the e-Marts dont sell them? But we do have army knives. More variety than the ones they sell in the e-Marts - more functions and even accompanied with LED light. We sell things army guys need in camp. That is most of the things you can find in the e-Marts we have it in the shop. There are other things as well, like water bags, compasses etc. Maybe you guys could go down to the shop to have a look. It's located at BTP B1 level. Or if you have anything you need to get in mind, maybe you could ask for it here and we'll help you check if we have it.<br><br>My dad is ST's contractor. He doesnt control the unit or credit system. And Gortex boots for half price? That's a little too much of a discount huh? We have running shoes selling at $39.39 I believe. It's standard price in all the e-Marts.<br><br>The e-Store would be selling similar things as well. [/b]</blockquote>do your shop have any rules for buyers eg, muz be 18 and over?<br><br>if there's no rules that means a gangster can come in and buy some knives to go on a killing spree??</div>

I spend them all on countless pairs of black socks, 1 pair of new balance, 1 pair of mizuno, plenty of toilet rolls and powder.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well sounds like a feasible idea man ..Since u mentioned that your dad is ST's contractor. the consumer demograph can be rather different. U can also reach out to all the reservist ppl out there who needs to buy new socks,powder, uniforms (especially pants hehe), ranks. fieldpacks, rifle cleaning kit stuff, admin attire for their annual ICTs.<br><br>I recalled 7-11 did try to do a tie u with ST where the ppl actually fill out a form at the outlet and the 7-11 guys will contact ST to bring in the stuff as specified by the person. Don't noe how well the respone was..</div>
