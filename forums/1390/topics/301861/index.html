But COM doesn't seem to count for much these days leh.  I look at the job ads, all want minimum 3 years working experience.  Those that don't need experience are like Help Desk and support.  Can't get to work on projects or anything without at least 3 years exp.<br><br>Will be apply to uni first though.  Due to lack of finance, I figured' I'd continue my Uni only if i can get full scholarship for it.  But chances are low since I actually want to move out of IT, and into Political Science.<br><br></div>
