              <p>Those who are liable to serve national service but refuse are
              charged under the Enlistment Act. If convicted, they face three
              years' imprisonment and a fine of S$10,000.</p>
              <p>Controversy arose when the penalties were increased in January
              2006 after <a title="Melvyn Tan" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvyn_Tan">Melvyn
              Tan</a>, who was born in Singapore, received a fine for defaulting
              on his National Service obligations. Tan left for <a title="London" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London">London</a> to study music during his enlistment age and
              later acquired British nationality. In <a title="Parliament of Singapore" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore">parliament</a>, Defence Minister <a title="Teo Chee Hean" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teo_Chee_Hean">Teo Chee Hean</a> provided some illustration of the
              punishments defaulters would face:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the default period exceeds two years but the defaulter is
              young enough to serve his full-time and operationally ready NS
              duties in full, MINDEF will press for a short jail sentence.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot serve his
              full-time NS in a combat vocation or fulfil his operationally ready
              NS obligations in full, a longer jail sentence to reflect the
              period of NS he has evaded may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot be called
              up for NS at all, a jail sentence up to the maximum of three years
              may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Each year, a small number of people are convicted for their
              failure to enlist or refusal to be conscripted. Most of them were
              <a title="Jehovah's Witnesses" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, who are usually
              court-martialled and sentenced to three years' imprisonment, but
              they are usually held in a low-security detention facility and
              separated from other conscription offenders. The government does
              not consider <a title="Conscientious objector" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector">conscientious objection</a> to be a legal
              reason for refusal to serve NS.</p>

              <p>this is a reply in sgforums in the year 2006:</p>
              <p>If you are in SG and didn't show up for reservist, sure
                                          DB.<br> <br> But being overses with a valid visa is a good 
                  first step for
                                          leniency. You will not escape being charged, 
                  just try to avoid
                                          DB.<br> <br> You have to first plead guilty, but must prepare
                   some kind of
                                          document to prove you are employed during the 
                  time that you were
                                          called up. And then say that your family members
                   can't understand
                                          English, didn't open your mail or something...<br> <br> I don't know your situation, but does this help?<br> <br> I was charged for AWOL and fined when I first 
                  left the country to
                                          work overseas 10 years ago.<br> <br> When I reported back to MINDEF to face charges, 
                  there was at first
                                          an interview. The officer was firm but very 
                  polite and I was given
                                          a chance to explain the reasons:<br> <br> ...when I first left the country, my battalion 
                  HQ clerk told me no
                                          need to apply for Exit permit from MINDEF, just 
                  write a letter to
                                          the Bn S1 or something, which I was dumb enough 
                  to believe
                                          him.<br> <br> I also handed over my documents proving my 
                  employment status
                                          overseas.<br> <br> After that, they had a conference amongst 
                  themselves.<br> <br> Later, I was loudly marched in and formally 
                  charged and fined
                                          SGD400 after pleading guilty to AWOL and not 
                  contesting the charge.
                                          If you contest the charge and the punishment 
                  (fine), you can go for
                                          higher court martial. If you lose that one, MP 
                  will "love you long
                                          time" in DB. <img title="Mr. Green" src="http://lahcc.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green"><br> <br> I believe there are many reasons I was not 
                  thrown into DB:<br> <br> * Firstly, I made contact with my unit and 
                  MINDEF <strong>while
                                          still overseas</strong> to explain that I 
                  screwed up by not
                                          applying for Exit Permit etc.<br> <br> * They gave me a date to report for charges and I
                   showed up on time
                                          - very important.<br> <br> * I had the necessary documents to prove my 
                  story and they believed
                                          it.<br> <br> * My passport stamps proved I was away all the 
                  while even before
                                          they sent out the ICT call-up letter.<br> <br> * Excellent service record throughout also 
                  helped. If you had ever
                                          been in trouble with army law, then bad news for
                   you.<br> <br> Oh, when you report, dress smartly in No 4, kiwi
                   your boots and
                                          remember to address NCO's by their rank and 
                  officers as
                                          "sir".<br> <br> Good Luck <img title="Mr. Green" src="http://lahcc.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green"></p>

              <p>Assuming TS had a brand new passport when he ORD. But even that, he cannot travelled around for 10 years, that's the old passport. 9 1/2 years most of the countries will reject your entry liao. </p>

              <p>It is a very strange post. you just need to give an overseas notification, that you have been to overseas,you will settle about the reservist part. they will not call you for reservist. My friend have been overseas and they have not called him back since.</p>
              <p>In any case, you can just claim that you have already given the notification it is the SAF who failed to take noted of that. Beside you have no seen the SAF100 because you have not seen it. You will not charged for being misinformed.</p>
              <p>Beside, when I am overseas, I would not expect SAF to provide me a two-way ticket to return Singapore.  </p>
