I'm in the PTP batch (PES A/B1) and it's only the first week that my buddy is gonna leave our company to the obese batch due to his BMI exceeding. I wanna know whether there's a chance I will get another buddy after transitioning from PTP to BMT and if y'all can share your experience here! I'm kinda worried now.. Thanks :)</span></p></div>

              <p>Because NS life is different from civilian life before
                      enlistment, there are many adjustments you need to make.</p>
              <p>A good way to cope is to get support from your buddy and fellow
                      recruits. They are going through the same tough training as you, so
                      talking to one another will help relieve some tension.</p>
              <p>In most evenings during your leisure time, you’ll also have some
                      time to call your family or loved ones to talk. They can give you
                      emotional support during NS.</p>
              <p>You can have a one-on-one interview sessions with your officer
                      to highlight any problems you may have. If you have a personal or
                      family problem that need to be addressed, do let the officer
                      know—he may be able to give you some advice or time off to settle
                      your problems.</p>

              <p>You will also have access to Orientation Officers who may be
                      able to help you if the need arises.</p>

My apologies for posting my concern here as it is hard to find an open topic that is related to my case. I hope someone can give me some advice :)<br><br>I'm a 18 years old Singapore PR studying in a local secondary school. Basically, I'm 3 years older than my cohort mates and obviously I'm currently on deferment. I'm not sure if they would give me deferment for JC/Poly so I'm starting to think of going NS first before going to Poly. What are some of the downsides from that path? I heard something about not being able to promote and what not? I'm a bit lost in that part and I hope someone here can give me some advice :D</p></div>
