              <p>Either seek out a psychiatrist on your own or go see the MO and they will likely sent you to 1. All medical records are confidential so they won't be shared with others.</p>
              <p>Depression is not something to play around with and serious case of depression will cause the sufferer to have sucidal tendencies etc which endangers your life</p>

              <p>Don't worry about that. If you are really having depression, its more important to get it diagnose and medication/therapy be applied. Depression requires proper diagostics and not something you say you have means you have it. If it has been medically diagnosed with depression, noone can say you are kenging.</p>
              <p>The longer you drag the issue, the more severe your problem might be and the harder it would be to cure it.</p>
              <p>Just pluck up some courage and take the 1st step to get your problem diagnosed by a psychiatrist. With treatment, conditions might improve, you will feel less stress and alot of problems you current might be facing might be less of an issue later on. Depression will cloud your judgement.</p>
              <p>How to help yourself</p>
              <p>1) Get yourself diagnosed and accept the result of the diagnosis.</p>
              <p>2) Set small realistic goals for yourself to get back to your usual routine</p>
              <p>3) Take some time out whenever you can to do something you enjoy to let yourself relax</p>
              <p>4) Hold off big decision making for now since your outlook of things are not clear</p>
              <p>5) Avoid alcohol as it could lead to abuse of it and interact with medications when you are on them</p>
              <p>6) Some exercise will help fight mild-moderate depression</p>
              <p>7) Share and talk about things that bothers you, keeping them bottled up will make you feel worse</p>
              <p>8) Maintain good physical health as that is linked to your mental wellbeing</p>
              <p>9) Don't despair or giveup. There are many people who suffered depression and got over it before so you can also get over it.</p>

              <p>Suicides in NS are rare but still occur every now and then.</p>
              <p>While i was in service, 1 of my guards told me someone in camp had commited suicide and he was 1 of those who had to rush him to hospital. 1 former visitor to this forum also mentioned that he almost suicided and base on the things i've learnt, i would say that case was not just someone who saying they will suicide just for fun and not do it. There was enough proof to suggest that it really could have happen.</p>

              <p>You are just confused and letting your mind run wild.</p>
              <p>Don't be so worried about what will happen in the future. Its more important for you to focus on the present and take small steps at a time. Taking too big steps and looking too far into the future will do you more harm than good at the moment.</p>

              <p>Problems of loved ones often become 'transfer' to ownself. You are not alone in this.</p>
              <p>You are assuming people would laugh at you. Have you ever tried in the 1st place? Find your close friends and they will often be more willing to listen and help you. Don't make negative assumptions before you even try. By assuming, you are giving yourself even more unnneccessary stresses.</p>
              <p>Just like the earlier posts, you assume your unit people will insult you, saying you keng, your superiors will laugh or disbelieve you etc etc. You only just posted to a new unit as you said, how well do you know the people around you to judge them this way? Is it fair to them and yourself to judge people so early without giving everyone and yourself a chance?</p>
