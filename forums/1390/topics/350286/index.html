              <p>Have the same thought too previously. Adopt the wait and see. The point you have never been to SAF you never knew what is it like. So can sign after you almost want to leave the SAF they would pay you back the salary.</p>
              <p>But I can tell you that most of my friends who sign on is not smiling now. Some are even leaving soon.</p>

              <p>The general comments in all such topics are the same which is wait and see for those who haven't done NS yet but seems like you are already in the midst of it. Being in NS and you still feel you wanna work for such an organisation?</p>
              <p>What i heard is work in the civil service is not considered work experience at all, not just restricted to MINDEF since a friend just told me his friend who worked in MOM went to find job and she could not use her years in MOM as job experience for job application. Wierd logic but thats how things seems to be.</p>

              <p>Wow thanks for the links. It's weird, i typed sign on before, yet i didn't find those topics!</p>
              <p>To dkcx, yes, i felt the same way but i thought it all depends on your vocation, like if you were a sai gang rp who just did guard duty for 2 years, sure it won't add value to your civilian life. But perhaps, if i became a guards officer or something, surely that wouldn't be such a waste would it?</p>
              <p><br>But then being in the Army itself takes you out of society. Perhaps police force might be better? But i think they dont have a short term contract..</p>
              <p>Oh then that really sucks if you don't get tax-free income, i figured that was a big perk of being in the service; it is in oz, uk and perhaps usa.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are there any vocations in the SAF that will add value to your later civilian life?</p>
              <p>Thanks</p>

              <p>For some reason u can practice what you know in the civil service but its still not recognised. The person i mentioned was an accountant in MOM but when she went out to find work, her years in MOM was not considered as working experience as an accountant so i would say your vocation would not affect it as all would be considered none.</p>
              <p>There might be skills u learn in SAF that improves your knowledge, your skills, your leadership etc which u can apply to your later work but will not be directly acknowledge by the private sector.</p>
              <p>I have no knowledge about SPF so you might like to ask the others or go to the SPF forums and ask.</p>

              <p>Lokey, why are your friends leaving the army even though they signed on?</p>

              <p>Boring, no prospect, no job satisfication, no appreciation. Unlike job outside,you are praised and award for every things that you do. in the SAF, a single mistake would cause your future. Sandwich between top and bottom. Hard work. SAF is  a "demerit" system. one is supposed to do the right thing and get punish for not doing it right. Routine. Politics. Slow moving. So far really none of my friends like their job. Quite surprise, my colonel officer/friend is ORDing, even for a &gt;50 % paycut?</p>
              <p>To balance - ve comments: SAF, especially navy allow you do go overseas very often. "Real' working hours is little compare to outside, Can excerise and run in the day, and encourage to do so. Can join SAFSA and whole week training, having fun while appreciated by OC/CO. Can bully people, torture the low rank, show your saddism side, fun with human interaction. got $$. enjoy good catering.</p>
              <p>if you are worry about after you ORD, there is a still plenty of places for you to go. You might do a job switch or other stuff. Nobody holds a perm career path for life now.</p>
              <p>suggest go to the SAF and see if you like that kind of life first before signing.</p>
              <p>3 of my big family members are army regular. one ORD, one long long service award, one just joined.</p>
