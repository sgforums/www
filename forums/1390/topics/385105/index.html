              <p>Hi there</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've recently been posted to a new unit as a platoon medic fresh from the new medic course. I can't say the job is tough neither is it very chiong sua cause cbt medics in my unit generally stay at the medical centre unless there are out field etc. Basically we're still platoon medic that chiong sua but do not stay with the platoon. Both service medic and combat medic in my unit is stay in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thing is, i only have like a year left before i ORD cause i OOC'ed from OCS before, thus the late posting to a unit. Like for the whole year, i've never had a proper unit that i belonged to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyways, i was hoping you guys could give me some input regarding my problem. Basically i OOC'ed from OCS because i was having depression and anxiety problem. During my short stay as an OCT, i really couldn't take the environment and stress and it made me become an insomniac as well as to be very edgy as a person which i normally am not. In the day, my heartbeat would be racing even though im not exercising etc. I can feel that something is not right with my mental health but i did not pursue the matter as in the end i OOC'ed due to my physical problem with my lower limb plus my friend said that if i OOC'ed due to mental health, i may jeopardize my future. Thing is, i didn't consult anyone regarding that anxiety problem cause when i ooc'ed and got posted as a temporary staff somewhere else, the anxiety problem went away.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe some readers may find that i'm tyring to chao keng but i guess its up to u to decide. I did go through BMT and i did go through the medic course like how a normal NSF would do it without problems. But i just didn't understand that state of mind that i had during my stay in OCS and the current one i'm having.</p>
              <p>When i got posted to my new unit as the combat medic, my anxiety problem arose again and im having trouble sleeping. i'm losing my appetite and all i keep thinkin about is to get out cause something shit is gonna happen. My heartbeat is racing all day and there is nothing i can do to calm it down. Every now and then i'll look at the clock and basically do all kinds of things to keep myself occupied but i'll still end up feeling this doom coming over me or somthin. its a weird feeling that i can't explain other than that i feel overly anxious like i'm gonna die or something (i dont mean to sound exxagerating but at times i do feel this way. Espeically before i sleep). I did call the SAF counselling hotline and all they said was to talk to the MO and see where it goes from there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thing is, i still want to be a combat medic. But something about my unit is driving me nuts and all i wanna do is just to get out. Is there anyway i can like request to get posted out to another camp? or even revocationed if i have to cause right now all i can think about is just to get out of the camp. I've spoken to some of my friends and they did say i may be suffering from anxiety problem which is supposedly down-pes-able but thats not what i want. All i want is to be posted out somewhere else. I've gone through normal BMT and the Medic course as well as taking a temporary staff job at ocs without problems but why now again? the feeling is just really driving me down. As embarassing as this may sound, sometimes i'm really at my wits end and i end up tearing while tryin to sleep.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so yeah, if you guys have experience or inputs regarding what i should do, please do leave a comment. I'd really appreciate it.</p>

              <p>Hi Shaun g101,</p>
              <p>As the counsellor from the counselling hotline has suggested, the first step is for you to seek help from your camp's MO. Only after he has judged that your situation is serious enough, then will he direct you to a SAF psychiatrist. </p>
              <p>If you are to keep everything to yourself, your situation may worsen and you may start to have suicidal thoughts. </p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the reply guys.</p>
              <p>I decided to seek help from a private shrink first to actually find out whats really up with me and according to him, i have a General Anxiety Disorder plus mild depression. I'll most likely see the MO tomorrow first thing in the morning and find out more what can be done. From the doctor's memo, he requested that that i be referred to the SAF Physciatrist. Hopefully i can just get posted out without any records but i'll see how it goes. Though i must say that the Shrink's meds do help to calm me down but i still cant bear to stay in my camp for the next one year</p>
              <p> </p>
