              <p>my cst last time consists of a 2 weeks training at hendon camp which includes some nights out and weekend bookouts. the killing of fowls, frogs, iguanas and such were done during this period. we were taught how to cook bamboo rice too which was actually useful for the 2nd half of the course. btw the killing of animals was a 'voluntary' action. if nobody volunteers, the arrows will come.</p>
              <p>the 2nd half of the course was a 1 week (iirc) outfield at tekong. we were driven to a beach with beautiful fine sand, lots of coconut trees, olive trees and a little stream running through the jungle behind the beach. we spent about 2, 3 days building A-frame tentages with branches and leaves, plucking coconuts and olives and cooking bamboo rice. the ration given during these 3 days was a pack of combat ration per day to be shared among 2 teams and some uncooked rice (iirc).</p>
              <p>after these 3 days, we were told to packed up and topo to another spot on the island. the topo was supposed to be on a team basis but some teams ended up walking together eventually.</p>
              <p>after that all of us were settled in a training shed for the night. we were told there will be a simulated attack on us later on which came at around 4am. that was the start of the pow phase of the course. the attack consists of thunderflash and firing of blanks by the instructors. nothing new. after that all of us were told to wear our long 4 inside out and a number was written on each of our shirt. we were also blind folded and hand cuffed. we were then led to walk in a single file  to some unknown location. once arrived, we were interrogated one by one using soft and hard tactics. some of us were tekanned with labourous tasks. we were also led one by one to a tank where we were dunked repeatedly into the water. the next one to be dunked was led to the front of the tank to hear the 'torture' of the guy in front.</p>
              <p>eventually the exercise was cut halfway as news from the hospital arrived which said one of the trainee has died due to the dunking. several others were sent to hospital as well. by the time my blindfold was removed, i was already blindfolded and handcuffed for 14hours or so.</p>
              <p>the escape and evasion phase (chasing by dogs) was not done as all of us were sent back to hendon that same evening.</p>
              <p>hope that helps.</p>
