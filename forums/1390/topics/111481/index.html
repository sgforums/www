Do they pay me for RT?<br></blockquote>why not go to the miw website to check it out. think its miw.gov.sg<br><br>anyway from best i know, you may need to have letter of explanation why you cannot go for 3 months of RT, like injury, business trip, etc.<br><br>think after you ORD, you need to do IPPT until you ROD or you reach age of 45 yrs old.<br><br>If you disrupt, by right you still have to go for IPPT and RT as it is a compulsory annual thing no matter what, but funny is some units seems to have forgotten you all and you never receive any letter. But starting from when IPPT is individualised, it becomes your own responsibility liao, so if you kenna that you never go and got caught, too bad, kenna fine.<br><br>No matter how many millions of dollars you still have to go for IPPT and RT. Unless you got excuse. Million of $$ only help for you not to go back ICT i think.<br><br>They dont pay you for RT, but if you pass, then get money for IPPT.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I smell a Tuang King ~lol~ Too bad. RT is quite watertight nowadays, &amp; it's a proactive format too. No more panchan like before.<br><br><blockquote>If I do not have time to go for 3 months of RT.... how do I explained to the unit?</blockquote>Every RT session is compulsory, unless you have a valid excuse. Like NS &amp; reservist, it's covered under the Enlistment Act &amp; your employer must release you. There's some leeway with missed sessions (must promptly do make-up) but, upon exceeding a certain number, it's a AWOL charge &amp; you'll be called back by the unit to explain yourself. Someone mentioned a $50 fine too but, whatever punishment, a new RT slot will be reccheduled for you.<br><br><blockquote>How long must I continue to take IPPT after I ORD?</blockquote>Until 45 years old for all PES A, B &amp; C1 personnel. Those under 40 (up to Cat Z) must take the full IPPT. Those between 41-44 (Cat Z1) will take 3 test stations: chin-ups, sit-ups &amp; 2.4. Everyone over 35 must do their FFI prior, though.<br><br>There's a lobang for "early retirement", since IPPT liability ends for all those who're posted to the MINDEF Reserve list. That's also the destination of all operational-ready units upon completion of their reservist cycle, so if you're part of a nominal roll &amp; have faithfully answered every ICT callup, you shall no longer kena IPPT after turning 34-35.<br><br><blockquote>If I disrupt, do I have to come back for RT and IPPT?</blockquote>Disrupt or defer? You can disrupt NS, which means you'll be postied to a Holding List (&amp; be exempted from IPPT).<br><br>If you defer successfully for whatever reason, you'll be reassigned a new RT slot after your deferment ends.<br><br>A submitted MC is considered a deferment application. Your unit will book the next available RT slot (of your choice) &amp; your RT window extended accordingly. But this particular RT cannot be canceled; you can make changes but take note that, being a postponed RT carried forward, it may shorten your new IPPT window.<br><br>Re-applying of deferment again is allowed, though. Otherwise, the format can be Catch-22: Must book for RT again if can't pass the IPPT by the next birthday, yet can't take IPPT in new IPPT window until finishing RT.<br><br>Best advice: Either stay fit, or treat the RTs as regular exercising regimens (but big hassle if you stay far away &amp; don't drive). Otherwise, get downgraded or be based overseas. Don't mess with non-attendance; your boss may end up firing you.<br><br><blockquote>If I earn alot of money, can I be excused RT? Do they pay me for RT?</blockquote>I believe it's half-day service pay for each session, remitted on a weekly basis.</div>

Walk three rounds or run two ... guess which most chose  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>Regardless how fast you run, you sill have to wait for all to complete. most "RT'ers" not interested in improving their stamina.

            <div class='col-md body'>I did my reservist at Khatib so we used to sit in the canteen &amp; watch the RT participants a lot. The PTI's there initiated a lot of training methods throughout the '90s - from "OTOT" running around the track, to "touch-tree" type sprinting drills all over the soccer field, to slow group jogs around the camp.<br><br>Then, towards decade's end, they started bringing in these exercise stations (including treadmills) to the auditorium which allowed, I guess, for more specialized/individual training.<br><br>Don't worry about BMT-style tekanning or old-school RT (with log PT or medicine balls or sandbagged fullpacks) cuz there's none. In fact, the general mood can be festive till sunset, since plenty of camp people also exercise or play football at the stadium between 4pm &amp; 7pm plus.<br><br>But the RT morale does noticably slacken after 8pm though, when everyone's exercised (moderately) for 2+ hours but no one could book out until way, way past 9 o'clock.<br><br>So, from what I saw, the RT training wasn't intensively super-siong as it was more mundanely dragged out over a 4-hour schedule for each session. Like I said: best see things positively &amp; treat them as normal exercising regimens, lah. But if you don't drive, then it can be a long nightly wait for bus 171 along Sembawang Road just to go to Yishun for the MRT. There's also a back gate to/from the nearer Khatib station, except it's only open during certain hours &amp; in any case the RT guys could no longer book in from there.<br><br>The camp would be obviously deserted on weekends but I understand that the Saturday afternoon RT sessions aren't that demoralizing. Sunday morning RT sessions, however, were said to be hugely depressing ~lol~</div>

It really helps.<br><br>Technique<br><br>Right before jump: a few "on the spot jumping" to loosen joints /muscles / warm up.<br><br>Excuting the jump: Use momentum to push yourself forward. Spring forward, tuck your kneels all the way in and lean body forward. Always remember to  look straight and not downwards.<br><br>This technique works for me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> good luck.</div>

No time is a lame excuse.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  I have seem folks doing their running at 11pm or even 1pm(under the hot sun).<br><br>It is all in the mind. If you treasure your job, do not blame the SAF or government. If majority of people can pass their IPPT. How come not you!!!! RT affects your work and time, if a bit sacrifice here and there can save alot of hassles later, gain a healthy body, why not spent more time on exercise.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
