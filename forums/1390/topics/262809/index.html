            <div class='col-md body'>Never got downgraded ~lol~ I did try for it during reservist (hypertension), but such cases seldom reach beyond the unit MO level. Everyone knew the main purpose is to siam IPPTs so, as long as it's credible on paper, you'll be excused accordingly. Near the end of my cycle, about a third of my unit personnel used to sit on the stadium benches "cheering on" during the fitness testings. Quite farcical, even though we're one of the top outfits in FATEP (field-exercise) scoring.<br><br>I don't think I was even sick, but just happened to be hyperstressed from work that day. Just manipulated the system, lah. Asked for medical board, was told to get treated outside &amp; submit the reports, then acted blur -- "what report?" -- when called back for medical review. Each time, it'd be a new (&amp; usually friendly) MO who only has the notes inside my docket for appraisal. Attend B/excuse IPPT-type chit issued, with verbal instructions on what to bring back for the next FFI. Repeat ad nauseum. Sometimes my unit didn't get the docket back for an ICT, so my regular MO would pass the buck again. Lo &amp; behold, there'd be a surge of such "hardship" cases in time as my unit itself got older (&amp; the training schedule got tighter &amp; tighter, so much so the MO has to finish dealing with the reporting sick out in the field).<br><br>Dunno about active time, which was also quite a long time back in my case. Each unit, or rather medical center, has its own institutional culture. My own understanding is that, as much as possible, that command level is "encouraged" to solve its own "problems", before involving the higher-ups or elsewhere. Medical Boarding seeks a permanent PES downgrading, which usually entails re-vocationing &amp; re-coursing. There were some serious injury cases in my time, one famous one involving a M113 explosion that left almost a full detachment of mortarmen incapacitated. But, as far as I knew, only one of the casualties was Boarded. Another became a mess boy, the other two Hokien peng followed the rations truck, while the two NCOs kept their combat status. In those days, formal downgrading would also involve an unwelcome cut in service pay (different vocations were paid differently then), which might have also contributed to my unit preferring to solve matters internally.</div>
