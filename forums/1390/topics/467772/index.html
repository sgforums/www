              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cold Storage, Giant Hypermarket- NS/ Family Unfriendly Policies?</strong></span></p>
              <p>According to the NS45 benefits website: Redemption Outlets for SAFRA vouchers&gt; Participating Outlets, URL: <a href="https://ns45.safra.sg/About/redemShopping.aspx">https://ns45.safra.sg/About/redemShopping.aspx</a><br> <br> Both <a href="http://www.coldstorage.com.sg/">Cold Storage</a>++ and <a href="http://www.gianthypermarket.com.sg/">Giant Hypermarket</a>++ (All Outlets) list their NS45 SAFRA vouchers redemption terms and conditions as follows.<br> <br> <strong>++Voucher cannot be used to purchase The Choice Voucher,<strong><span style="color: red;"> infant formula</span></strong>, any service items (e.g. lottery, phone cards, parking coupons) and is not valid with any other promotional vouchers.</strong><br> <img id="vBCodeIMG" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FtUZAJ7A0TQ/UVkN0LQzEmI/AAAAAAAAAso/XsMFpe3JkMk/s1600/ColdStorage,+Giant+Hypermart,+NS+vouchers+applicability.JPG" border="0" alt=""><br> Which leads one to ask why, and upon failure to<strong> clarify this hypocrisy</strong>,
               might be led to make the following assumptions (no matter how 
              ridiculous they might be) (NTUC, on the same site-page, does not have 
              similar restrictions save for the purchase of  "cigarettes, lottery 
              products" which are both non necessities; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_of_tobacco#Health_effects">the former having obviously detrimental health effects [link]</a>, the latter an obvious waste of money).<br> <br> Which would obviously lead one to ask why these significant members of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_Farm_International_Holdings">Dairy Farm International Holdings [wiki]</a> would prejudice against the use and applicability of <a href="https://ns45.safra.sg/About/NSSAFRABenefits.aspx">NS45 SAFRA vouchers</a>.<br> <br> Whilst the exception in applicability of NS vouchers from exchange for 
              cigarettes and lottery products is obvious, the exception form 
              applicability to 'infant formula' is much less; and neither is the 
              exception clause towards "phone cards, parking coupons" understandable.<br> <br> Perhaps the actions of both Cold Storage, Giant Hypermarket are <strong>Singapore government led- facilitating the policies of</strong>:<br> - <strong>Reducing the birth rates amongst lest wealthy</strong> Singaporeans e.g. :<em>'Eugenics in Singapore: Government wants more babies, but not from women with low education'</em> [<a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.sg/2013/03/procreation-hypocrisy-singapore.html">link</a>]-
               this is because unlike expenses at glitzy entertainment outlets, the 
              expense of NS45 vouchers on (imported) 'infant formula' does not 
              increase SG GDP numbers (of which the political salaries of Ministers is
               tagged to)- or that the truth is that with porous immigrant policies, 
              the Singaporean baby really isn't a necessity.<br> <br> Or are the 'instant Capitalist' <strong>Chinese nationals immigrating to Singapore in droves</strong> due to the availability of safe, unadulterated baby formula <em>'Swiss baby formula 'adulterated by Chinese partner''</em>[<a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/swiss-baby-formula-adulterated-chinese-partner-113206135.html">link</a>], so 'infant formula' at Cold Storage, Giant Hypermarket are really being reserved for them.<br> <br> Likewise a public policy restriction on "<strong>phone cards</strong>, parking 
              coupons"- the former to curtail Singaporeans (NS men) wasting time 
              chatting on telephones ('unproductive') and the latter to cut the car 
              population in Singapore (increase public transport use).<br> <br> Yes, I agree that my assumptions might be highly speculative/ 
              imaginative, however, would Cold Storage, Giant Hypermarket (or even the
               Singapore government) be equally willing to explain its stance 
              regarding why humble  'infant formula' should be excepted products 
              purchasable with NS45 SAFRA vouchers.<br> <br> And please, the <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/pa-explains-why-opposition-mps-cannot-grassroots-advisers-161613082.html">PAP/PA grassroots advisers have either overlooked this point</a> or are <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_amkacIIwAFE/StE7T9VyIUI/AAAAAAAABs8/AZ505YgAQwo/s1600/liftupgrade.jpg">too busy scheming for the next general election [pict]</a>, (see: <strong>‘Adviser over MP’ raises many questions</strong> [<a href="http://www.tremeritus.com/2009/10/22/adviser-over-mp-raises-many-questions/">link</a>]). Thus a response form the Minister in charge of defense/ national procreation would be most welcome.<br> <br> And if <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7810819/Breast-milk-best-because-it-kick-starts-babies-immune-system.html">breast milk is a healthier choice towards the development of the future generation of NS men</a>, then yes, the Minister of Defence (or his hundreds of grassroots advisers) could tell that to us (truthfully) too...<br> <br> And dear Cold Storage, Giant Hypermarket, is it really such a great favor to accept SAFRA NS45 vouchers that they <em>"is<strong> not valid with any other promotional vouchers</strong>."</em>?<br> <br> No wonder they oft say (even during National Service), that SAF really means <strong><em>Serve and F*** off</em></strong>... the entire system is no more than <strong>a mere commercial enterprise </strong>and
               that's what Singapore is all about, no more than a financial hub where 
              slaves are bought and sold; sadly, perhaps what they say about Sinkapore
               is true- e.g.<strong> 'PAP’s Selective Kindness'</strong>[<a href="http://www.tremeritus.com/2012/12/13/paps-selective-kindness/">link</a>]<br> <br> <img id="vBCodeIMG" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/TSs3eMhmjhI/AAAAAAAAAQ0/WpeaPyJ73JI/s1600/talk_politics_free_hand%2528source%252C+jpg%2529.JPG" border="0" alt=""></p>
