              <p>Yo, I am planning to jump ship and skip town to Australia to further studies. However, I have a real serious reality problem. With the administrative paperwork not sorted out yet with the proper authorities of all countries, I am planning to default the NS system, as in escape/ evade/ skip/ desert NS. Then I will have another problem, I will be an illegal immigrant of sort due to my country's international passport problem/ expiry date, I will then later be a fugitive and consider to apply for asylum to escape to Australia/ America, I will have to go through the countries' D<span class="st">epartment of Customs, Immigration and Border</span> checkpoints.

              <p>The advice before you even think twice and thrice about this is take a good look at your parents. They will be penalised severely by all the government agencies and their CPF retirement fund will be greatly forfeited to be reduced to peanuts for their old age maintenance... Look at this very seriously unless your parents truly give you blessings and forgiveness if they have the guts and money to throw away for donation to the government coffers/ bank vault as thank you for your contribution to nation building.
                                                  
                                                  Change very single biological stuff such as your name, fingerprints, cornea/ iris, hair and all other biometric body parts that the checkpoint authority will scan at the borders should and if you are granted Australian/ US green card.</p>

              <p><strong>Those who require exit permit of 2 years or longer will

              Guarantee must be furnished. The amount of the security bond is
              S$75,000 or 50% of the combined gross annual income of both parents

              full-time NS in a combat vocation or fulfil his operationally ready
              NS obligations in full, a longer jail sentence to reflect the
              period of NS he has evaded may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>

              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot be called

                      Control Measures for Pre-Enlistees</span></em></h2>
              <p><strong>Q1. Why must MINDEF impose exit controls on NS-liable
                      males?<br> <br></strong> Exit controls are necessary to ensure that
                      NS-liable males who have gone overseas to study or reside at a
                      young age return to fulfil their NS responsibilities.</p>

              <div>
              <div>
              <p><strong>Q2. Why can't MINDEF exempt young males aged 13 to 16½
                      from exit controls?<br> <br></strong> Exit control measures have to be applied at a
                      reasonably younger age so that they could be effective to prevent
                      those who leave at a younger age defaulting on their NS
                      responsibilities</p>

              <div>
              <p><strong>Q3. Why has MINDEF decided to shift the starting age for
                      exit controls from age 11 to 13?<br> <br></strong> Currently, the starting age of exit controls is
                      pegged at age 11, the age where Singaporeans used to be issued with
                      NRICs. With Singaporeans now being issued NRICs at age 15, there is
                      no longer a special reason to retain age 11 as the starting age for
                      exit controls. MINDEF has therefore decided to set it at age 13,
                      which is when students would have just started their secondary
                      school education.</p>

              <div>
              <p><strong>Q4. Why is MINDEF removing passport controls?<br> <br></strong> With the introduction of the non-extendable
                      Singapore Biometric passport, a continuation of passport controls
                      for young males would mean that they will have to pay for a new
                      biometric passport upon expiry each time. This will result in
                      greater inconvenience and higher cost for young males and their
                      families. MINDEF has therefore decided to remove passport
                      controls.</p>

              <p><strong>Q5. Will young males holding non-biometric Singapore
                      passport be given full validity?<br> <br></strong> Those holding non-biometric Singapore Passports
                      will also have their passports extended for the full duration of 5
                      or 10 years. This is however subject to the remaining lifespan of
                      the passport.</p>

              <p><strong>Q6. Why does MINDEF require young males to apply for an
                      exit permit?<br> <br></strong> With the removal of passport controls, it is
                      necessary for MINDEF to extend exit permit requirements (which
                      currently affect only NS-liable males aged 16½ and above) to males
                      aged 13 and above in order to ensure that young males who go
                      overseas return to serve NS. However, to avoid inconveniencing
                      those who make short overseas trips during vacations, exit permits
                      will only be required for overseas trips of 3 months or more.</p>

              <p><strong>Q7. Will young males who require exit permits be
                      required to furnish a bond?<br> <br></strong> Young males aged 13 to 16½ will only be required to
                      furnish a bond if they require an exit permit of 2 years or more.
                      This arrangement is similar to the current practice where only
                      young males who require a passport validity of more than 2 years
                      are required to furnish a bond.<br> <br> Males aged 16½ to enlistment are approaching the age of enlistment.
                      They are therefore subject to more stringent exit controls to deter
                      potential NS defaulters. The current practice of requiring such
                      males to furnish a bond if they require an exit permit of 3 months
                      or more will continue.</p>

              <p><strong>Q8. Will young males aged 13 to 16½ who fail to apply
                      for an exit permit be sentenced to imprisonment?<br> <br></strong> The penalty regime for exit permit offences of
                      young males aged 13 to 16½ will be a fine of up to $2,000, with no
                      custodial sentences. They will however be subject to harsher
                      penalties should they continue to be in breach of the Enlistment
                      Act after that age 16½.<br> <br> Males above 16½ years who travel and remain overseas without
                      applying for an exit permit will be prosecuted under the Enlistment
                      Act. They will be liable upon conviction to a fine of up to $10,000
                      or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or both.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Q9. How will MINDEF deal
                      with young males who do not understand their obligations under the
                      Enlistment Act or those who have parents/guardians who deliberately
                      encourage them to be in breach of the Enlistment Act?</span><br> <br></strong> MINDEF recognises that some young males may not be
                      sufficiently mature to understand their obligations under the
                      Enlistment Act. <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Their parents or guardians may also have been
                      instrumental in decisions, which are in contravention of the
                      Enlistment Act. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Parents and guardians would therefore also be
                      liable for the exit permit offences of their children or wards of
                      ages 13 to 16½, so that the penalty can be imposed on their parents
                      or guardians when the circumstances warrant it. <span style="color: #ff6600;">MINDEF will
                      consider the circumstances of the case carefully before deciding
                      whether to issue warnings, composition fines or to charge the
                      parent or guardian in court.</span></span></strong></p>

              <p><strong>Q11. With the removal of passport controls, what would
                      be the arrangement for young males who have furnished bonds for
                      extended passport validity under the Immigration Bonding
                      Scheme?<br> <br></strong> As males below the age of 13 will no longer come
                      under the ambit of passport or exit control, those who had
                      furnished a bond to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority under
                      the Immigration Bonding Scheme will have their bonds
                      released.<br> <br> Males aged 13 to 16½ currently bonded in order to be issued with
                      passports of extended validity will be required to apply for an
                      exit permit for overseas trips of 3 months or more. Those who
                      require an exit permit of 2 years or more will continue to be
                      bonded. Those who require an exit permit of less than 2 years or
                      who do not require an exit permit will have their bonds
                      released.</p>

              <p><strong>Q12. If MINDEF continues with passport controls, how
                      many pre-enlistees would be inconvenienced by having to apply for a
                      new biometric passport every year?<br> <br></strong> According to the Immigration and Checkpoints
                      Authority, there are approximately 120,000 pre-registrants (males
                      aged 11 to 16½) and 100,000 registrants (males aged 16½ to
                      enlistment) passport holders. With the passport validity of
                      pre-registrants and registrants capped at 2 years and 1 year
                      respectively, we would expect a pre-registrant to have to apply for
                      a new passport once in 2 years and a registrant once a year. On
                      average, 100,000 have their passports extended annually.</p>

              SAF</span></span></strong><br> <br> 1. Overview<br> The military justice system in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is
              expected to treat every service personnel fairly and equally,
              regardless of race, rank or vocation.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"> <br> 2. Multi-levelled Approach</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The military justice system is based on the SAF Act, which was
              implemented in 1972. All servicemen are subjected to the SAF Act,
              SAF Regulations, and orders of whatever form issued pursuant to
              them.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">While discipline is paramount in the military, not all offences
              committed by SAF servicemen are dealt with by formal investigations
              and charges. Essentially, offenders can be dealt with either by way
              of informal or formal punishment systems.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"> <br> 3. Informal Punishment System<br> Commanders are empowered to mete out informal punishments like
              push-ups and weekend confinement to servicemen who have committed
              disciplinary breaches, like being late, sluggish, or improperly
              dressed.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">4. Formal Punishment System<br> If the offence that a serviceman committed is of a more serious
              nature, he may be formally dealt with by his disciplinary officer
              by way of a summary trial, or brought before a subordinate military
              court (more commonly known as the General Court Martial or
              GCM).</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">(a) Summary Trial</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The offences that can be dealt with by summary trial are
              essentially military offences, such as absence without leave
              (AWOL), non-compliance with lawful orders or insubordination.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">Depending on the rank of the serviceman in question, and the type
              of the disciplinary body hearing the case, the possible sentences
              that may be imposed can vary, and these can include fines or
              detention.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The summary trial is carried out in accordance with relevant SAF
              regulations, and the records of the summary trial are sent to the
              office of the Director, Legal Services of the SAF.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">(b) General Court Martial</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The General Court Martial exists as a separate forum from that of
              the summary trial. Unlike the summary trial, the GCM can deal with
              a wider range of offences, and can impose a wider range of
              punishments including imprisonment and discharge, on top of
              sentences like detention and fines. The GCM is also a more public
              and open forum, and its proceedings are conducted using similar
              legal rules and procedures as those used in a civil criminal
              court.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">Generally, only serious offences investigated by the Military
              Police Command, and which are referred to the office of the
              Director of Legal Services, will result in the accused serviceman
              being charged in a GCM. In such a case, a military prosecutor will
              draw up a formal charge sheet and present it before the GCM.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">General Courts Martial can be further sub-divided into two
              categories, namely the Panel Courts Martial - consisting of a
              President and usually two other members, and Judge Courts Martial -
              consisting of a single President only.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">Currently, the practice is for military offences to be heard by
              Panel Courts Martial, while civil offences like misuse of drugs and
              penal code offences may be dealt with by a Judge Court Martial.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"><br> The current policy is also for an NSman, who is or was a District
              Judge in the Subordinate Courts, to preside in a GCM. There are
              currently 10 NSmen who have been appointed by the Armed Forces
              Council to perform duty as President of a court martial. They are
              rostered by the Registrar of the Subordinate Military Court to hear
              cases during their in-camp training. In the case of a Panel Court
              Martial, the other two members are rostered from among some 155
              military officers appointed by the Chief of Defence Force.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"> <br> 5. Ways to Seek Redress</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">There are numerous safeguards and avenues set out in the military
              justice system for an SAF serviceman to seek redress if he is
              unhappy about the punishment imposed on him.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">Generally, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with an informal
              punishment meted out to him may request a higher level commander to
              review the punishment, or request for formal disciplinary
              dealing.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">In the case of a summary trial, a serviceman brought before the
              disciplinary officer may elect instead to be tried by a court
              martial. Alternatively, an aggrieved serviceman may request that
              his conviction or punishment imposed at the summary trial be
              reviewed by MINDEF's Director Manpower (a delegated authority of
              the Armed Forces Council).</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">In the case of a GCM, a serviceman may choose to be represented by
              a lawyer or an SAF defending officer if his case will be heard by a
              court martial. The SAF has about 200 trained defending officers.
              While an SAF defending officer comes free to the serviceman, he has
              to bear the cost of engaging a lawyer. At the end of the trial, a
              serviceman who is dissatisfied with the decision of the court
              martial may petition the Reviewing Authority (the AFC or a
              committee of its members) for a review of his case. The serviceman
              can also appeal to the Military Court of Appeal (MCA) for a
              reconsideration of his conviction, or his sentence, or both.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The MCA, when convened to hear an appeal, sits as a panel of five
              members. Heading the MCA is a President, who is appointed by the
              Chief Justice. By law, he must be a person qualified to be a Judge
              of the Supreme Court. The current President of the MCA is Justice
              Choo Han Teck. Four other members - two civilian members who are

              case impartially like any other civil criminal case. The
              proceedings in the GCM and the MCA are also heard in a public
              forum, and these military courts adopt many of the same legal
              procedures and safeguards as that used in the civil criminal
              courts. All servicemen formally charged with an offence can bring
              their case to these forums.</p>

              the compliance of traffic regulations by military personnel on the
              road as well as performing escort duties. It also performs regular

              registering and detaining suspects and offenders of military crimes
              in holding cells. The station is similar to a civilian police
              station and it is usually the first stop for detainees before their
              transfer to the detention barracks after conviction in military
              courts, or a temporary holding cell for servicemen placed under
              Closed Arrest. The investigative branch for the SAF, the Special
              Investigation Branch (SIB) investigates higher-order military
              crimes that requires specialised handling. Since 31 December 8,
              MPEU has heralded the inclusion of a new branch within its ranks.

              <p><em><strong>Being psychologically prepared is all about knowing
              what to expect and being prepared for it.</strong></em></p>
              <p>To be better prepared, you can participate in Total Defence
              activities and Open Houses organised by the SAF/SPF/SCDF.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you should also talk to your family members and friends
              who have lived the NS experience. The more you discuss with others,
              the more comfortable and mentally prepared you’ll become.</p>
              <p><strong>Because NS life is different from civilian life before
              enlistment, there are many adjustments you need to
              make.</strong></p>
              <p>A good way to cope is to get support from your buddy and fellow
              recruits. They are going through the same tough training as you, so
              talking to one another will help relieve some tension.</p>
              <p>In most evenings during your leisure time, you’ll also have some
              time to call your family or loved ones to talk. They can give you
              emotional support during NS.</p>
              <p>You can have a one-on-one interview sessions with your officer
              to highlight any problems you may have. If you have a personal or
              family problem that need to be addressed, do let the officer
              know—he may be able to give you some advice or time off to settle
              your problems.</p>
              <p>Life in NS revolves around structure, routine and discipline.
              This helps us stay united as a uniformed organisation as well as
              imparts the rigours necessary to protect our nation and
              citizens.</p>
              <p>This does not mean there is just work and no play. In fact,
              after a few weeks in NS and you’ll find new friends and new reasons
              to smile!</p>
              <p><strong>As a soldier, one of the biggest adjustments you’ll have
              to make quickly is in regimentation and discipline.</strong></p>
              <p>Being in a uniformed organisation, you’ll have to obey orders
              from your superiors. Thus some of you may feel a sudden lack of
              freedom to do what you want and you may find yourself having
              difficulties accepting authority initially.</p>
              <p>Regimentation and discipline build strong character and
              toughness, so that you’ll be tough enough to handle difficult
              combat, crime-fighting or rescue situations without giving up or
              breaking down.</p>
              <p>When you first enlist into NS, you may have concerns of being in
              a new territory, with new faces and new things to do. But don’t let
              this get to you. Just remember the saying that “when the going gets
              tough, the tough gets going”.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Following are some
              tips on what you can do to prepare yourself
              psychologically:</em></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Adopt a positive perception</li>
              <li>Build up physical stamina</li>
              <li>Develop good working attitude and habits</li>
              <li>Overcome psychological stress</li>
              <li>Adopt teamwork spirit</li>
              <li>Learn to be independent</li>
              <li>Set realistic expectations</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can also speak to your friends or family members who have
              been through NS. Ask them to share their stories. The sharing will
              help you reduce some of your fears, uncertainties and doubts.</p>
              <p><strong>During NS you’ll be living with different
              people.</strong></p>
              <p>Because these people come from different backgrounds, they may
              not think like you do or react to situations like you would.
              Instead of trying to select your type of people, you should cherish
              the diversity. This is a chance for you to learn more about your
              fellow mates and their cultures.</p>
              <p>You’ll find that you have many opportunities to absorb the
              different cultures—during training, eating, chatting or just seeing

              around you, you’ll have a much better appreciation of Singapore’s
              cultural diversity.</p>
