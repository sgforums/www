              <p><span>The answer to the question of
              changing military operational requirements came with the advent of
              sub-machine guns (SMGs) in the early 18th century as it combined the
              advantages of pistols - agility and convenience - with the accuracy of
              full-sized rifles.<br><br>Since the first SMG - the Italian Villar
              Perosa - SMGs and their designs have evolved many times to meet the
              ever-changing requirements for the infantryman's primary weapon.<br><br>One
              such weapon is the Heckler &amp; Koch 417 assault rifle. Designed with
              effective stopping power over a longer range than what a traditional
              5.56mm rifle is capable of, the HK417 - like most other combat systems
              - was one born out of necessity.<br><br><strong>Built as required</strong><br><br>The
              need for a larger calibre weapon developed out of the United States
              Army's operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Army commanders noticed that
              most encounters took place either at very close quarters in urban
              environments or over longer distances than what their standard issue
              5.56mm weapons were designed for.<br><br>While the call for a longer
              effective range signalled a need for more powerful rounds, there were
              no plans for a medium calibre cartridge. Heckler &amp; Koch (H&amp;K)
              then decided to use their already successful HK416 assault rifle as the
              backbone for the HK417 and adopted the established 7.62mm NATO
              cartridge as the ammunition of choice for the HK417.<br><br>In 2004,
              prototypes of the HK417 were designed with the focus on retaining the
              weapon-handling drills that soldiers were used to and having
              maintenance features similar to the M16 and M4 - both established
              weapon systems.<br><br>The HK417 was the first of H&amp;K's range of
              assault rifles that was designed for the addition of a sound suppressor
              and it subsequently became the first H&amp;K weapon to feature sound
              suppression capabilities without the need for modifications - also as a
              result of user demands.<br><br><strong>Fully customisable features</strong><br><br>The HK417 has a range of features that enables the user to customise the weapon to suit all sorts of operations.<br><br>It
              can be fitted with a choice of three barrel lengths: 12 inch (305mm),
              16 inch (406mm) and 20 inch (508mm), and the changing of barrels is
              accomplished by replacing only the barrel assembly group. This ability
              to change barrels quickly translates into more time for shooting rather
              than fiddling with the rifle's settings.<br><br>An gas regulation
              system, more commonly known as the silencer, can be fitted on the HK417
              gives its shooter an added edge: the option to switch to silent fire
              quickly and easily. This is capability, which is crucial in
              fast-evolving combat scenarios, is one that most other rifles do not
              have.<br><br>The free-floating hand guard system - patented by H&amp;K
              - allows the shooter to mount accessories such as torches and optical
              aiming systems exactly where needed. As its sights are integrated into
              the hand guard, there is no need to recalibrate the weapon after
              removal or re-installation.<br><br>Accommodating shooters of varying
              heights, the butt stock on the HK417 can be locked in various
              positions. A protected release lever prevents accidental release, as
              well as eliminates the risk of snagging on soldiers' uniforms and other
              materials. Inside the butt stock, there is a concealed compartment for
              batteries, tools and other small objects.<br><br><strong>For every terrain</strong><br><br>The
              HK417's receiver, magazine and action is built in a manner that it will
              not malfunction even when heavily fouled with sand or mud.<br><br>In
              the gas system assembly, the piston and driving rods are built to fit
              together tightly and will hardly permit any fouling deposits. To
              further prevent malfunctions, dirt particles and waste gases are not
              blown into the upper receiver. An optimised slope design in the
              magazine well makes changing magazines much easier - something that
              users will appreciate while using the weapon in the dark.<br><br>The
              HK417 is designed to function normally after being submerged due to the
              construction of the gas system that minimises entry of particles into
              the weapon. It can even be fired from within water safely, according to
              H&amp;K. This feature is essential to combat at coastlines, lakes and
              rivers where troops are vulnerable to ambush. The HK417 gives its user
              the assurance of greater survivability because it is always ready to
              fire.<br><br>Though the infantryman's primary weapon is considered a
              mature technology - a technology that is unlikely to see milestone
              changes or radical developments - riflemakers like H&amp;K and their
              HK417 prove that there is always room for improvement.Â </span></p>
