            <div class='col-md body'>The reason I started this thread was spurred by the coming exit of 3 ex superiors with one of them managed to find emplyment before he ORD.<br><br>Please answer the questions:<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>(1) When did you ORD? Or when are you going to ORD?</strong></span><br>ORD 30-06-05<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>(2) Your ORD is self induced (ie. resigned, Don't want to renew contract) or SAF induced (ie. Cannot extend contract, terminated prematurely).</strong></span><br>Offered to extend but refused to renew contract.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>(3) Have you found a new job already? How long did you take to find the new job after ORD, or you already secured a job before you ORD. How many resumes did you send?</strong></span><br>Job hunting started 3 months before I ORD. Secured a job 5 days before ORD. But switched jobs on the day I ORD to another dept of the same company.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">(4) If you have found a new job, how far are your ideals from your new job. In terms of position, jobscope &amp; pay?</span></strong><br>Position was higher than what I used to be in SAF. Jobscope is also more complicated but more focused into automotive engineering. No need to do duty, no need to chiong any sua. But paywise has to start 20% lower than what I used to draw. But I foresee I will catch back within 3 years &amp; eventually overtake what I can draw if I stay in SAF in the next 5 years.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">(5) Compared to SAF, how much welfare did you lose now?</span></strong><br>No more free medical. But current company covers my medical mostly with $3.00 co-payment everytime I see doctor. However, my current company gave me free courses to attend that helped me in my career even better. Something I'd never get in SAF.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">(6) What was your vocation in SAF?</span></strong><br>Autotech Spec<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>(7) Were you very worried when you are going to ORD that you may be jobless for a long time?</strong></span><br>OF COURSE YES! But luckily I managed to stay free for 2 weeks when I started my new job on 15 July 2005.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>( 8 ) Do you regret leaving SAF?</strong></span><br>Leaving SAF was 1 of my greatest agenda in my life. And I've accomplished. I will never regret that decision even if I were to be jobless for ages. What's more I'm young and can afford to run now. If I were to leave when my ex superiors are doing now, I'd be in greater trouble finding new employment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I see a strange trend, especially of officers leaving the SAF. This is only my perspective.<br><br>At the end of his first contract (around 30 years old), the salary of a Captain would be at a minimum of $3K+. If at Major rank, much more. This is the first hurdle to overcome.<br><br>To leave anytime after the first contract, at the age of mid 30s to 40s, the salary gap becomes even wider. He would have even more commitment, such as family, house and car.<br><br>How much would an appropriate salary be, to be able to maintain his lifestyle ? And would this be affordable by the company hiring him ? At that kind of salary, the company can hire 2 or more fresh graduates, younger and teachable.</div>

If a country doesn't subsidise its citizens' education, its only killing itself in the long run when its people become poorly educated and paid less.  A nation's wealth comes from its people.  Poor people = poor nation.<br><br>I'm not saying that we should equalise NSF allowance to be comparable to Regular salary or commercial salary scales.  I'm just saying the reason given to us through this housewive's tale version of "National Education" is not substantial.<br><br>The real reason why all of us need to serve our NS is that we all need to contribute to this country's security, safety, and welfare.  NOT cos we are recieving subsidised education.<br><br>And yes, the SAF needs to streamline its force of regulars.  It really pricks my ass to see inept, and attitude problem regulars take charge of NSF.  (eg. 1SG in my former unit caught sleeping during office hours, kena 3 extra)  I do not wish to stereotype regulars, but there is a very disturbing number of Regulars that have very poor working atitudes and ethics in the SAF.<br><br>Naturally, it was also a very inspiring experience to have worked with Regulars who are really dedicated to their work.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok. Then I think we could perhaps confine the comparison of salaries and the amount of work done, between regulars and NSFs, and leave the other factors out. Is it gross injustice ?<br><br>On education, maybe the less educated will complain less ?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
