            <div class='col-md body'>I was from 2SIR 9th Mono Support Coy Pnr Platoon from 1998 to 2000. CO was the then LTC Chan Chun Sing (who has just promoted to BG).<br><br>Have fond memories of the place. Being an ulu camp, the place has its charm. The nearest MRT is Yio Chu Kang and the walk is about 20mins. During my time, the other main unit was 20SA. A driver's training unit and another obscure reservist unit was there. Hence, the quietness and peacefulness.<br><br>I was a spec so I don't have to do prowling. But I understand the walk to be quite long as the prowlers have to walk all the way to the other end of the camp.<br><br>There were talks that 2SIR was to be move out after 9th mono, but apparently, it was still in Amoy Quee. The camp was rather run-down at that time. Toilet was full of algae. That time no king koil.<br><br>Actually, what is now Nanyang Poly was used to be part of Amoy Quee. It used to be an open field. Imagine the size of the camp back then.<br><br>During down periods with no training, I used to borrow my Platoon Sergeant's mountain bike and did a bit of off-road riding in the tracks just behind the current Poly. The place was big and not a soul was there. Very nice...<br><br>The NCC buildings were deserted but i understand now its taken up as NCC HQ.<br><br>Just a bit of my army memories.<br><br>2SIR!

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;&gt;formed in 1967 if i remember correctly. Was activated during the Konfrontasi.&lt;&lt;<br><br>Incorrect first part. Both 1SIR &amp; 2 SIR were from pre-independence, formed during the self-government period (1954-1963). But, as you said, the latter unit got battle-tested at Kota Tinggi, when Indonesia bristled at the formation of Malaysia (Malaya, Singapore, Sabah, Sarawak).<br><br>[Too bad MINDEF took down all the historical stuff hosted on their website.]<br><br>The unit is still at Amoy Quee? Wow, that means they must've been there for some 20 years (at least), cuz I used to walk past their parade square on the way to ARTC further inside the camp in the late 80s-early 90s. Perhaps it's just concidence, but I usually found the place quite deserted. But its cookhouse is located at a prominent site, so I'm sure they're not really that low profile.<br><br>Unless I'm wrong, they &amp; 20 SA remain the two NS outfits inside the camp, which is quite a big place. Arty has its own training grounds inside Amoy Quee itself, that's how big it is! It used to be bigger too, until part of the grounds was returned to the Govt to build Nanyang Poly. (But also got good tradeoff: we reservists could wake up to watching young, nubile Poly girls playing tennis across the fence!)<br><br>Until then there used to be a back gate leading to &amp; from Ang Mo Kio itself. Afterwards one had to walk a long way out to the main gate, &amp; then just as long out to the main road (Yio Chu Kang Rd). It's no easier from the YCK MRT station, a half-hour traverse that cuts across the Stadium/Tennis Centre into AMK Industrial Estate (must climb over railings &amp; a drain, SOC-style ~lol~). The back of a Chinese Temple there leads upslope to the side gate of 20 SA &amp;, if that's locked, one will have to head further down to the camp main gate. Would've been a good reason to stay-in, except IMO Amoy Quee is quite spartan, lacking in facilities, even "ulu" to this day, when compared to camps like Khatib.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>"Until then there used to be a back gate leading ..."</strong><br><br>Biltzonic, your description of book-in/out route couldn't be more accurate  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>A bit more to 2SIR's combat history (If i remembered correctly!) The first contact with the Indonesian inflirators resulted in a few soldiers from 2SIR killed as they were ambushed. However subsequently, 2SIR managed to kill a few Indonesians as they gained experience in jungle warfare.<br><br>The 2.4 route is indeed boring, but the SOC is a totally different ball! The starting point was around the 2 storey NCC buildings (back then, it was still deserted) DOWNSLOPE to a path that runs behind HQ and 'A' Coy! Its one of the easilest I've run.<br><br>2SIR has a carteen behind the cookhouse and there was only two stores around. But the uncle was very friendly and his egg noodles were yummy! Next choice would be 20SA carteen which has got more stuffs, but of course most of us are lazy to road march there.</div>
