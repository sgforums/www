            <div class='col-md body'>Okay corporal, you've survived BSLC and very happy to be out of Suffer In Silence Plus Extra Confinement. But be warned, being a combat engineer is not as easy as you think.<br><br>The School of Combat Engineer is relocated to Nee Soon Camp instead of the old Jurong Camp II. You will be training under the Specialist Training Wing for your specialist course. There is also an Cadet Training Wing for those Pro term cadets.<br><br>1) The first part of the course is the basic engineer course. This is roughly 1 month if I remember correctly. There are only 1 or 2 outfield during this phase. The training will be primarily classroom based and you learnt all sorts of theories. Most of the time you practices what you learnt within camp compound. What you cover includes:<br>- Combat engineer ORBAT<br>- Roles and formation of various combat engineer units<br>- Theories about demolition materials, circuits and detonation techniques.<br>- A couple of live demolitions<br>- Theory / Construct / Clear wire obstacles<br>- Theory / Construct / Clear minefields/mineclusters<br>- Theory / Use mine detectors<br>- Theory / Construct STB (Short Trackway Bridge).<br><br>The above is arga all that you'll learn in 1 month lah. I hope I got it correct.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  At the end of the basic course, you'll be sitting for a MCQ test which is rather long on all the stuffs that have been lectured to you. Oh, one important point to note, of course you'll also kenna appointments during your course. hehehe... cannot escape one lah. And similar to SISPEC, your OC will be a MWO or SWO, your PC will be a WO and your instructors will be senior specialists together with a few 3rd Sgts. There will also be a few physical trainings like IPPT and SOC for those who haven't cleared their 1st year. Every week will have a Muster Parade for the CO to talk cock and the School Sergeant Major (SSM) to give you extras too. After this basic course, maybe you'll be post out to different engineer units to further your studies or you'll remain to continue the Field Engineer Course. I'll continue part 2 below.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part II:<br>Possible postings after Basic Engineer Course include:<br>- School of Armour ( Armour Engineer )<br>- 35th SCE ( Amphibious Engineers )<br>- 36th SCE ( Explosives and Ordinance Disposal )<br>- 39th SCE ( NBC Engineers )<br>- Plant Engineers ( Operate dozers and other heavy equipments )<br>- Field Engineers ( &lt;- you very "heng" liao loh. hahahaha )<br><br>Okay, the reason I said you very heng is because, it is the most siong of all liaoz. The most relax should be plant engineers. The field engineer course is about 3 months long. So this is the 2nd longest path to your 3sgt rank after the Armour Sepcialist course. In this field engineer course, you'll learnt advanced theories and alot of outfield exercises. Stuffs like:<br>- Live demolition of charges less than 10kg in Singapore.<br>- Construction of beach obstacles<br>- Construction of underground Battalion Command Post.<br>- Construction of underground Battalion Collection Station.<br>- Construction of very big bridges for tanks and vehicles to cross.<br>- Learn to do basic engineer surveys.<br>- Assault breaching of various types of obstacles.<br>- Overcoming Anti - Tank Ditches.<br>- Launch / retrieve Class 30 Trackway.<br>- Road mine sweeping<br>- Go to Ex Crescendo with the officer cadets from CTW for summary exercise together.<br><br>In Ex Crescendo, specialists trainees will train together with the officer cadets for a common summary exercise. Officer roles and senior roles like CSM will be played by cadets and specialist trainees will be sect comds and PSs. The rest who doesn't have a role will be men irrespective if you are cadets or specialists. I really like this collaboration because this helps us see how cadets trains and they see how us trains. And of course, along the way, you will make great friends with them too. But beware too, those cadets instructors will be able to f*** you too if you screw up! And the best thing of Ex Crescendo is that you will be able to fire virtually unlimited amount of demolition ( &lt; 10kg ). It is here that you really feel the shock and awe of demolition! Really fantastic. After the 6 day summary exercise, everyone will have 2 days RnR and visit the SOP places before getting your ass back in Singapore. hehehe...<br><br>I hope this helps. Join the Field Engineers if you really like to blow shit up! hahaha... I REALLY like demolition.<br><br>After you finished your field engineers course, the only combat roles you'll be posted to will be limited to<br>- Infantry / Guards Pioneer platoon<br>- 30SCE<br><br>Otherwise, you'll either end up as instructors in the School of Combat Engineers or become Admin / Ops Specialists withing the engineer formation. And of course, you get your 3Sgt FINALLY.......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Something to add, if you kenna Guards unit, then you'll have to go there and do (GSCC) Guards Specialist Conversion Course too.<br><br>I'm sorry I can't provide anymore insights on the other engineer course like armour engineer because I did not went there so I don't want to mislead people by writing something I am not sure of. So anyone out there who went there please add to this thread.<br><br>I don't think I'll write anymore FAQs liao, too tiring for my old brain. hahahaha.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah, bangalore is powerful. But the most power I ever experienced is the cratering charge. It is a 20kg charge that is used to blow 1 big hole in the ground, big enough for a platoon of men to stand inside.<br><br>Singapore got limit the max weight of a single charge that can be detonated ( &gt; 10kg ). So must go overseas to enjoy spectacular fireworks.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
