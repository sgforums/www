            <div class='col-md body'>The SAF Overseas Scholarship (SAFOS) was introduced in 1971, with the aim of recruiting top students of each year's GCE 'A' Levels cohort to serve in MINDEF and the SAF. The SAFOS is widely recognised as second in prestige to the President's Scholarship, with unparalleled career prospects.<br><br>Only about 1,000 of 5,000 male NSFs who sit for the GCE 'A' levels each year will be selected for officer cadet training. Amongst them, only about 60 will qualify for the SAFOS selection.<br><br>The SAFOS will pursue challenges and diversity of experiences within the SAF and MINDEF. Their career paths are not limited to MINDEF and the SAF. Suitable scholars may be deployed in other Ministries as well.<br>With the heavy emphasis on talent grooming and management, MINDEF has a committee chaired by the top management that oversees talent management policies. This is explicitly shown in the developmental programmes that MINDEF provides for the SAF overseas scholars, which groom them to assume key appointments.<br><br>With ample training and exposure through taking on a variety of challenging command and staff appointments, the SAF overseas scholars are well prepared to hold top management positions in the SAF, public service and private sector.<br><br>The selected scholars will be paid a full officer's salary during their course of study, and receive a monthly maintenance allowance and an annual book allowance. Commissioned as 2nd Lieutenants in their first year of studies, the scholars will be promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in their second year. One year after graduation, they will be promoted to the rank of Captain.<strong><br><br>Just wondering...the accelerated promotion for these group of personalities...are they rewards to their performance or are they just given freely as they are scholars? Personally, (don't flame me for being jealous etc.) I'm just wondering, how competent are these guys serving in the command role and their ability to perform under combat situations.Just curios...anyone ever had experience with SAFOS scholars, please share. Thanks!</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Saw somewhere that got once this chap lost his rifle in Brunei...but he got a way light other then a little trashing by the senior officers...is it true that this group are priviledged and sheltered from rain and wind? As seriously...I'm thinking that its unfair to the others as its like an "old boy's club" sorta like an alumni for those who can study. Don't know if you guys agree but...Being awarded the scholarship just means that you can study, it doesn't mean that you have good leadership or human relationship yeah</div>

Just a thought, does any of the SAFOS scholars, whom end up in top positions in the SAF, actually have a degree in defense or war related academics. As mostly I see end up getting some science or business related degree such as Economics etc...whats the use of those in the military? The way I see it is that, they study this as the government is preping. them for what happens after their service with MINDEF, not what happends during their service with MINDEF.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looking at this year's crop of SAFOS scholars, I feel rather sad and bewildered that all of them are going to study science or engineering subjects, which will not be of much use at all during their future careers. It would be much better of SAFOS scholars study the humanities, especially history and geography, so that they can better understand the world situation around them and thus formulate better policies for the SAF of the future, and in times of war or peacekeeping duties, relate better to the circumstances on the ground. Leave the science and engineering to those tech geeks at DSTA and STK.</div>

In the military, in fact any military, we need men whom are not after stars...but those who will serve their country unflinchingly under fire, under pressure and under any circumstances. And the scholars...I personally feel are a tad too uncreative and are not flexible to adapt to the situations given. In war, resoruces is a thing which will always be scarce...sio what if they can't call in an air-strike coz the Strategy 101 manual says that has to be done? all operations have to cease and wait till the air-strike is made available? Honestly,why hasn't anyone raised this up to the SAF,MINDEF or the papers?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, I'm just curious about the promotion rate for officers in the Singapore military.<br><br>After reading this thread and others, I get the impression that the average age of officers in the Singapore military is relatively young. Is there is an early mandatory retirement age?<br><br>I'm aware that a university degree is not a requirement (though strongly recommended) for officers, and that many lieutenants are doing their national service (hence, around 19-21 years of age).<br><br>I read in one of the other posts that one Colonel was only 29 or something... To say that I was "surprised" would be an understatement! Is this true?? (Maybe it was LTC, not COL...I don't exactly remember).<br><br>(P.S. I served in the Korea Army for my military service)<br><br></div>

And yes I do believe that promotion should be based on merit rather than any extraordinary status like "scholar". And I was appalled to hear from my unit's COPA that the CO told him frankly that he was in it for the money. Another reason that the SAF is a fighting force on paper only.</div>
