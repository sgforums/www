              <p>Hello forum ,<br><br>Its been months since i graduated from BMT. Due to an injury + long status , i didnt manage to enter scs and was posted as a storeman(at least , thats the only reason i can think of why i didnt get in). Now that everything's cleared up and my pes status is again deemed combat fit, i have managed to convince my commanders that i belong to the combat side. I managed to 'impress' them with my background and told them i wanted to be a combat medic.<br>OC tells me that he's submitted the required documents for the change of vocation into a medic with the support of my CO and now , its just the wait , the longest wait.<br><br>I used to be able to get a silver in BMT but due to not having any motivation to do PT as a storeman , it's dropped to a fail. A few days ago after finally trying , i can barely do 4 chin ups. Now that there's finally a sense of hope , being able to learn something and not wasting 2 years doing saigang(no offence) , im determined to bring it back up to silver, or at least a pass before my change of vocation.<br><br>My question is , am i able to check with HQMC or anywhere regarding HQMC's intake ? i.e. when will they actually start taking in trainees as from what my commanders tell me , that is when ill be finally posted out. That date will be my goal for a silver , or at least a pass. <br>Secondly , Will i get f-ed if i enter the combat medics with a fail in ippt ? It is 'tough' and boring doing pt alone..</p>
              <p>With that , thank you forums :)<br><br>Regards<br>RuiQi</p>

              <p>Hello taru ,</p>
              <p>Thanks for the reply , i remb u were one of them who replied to my storeman thread as well :D</p>
              <p>I understand id have to wait for the next intake but im curious as to its date. Hence why im wondering if HQMC is the place to enquire.</p>
              <p>Feeling excited to go over yet worried the posting might take too bloody long(NS is 2 years , its long but still , id like to spend most of my 2years as a medic). My current fitness also worries me. (part of me hopes that the posting wont be too soon as i need to get my fitness back up) Wouldnt want to enter the combat side with a fail in IPPT.<br><br>Regards<br>RuiQi</p>

              <p>Young man, I am a combat medic spec.</p>
              <p>Now, before you get caught up in the glamour and glitz (if any) about being a medic, ask yourself whether (as others have pointed out) you enjoy having an 18G cannula stuck into your arms at least ten times. </p>
              <p>If you don't know what is 18G, look at a Yakult straw and imagine poking all of it into your forearm. Yeah, it's something like that.</p>
              <p>And ten times is only if your buddy is an expert marksman. Otherwise, expect at least twenty times. And that is only during the course itself - once you've passed as a medic, expect to do it to others many, many times. And expect other medics to train their skills on your arms.</p>
              <p>Then, think about what it is like to carry a medical fieldpack and stretcher out in the jungle. You think the FBO in BMT was heavy? Well, you'll be carrying double of that. While everyone else is fighting in SBO attire, you will be in double FBO.</p>
              <p>Then after each battle while everyone is resting and doing re-org, you will be running from casualty to casualty, treating each one of them. And that includes shooting that 18G cannula into their arms if need be. In the jungle, in the mud, under the hot sun, while you're shagged as hell, with all the bengs screaming at you for inflicting pain on them.</p>
              <p>Not trying to discourage you. Just trying to say it as it is.</p>

              <p>Hello forum ,</p>
              <p>Thanks for the replies :)<br>Havent been able to reply coz of camp but was given nights off today.<br><br>I am not going for the glory or the status but for the life skills i can learn. My elder brother passed away at home , infront of us , 2 months before i enlisted due to heart failure. Ever since then , i have had this strong intention of being an SAF medic. I understand there are always courses outside of SAF but this , will make me stronger both mentally and physically.<br><br>Personal stories aside , yes u are right , there will be times , many times where we suffer and suck thumb during our army lives , especially those in the combat side. But these times never last , and when we go through it , we become stronger , we become less afraid for the tougher days ahead. Many are right , why go through hardship (for honour and glory) when u can breeze through the 2 years peacefully and go back to civilian life. Not to wayang or so , but id like to ORD knowing that i have done my best in the army , as a corporal (since that is the highest rank men can attain prior to ORD)<br><br>I understand that BMT might be nothing compared to a combat medic but if i do get the transfer , no matter how sh--tty life gets or how unfair the treatment gets , i will never stop to regret my decision. I will have the mindset that at the end of the day , i am a step closer to achieving something and i will have something more to talk to my parents about.<br><br>I have failed to enter SCS , i now pray that with my OC's referral , HQMC will take me in. Again , thanks for the replies and peace out :)<br><br>Regards<br>RuiQi</p>

              <p>Young man, I am a combat medic spec.</p>
              <p>Now, before you get caught up in the glamour and glitz (if any)
              about being a medic, ask yourself whether (as others have pointed
              out) you enjoy having an 18G cannula stuck into your arms at least
              ten times. </p>
              <p>If you don't know what is 18G, look at a Yakult straw and
              imagine poking all of it into your forearm. Yeah, it's something
              like that.</p>
              <p>And ten times is only if your buddy is an expert marksman.
              Otherwise, expect at least twenty times. And that is only during
              the course itself - once you've passed as a medic, expect to do it
              to others many, many times. And expect other medics to train their
              skills on your arms.</p>
              <p>Then, think about what it is like to carry a medical fieldpack
              and stretcher out in the jungle. You think the FBO in BMT was
              heavy? Well, you'll be carrying double of that. While everyone else
              is fighting in SBO attire, you will be in double FBO.</p>
              <p>Then after each battle while everyone is resting and doing
              re-org, you will be running from casualty to casualty, treating
              each one of them. And that includes shooting that 18G cannula into
              their arms if need be. In the jungle, in the mud, under the hot
              sun, while you're shagged as hell, with all the bengs screaming at
              you for inflicting pain on them.</p>
              <p>Not trying to discourage you. Just trying to say it as it
              is.</p>
              </div>

              <p>WTF? A staged exercise involves shotting real cannulas to the whole unit's men?</p>

              then also those attitude type of guy...during one excercise many
              men were declare casualty maybe 20 men, the meduc was running
              around like mad, keep shouting and requesting to arrange
              evacuation... the controller came around keep stressing him,
              shouting that casulaty critical, that caualty dying etc... and keep
              shouting at him, those dead, how? how?</p>
              <p>He reply leaves them, the controller again shouted, how can you
              leave them, the other men seeing will feel demaoralise..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He dam TL shouted, Sir.. lay the dead in a straight line, I will
              request the APC come to roll them till no remains can be
              seen.....</p>

              <p>Which is true. Dead soldiers are given the lowest priority.</p>
              <p>After all, you can't bring back the dead. But you can still stop the living from being dead.</p>

              <p>Hello forum ,</p>
              <p>16th July , that's the confirmed date of my posting to HQMC in Nee Soon camp as a trainee.</p>
              <p>I can't believe it , i got it. After waiting for so long , thinking everyday about whether my appeal will be a success , its finally over. My OC told me the chances of revocating from a storeman to a medic was actually slim but due to my background and history , i got extremely lucky.</p>
              <p>I will never be able to thank them enough for helping me change my NS life. All i can do is work hard. I know it'll only get tougher beyond this point , but what we experience are nothing compared to those soldiers out there fighting a war at this moment. If they can get through it , we definitely can , at least , this is one of the things i say to myself to push on. I cant promise those who helped me that i'll be the best , but ill definitely put everything i can to my new vocation.</p>
              <p>Ill definitely have more to ask in the near future but atm , thank you forums for the advices in this thread :)</p>
