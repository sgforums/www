              <p><em>Seeing the SAF counsellor a few times. He referred me to see PCC psychiatrist. <br>I have problems adjusting to new environment and tend to be violent/ rage. <br><br>However, I am quite curious/ anxious/ nervous on my first visit to the psychiatrist since it is a relatively new place/ experience. </em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What to expect?</strong></span></em></p>
              <p>Psychiatrists in Singapore, as with other medical specialist,can be found both in the public and also the private sector. If you are thinking of going to see (or have been referred or been given a recommendation to) a psychiatrist in Singapore and are not sure what to expect, or you are feeling anxious and apprehensive, read on.<br><br>Many people have pre-conceived ideas about what to expect before they see their psychiatrist for the first time. They often feel very apprehensive while waiting for the appointment. There is often much anxiety about what he will be like and what he would then do to you. <br><br>Actually, a visit to a psychiatrist in Singapore is pretty similar to a visit to any other doctor. Think of a psychiatrist as a doctor for emotions. Sometimes feelings and emotions get “fractured”and a psychiatrist helps to take away the emotional pain and let them heal again. If you feel shy or anxious about seeing the psychiatrist alone, you may also get your family members or best friends to accompany you for the first visit.<br><br>There are various approaches to treating psychiatric conditions but all begin with a thorough and complete history, a mental state examination and finally a formulation and diagnosis is made. The first visit would typically take about 40 to 60 minutes, during which, expect the psychiatrist to get to know you and your problems better.<br><br>He would usually begin by finding out about the main issue that has brought you to the clinic. He would then want to get to know you better and find out more about your family, your childhood experiences and your educational and occupational history. Male patients in Singapore would also be enquired about their  stint in National Service. A more thorough evaluation of each symptom would then be undertaken. He would also be interested to find out more about your relationships with others and whether there are areas of concern you have. <br><br>A skilled psychiatrist will of course weave all these into a pretty normal conversation. The key to any psychiatric evaluation is making you feel comfortable and a good psychiatrist would also be able to gauge your level of comfort and tailor the level of questioning to suit this. So don't be worried, seeing a psychiatrist is not particularly scary or intimidating and psychiatrists are generally warm, friendly, approachable and nice people. It is often an experience on its own for most patients to be intently listened to by someone for the first time. The psychiatrist would then reflect upon what you have said and help you better understand yourself and also develop greater insight into your issues.<br><br>While gathering the history, the psychiatrist would also conduct a “mental status exam”. Think of this as the equivalent of the physical examination that other doctors do. A psychiatrist is a trained medical specialist who is able to assess your level of emotional functioning through both verbal and non-verbal cues that you provide.The use of therapy or medications or both would depend on the diagnosis and severity but your wishes would also be respected.<br><br>At the end of the session, your psychiatrist will offer a summary of what he sees as the current issues. He will take  into account your needs and wishes in the recommended subsequent plan of care.</p>
              <p><br>So that’s it, a rather enjoyable first session with plans made for subsequent visits. Remember, Psychological conditions respond best when treated early, but its also never too late to seek help. Don't hesitate any longer, take good care of yourself and your emotional health and get your appointment and then turn up promptly at the clinic. Seeing a Psychiatrist in Singapore may just be the best thing that you have done for yourself in a while.</p>

              <p><em><strong>Being psychologically prepared is all about knowing
              what to expect and being prepared for it.</strong></em></p>
              <p>To be better prepared, you can participate in Total Defence
              activities and Open Houses organised by the SAF/SPF/SCDF.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you should also talk to your family members and friends
              who have lived the NS experience. The more you discuss with others,
              the more comfortable and mentally prepared you’ll become.</p>
              <p><strong>Because NS life is different from civilian life before
              enlistment, there are many adjustments you need to
              make.</strong></p>
              <p>A good way to cope is to get support from your buddy and fellow
              recruits. They are going through the same tough training as you, so
              talking to one another will help relieve some tension.</p>
              <p>In most evenings during your leisure time, you’ll also have some
              time to call your family or loved ones to talk. They can give you
              emotional support during NS.</p>
              <p>You can have a one-on-one interview sessions with your officer
              to highlight any problems you may have. If you have a personal or
              family problem that need to be addressed, do let the officer
              know—he may be able to give you some advice or time off to settle
              your problems.</p>
              <p>Life in NS revolves around structure, routine and discipline.
              This helps us stay united as a uniformed organisation as well as
              imparts the rigours necessary to protect our nation and
              citizens.</p>
              <p>This does not mean there is just work and no play. In fact,
              after a few weeks in NS and you’ll find new friends and new reasons
              to smile!</p>
              <p><strong>As a soldier, one of the biggest adjustments you’ll have
              to make quickly is in regimentation and discipline.</strong></p>
              <p>Being in a uniformed organisation, you’ll have to obey orders
              from your superiors. Thus some of you may feel a sudden lack of
              freedom to do what you want and you may find yourself having
              difficulties accepting authority initially.</p>
              <p>Regimentation and discipline build strong character and
              toughness, so that you’ll be tough enough to handle difficult
              combat, crime-fighting or rescue situations without giving up or
              breaking down.</p>
              <p>When you first enlist into NS, you may have concerns of being in
              a new territory, with new faces and new things to do. But don’t let
              this get to you. Just remember the saying that “when the going gets
              tough, the tough gets going”.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Following are some
              tips on what you can do to prepare yourself
              psychologically:</em></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Adopt a positive perception</li>
              <li>Build up physical stamina</li>
              <li>Develop good working attitude and habits</li>
              <li>Overcome psychological stress</li>
              <li>Adopt teamwork spirit</li>
              <li>Learn to be independent</li>
              <li>Set realistic expectations</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can also speak to your friends or family members who have
              been through NS. Ask them to share their stories. The sharing will
              help you reduce some of your fears, uncertainties and doubts.</p>
              <p><strong>During NS you’ll be living with different
              people.</strong></p>
              <p>Because these people come from different backgrounds, they may
              not think like you do or react to situations like you would.
              Instead of trying to select your type of people, you should cherish
              the diversity. This is a chance for you to learn more about your
              fellow mates and their cultures.</p>
              <p>You’ll find that you have many opportunities to absorb the
              different cultures—during training, eating, chatting or just seeing
              and listening. Take these opportunities and learn from people
              around you, you’ll have a much better appreciation of Singapore’s
              cultural diversity.</p>

              <p><br> The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) is a 2,000-bed acute tertiary
              psychiatric hospital situated on a 25-hectare campus at
              Buangkok Green Medical Park. Set amidst serene surroundings,
              IMH offers a comprehensive range of psychiatric, rehabilitative and
              counselling services for children, adolescents, adults, and the
              elderly.</p>
              <p>IMH’s tradition of care started in 1928. We were the first
              mental hospital in Singapore, starting with some 1,000 patients.
              Since then, many advances have been made in treatment, training,
              and research. Our treatment integrates evidence-based therapies,
              supported by the departments of clinical psychology, nursing,
              occupational therapy, and medical social work, to provide holistic
              care for our patients. IMH is equipped with modern facilities, with
              50 wards for inpatients and seven Specialist Outpatient
              Clinics.</p>
              <p>IMH was the first mental health institution in Asia to receive
              the Joint Commission International Accreditation in 2005, a highly
              coveted international accreditation for healthcare
              organisations. </p>
              <p>Over the years, IMH has gained a reputation for quality
              research. In 2008, the Ministry of Health,
              Singapore, entrusted IMH with a S$25 million research
              grant to implement translational and clinical research into the
              causes of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.</p>
              <p>IMH also plays a key role in training the next generation of
              mental health professionals in Singapore. We train psychiatrists
              and mental health professionals through the NHG-AHPL Residency
              Programme for psychiatry and through collaborations with the local
              tertiary institutions.</p>

              initiatives</strong><br> <em>Posted: 12 November 2012 1930 hrs</em></p>
              <p>Minister of State for Health Dr Amy Khor announced in Parliament
              on Monday two new community-based mental health initiatives
              designed to improve Singaporeans' access to mental
              healthcare.<br> <br> "We are developing Assessment and Shared Care Teams (ASCAT), which
              are specialist-led mental health teams based in the community, in
              order to improve access to mental health care. We are also
              developing Community Mental Health Intervention Teams (COMIT) to
              provide improved access to counselling and psychotherapy services
              in the community," said Dr Khor.<br> <br> Dr Khor also said that the Institute of Mental Health's (IMH)
              occupancy rate for the past three years averaged at about 80 per
              cent and that the hospital has sufficient capacity for new
              patients.<br> <br> There are currently about 2,000 beds across public hospitals in
              Singapore dedicated to mental health patients, with the majority in
              IMH.<br> <br> Responding to queries from Member of Parliament Mr Hri Kumar Nair
              on the criteria for admitting patients to IMH, Dr. Khor said those
              with conditions such as schizophrenia and depression may be
              admitted for closer monitoring.</p>

                   Centre and SAF Ward came under the umbrella of MMI. In Dec 2003, 
                  Military Medicine Institute, together with Tanglin Physiotherapy Centre,
                   relocated to DSO(Kent Ridge) Building. <br><br><strong class="redText"></strong></span></div>

              <p>Does my case sound quite serious?</p>
              <p>I am always being bullied in school and even in NS. In my primary sch days, it got so serious that I took a water bottle and started chasing the bullies attempting to hit them. In my sec school days I took a chair. I also has sucidual thoughts in pri,sec and NS period. </p>
              <p>In JC, there was a change in class for me, like they splitted the class as it was too small. I could not take it and managed to cchange to my old class eventually. </p>
              <p>In NS, was bullied all the way. Broke chain of command before. </p>
              <p>Slight deviation in my routine would get me very upset. Like I need to know of extra lessons months ahead. Cannot be given dentention all those as I would just break down. Even now if there are too many changes I would just break down</p>
