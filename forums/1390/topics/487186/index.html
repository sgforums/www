              <p><span><strong>Almost
               everyone who had problems passing or doing well in IPPT, have one thing
               in common - they hardly train. Even if they do train, it is either done
               sporadically or without sufficient intensity or duration to have any 
              significant impact on their physical fitness. Worse still, they often 
              wait until the "last-minute" to make an attempt to train and then hope 
              for the best.</strong><br><br>Here, I intend to share some useful pointers 
              and guidelines with you and everyone preparing for their IPPT. I will 
              keep it simple, basic and practical. But, let's be realistic. It is not 
              going to be a magic formula plucked out of nothing and which will make 
              you fitter overnight. There is no short cut and no easy way out. 
              Training will be stressful and, to some degree, painful. How long you 
              will take to succeed will depend on what is your current state of 
              physical fitness and how hard you are prepared to work. If you are at a 
              "zero" fitness state, then it will take you longer to attain the 
              required fitness level than if you are already exercising, albeit 
              irregularly.<br><br>Before you embark on a fitness program, you must be 
              prepared to invest time and make some sacrifices. You will need to train
               at least 3 times a week, up to 1 hour each time. Make sure you have the
               right gear, and, most importantly, a reasonably good pair of running 
              shoes. If you are not sure what type of shoes to buy, just go to the 
              nearest e-mart and purchase the SAF running shoes with your credits. You
               should also give yourself about 12 weeks to prepare for your IPPT. <br><br><strong>Some Basic Principles</strong><br>The key to fitness lies in the FIT formula. It is simply:<br><br><strong>Frequency - How Often</strong><br>Exercising
               3-5 times is highly recommended. If you have a busy schedule, aim to 
              maintain a regular program of exercise at least 3 times a week, 
              alternating with one rest day in between workouts to give your body a 
              chance to rest and recover.<br><br><strong>Intensity - How Hard</strong><br>Your 
              heart rate will tell you how hard you have been exercising. You should 
              exercise hard enough so that your heart rate stays within a certain 
              target range. This is about 70-85% of your maximum heart rate 
              (calculated from 220-your Age). For example, if you are 20 years old, 
              your maximum heart rate is 220 - 20 = 200 beats per minute. If you want 
              to keep your heart rate at 70% of its maximum, then your targeted heart 
              rate should be 200 x 0.7 = 140 beats per minute. Take your heart rate 
              immediately at the end of your run and you will know whether you have 
              been exercising at the right effort level. The wrist or the neck is a 
              good spot to feel the pulse. <br><br><strong>Time or Duration - How Long</strong><br>To
               be effective, you should exercise such that your heart rate stays in 
              the target range for 20 to 30 minutes continuously. Ideally, an exercise
               session should consist of 3 segments: warm up (5-10 minutes), workout 
              proper (20-30 minutes) and cooling down (5-10 minutes). The whole 
              session will not last more than an hour. In the warm up, include light 
              jogging and then stretch your muscles, especially the arm and shoulder, 
              trunk and your thigh (both front and back) muscles. Warming up will help
               prepare your body for the vigorous exercise and reduce the risk of 
              getting injured during the exercise. You should also stretch your 
              muscles as you cool down after your run. This will ensure that your 
              muscles remain flexible and gain more strength with time.<br><br><strong>Be specific in your training</strong><br>Let's
               face it. If you want to prepare for IPPT, you will have to train for 
              IPPT. You can't be playing a sport or cycle all the time and then think 
              you are ready for a good 2.4km time. Likewise, doing push-ups and chin 
              ups are 2 different exercises altogether, even though both stresses the 
              upper body. The bottom line is that, if your goal is IPPT, you must 
              specifically train for IPPT.<br><br><strong>Fitness Begins at Home</strong><br>Before
               you get the wrong idea, I am not suggesting turning your precious home 
              into a gym. Far from it, you don't really need anything else except 
              investing in a portable doorway chin-up bar. A reasonable one costs no 
              more than $20 and may have other domestic uses too, such as hanging up 
              your clothes before putting them away in the closet. The point is, you 
              don't have to get out of your home to exercise. Exercises such as sit 
              ups, dips, back raises, step-ups and squat thrusts, etc; can be done in 
              the comfort of your home. Best of all, you can do most of them while 
              watching your favourite TV programs and you can also do it at any time 
              of the day at your convenience. Such exercises can be done daily. Before
               you know it, you would have developed a fine set of abs (without even 
              having to buy any of those commercial-ad equipment which you see on TV) 
              and well-conditioned shoulders and thighs. All these without getting out
               of the house! If you are living in a high-rise apartment, use the 
              staircase instead of the elevator. It is effective to build up strong 
              legs and your heart and lungs too. I can go on and on but it is not 
              necessary. With a little imagination and initiative, you should be able 
              to come up with more exercises that you can do at home. And why not 
              exercise at your workplace too?<br><br><strong>Having Problems with IPPT?</strong><br>Some
               people seem to breeze through their IPPT with minimum training and 
              effort. But, most of us need considerable physical preparation. Due to 
              physiological differences among people, some will find certain stations 
              harder to pass than others. Generally though, there really need not be 
              any other modes of training in preparing for the IPPT other than 
              practising the exercises themselves. In other words, all you need to do 
              is to regularly do your sit ups, standing broad jumps, chin ups and 
              4x10m shuttle runs, followed by a timed 2.4km run at each training 
              session. However, there are those who will have specific weaknesses and 
              need extra help.<br><br><strong>BA Recommended Recipe</strong><br>The major 
              problem areas in IPPT seem to be the 2.4km run and chin up tests. 
              However, I will cover all 5 stations. The recommended exercises will be 
              generally effective for improvements to be made. Make no mistake about 
              it, it will depend on the current state of fitness of the individual, 
              the commitment and effort put in training and the time available to 
              prepare for IPPT.<br><br><strong>SIT UP</strong><br>If you are able to sit up a 
              few repetitions without difficulty, all you will need to do is to 
              practise sit ups regularly and increase the number of repetitions 
              progressively till you are able to do the required number to pass the 
              test. If you experience problems in even doing a few, you will need to 
              build up your abdominal strength in your training.<br><br>Do crunches 
              and leg raises. In addition, do sit-backs. It is actually a reverse of 
              the sit up. From a sit up position, lower your upper body slowly to the 
              halfway point and hold this position for a few moments. Most likely, 
              vibrations in the muscles of the abdominal region will be felt with 
              discomfort. Then let the upper body go all the way to the floor and rest
               for a while. Repeat the exercise several times.<br><br><strong>STANDING BROAD JUMP</strong><br>This
               test requires good muscular power of the legs. In other words, in 
              addition to building up strength, training to develop speed in executing
               the jump is equally important. To be effective, plyometric or hopping 
              exercises must be done in addition to squats or leg press exercises.<br><br>Double-Leg
               Hops. Squat down and jump as far as possible. Immediately upon landing,
               jump forward again. Use quick, double-arm swings and keep the landings 
              short. Do about 5 jumps in a row for each set, about 3-5 sets per 
              training session. One precaution to take is to ensure that the knees are
               not less than 90 degrees bent in the landing position and prior to 
              taking off.<br><br>Tuck Jumps. Do no more than 5 jumps in a fast, 
              regular rhythm, about 3-5 sets. Possibly, try bringing your knees or the
               front of your thighs to touch your chest. . Stand upright with feet 
              nearly together. Then jump upwards as high as possible.<br><br><strong>CHIN-UPS</strong><br>This
               is the test that tends to give the most trouble. Often, the 
              strength:body weight ratio is lop-sided. Individuals who are obese or 
              with larger than normal body weight, will need to get rid of the excess 
              weight in order to improve chin up performance. This can be achieved 
              with aerobic exercise and proper dieting. Chin-ups must be practised 
              regularly to achieve improvements. The prime movers in this exercise are
               the latissimus dorsi (commonly known as the "wings" or laterals) and 
              biceps. The recommended weight training exercises are lats pulldown and 
              bicep curls. The specific chin-up exercises are as prescribe below. 
              Always begin with the most difficult one and work down to the easiest. 
              As the bicep muscles are primarily involved in the chin up exercise, the
               underhand or supinated grasp (palming facing the body) is the stronger 
              of the two handgrasps, the other being the pronated grip (palms facing 
              away from the body). <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Partner-Assisted.</span> Assume chin-up 
              position and perform as many correct chin-ups as possible until muscle 
              fatigue. When you cannot perform any more correct chin-ups, get a 
              partner to assist you up until a repetition is completed. Your partner 
              will then let go and you will lower yourself down slowly at a four-count
               cadence. Repeat the procedure until you are unable to hold on to the 
              bar or lower yourself in a controlled manner.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chair or Step-Assisted</span>.
               Stand on a stable stool, chair or bench and jump up until chin is above
               the bar. Bend your knees and lower yourself at a 4-count cadence. When 
              the arms are fully extended, place your feet on the bench and repeat 
              procedure until muscle failure or when you are unable to lower yourself 
              in a controlled manner.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Behind the neck</span>. Hang on to the 
              bar with your hands further apart than the width of your shoulders. Pull
               yourself upwards till the base of your neck touches the bar. Repeat the
               exercise until muscle failure.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Hang</span>. Get into the 
              chin-up starting position and hang on to the bar until it is no longer 
              possible to continue gripping the bar. Time your hang as increasing 
              "hanging" time is indicative of better grip strength and endurance.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inclined Chin-up</span>.
               In this exercise, the chin-up is done using a low bar set at about 
              mid-chest level. Grip the bar and slide feet under the bar with body 
              straight, arms and body forming a right angle. The weight should rest on
               the heels of the feet. Execute chin-up with a straight body until 
              fatigue.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>Flexed-Arm Hang</span>. Get into the chin-up position, 
              i.e. with chin at or above bar. Hang on for as long as you can. Time 
              your hang to monitor progress.<br><br><strong>4X10M SHUTTLE RUN</strong><br>Repetitive
               agility runs over short distances will help to develop your speed, 
              agility and co-ordination. You should concentrate on your acceleration 
              and the way you change direction. With practice, you will develop the 
              right technique, which will help you to clock better times. The same 
              exercises that help you to leap further in the standing broad jump will 
              also give your legs that extra burst of speed in the shuttle run.<br><strong><br>2.4KM RUN</strong><br>To
               prepare for your 2.4km run, you should combine steady longer distance 
              runs with interval training. What's interval training? You run a series 
              of shorter distances at a faster pace, take twice the time of each run 
              to recover by walking or jogging slowly, and then start another fast run
               again. Do 4-6 repetitions at each session. Physiologically, interval 
              training will build up your body's ability to clear away the lactic acid
               that accumulates in your muscles during vigorous exercise. This means 
              that you can run further and faster without getting muscle aches and 
              fatigue prematurely. This is a very effective training method as it 
              helps to build up speed-endurance, which will enable you to sustain a 
              faster-pace continuous run over 2.4km. If you have not been exercising 
              regularly or have laid off exercise for a considerable length of time, I
               would suggest you give yourself at least 12 weeks to progressively 
              prepare for the test.<br></span></p>

              fitness needs. Select the appropriate program (A, B or C) to help you 
              achieve the goal you want to set for yourself but be realistic. For 
              example, if you are aiming to run the 2.4km in 12 minutes and below, 
              then program B will probably be the more appropriate one for you to 
              begin with. However, if you are doubtful, start with program C. If you 
              improve quickly or find program C too easy, you should switch to program
               B. This way, you will allow your body to progress according to your 
              potential and ability. But, do it gradually. Avoid doing too much too 
              soon.<br><br><strong>Advice for the Overweight and Obese</strong><br>If you are 
              overweight, you should lose some weight before starting on this training
               program. Otherwise, you run the risk of injuring your joints, 
              especially your knees and ankles. Give yourself an additional 8 to 12 
              weeks to lose weight. Combine dieting with low-intensity aerobic 
              exercise such as brisk walking. Start by walking briskly for 20 to 30 
              minutes continuously. The aim is to build up the body's tolerance and 
              ability to sustain continuous aerobic exercise. Progress to walk-jog 
              when you are able to brisk walk comfortably for 30 minutes continuously.
               Once you are able to slow jog continuously for at least 20 minutes, you
               can go on to the training program proper and start with program C.<br><br><strong>Do You Need Weight Training?</strong><br>Generally,
               no. Callisthenic exercises such as those described earlier, together 
              with regular aerobic runs, will be sufficient for you to pass IPPT. 
              However, if you have weak arms and legs, have not been exercising for a 
              long while or want to achieve greater results, working out in a gym is a
               good way to improve quickly. For example, the lats pulldown exercise 
              using weights is particularly useful to develop the specific muscles for
               chin-up improvement. While working out in the gym, bear in mind that 
              strength is developed with the use of heavier weights performed with 
              fewer repetitions (about 6-8 repetitions). Muscular endurance, on the 
              other hand, is achieved with lighter weights but more repetitions (about
               12-15).<br><br><strong>A Lifetime Pursuit</strong><br>So, you have finally 
              cleared your hurdle. What next? It is not uncommon to see individuals 
              reverting to a sedentary lifestyle and inactivity the moment they 
              overcome IPPT. It is like getting a huge load off one's back. But, 
              really, all the efforts to build up your fitness would be thoroughly 
              wasted. You will then have to start all over again the next time the 
              IPPT comes up. On the contrary, you should continue to maintain a 
              regular physical exercise regime for as long as you are able to. The 
              physical and health benefits you will reap will be worth the investment.
               You will not only be filled with a bigger zest for life but a happier 
              and healthier person for it. Make Fitness a lifetime pursuit and IPPT 
              your recipe to fitness.<br><br><em>If you have any doubts regarding your medical condition, consult a qualified doctor for advice immediately.</em></span></td>

              <p><span><strong>Q1 What are the safety precautions that I should take note of on the day of my scheduled non-ICT IPPT session?</strong><br>You
               should make sure that you have at least 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep 
              the night before the IPPT. Also, drink as much plain water as you 
              comfortably can, preferably beyond the point of thirst, 2 hours before 
              you sleep on the night before the IPPT, and again not earlier than half 
              an hour before the test. You should avoid having a meal within one hour 
              of the test. In addition, please do not attempt the IPPT if you have a 
              valid medical certificate for the last three days before the day of the 
              test. <br><br><strong>Q2 What do I need to bring along for a non-ICT IPPT Session?</strong><br>Besides
               your PT attire, you will need to bring along your SAF 11B or your NRIC 
              to register for the IPPT session. If you are 35 years and older, you 
              have to bring along your valid FFI certificate for verification if you 
              had attended your medical screening within the past week.<br><br><strong>Q3 What time must I report for IPPT? </strong><br>You
               are to report 15 minutes before the commencement of the non-ICT IPPT 
              session as stipulated in the Booking System confirmation note. This is 
              to facilitate in-processing and completion of the exercise early so that
               all NSmen will be able to finish their IPPT sessions in a reasonable 
              time. <br><strong><br>Q4 Am I covered for injuries sustained during my non-ICT IPPT at FCCs and SAFRA EnergyOne Gyms? </strong><br>Yes.
               For every IPPT session that you attended, you will be in-processed 
              before you can take the test. Once you are in-processed, SAF provides 
              the necessary medical coverage as well as being liable for any injuries 
              as a result of taking part in these sessions. </span></p>
