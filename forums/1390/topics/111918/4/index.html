            <div class='col-md body'>I don't personally buy into the "Malay won't fight Malay" argument 100%.<br><br>That's cuz they have a history of it, smack between the fall of Malacca in 1511 &amp; Raffles's 1819 founding of S'pore. I realized this when I explored through Malaysia's history textbooks, which described the various rivalries even as the S'pore schools glossed over them. They're not a warrior people per se, but it was nevertheless an eye-opener to discover just how bloody some of the conflicts, stretching even into the 19th century when the British adopted their "divide &amp; rule" strategy.<br><br>Granted, today's Southeast Asian loyalties are built of a different political nature. Today's psychological warfare can also pretty sophisticated &amp; professional in nature; you don't really need zealots to radicalize a community anymore (like those as late as in the 1960s).<br><br>I believe the local Malays will answer the call if it was our home &amp; sovereignty that are under threat. Religion, not race per se, is the bigger pull for them; all it takes is a respectable iman to issue a fatwa &amp; they won't fight.</div>

Now only dismounted when the APC reaches the objective.<br><br>FYI, even under hot sun, the troppers still can fall sleep easily.
