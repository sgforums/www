Just take a look at the results of the major examinations. Malays are always at the bottom when the different races are compared.<br><br>Anyway, 99.99% of Malays are Muslims. So, for all intents and purposes, an absolute ban on Malays == absolute ban on Muslims.<br><br>Sure, there are Muslims of other races, but they make up a minority (and Malays already are the minority).<br><br>Whatever the case, the SAF has no excuse for this sort of crap.</div>
