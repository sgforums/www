            <div class='col-md body'>To clear some doubts,<br><br>1) There are Malay pilots and there is one who is a F-16 pilot. Muslim or not, I am not sure but he is a Malay.<br><br>2) According to my Commando friend, Malays are allowed, as in Guards, in Cdo. However, because of the tough life, many got out-of-course. So, statistically speaking, you don't see one wearing red beret.<br><br>3) Guard units have many Malays and the guardsmen are supposed to be elite infantrymen. There are Malays handling ATGM, MG, etc. There was this Capt Sulaiman, who worked in Berita Harian, but was in command of a mobile ATGM platoon (ATGM mounted on Spider vehicle). Remember also that the guardsmen are trained in demolition, heli-ops, etc. In terms of the infantry fieldcrafts and sabotage techniques, the guardsmen are only second to Cdos, and much superior than any armour infantryman.<br><br>Therefore, from the above, I do not think that SAF is discriminating against the Malays. Some units, we must understand, need 100% committment and clear directions when asked to act. The people there cannot even have a slight doubt or even delay when asked to act. It is true that we have significant dealings with the Israelis, especially, armour, as the Israelis are considered the best in terms of armour tactics and technolgy. So, it will be troublesome, IMHO, in some cases to have muslims (not Malay) in the formation.<br><br>I think, the SAF, having the standard Singaporean mentality, is kiasu and kiasee. So, to make sure that there is not even a 0.001% chance of a hiccup, has to install certain manpower policies.<br><br>I believe, all of our NSF, NSmen are patriotic, regardless of race. However, the racial and religious traits of a person, whether Malay or Chinese, cannot be totally removed. When in a critical situation, a slight wavering or delay, may cause the death of his buddy or a failure of a mission.<br><br>We have many Singaporeans who have relatives in the North and South and when one has to face his relative in a conflict, whether Malay or Chinese, it will be a tough decision.<br><br>The worrying trend for us, is the grow of islamic extremism. This wrong and sinful use of religion to justify killings of innocent people may affect our young recruits in the SAF.
