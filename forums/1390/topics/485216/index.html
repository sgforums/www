            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">SINGAPORE - Polytechnic students are likely to start their national service in May or August next year, a month earlier than usual, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen in Parliament yesterday.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">The proposed change, which will affect an annual intake of some 11,000 polytechnic students, is one of 30 recommendations by the Committee to Strengthen National Service (CSNS), which released its report last week.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Their implementation, including enhanced benefits for NSmen, is expected to cost about $4.5 billion over the next decade, Dr Ng said. It is a move that will have a "huge administrative impact" and require "significant investment" from the Defence Ministry, he said. About 24,500 servicemen are enlisted annually.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">"My SAF commanders are sweating over this... Each batch is about five, six, seven thousand, and they're wondering how do we do this."</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">But enlisting these students earlier means they get into the workforce earlier. For those who enlist in September and are bound for local universities at the end of their two years in August, they will no longer need to disrupt their NS, he said, speaking at the debate on the President's Address.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Junior college and Institute of Technical Education students will also benefit from a shorter waiting time, as the Singapore Armed Forces aims to enlist 90 per cent of its incoming recruits in a four-month window, up from 45 per cent now.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">If these suggestions are accepted, they could take effect as early as the middle of next year, said Dr Ng, who chaired the CSNS. Such changes will bring "substantial" benefits to servicemen and Singapore, he noted.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Earlier in his speech, Dr Ng also highlighted the importance of NS to building a credible SAF, since national servicemen form the bulk of the fighting force.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">He observed that Singapore is one of the few countries that has sustained its conscript system - for 47 years, as other states gradually phased them out, due to waning public support or to reap peace dividends. He attributed Singapore's success to the NSmen who had discharged their duties, and high levels of public support.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Despite that, the CSNS pressed on with its work, to ensure that NS remains "responsive and relevant to a new generation of millennial national servicemen".</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">"Better to hear them now and adjust policies, rather than wait and assume previous policies will work even when circumstances have changed," said Dr Ng.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">For instance, family sizes have shrunk, work life is more hectic and more Singaporeans aspire to higher education. "Motivating national servicemen will have to change. Especially when this new generation has no direct experience of our early struggles."</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">He also welcomed positive feedback on the committee's work and explained the rejection of certain suggestions. "For example, priority places in primary schools... if we give priority to all NSmen then nobody gets priority."</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">On the additional benefits the committee recommended, he noted: "The benefits we give must reflect the right values of service... (they) must never dilute the spirit of service - that is for duty, honour and country."</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"> </p>

              <div>
              <p><strong>A Strong NS Training System</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Strengthen the NS training system by employing an
              additional 1,100 Regulars in the SAF, and 230 Regulars in the SPF
              and SCDF, to improve training and inculcate values more
              effectively. These Regulars will be well-versed in the latest
              training methods and technology. They can also better emphasise and
              enforce training safety. As role models, regular trainers will
              provide our servicemen with a better appreciation of why they train
              and what they are defending.</li>
              </ul>

              <div>
              <p><strong>More Opportunities for National Servicemen to
              Contribute</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Increase leadership opportunities for our servicemen
              by raising the proportion of officers and specialists from 30% to
              40%, to meet new operational needs.</li>
              <li>Increase deployment flexibility for NSFs by taking
              into account skills and preferences when deploying servicemen. This
              would maximise the contributions of NSFs, provide them with a
              better NS experience and meet our operational requirements.</li>
              <li>Provide more leadership opportunities and deployment
              options for servicemen in service vocations (i.e. non-combat
              vocations) to enable them to contribute more.</li>
              <li>Enhance the value proposition of NS by accrediting
              skills that NSFs gain during NS, and enhancing the Certificate of
              Service to highlight the competencies and skills gained during
              full-time NS.</li>
              <li>Provide opportunities for NSFs to contribute as SAF,
              SPF and SCDF Regulars on short contracts after they have completed
              their full-time NS. This will enable NSFs to continue to contribute
              to the defence and security of Singapore while honing important
              life skills.</li>
              <li>Provide scholarships to develop talents in engineering
              and science who will be able to contribute to the 3rd Generation
              SAF.</li>
              <li>Expand opportunities for NSmen with relevant civilian
              expertise to contribute to national defence and security in their
              areas of expertise.</li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>The SAF Volunteer Corps</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Establish an SAF Volunteer Corps to enable the broader
              community, especially women, first generation PRs and new citizens,
              to contribute to defence and strengthen support for NS.</li>

              <p><strong>Recognition and Benefits for National
              Servicemen</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Revamp the NS Recognition Award into the NS HOME
              (<span>HO</span>using, <span>M</span>edical and
              <span>E</span>ducation) Awards to support servicemen in
              housing, healthcare and education with an additional Medisave
              component.</li>
              <li>Provide life and personal accident insurance coverage
              for our servicemen, to cover incidents during their full-time NS
              and the period of their ORNS call-ups.</li>
              </ul>
              </div>

              <div>
              <p><strong>Expand Community Support for National
              Servicemen</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Increase recognition for the families of servicemen,
              such as through an extension of the Family Recognition Voucher
              (FRV) scheme. The number of NSmen who are awarded FRVs could be
              increased from the top 10% to the top 30% of ICT performers. The
              quantum for the top 10% can also be increased.</li>
              <li>Introduce small gifts to servicemen at significant
              milestones of their lives, such as marriage or the birth of their
              child. Just as NS has become a part of NSmen’s lives, we care for
              them and celebrate joyous moments in their lives too.</li>
              <li>Restructure the Advisory Council on Community
              Relations in Defence to comprise (i) an Educational Institutions
              Council; (ii) an Employer and Business Council; and (iii) a Family
              and Community Council, to deepen stakeholder engagement.</li>
              <li>Enhance awards for employers and individuals
              supportive of NS. These awards include the “NS Mark” which
              recognises companies with pro-NS policies and human resource
              practices, and could be a factor for consideration when companies
              bid for MINDEF/SAF and Home Team contracts.</li>
              <li>Strengthen National Education efforts through the SAF
              Veterans’ League and Home Team Veterans, to impart core national
              values to the younger generation and boost community support for
              defence and security.</li>
              <li>Expand SAFRA and HomeTeamNS recreational facilities
              for our servicemen and their families.</li>
              <li>Improve community recognition by supporting
              community-led initiatives that recognise servicemen and raise
              public awareness of NS.</li>
              <li>Facilitate NSFs’ transition to employment and further
              studies after they complete full-time NS by expanding the range of
              companies and institutes of higher learning at career fairs.</li>

              <p><strong>A Positive NS Experience: Easing Administrative
              Restrictions</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Partner NSmen to improve their fitness by giving them
              more time and flexibility to meet their Individual Physical
              Proficiency Test (IPPT), IPPT Preparatory Training and Remedial
              Training requirements.</li>
              <li>Increase incentive awards for the attainment of Gold,
              Silver and Pass with Incentive for IPPT, to recognise servicemen
              who put in the extra effort to keep fit.</li>
              <li>Engage schools and educational institutions to help
              pre-enlistees build up their fitness prior to full-time NS.</li>
              <li>Reduce enlistment wait-time for pre-enlistees to
              between four and six months after the completion of post-secondary
              education.</li>
              <li>Work with tertiary institutions to explore ways to
              reduce transition time after full-time NS.</li>
              <li>Change the MINDEF Notification Centre and Home Team
              Overseas Notification Centre requirements, such that notification
              will only need to be given for overseas trips of more than 14 days.
              This will increase convenience for NSmen.</li>
              <li>Implement Make-up Training for high-key ICTs, which
              will allow NSmen to keep pace with their ORNS training cycle.</li>
              <li>Allow NSmen to use electronic devices such as tablets
              and laptops during their ICT, in non-sensitive areas within their
              camps like accommodation blocks and cookhouses. This will help
              NSmen remain connected to their family and work during ICT.</li>

              <p>The debate on the President's Address moved to the theme of
              "Safe and Secure Singapore" on 29 May and Minister for Defence Dr
              Ng Eng Hen shared on the recommendations put forth by the Committee
              to Strengthen National Service (CSNS) and the warm reception they
              have received.</p>
              <p>"Overall, the response has been positive and the Committee is
              thankful for this. Some have said that we struck the right tone, by
              capturing the wide range of sentiments and ideas from the focus
              group participants.</p>
              <p>"Indeed, we reproduced some of their direct feedback in our
              report because we wanted to capture the essence of what they said
              and their main points. The Committee was careful not only to
              recommend actions that were easy to implement," said Dr Ng.</p>
              <p>Some of the Members of Parliament who welcomed the
              recommendations earlier in the week included MP for Sembawang GRC
              Ellen Lee, who said: "The proposed changes show more than due
              consideration towards Singaporeans who defend us and our homes.</p>
              <p>"They are proof that the nation places great priority on
              furthering options that will increase their well-being as well as
              their family's well-being which in turn strengthens their sense of
              belonging to our nation." Ms Lee is a member of the CSNS working
              group which looks into recognition and benefits for NS. The other
              working group looks into boosting support for NS.</p>
              <p>MP for Potong Pasir GRC Sitoh Yih Pin, the newly appointed
              Chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Defence and
              Foreign Affairs also voiced his support earlier this week: "The
              CSNS... is making some very far-reaching proposals that will
              strengthen Singaporeans' support for NS.</p>
              <p>"I am glad that the Government is not content with what it has
              achieved and continues to strive to make NS even more relevant and
              to secure more support and buy-in from not just Singaporeans,
              but... (also) employers and companies that hire Singaporeans."</p>
              <p>If accepted by the Government, the CSNS recommendations will
              bring about substantial recognition to national servicemen, and
              more importantly, boost Singapore's defence. The recommendations
              will cost about $4.5 billion over the next decade to implement.</p>
              <p>One of the recommendations called for 90 percent of all future
              NS cohorts to be enlisted within four months of leaving school. The
              remaining will be enlisted within six months.</p>
              <p>This is a significant commitment from the Singapore Armed Forces
              (SAF), said Dr Ng in Parliament on 29 May. "Such recommendations
              have a huge administrative impact."</p>
              <p>He noted: "If accepted by the Government, this could be
              implemented as early as the middle of next year." Every year, the
              SAF typically calls up NS-liable males in June and September. These
              will be brought forward to May and August, respectively.</p>
              <p>The recommendations also included a call for the SAF to better
              match the skills of enlistees to their eventual vocations. "For the
              first time, we will ask NSFs (Full-time National Servicemen) to
              indicate their preferred vocation," said Dr Ng.</p>
              <p>"This is another headache which my commanders are grappling
              with. Similarly for the SPF (Singapore Police Force) and SCDF
              (Singapore Civil Defence Force)," he said.</p>
              <p>But Dr Ng cautioned: "Any time we give choice to everyone, not
              all will get their first or even second choice."</p>
              <p>He elaborated: "The Committee deliberated this, said even though
              some, not all, will get their first and second choice... this
              should not deter us. Because giving choice will better match
              aptitudes to vocations and allow people who want to contribute in
              areas that they think they have strength in to do so."</p>
              <p>Speaking for the continued importance of NS in Singapore's
              fabric, Dr Ng said: "Singapore remains one of very few countries
              able to sustain an NS system... Others have dismantled their NS
              systems, not because threats disappeared but because public support
              waned.</p>
              <p>"NS support (in Singapore) has been built on the service of
              900,000 national servicemen who have discharged their NS duties.
              Everyone faithfully, dutifully, did his duties."</p>
              <p>Dr Ng also paid tribute to all NSmen. "Here we want to place on
              record the appreciation of this House for all the national
              servicemen who have served, and recognition of their
              contributions."</p>
