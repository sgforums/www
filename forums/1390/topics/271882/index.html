            <div class='col-md body'>yes i agree Ng is qualified to hold an MD position. Yes, he has vast military experience and has been in command of an entire armed force.<br><br>But i doubt that equates to having similar experience to holding a portfolio MD position. Leadership and what not aside, he's now in charge of alot of resources in Temasek. It's a pretty different job from handling soldiers.<br><br>Whilst i would agree he should be able to suceed given his track record, it's still uncomfortable to see an man once in green now holding meetings in a suit and talking about investments, profits and the likes.<br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Funny, but I interpreted it as generally an upbeat press conference. The $12.8b benchmark, from 2006, was a historical high -- that one was obtained off a massive 71% rise in profits in the preceding 12 months. The latest profit number, $9.1b, remains the second-highest in Temasek's history. Methinks it's too harsh to describe the 29% dropoff year-on-year as a "slump", lah.<br><br>As for the Shin Corp stake, give it a year. The main culprit appears to be its Shin Satellite business, which'd suffered a net loss for the first time since 1997 (partly blamed on a malfunctioning satellite) but is expected to rebound into profits again.<br><br>Ng Yat Chung also not the Big Bossman here. S. Danabalan is, so it's his head which is on the guillotine. (As if that will ever happen ~lol~)</div>
