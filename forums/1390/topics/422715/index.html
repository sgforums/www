I have the below mentioned problems and wonder if they could give me down pes / excuse:<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">1. I have hurt my left knee before till the event I walk in crutches. But it has healed now already. I could run normally without feeling the pain.. but after long route marches, I still will feel my left knee hurting a bit.<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">2. My left shoulder will hurt sometimes.. after I carried heavy loads. Sometimes it will hurt a lot.. but sometimes it is alright.. When it is hurting.. when i'm pulling my locker door open, I could feel sharp pain at my shoulder area. <br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">3. I got frequent leg cramps (9 out of 10 times) whenever I stand up after sitting down for more than 30 seconds.. so i could not run immediately after i stood up. <br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">4. I sweat a lot.. just putting on SBO.. I could start sweating already.. and sometimes when I'm nervous standing at the parade square.. i start to sweat already... it really feel uncomfortable. <br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">5. I have fell down landing on my left chest (heart area) when i was a kid. So sometimes I could feel my heart area cramp.. And.. just by looking at my left chest, you could see the area moving (due to my heart beats). <br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">I really wonder if i got down pes / get excuse due to these problems.. and anyone know if there are any consequences if i tell the MO of any problems (such as my heart feeling uncomfortable) but later after the medical examination, it shows no problems.. will i go DB then? haiz.... sianz........ sho moody. <img class="inlineimg" style="font-size: 9px; color: #999999; vertical-align: middle; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: initial none initial;" title="Frown" src="http://www.hardwarezone.com.sg/img/forums/hwz/smilies/frown.gif;pva7c53785704671aa" border="0" alt=""><img class="inlineimg" style="font-size: 9px; color: #999999; vertical-align: middle; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: initial none initial;" title="Frown" src="http://www.hardwarezone.com.sg/img/forums/hwz/smilies/frown.gif;pva7c53785704671aa" border="0" alt=""><img class="inlineimg" style="font-size: 9px; color: #999999; vertical-align: middle; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: initial none initial;" title="Frown" src="http://www.hardwarezone.com.sg/img/forums/hwz/smilies/frown.gif;pva7c53785704671aa" border="0" alt=""></span></p></div>

              <p>You should see a specialist first instead of MO if you want. I'm going NS soon and I heard scary stories from a friend about MOs. This is making me so worried too, especially when I have symptoms all these years now and fear of seeing a specialist. I'm trying to build up courage to see specialists for my symptoms before NS.I hope that the stories I heard were not true.</p>
              <p>Health is not a joking matter.</p>
              <p>One can't be judgemental just because the person who's complaining of symptoms is going through NS.</p>
              <p>Threadstarter symptoms sounds more like normal to me. However, if you experienced injuries in the past and have the pain now, it's better for you to go checkup, just in case. It's your safety and health. I have a friend who was cured from knee injury too. He thought all these years his knee was okay. It was until he started basketball and his knee felt strange. He thought it was all in his mind so he didn't care. After sometimes, his knee felt very painful until can't walk. He is having permanent injury now because of the bone damage. He can't play basketball anymore.</p>

              <p>The advice is if you have problem, see a specialist first and get certifed before going for medical checkup in CMPB.</p>
              <p>Never wait for an injury to happen then you start to downgrade during NS. The posting and re-posting creates extra adminstration work for every1 and every1 hates you after that. </p>
