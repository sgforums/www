            <div class='col-md body'>Well. seriously .. i would think that you are whinning too much. I suppose you are one of the many personnels who are PEs C and below? I think why not just stay-in in camp? Then you will never be late b4 730am. But if you choose to stay out, then please suck it up and bear with the consequences of possibly being late. Thats just too bad for you.<br><br>With respect to the sentry duty, i think it is high time the personnel in ur admin camp take up the duties. Common, you are already in such a slack pes medical status, no IPPT to do, No outfield training missions.. . Common, what is.. Sentry duty to you peeps? somemore you are just holding batons and shield. And you people have no rights to ask pp from another camp to slog and do sentry duties for your admin camp.<br><br>Stop disgracing yourself and BE a MAn.( or whatever thats left of you.) I have personally seen PES C and below friends upholding their duty (be it clerical or sentry duties) dutifully, without complains and all because they are aware that they are already one of the priviledged few ; to be able to go home after 530pm, no IPPT, no outfielding training , no Harsh military exercises.<br><br>So please.. stop whinning.<br><br></div>

With regards to the duty personnel issue, it is a classified matter to discuss allocation of manpower within the formation.<br><br>Secondly, certain units forbid their men to stay-in due to operational or infrastructural constraints.<br><br>I think you should avoid personal attacks. It does not serve any purpose.</div>
