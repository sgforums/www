            <div class='col-md body'>Well it sucks to be you, but I hope you'd look on the bright side of things.<br><br>Are you PES C/E? If you are E then look forward to no reservist.<br>Long trip to camp? Well think of combat people sweating it out doing 5BX.<br>Late sign 5 extras? ...ok that's pretty bad. Although reassure yourself that imbecilic C/RSMs are a dime a dozen in SAF.<br>Sentry duty? If I see correctly you only have to cover the sentries and do ops clerk duty right? Ok that's pretty bad too...are your superiors and duty officers overly nitpicky and extra-happy? If not almost half your problem is gone.<br>Hmm...how bad is your health problem that caused your downgrade? Does it prevent you from carrying out your duties properly?<br><br>I'm not accusing you of whining here, just suggesting that you should look at the bright side of things. Whenever things get bad, just compare yourself to guards/commandos. You should feel slightly better after that.</div>

And even scheduled the Warrant Officers and Officers to conduct the warm ups. Of course the NSFs and Officers aren't happy about it, because they have to come as early as 7:30 AM everyday. Not that I am complaining about that but the worse is yet to come...<br><br>So one fine day, during the Life Activity, as usual a few people would be late or reach on the dot, but on that freaking day, the RSM as usual decided to make trouble for us by making those late on that day sign 5 extras.<br><br>So from that day onwards... we have to sign 5 extras ( Isn't that freaking harsh? ) whenever we are late, regardless of rain or emergency ( If got emergency, the CSM say take Urgent leave... ) and considering that some of us live on the other side of Singapore... there's pretty much a high chance of being late.<br><br>FINE... I am not complaining, even though I DO LIVE on the other side of Singapore from my Camp. And already leave home at 6:15 AM everyday and only managed to reach on the dot everyday. And there's this Warrant Officer living in the same area as me, but guess what? If I ever see her on the train, I know I will be late for sure, but for her, she reaches early or just on time, cause they freaking make the NSFs fall in earlier.<br><br>And then the freaking CSM decided to act smart and use the directive again. He asked us to print a copy of the Medical Directive on Reporting Sick outside. The directive says something like you need to inform your superior if you want to report sick outside on the day. So the freaking CSM, either misinterpreted the directive or wanted to make our lives difficult.<br><br>So he told us to write on the R.O... "All NSFs are to request from the CSM's permission if they want to report sick outside before 7 AM." And he happily told us he follow directive one... But upon reading the directive it says nothing like this. But seriously, we don't give a damn, because our DIRECT superiors are Captains and Majors, we would rather request permission from them first, which they will grant us more likely than the CSM will, then only INFORM the CSM that we are reporting sick outside and our Captain has already given approval, and there's nothing he can do about it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But the worse is yet to come... our Camp currently utilises Sentry people from other Camps, since we are an admin Camp, where most of the people are PES C and E, and only fo Ops Duty. But recently, the Camp providing us with Sentry people claim that they are short of manpower and will not be providing us with anymore people, so that we have to do ourselves.<br><br>So many of us, being not Weapon trained will be holding the Baton and Shield doing Sentry. And the best thing is our Camp has only about 20 or so NSFs... so after deducting the personnel to do Sentry... we have only FOUR Ops Duty Clerk left, and 1 is going to ORD soon... However, we have 2 Divisions in our Camp, the other Division has about 10 Ops Duty Clerk, but I don't know if they will sent anyone for Sentry Duty...<br><br>So now its don't know 1 month must do how many Ops Duty... and the possibility of getting extra is much much higher. Not to mention, all of the NSFs are admin personnel in our Camp, with the inclusion of Sentry Duty, more Ops Duty and more Extras... how are they going to further cope with their admin work. This is not a Combat Unit where you just train and train, we need concentration to do our work.<br><br>Our Camp just turned from Heaven to Hell...<br><br>Fine, scold me for whining now.</div></blockquote>Firstly, if SAF camp's life is heaven.......SG will be in serious trouble if war comes around!! ..hmmm.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Secondly, with MRT and improved bus systems, I dun see how you can be late, eventhough you may be living on the other side of the island! During my NSF days, I too was living in the East.....my camp was at SAFTI.....on the other side of the Island.  There wasn't any MRT system during my time [70s' period]. I had to take the unrealible bus system. Had to change 2 buses to get to SAFTI, but still managed to be on time.<br><br>I believe it's about how you manage time.....if you can't manage time.....you will always report late......and kena extra duties. NO fault of the RSM or SAF.<br><br>If leaving home at 6.15am makes you report late....than why dun you catch the first bus between 5.15am-5.45am [depending on which bus you take] and  than the 1st or 2nd train??<br><br>Anyway, if you have problem with time management, you will always be late....no matter if it is in the SAF or Civilian life......AND no matter if it's near your home or on the other side of the island....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

We do not need MES and S&amp;T to start having a 'fight' in here. We all belong to CSSCOM so just try to work together and not fight among each other...<br><br>AYC and GC both lack guards, AYC has 1AMB and OETI but that still doesn't mean they have enough manpower to supply guards for both camps while GC just has the 2 HQ blocks. Both side are not high on manpower so just bear with it. Arguing here will not make you 2 do any less duty.</div>

If you are prepared to do it then you shouldn't be complaining yourself. He feels its unfair cos his PES status does not require guard duty to be done but due to lack of manpower he almost had to. For PES A/B/C, guard duty is normal and regimental so theres nothing to complain or compare about. If you were in the same situation as him then rather than opposing him, i would thought you would be on the same line as him.</div>
