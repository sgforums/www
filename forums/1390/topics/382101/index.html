              <p>best is dont come back....</p>
              <p>if not you go DB.. you get to shave botak... then you are cramped in those cells with other offenders. Then you can see the outside world, because the windows are all shut and blocked. You wake up early to do PT, and you will have a low life.</p>
              <p>If you do anything funny inside, they lock you up alone in a dark cell, that has no windows and only a door, they will only give you a potty, no proper toilet. You sleep in that cell. Each day you are only allowed to come out for 20 minutes to empty the potty, other than that you stay in the dark cell. Morning will be damn hot, night will be damn cold.</p>
              <p>DB though is not a real prison, but then its not a very nice experience.</p>
              <p>But if you go DB, when you come out, please remember to go to Yew Tee central there and buy a piece of their delicious Waffle!!!</p>

              <p>U are supposed to request for an exit permit from MINDEF before you left Singapore for anything longer than 6 months to informed MINDEF that you will not be around. Without an exit permit, leaving the country and missing ICT is considered AWOL.</p>
              <p>Call up MINDEF and see what they say since the type of punishment you will receive is not for us to say.</p>

              <p>ya and depending on individual unit CO...</p>
              <p>some 'nice' might ask the MPC to backdate the sentence to the day where he's arrested and thrown in eg. if mr x is arrested on dec 1 and the unit co metes out the sentence on 9 dec, mr x's co will tell the MPC to start the sentence on 1 dec.</p>
              <p>some lagi 'nice' one might just give you few days(even if u AWOL for one year) provided u did not give ya unit ''large anount of headches'' prior to commitment of offence. but the catch is you still have to serve up the period of days that u have AWOL-ed that is.</p>
              <p>some knnccb ones will as opposed to first pointer, ask the MPC to set the start date of sentence ON THAT DAY ITSELF.</p>
              <p>* oh another thing, before the unit CO come mete out ya sentence, your company OC come days before hand to tell you the charge and ask whether you wanna plead guilty. just plead guilty  if you dun want the sentencing date to drag further...</p>

              <p>My reservist unit got different punishment/treatment for such AWOL case...<br>one guy stay in Singapore and did not report for ICT. Then he got call from the clerk/sergeant  and turn up in camp the next day. got charged and send to DB for 5 days....</p>
              <p>Another guy did not attend any ICT right from the 1st year till 6th year ICT. But then he suddenly turn up at 7th Year High Key ICT, in civilian clothes and without any full pack items/equipment/uniform etc...  He did not get charge in this case... and the reason he give is that he have been staying in malaysia for the past few years settling family problems/financial problem... he was given some credit to buy one set of uniform /PT Kit and manage to stay in camp for first week (actually it is from wed to friday) and then he outprocessed...amazing why he didnt get charged at all.</p>

              <p>Regardless whether u have decided ur dates, its best to ask. Maybe after asking, u don't even want come back...</p>
              <p>Come back when is unlikely to change anything so u might as well settle with them rather than u ask here and people can only offer suggestion but u cannot tell MINDEF forum ppl say this n that de etc if people here tell u won't get caught yet u get caught etc.</p>

              <p>Is that your first ICT?Did you have a good reason for staying overseas for two yrs,prepare a good reason before calling,most likely just say work committment or family issues.</p>
              <p>Don't worry,remember something, Singapore is a "fine "city,if you are rich,you can even consult a lawyer before coming back to SG,he/she should help you find a nice and good reason :)</p>

              <p>I don't really think they will arrested you at airport,you think you are terrorist?or some criminal? LOL</p>
              <p>Your main mistake is that you forgot to apply your Stupid exit permit and you don't even bother to call up.Think they just detain you and ask you to report to CMPB or whatever places maybe kranji to face your charge,who know nothing might happened at all.</p>
