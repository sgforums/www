              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Military Justice System in the
                  SAF</span></span></strong><br> <br> 1. Overview<br> The military justice system in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is
                  expected to treat every service personnel fairly and equally,
                  regardless of race, rank or vocation.</p>
              <p> <br> 2. Multi-levelled Approach</p>
              <p>The military justice system is based on the SAF Act, which was
                  implemented in 1972. All servicemen are subjected to the SAF Act,
                  SAF Regulations, and orders of whatever form issued pursuant to
                  them.</p>
              <p>While discipline is paramount in the military, not all offences
                  committed by SAF servicemen are dealt with by formal investigations
                  and charges. Essentially, offenders can be dealt with either by way
                  of informal or formal punishment systems.</p>
              <p> <br> 3. Informal Punishment System<br> Commanders are empowered to mete out informal punishments like
                  push-ups and weekend confinement to servicemen who have committed
                  disciplinary breaches, like being late, sluggish, or improperly
                  dressed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Formal Punishment System<br> If the offence that a serviceman committed is of a more serious
                  nature, he may be formally dealt with by his disciplinary officer
                  by way of a summary trial, or brought before a subordinate military
                  court (more commonly known as the General Court Martial or
                  GCM).</p>
              <p>(a) Summary Trial</p>
              <p>The offences that can be dealt with by summary trial are
                  essentially military offences, such as absence without leave
                  (AWOL), non-compliance with lawful orders or insubordination.</p>
              <p>Depending on the rank of the serviceman in question, and the
                  type of the disciplinary body hearing the case, the possible
                  sentences that may be imposed can vary, and these can include fines
                  or detention.</p>
              <p>The summary trial is carried out in accordance with relevant SAF
                  regulations, and the records of the summary trial are sent to the
                  office of the Director, Legal Services of the SAF.</p>
              <p>(b) General Court Martial</p>
              <p>The General Court Martial exists as a separate forum from that
                  of the summary trial. Unlike the summary trial, the GCM can deal
                  with a wider range of offences, and can impose a wider range of
                  punishments including imprisonment and discharge, on top of
                  sentences like detention and fines. The GCM is also a more public
                  and open forum, and its proceedings are conducted using similar
                  legal rules and procedures as those used in a civil criminal
                  court.</p>
              <p>Generally, only serious offences investigated by the Military
                  Police Command, and which are referred to the office of the
                  Director of Legal Services, will result in the accused serviceman
                  being charged in a GCM. In such a case, a military prosecutor will
                  draw up a formal charge sheet and present it before the GCM.</p>
              <p>General Courts Martial can be further sub-divided into two
                  categories, namely the Panel Courts Martial - consisting of a
                  President and usually two other members, and Judge Courts Martial -
                  consisting of a single President only.</p>
              <p>Currently, the practice is for military offences to be heard by
                  Panel Courts Martial, while civil offences like misuse of drugs and
                  penal code offences may be dealt with by a Judge Court Martial.</p>
              <p><br> The current policy is also for an NSman, who is or was a District
                  Judge in the Subordinate Courts, to preside in a GCM. There are
                  currently 10 NSmen who have been appointed by the Armed Forces
                  Council to perform duty as President of a court martial. They are
                  rostered by the Registrar of the Subordinate Military Court to hear
                  cases during their in-camp training. In the case of a Panel Court
                  Martial, the other two members are rostered from among some 155
                  military officers appointed by the Chief of Defence Force.</p>
              <p> <br> 5. Ways to Seek Redress</p>
              <p>There are numerous safeguards and avenues set out in the
                  military justice system for an SAF serviceman to seek redress if he
                  is unhappy about the punishment imposed on him.</p>
              <p>Generally, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with an informal
                  punishment meted out to him may request a higher level commander to
                  review the punishment, or request for formal disciplinary
                  dealing.</p>
              <p>In the case of a summary trial, a serviceman brought before the
                  disciplinary officer may elect instead to be tried by a court
                  martial. Alternatively, an aggrieved serviceman may request that
                  his conviction or punishment imposed at the summary trial be
                  reviewed by MINDEF's Director Manpower (a delegated authority of
                  the Armed Forces Council).</p>
              <p>In the case of a GCM, a serviceman may choose to be represented
                  by a lawyer or an SAF defending officer if his case will be heard
                  by a court martial. The SAF has about 200 trained defending
                  officers. While an SAF defending officer comes free to the
                  serviceman, he has to bear the cost of engaging a lawyer. At the
                  end of the trial, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with the
                  decision of the court martial may petition the Reviewing Authority
                  (the AFC or a committee of its members) for a review of his case.
                  The serviceman can also appeal to the Military Court of Appeal
                  (MCA) for a reconsideration of his conviction, or his sentence, or
                  both.</p>
              <p>The MCA, when convened to hear an appeal, sits as a panel of
                  five members. Heading the MCA is a President, who is appointed by
                  the Chief Justice. By law, he must be a person qualified to be a
                  Judge of the Supreme Court. The current President of the MCA is
                  Justice Choo Han Teck. Four other members - two civilian members
                  who are qualified legal practitioners with at least five years
                  experience each, and two senior military officers - make up the
                  rest of the MCA. The MCA is the highest court in the military
                  justice system.</p>
              <p> <br> 6. Impartial Hearings<br> It is important to recognise that the GCM and the MCA are tribunals
                  headed by presidents who are outside the SAF chain of command.</p>
              <p>Being an "outsider", the president of these forums will hear the
                  case impartially like any other civil criminal case. The
                  proceedings in the GCM and the MCA are also heard in a public
                  forum, and these military courts adopt many of the same legal
                  procedures and safeguards as that used in the civil criminal
                  courts. All servicemen formally charged with an offence can bring
                  their case to these forums.</p>

              <p><strong>Singapore Armed Forces Military Police
                  Command</strong><br> (SAFMPC/ æ–°åŠ å�¡æ­¦è£…éƒ¨é˜Ÿå®ªå…µå�¸ä»¤éƒ¨)</p>
              <p>The formation is headed by the Command Headquarters which
                  oversees its daily operations, and supported by four units
                  specialising in the various specific operational responsibilities
                  of the SAF MPC.</p>
              <p>The four units are:</p>
              <p><strong>Military Police Enforcement Unit (MPEU):</strong> The
                  unit consists of the Law Enforcement and Ceremonial Company (LECC),
                  the Security Operation Unit (SOU) and the Special Security and
                  Protection (SSP) Branch. It is the active wing of the SAF MPC and
                  executes most of the operational and ceremonial duties and roles
                  carried out by the SAF MPC.</p>
              <p>The LECC was formed by combining the former Active Provost
                  Company (APC) and the former Zone Provost Company (ZPC). Its duties
                  include most of the important ceremonial duties required within the
                  SAF as previously handled by the APC, and a traffic platoon which
                  ensures the compliance of traffic regulations by military personnel
                  on the road as well as performing escort duties. It also performs
                  regular raids for contraband and/or miscreants on various camps of
                  the SAF as was conducted by the ZPC. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Enforcement
                  Platoon (also known as Platoon 2) performs regular operations in
                  residential areas, workplaces, and many public places such as
                  shopping centres, clubs and eating outlets to apprehend <a title="Deserter" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deserter">deserters</a>, <a title="AWOL" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWOL">AWOL</a> offenders, drug addicts and other military
                  criminals.</span> They work closely with the Singapore Police Force
                  and are often in very dangerous situations and are extremely well
                  trained for handling the varied scenarios that they find themselves
                  in. This is also the platoon that enforces the public image of the
                  SAF by booking offenders who smoke in uniform and commit other
                  offences in uniform while in the eye of the public.</em></span> It
                  is worth noting that they perform undercover security operations
                  for high-key events like the National Day Parade and the Youth
                  Olympic Games. The security of Mowbray Station is overseen by a
                  platoon who is also in charge of registering and detaining suspects
                  and offenders of military crimes in holding cells. The station is
                  similar to a civilian police station and it is usually the first
                  stop for detainees before their transfer to the detention barracks
                  after conviction in military courts, or a temporary holding cell
                  for servicemen placed under Closed Arrest. The investigative branch
                  for the SAF, the Special Investigation Branch (SIB) investigates
                  higher-order military crimes that requires specialised handling.
                  Since 31 December 8, MPEU has heralded the inclusion of a new
                  branch within its ranks. The Security Support and Protection (SSP)
                  Branch is involved in sensitive operations so no further
                  information is available.</p>
              <p><strong>SAF Detention Barracks (SAFDB):</strong> Headed by a
                  commandant, DB consists of MPs in charge of supervision of
                  detainees of the SAF who have been convicted in military
                  courts.</p>
              <p><strong>Military Police Training School (MPTS):</strong> Formerly known as the School of Provost, MPTS is in charge of
                  equipping trainees with necessary and fundamental military policing
                  skills as well as instilling in them a high standard of discipline
                  through the vocational courses and specialised courses such as the
                  Silent Precision Drill Courses. MPTS also legislation courses for
                  senior commanders all over the SAF. In addition, the SAF Military
                  Working Dog Unit is a wing under MPTS and it is in charge of all
                  dog training and doctrine matters of the SAF.</p>
              <p><strong>SAF MP Command Head Quarters (HQ):</strong> The Head
                  Quarters of the Command comprises various branches, namely the
                  Human Resource (HR), Intelligences and Security Branch (ISB),
                  General Staff Branch (GS), the Special Investigation Branch (SIB)
                  and Logistic Branch. Each branch is headed by a branch head who
                  serves concurrently as the Command's Manpower, Intelligence, Ops
                  and Training and Logistics Officer.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Military Justice System in the
                  SAF</span></span></strong><br> <br> 1. Overview<br> The military justice system in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is
                  expected to treat every service personnel fairly and equally,
                  regardless of race, rank or vocation.</p>
              <p> <br> 2. Multi-levelled Approach</p>
              <p>The military justice system is based on the SAF Act, which was
                  implemented in 1972. All servicemen are subjected to the SAF Act,
                  SAF Regulations, and orders of whatever form issued pursuant to
                  them.</p>
              <p>While discipline is paramount in the military, not all offences
                  committed by SAF servicemen are dealt with by formal investigations
                  and charges. Essentially, offenders can be dealt with either by way
                  of informal or formal punishment systems.</p>
              <p> <br> 3. Informal Punishment System<br> Commanders are empowered to mete out informal punishments like
                  push-ups and weekend confinement to servicemen who have committed
                  disciplinary breaches, like being late, sluggish, or improperly
                  dressed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Formal Punishment System<br> If the offence that a serviceman committed is of a more serious
                  nature, he may be formally dealt with by his disciplinary officer
                  by way of a summary trial, or brought before a subordinate military
                  court (more commonly known as the General Court Martial or
                  GCM).</p>
              <p>(a) Summary Trial</p>
              <p>The offences that can be dealt with by summary trial are
                  essentially military offences, such as absence without leave
                  (AWOL), non-compliance with lawful orders or insubordination.</p>
              <p>Depending on the rank of the serviceman in question, and the
                  type of the disciplinary body hearing the case, the possible
                  sentences that may be imposed can vary, and these can include fines
                  or detention.</p>
              <p>The summary trial is carried out in accordance with relevant SAF
                  regulations, and the records of the summary trial are sent to the
                  office of the Director, Legal Services of the SAF.</p>
              <p>(b) General Court Martial</p>
              <p>The General Court Martial exists as a separate forum from that
                  of the summary trial. Unlike the summary trial, the GCM can deal
                  with a wider range of offences, and can impose a wider range of
                  punishments including imprisonment and discharge, on top of
                  sentences like detention and fines. The GCM is also a more public
                  and open forum, and its proceedings are conducted using similar
                  legal rules and procedures as those used in a civil criminal
                  court.</p>
              <p>Generally, only serious offences investigated by the Military
                  Police Command, and which are referred to the office of the
                  Director of Legal Services, will result in the accused serviceman
                  being charged in a GCM. In such a case, a military prosecutor will
                  draw up a formal charge sheet and present it before the GCM.</p>
              <p>General Courts Martial can be further sub-divided into two
                  categories, namely the Panel Courts Martial - consisting of a
                  President and usually two other members, and Judge Courts Martial -
                  consisting of a single President only.</p>
              <p>Currently, the practice is for military offences to be heard by
                  Panel Courts Martial, while civil offences like misuse of drugs and
                  penal code offences may be dealt with by a Judge Court Martial.</p>
              <p><br> The current policy is also for an NSman, who is or was a District
                  Judge in the Subordinate Courts, to preside in a GCM. There are
                  currently 10 NSmen who have been appointed by the Armed Forces
                  Council to perform duty as President of a court martial. They are
                  rostered by the Registrar of the Subordinate Military Court to hear
                  cases during their in-camp training. In the case of a Panel Court
                  Martial, the other two members are rostered from among some 155
                  military officers appointed by the Chief of Defence Force.</p>
              <p> <br> 5. Ways to Seek Redress</p>
              <p>There are numerous safeguards and avenues set out in the
                  military justice system for an SAF serviceman to seek redress if he
                  is unhappy about the punishment imposed on him.</p>
              <p>Generally, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with an informal
                  punishment meted out to him may request a higher level commander to
                  review the punishment, or request for formal disciplinary
                  dealing.</p>
              <p>In the case of a summary trial, a serviceman brought before the
                  disciplinary officer may elect instead to be tried by a court
                  martial. Alternatively, an aggrieved serviceman may request that
                  his conviction or punishment imposed at the summary trial be
                  reviewed by MINDEF's Director Manpower (a delegated authority of
                  the Armed Forces Council).</p>
              <p>In the case of a GCM, a serviceman may choose to be represented
                  by a lawyer or an SAF defending officer if his case will be heard
                  by a court martial. The SAF has about 200 trained defending
                  officers. While an SAF defending officer comes free to the
                  serviceman, he has to bear the cost of engaging a lawyer. At the
                  end of the trial, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with the
                  decision of the court martial may petition the Reviewing Authority
                  (the AFC or a committee of its members) for a review of his case.
                  The serviceman can also appeal to the Military Court of Appeal
                  (MCA) for a reconsideration of his conviction, or his sentence, or
                  both.</p>
              <p>The MCA, when convened to hear an appeal, sits as a panel of
                  five members. Heading the MCA is a President, who is appointed by
                  the Chief Justice. By law, he must be a person qualified to be a
                  Judge of the Supreme Court. The current President of the MCA is
                  Justice Choo Han Teck. Four other members - two civilian members
                  who are qualified legal practitioners with at least five years
                  experience each, and two senior military officers - make up the
                  rest of the MCA. The MCA is the highest court in the military
                  justice system.</p>
              <p> <br> 6. Impartial Hearings<br> It is important to recognise that the GCM and the MCA are tribunals
                  headed by presidents who are outside the SAF chain of command.</p>
              <p>Being an "outsider", the president of these forums will hear the
                  case impartially like any other civil criminal case. The
                  proceedings in the GCM and the MCA are also heard in a public
                  forum, and these military courts adopt many of the same legal
                  procedures and safeguards as that used in the civil criminal
                  courts. All servicemen formally charged with an offence can bring
                  their case to these forums.</p>

              <p><strong>Singapore Armed Forces Military Police
                  Command</strong><br> (SAFMPC/ æ–°åŠ å�¡æ­¦è£…éƒ¨é˜Ÿå®ªå…µå�¸ä»¤éƒ¨)</p>
              <p>The formation is headed by the Command Headquarters which
                  oversees its daily operations, and supported by four units
                  specialising in the various specific operational responsibilities
                  of the SAF MPC.</p>
              <p>The four units are:</p>
              <p><strong>Military Police Enforcement Unit (MPEU):</strong> The
                  unit consists of the Law Enforcement and Ceremonial Company (LECC),
                  the Security Operation Unit (SOU) and the Special Security and
                  Protection (SSP) Branch. It is the active wing of the SAF MPC and
                  executes most of the operational and ceremonial duties and roles
                  carried out by the SAF MPC.</p>
              <p>The LECC was formed by combining the former Active Provost
                  Company (APC) and the former Zone Provost Company (ZPC). Its duties
                  include most of the important ceremonial duties required within the
                  SAF as previously handled by the APC, and a traffic platoon which
                  ensures the compliance of traffic regulations by military personnel
                  on the road as well as performing escort duties. It also performs
                  regular raids for contraband and/or miscreants on various camps of
                  the SAF as was conducted by the ZPC. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Enforcement
                  Platoon (also known as Platoon 2) performs regular operations in
                  residential areas, workplaces, and many public places such as
                  shopping centres, clubs and eating outlets to apprehend <a title="Deserter" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deserter">deserters</a>, <a title="AWOL" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWOL">AWOL</a> offenders, drug addicts and other military
                  criminals.</span> They work closely with the Singapore Police Force
                  and are often in very dangerous situations and are extremely well
                  trained for handling the varied scenarios that they find themselves
                  in. This is also the platoon that enforces the public image of the
                  SAF by booking offenders who smoke in uniform and commit other
                  offences in uniform while in the eye of the public.</em></span> It
                  is worth noting that they perform undercover security operations
                  for high-key events like the National Day Parade and the Youth
                  Olympic Games. The security of Mowbray Station is overseen by a
                  platoon who is also in charge of registering and detaining suspects
                  and offenders of military crimes in holding cells. The station is
                  similar to a civilian police station and it is usually the first
                  stop for detainees before their transfer to the detention barracks
                  after conviction in military courts, or a temporary holding cell
                  for servicemen placed under Closed Arrest. The investigative branch
                  for the SAF, the Special Investigation Branch (SIB) investigates
                  higher-order military crimes that requires specialised handling.
                  Since 31 December 8, MPEU has heralded the inclusion of a new
                  branch within its ranks. The Security Support and Protection (SSP)
                  Branch is involved in sensitive operations so no further
                  information is available.</p>
              <p><strong>SAF Detention Barracks (SAFDB):</strong> Headed by a
                  commandant, DB consists of MPs in charge of supervision of
                  detainees of the SAF who have been convicted in military
                  courts.</p>
              <p><strong>Military Police Training School (MPTS):</strong> Formerly known as the School of Provost, MPTS is in charge of
                  equipping trainees with necessary and fundamental military policing
                  skills as well as instilling in them a high standard of discipline
                  through the vocational courses and specialised courses such as the
                  Silent Precision Drill Courses. MPTS also legislation courses for
                  senior commanders all over the SAF. In addition, the SAF Military
                  Working Dog Unit is a wing under MPTS and it is in charge of all
                  dog training and doctrine matters of the SAF.</p>
              <p><strong>SAF MP Command Head Quarters (HQ):</strong> The Head
                  Quarters of the Command comprises various branches, namely the
                  Human Resource (HR), Intelligences and Security Branch (ISB),
                  General Staff Branch (GS), the Special Investigation Branch (SIB)
                  and Logistic Branch. Each branch is headed by a branch head who
                  serves concurrently as the Command's Manpower, Intelligence, Ops
                  and Training and Logistics Officer.</p>

              Control Measures for Pre-Enlistees</span></em></h2>
              <p><strong>Q1. Why must MINDEF impose exit controls on NS-liable
              males?<br> <br></strong> Exit controls are necessary to ensure that
              NS-liable males who have gone overseas to study or reside at a
              young age return to fulfil their NS responsibilities.</p>

              <div>
              <div>
              <p><strong>Q2. Why can't MINDEF exempt young males aged 13 to 16½
              from exit controls?<br> <br></strong>Exit control measures have to be applied at a
              reasonably younger age so that they could be effective to prevent
              those who leave at a younger age defaulting on their NS
              responsibilities</p>
              </div>

              <div>
              <div>
              <p><strong>Q3. Why has MINDEF decided to shift the starting age for
              exit controls from age 11 to 13?<br> <br></strong>Currently, the starting age of exit controls is
              pegged at age 11, the age where Singaporeans used to be issued with
              NRICs. With Singaporeans now being issued NRICs at age 15, there is
              no longer a special reason to retain age 11 as the starting age for
              exit controls. MINDEF has therefore decided to set it at age 13,
              which is when students would have just started their secondary
              school education.</p>

              <div>
              <p><strong>Q4. Why is MINDEF removing passport controls?<br> <br></strong>With the introduction of the non-extendable
              Singapore Biometric passport, a continuation of passport controls
              for young males would mean that they will have to pay for a new
              biometric passport upon expiry each time. This will result in
              greater inconvenience and higher cost for young males and their
              families. MINDEF has therefore decided to remove passport
              controls.</p>

              <p><strong>Q5. Will young males holding non-biometric Singapore
              passport be given full validity?<br> <br></strong>Those holding non-biometric Singapore Passports will
              also have their passports extended for the full duration of 5 or 10
              years. This is however subject to the remaining lifespan of the
              passport.</p>

              <div>
              <p><strong>Q6. Why does MINDEF require young males to apply for an
              exit permit?<br> <br></strong>With the removal of passport controls, it is
              necessary for MINDEF to extend exit permit requirements (which
              currently affect only NS-liable males aged 16½ and above) to males
              aged 13 and above in order to ensure that young males who go
              overseas return to serve NS. However, to avoid inconveniencing
              those who make short overseas trips during vacations, exit permits
              will only be required for overseas trips of 3 months or more.</p>

              <div>
              <div>
              <p><strong>Q7. Will young males who require exit permits be
              required to furnish a bond?<br> <br></strong>Young males aged 13 to 16½ will only be required to
              furnish a bond if they require an exit permit of 2 years or more.
              This arrangement is similar to the current practice where only
              young males who require a passport validity of more than 2 years
              are required to furnish a bond.<br> <br> Males aged 16½ to enlistment are approaching the age of enlistment.
              They are therefore subject to more stringent exit controls to deter
              potential NS defaulters. The current practice of requiring such
              males to furnish a bond if they require an exit permit of 3 months
              or more will continue.</p>

              <p><strong>Q8. Will young males aged 13 to 16½ who fail to apply
              for an exit permit be sentenced to imprisonment?<br> <br></strong>The penalty regime for exit permit offences of young
              males aged 13 to 16½ will be a fine of up to $2,000, with no
              custodial sentences. They will however be subject to harsher
              penalties should they continue to be in breach of the Enlistment
              Act after that age 16½.<br> <br> Males above 16½ years who travel and remain overseas without
              applying for an exit permit will be prosecuted under the Enlistment
              Act. They will be liable upon conviction to a fine of up to $10,000
              or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or both.</p>

              <div>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Q9. How will MINDEF deal with young males who do not
              understand their obligations under the Enlistment Act or those who
              have parents/guardians who deliberately encourage them to be in
              breach of the Enlistment Act?</span><br> <br></strong>MINDEF recognises that some young males may not be
              sufficiently mature to understand their obligations under the
              Enlistment Act. Their parents or guardians may also have been
              instrumental in decisions, which are in contravention of the
              Enlistment Act. Parents and guardians would therefore also be
              liable for the exit permit offences of their children or wards of
              ages 13 to 16½, so that the penalty can be imposed on their parents
              or guardians when the circumstances warrant it. MINDEF will
              consider the circumstances of the case carefully before deciding
              whether to issue warnings, composition fines or to charge the
              parent or guardian in court.</p>

              <p><strong>Q10. When will the revised exit controls take
              effect?<br> <br></strong>The revised exit control measures will be introduced
              together with the launch of the Singapore Biometric Passport in the
              later half of the year.</p>

              <p><strong>Q11. With the removal of passport controls, what would
              be the arrangement for young males who have furnished bonds for
              extended passport validity under the Immigration Bonding
              Scheme?<br> <br></strong>As males below the age of 13 will no longer come
              under the ambit of passport or exit control, those who had
              furnished a bond to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority under
              the Immigration Bonding Scheme will have their bonds
              released.<br> <br> Males aged 13 to 16½ currently bonded in order to be issued with
              passports of extended validity will be required to apply for an
              exit permit for overseas trips of 3 months or more. Those who
              require an exit permit of 2 years or more will continue to be
              bonded. Those who require an exit permit of less than 2 years or
              who do not require an exit permit will have their bonds
              released.</p>

              <p><strong>Q12. If MINDEF continues with passport controls, how
              many pre-enlistees would be inconvenienced by having to apply for a
              new biometric passport every year?<br> <br></strong>According to the Immigration and Checkpoints
              Authority, there are approximately 120,000 pre-registrants (males
              aged 11 to 16½) and 100,000 registrants (males aged 16½ to
              enlistment) passport holders. With the passport validity of
              pre-registrants and registrants capped at 2 years and 1 year
              respectively, we would expect a pre-registrant to have to apply for
              a new passport once in 2 years and a registrant once a year. On
              average, 100,000 have their passports extended annually.</p>

              <div>Many guys and gals who's been growing up overseas are probably
              not too familiar with the concept of National Service, aside from
              listening to the exciting adventures as told by their fathers. So
              to help your children or you (if you are going to enlist soon) ease
              into NS, do take a look at the resources we're putting together

              <div>Together with MINDEF, OSU organises NS Familiarisation visits
              to the Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) on Pulau Tekong, where
              many recruits take their first step of this important journey in
              their lives. This visit is open to Singaporean citizens, both boys
              and girls, between the ages 15 to 18 years old. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The first NS Familiarisation visit was organised on 18 July
              2012, and 15 OS youths took this opportunity to take a sneak peak
              at life at BMTC and even got to experience it for a little bit.

              <p> <strong>2LT Sherman Pay, ROS Commander with 128 Squadron,
              RSAF</strong></p>
              <p>It was to be a decision many Singaporean boys who have grown up
              overseas, would have to make – whether to return home to Singapore
              and serve National Service (NS). Not necessarily an easy decision
              for any 19-year-old Singaporean; not when you’ve lived the last 11
              years of your life overseas. </p>
              <p><strong>Home Away from Home</strong></p>
              <p>For Sherman Pay, home had been in the Chinese city of Xiamen in
              Fujian province where he lived with his family. They would return
              twice a year to visit their relatives, often during Chinese New
              Year and the summer holidays. Save for his relatives, Sherman had
              hardly any friends in Singapore. Not surprising, given that he had
              spent most of his growing up years away from Singapore.</p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/IMG_2290%283%29.jpg"><img style="width: 380px; height: 318px;" src="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/IMG_2290%283%29.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="241"></a></p>
              <p><em>Sherman is ‘focused and ready’!</em></p>
              <p>His parents had made known their preference for the family to
              remain as Singaporeans. He recalled his mother signing him up for
              tours that took him around Singapore’s landmarks during his visits
              back as a child.</p>
              <p>While serving NS, Sherman lives with his uncle. However, being
              away from his immediate family does take its toll: “Sometimes I
              really miss them. I have learned to appreciate them more,
              especially  when I am feeling lonely. There would be times
              when I feel really down. But for me, my mom had brought me up to be
              independent and that really helped”.</p>
              <p>‘<strong>What-Ifs’ and ‘How-Woulds’</strong></p>
              <p>Prior to Sherman’s decision to return home to serve NS, his
              parents had concerns. Their uneasiness rubbed off on Sherman as
              well: “My mom was worried that I might get bad influence as there
              were people from all walks of life serving NS. She was also afraid
              that I couldn’t blend in and it would be hard for me to make
              friends. I was worried that I would be quite alone as I didn’t have
              friends (in Singapore) to begin with. I didn’t know how physical it
              (NS training) would get as I didn’t have my physical education
              here, so I didn’t know how (physically) fit I was compared to
              Singaporeans here. I didn’t know if I could keep up with the
              physical standards. My mum was worried about cultural differences
              because I don’t interact with Singaporeans that often. She was also
              worried I may not adapt to it.”</p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/MVI_2531.jpg"><img style="width: 410px; height: 250px;" src="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/MVI_2531.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="175"></a><br> <em>All geared up behind the ROS</em></p>
              <p>As for his father, he was worried as to whether Sherman was both
              physically and mentally strong enough to endure the training and
              demands of a soldier and if he might be bullied by his platoon
              sergeants. “I think it was because he believed Army trainings mean
              harsh treatments by the sergeants, but in reality, the trainings
              are carried out professionally with safety as a priority,” Sherman
              says with a grin. It helped that Sherman had Singaporean friends
              he’d grown up with in Xiamen who’d returned ahead of him to serve
              NS and they were able to cope well in NS.</p>
              <p><strong>Flying High In Many Ways</strong></p>
              <p>Sherman has been doing well in NS since his enlistment two years
              ago. The well-respected officer with the Republic of Singapore Air
              Force (RSAF) is addressed by his men and superiors in the 128
              Squadron as ‘2LT Sherman Pay’. He makes no qualms about aspiring to
              be an officer prior to his enlistment. “I have a few cousins who
              went to OCS (Officer Cadet School), so they told me, ‘If you can,
              try to be an officer as the experience would be more enriching.’
              Therefore that was my goal during BMT; I was very motivated.”
              Despite the initial anxieties, Sherman felt that serving NS has
              been a good and positive experience for him and it has made him
              mature from a boy to a man.</p>
              <p><br> It wasn’t just a positive attitude and hearing about success
              stories that got Sherman geared up for life in military fatigues.
              He credits his superiors who were very supportive and maintained an
              open communication channel with him during his Basic Military
              Training (BMT): “My supervisors did a good job. My OC (Officer
              Commanding) in BMT (Basic Military Training), he tried to engage us
              overseas Singaporeans, on enlistment day and told us that if we had
              any problems, if we couldn’t blend in, to look for him and he would
              help us. When we’re down, he’ll always motivate us. Although your
              family is not around, but during the time in NS, you have your
              so-called ‘brothers’, your bunkmates (and) they’ll also motivate
              you.” Yes, training will get tough, but the recruits will have to
              support each other to spur on and pull through together.</p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/IMG_2307.jpg"><img style="width: 440px; height: 290px;" src="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/IMG_2307.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="189"></a></p>
              <p><em>Setting up the ROS</em></p>
              <p>These days, Sherman literally has a bird’s eye view on things
              through the videos by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which would
              be fed back to the Receive-Only Station (ROS) that he operates with
              his team. The video feed, when relayed to the ground commanders,
              provides better battlefield situational awareness and enhances
              mission effectiveness.</p>
              <p><strong>Appraisal to be Well-Adapted</strong></p>
              <p>Sherman’s immediate supervisor Major (MAJ) Sam Ong, the OC in
              charge of ROS for 128 Squadron, says that Sherman has adapted very
              well in the Squadron. He believes Sherman’s positive experience in
              BMT and how those who had returned from overseas to serve NS were
              actively engaged by their superiors, set the foundation for a
              smoother transition for the recruits. “Those things are very
              important because the initial phase is when these overseas
              Singaporeans will need to adjust to the change in environment and
              that’s when engagement must come to the forefront. When Sherman
              came to the unit, I didn’t feel that he had any problems adjusting
              to the operational requirements of 128 Squadron. That foundation
              served him well and enabled him to adapt to the operational tempo
              without any difficulties” says MAJ Ong.</p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/IMG_2347.jpg"><img style="width: 400px; height: 277px;" src="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/IMG_2347.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="199"></a></p>
              <p><em>Sherman with Major Ong</em></p>
              <p>MAJ Ong regards Sherman as “a very outstanding NSF who’s not
              just able to lead when he’s required to, but he’s also a very
              capable team player. Sherman’s positive attitude and his
              willingness to take on challenges and overcome them will serve him
              well in the future”.</p>
              <p>Does MAJ Ong feel that Singaporean youths who return from
              overseas to serve NS are disadvantaged in some way? He doesn’t
              believe so as information is readily available in this age of
              connectivity and ease of access to the internet, where “you’re able
              to sift out information pertaining to NS. It’s this sense of
              wanting to find out what’s ahead that makes the difference. Perhaps
              years ago when information was limited, that would have made it
              more difficult for overseas Singaporeans to find out more about
              NS”.</p>
              <p><strong>Seeing Significance in NS</strong></p>
              <p>The most memorable event for Sherman was when he was
              commissioned as an officer. “My parents came back to attend my
              commissioning parade and they were very proud of me. After being
              commissioned as an officer, you will take up a leadership role. So,
              you’ll need to exercise a lot of your leadership skills. When you
              have to inspire people to be more capable beyond their normal
              abilities, make them go an extra mile, that’s when it feels very
              rewarding,” he says, beaming with a sense of accomplishment.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/IMG_2376.jpg"><img style="width: 450px; height: 300px;" src="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/userfiles/blog/images/IMG_2376.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="192"></a> <br> <em>Posing beside a UAV</em></p>
              <p>How this contrasts to his initial scepticism of how serving NS
              would help in the defence of a small nation like Singapore. That
              faded after Sherman underwent the National Education programmes
              conducted by his supervisors. It then dawned on him the crucial
              role each serviceman, himself included, played in national security
              and the defence of Singapore. MAJ Ong believes that the key to
              creating a positive NSF experience is to make sure the NSFs
              understand and internalise their role in national defence”.</p>
              <p>But it is easy to think that two years serving NS is two years
              too long. In Sherman’s perspective, “If you think of your career,
              your studies, it’s a postponement of two years. So before I
              enlisted, I was also thinking, ‘You waste two years of your life.
              People already get their degrees and you’re still studying. People
              are already working’. But after I enlisted, I realised I learnt a
              lot during NS. I learnt about leadership, having a positive
              mindset, how to overcome hardship – these kinds of things. The
              experience was enriching in many ways, and in the end I felt I’ve
              become more mature and better equipped as a person. My two years in
              NS wasn’t wasted”.</p>

              <p>When we hear of National Service (NS), it is often assumed that
              it relates to the time spent with the army or the SAF, but that’s
              not always the case. “Growing up, my father always talked about the
              SAF and his time there, so I always thought that I would be joining
              the SAF. So when I received my enlistment letter and found out that
              I was to join the SCDF, I was definitely surprised!” Such was SGT
              (Sergeant) Raphael Tan’s initial response when the enlistment
              letter indicated that he was to join the Singapore Civil Defence
              Force for two years of NS. In this <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.overseassingaporean.sg/articles/d/ns-through-the-lens-of-an-overseas-singaporean-part-1">second issue</a> of ‘NS through the Lens of an
              Overseas Singaporean’, we met up with Raphael Tan, a Singaporean
              who lived abroad and came back home to serve NS in the SCDF.</p>
              <p>Since his birth, Raphael has had to adapt to both Western and
              Asian cultures due to his parents’ commitments in missionary work
              and overseas businesses. “I was born in Cardiff, Wales and spent a
              couple of years growing up in the UK and in Sweden before coming
              back to Singapore for pre-school. Following that, we left for
              Bangkok, Thailand in which I spent 13 years there.”</p>
              <p>When it was time to return for his NS stint and not knowing what
              to expect, a nervous Raphael went on to find out as much as he
              could about the Singapore Civil Defence Force. “Despite being a
              little worried, when I found out that they train fire-fighters, I
              was actually quite excited about it,” revealed the young sergeant.
              For those unfamiliar with the SCDF, this uniformed organisation
              belongs to the Ministry of Home Affairs and plays a critical role
              in Singapore by providing fire-fighting, rescue and emergency
              ambulance services. They also oversee the implementation of fire
              safety and civil defence shelter matters.</p>

              drill with two of his trainees</em></p>
              <p>When enlistment day arrived, a sense of uncertainty could be
              felt among the new recruits, “I was quite nervous but I wasn’t the
              only one because on the first day, you see many other nervous boys
              as well.” He was quick to reassure though, saying, “The instructors
              were quite kind and understanding as they were once in our shoes as
              well, so it wasn’t too bad actually.”</p>
              <p>What helped Raphael was that his overseas experience allowed him
              the opportunity to meet different people from diverse backgrounds.
              This made interacting with others in the SCDF much easier for him,
              especially when certain situations force you out of your comfort
              zone. “We had a training stint at Outward Bound in Sabah,” recalls
              Raphael, “and did hiking treks into dense jungles. A lot of us were
              placed out of our comfort zones and because of that, you could
              really see what people were really like. It was a real eye-opening
              experience where we learnt a lot about ourselves and of each
              other.”</p>
              <p>Following his basic training phase, Raphael is now a Fire and
              Rescue Specialist trainer. “I’m in the fire-fighting branch, so I
              instruct trainees on how to fight different kinds of fire.” Fires
              like flashovers and backdrafts are just some of the many thermal
              accidents that fire-fighters encounter and have to deal with. One
              of the ways to do that efficiently is to ensure that they are
              well-versed in their drills, in which our trainer/resident expert
              and his team will give you a sneak preview of in our <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADOJUT6TwBk"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">video.</span></a></p>
              <p>Having almost completed his two-year NS stint, Raphael now looks
              forward to becoming a Physical Therapist in the field of Sports
              Sciences and will take the skills that he has learnt from the SCDF
              with him wherever he goes. He reflects, “There are many things that
              I’ve gained from the SCDF and a lot of what I’ve learnt can be used
              in most emergency situations in our daily lives. I’ll bring along
              all these knowledge with me and touch wood, if I need to draw upon
              them one day, at least I’ll be mentally well-equipped.”</p>

              <p>While there are some who might still feel that NS is a
              hindrance, both to their career and study plans, to Raphael, NS is
              an opportunity to continue learning new life skills in an
              environment that is unlike any other. “You’re going to go through a
              lot of new experiences so take it all in and you’ll learn a lot of
              new things. Embrace it because a lot of what you will experience
              here, you won’t get a chance to do so outside of NS. Once you
              leave, you might just miss the time you’ve spent here.”</p>

And if they are lenient isn't it unfair to everyone else? Everyone also have grandmother or grand parents &amp; anyone gf or wife will also get pregnant everyday so all guys who have grandparents or wife or gf pregnant can awol? And sad to say for ROM AWOL = NO ROM.. once go register straight get caught and it's an offence if you know the person whereabout and you did not report him. So just ask that guy to face it like a man anyway a father to be so dont act like a coward and be an irresponsible man. Dare to awol must dare to admit. </p></div>
