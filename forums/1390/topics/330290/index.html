              <p>Ok guys,this is gonna be abit draggy and i'll try to keep things short.</p>
              <p>I ORD like 2 years ago from a combat unit, i didn't declared 302 when i was in NS. After my ORD , i started undergoing HRT(hormone  therapy treatment) from a reputable Endocrinologist after being referred to him from a (GID)Gender-Identity Disorder psychatrist .</p>
              <p>Soon after,my body started some changes, and my test Lab result came back positively. late last year , i was reminded to attempt my 1st IPPT after my ORD.Due to some reason, i left the notice late and only visit my unit MO about a week before the window closes.Nonetheless. that MO assured me that  he will temp downgrade me for that IPPT.</p>
              <p>Weeks later, i received a SAF 264 charges for  failing to attend the IPPT. thus , i went back to the MC, but saw another MO instead that said that i need to attend to the charges, probably do some RT , meanwhile try to  get medical board review for me.absurd right !RT in my condition !</p>
              <p>so in mid june,i went to CMPB to answer for the charges,the disciplinary officer on seeing my appearances said that he will waived off my charges for last work year ,and excuse me for this work year's ippt,in the meantime advised  me to get a downgrade ASAP.</p>
              <p>So i called my unit MC again and true enough,2 weeks later,i was scheduled for MMI medical board review, the final puzzle..or so i thought.</p>
              <p>Was there on time but still have to wait like 2+hours for my turn. Upon seeing me,the 3 MOs including a COL i think mentioned that i will be PES E from that day on.I then asked him if i would still be called up for ICT and he said 'should not be', and official PES docementation will be posted to me but he also said only when i have completed the SRS(sexual reassignment surgery) will i be PES F..the whole thing lasted like 3 mins!!</p>
              <p>Everything was quiet,nothing was posted to me. Till 2 weeks back, i received a text reminding me of my upcoming ICT in oct. I called my unit MC and they asked me to check with my unit NS clerk,while faxing them my downgraded PES status( E9L9 ).YES ! MMI did their part swifly. i called up my NS clerk then and asked whether ICTs still on for me. He confirmed with me yes indeed im on PES E now and willl update me of the final outcome,in the midst of informing the NS branch OC i guess.</p>

              <p><span class="mw-headline"><span style="color: #ff0000;">------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></span></p>
              <p>Homosexuals and effeminate men are managed according to the dictates of a manpower directive issued by the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Singapore Armed Forces</span></span> (SAF).</p>
              <h4><span class="mw-headline"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Category 302</span></span></h4>
              <p>The most widely known and infamous classification is Category 302, a medical code given to personnel who are "homosexuals, transvestites, paedophiles, etc." Category 302 (popularly referred to as "cat 302") homosexuals are further classified into those "with effeminate behaviour" and those "without effeminate behaviour". This form of discrimination persists despite the fact that homosexuality was depathologised by the American Psychiatric Association in 1973, and homosexuality is not regarded as a psychiatric condition by the local medical profession. Moreover, the military's grouping of homosexuality and transvetism with paedophilia further reinforces the public misconception that it is abnormal.</p>
              <h5><span class="mw-headline"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Management</span></span></h5>
              <p>Self-declared or discovered servicemen are referred to the Psychological Medicine Branch of the Headquarters of Medical Services for a thorough psychiatric assessment, which involves their parents being called in for an interview.</p>
              <p>They are medically downgraded to a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Public Employment Status</span></span> of C (PES C), regardless of their level of fitness, and put through modified Basic Military Training. On graduation, they are deployed in a vocation which has no security risks, posted to non-sensitive units and given a security status which restricts their access to classified documents.</p>
              <p>Formerly, Category 302 personnel were not allowed to stay overnight in-camp, nor were they required to perform night duties, but these restrictions have been relaxed. Effeminate homosexuals are also posted to a holding list upon completion of National Service and not required to do reservist training, whilst non-effeminate ones have to undergo it in non-sensitive units.</p>
              <h4><span class="mw-headline"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Category 30-B</span></span></h4>
              <p>A less well known classification is Category 30-B, a medical code given to servicemen "with effeminate behaviour not amounting to sexual disorders". These individuals are further subdivided into "mildly effeminate", "effeminate" and "severely effeminate". Presumably, this group only includes effeminate heterosexual men and not homosexuals, so there have historically been very few servicemen slapped with this label; hence, its relative obscurity.<br><br><em>from:<br></em><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_rights_in_Singapore"><em>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_rights_in_Singapore</em></a></p>
