              <p>I've heard some people say that your vocation is already pre-determined. Even if you get posted to SISPEC/OCS, you generally end up being posted back to the formation you were intially posted and serve there as a spec or officer.</p>
              <p>No confirmation though and i would say its unlikely we can get proper info of how vocation posting is done.</p>

              <p>U wait long long ah. By default post near your home.</p>
              <p>Its a known fact CPC clerks generally will randomly allocate you your camp with disregard of where you stay. This is done both by my friend who was a former CPC clerk 1 and forumer here who is in CPC now.</p>
              <p>There is no rule where they must post you. Your camp depends on where the clerk likes to slot your name into.</p>

              <p>Supply and demand is important but that does not mean you will be posted to somewhere near your home.</p>
              <p>In each posting, there are sure to be people who are posted to camps all over the island mostly yet you see alot of people being posted to the other end of the island form where they stay such as my friends being posted to selarang, changi naval base etc when they stay in Jurong, Bukit Panjang. Yet in that same posting, i have friends staying in Tampinese etc being posted to Jurong.</p>
              <p>Don't think there is a directive that states that servicemen must be posted their their homes and even if theres 1, its 1 of the directives thats definitely not being followed.</p>

              <p>We all serve before and it should be common to all that we will rarely do additional work when its none of our concern. People who bother to do additional work can easily get Coy Best/Batt Best soldier award liao. For all the sai kang i did, my battalion still owe me my coy best soldier award cos i was supposed to be presented after i left service... sian. 2 movie tickets gone.</p>

              the live in the same area , study the same school and ended up in
              the same camp. even the signed on guy was in bedok. and it was so

              <p>The pre-destined thing is definitely not applicable to
              anyone.</p>
              <p>Not all deployments are done by CPC, FYI. Some units have
              different formations in different camps and they have the power to
              decide who goes to which unit. When that happens, please don't
              blame CPC.</p>
              <p>For me, proximity of camp to residence is not the most important
              thing that a serviceman should consider. It's the level of
              regimentation and the attitude of commanders that one should be
              concerned when he is serving NS. No point living 3 minutes from
              camp when you get treated like dirt.</p>
              <p>Academic results do play a part. For example, having a diploma
              in electrical engineering might increase your chances of being an
              electrical technician (if you are not considered to be good enough
              for command school, perhaps). Getting three or four A level
              distinctions might increase your chances of becoming an ASA (Asst
              Chief Clerk or project clerk), if you're not deemed to be combat
              fit. Hence, it pays to study well.</p>

              <p>You so sure about the academic part? As a technician, majority of my peers from poly all belongs to science, IT, business with very few in the engineering courses so i highly doubt the accuracy of that statement.</p>
