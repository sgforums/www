            <div class='col-md body'>For cadets who are posted to artillery after service term, they would go to School of Artillery which is at Khatib Camp. Khatib Camp houses several other units which includes 23SA, 24SA, PT AND SPORTS, etc...<br><br>For artillery, we do not call a platoon a platoon. We call it a battery.<br><br>For artillery, it is further sub-divided into 2 fields. Liaison and FA. Liaison basically are ppl who normally are with the infantry battalions, providing advices on Fire Support Issues. FA which also stands for Field Artillery basically are ppl that provide the fire, which is also the artillery battalions.<br><br>For cadets going thru artillery training, there are basically 3 phases that you have to go through. The basic phase, weapons phase and the specialized phase. For basic phase, the most basic knowledge of the artillery would be imparted to you. Things ranging from using forms for computation of data to using the GB6 director to obtain readings for laying of the guns.<br><br>As an artillery officer, you would need to have the basics of knowing parts and the operating specs of the Field Howitzers. In artillery, we have the FH88 which is capable of a distance of 30km with an ER round, the FH2000 which is capable of a distance of 40km with an ER round and the newly comissioned "Primus" which is a self propelled howitzer.<br><br>Lastly is the specialized phase where you would be streamed to Liaison, FA and radar. For liaison, you would be taught on map reading, fire support matters and specialised equipment handling, You would come out as qualified FOs or known as Forward Observers. There are several exercises for the liaison phase but the major one would be Ex Firestrike where cadets undertake appointments and start to plan for the fires to support the manouevre counterparts. For FA, cadets undergo training to further specialise their knowledge in the FA battalions; the hierachy and structure, to further hone their skills in the equipment used and to practice survey and the laying of the guns. The one major exercise would be EX Thunderstorm, where cadets take up various appointments, which includes BC (Battery Commander), BSM (Battery Sergeant Major), BRO (Battery Recce Officer) and GPO (Gun Positioning Officer). the other HQ appointment holders are FDO (Fire Direction Officer) and BNRO (Battalion Recce Officer). For those going to radar, sorry cant say much. its classified. I came from Liaison by the way.<br><br>After which, everyone would come together again and move off to either Starlight or Crescendo to do your live firing and then when you come back. Prepared to get comissioned!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dun expect too much from the toilet at School of Artillery. It is not like its in the OCS, where the water is all so powerful and all. The pressure of the water tank is not powerful enuff and hence the water tends to dribble down instead of spraying. you would rather bathe with a hose!!! You would stay in a 8 man or 6 man bunk. The bunk is quite small in size so if you are unlucky you might find it difficult to manouevre in a 8 man bunk.<br><br>Brace yourself for lotsa runs in SOAY (short for school of artillery). Tuesday and thursday are life runs. 5 km and 7km respectively. then on alt sats, its outcamp run, at outcamp runs, you run a longer distance. definitely more than 7km. sorry for you all but CO SOAY and Chief of Artillery are avid runners. lolx. then the other non running days, you would run 2.4km in the morning for 5BX. then the day proceeds by boring lessons at lecture rooms and at gunhill ( you will know wat is gunhill when you are at khatib camp).<br><br>Towards the end of the course, there would be a battle endurance course. You would have to do a combat swim, casevac a casualty and run the SOC route at khatib camp and then do computation of data till you fire off your first round (simulated of course!) That is the grand finale of the course!</div>
