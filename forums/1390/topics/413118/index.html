              <p>I am 16 this year -taking olevels- and I am going for foundation studies in Australia next year. It is a one year program before i start university for 3 years in 2012. I am guaranteed a place in the college and also university for my course in medicine.</p>
              <p>I am quite worried whether they would not allow me to defer ns til I finish my course in biomedicine but I've heard tt some people were allowed to finish their course in medicine before coming back for ns and they also would be allowed to become a doctor during ns. Is this true?</p>
              <p>My dad is not happy that I might have to come back for ns after foundation year and then go back again for university.</p>

              I guess u made the right choice. I guess you must be referring to monash. You must finish your MUFY and defer your biomedical bsc. And serve first. Then you can proceed to the biomedical. Still you will grad faster than local trained doctors. GO ON KID. When you grad. Don't come back. 
              
              The medical scene here is screwed. I'm not as lucky as you. I made the wrong choice and ended up in polytechnic. Even so I wouldn't have the money to do the foundation studies. I'm a frigin optometrist now. The Singapore medical scene isn't as rosy as it seems to be. GPs know nuts about eye conditions and other less common conditions. I went to the polyclinic twice because of a suspicion that i may have a torn retina and the GPs really know nuts about looking into the eye. They stood so fqr from me when looking through the device which was supposed to be used at a very close distance and told me that they couldnt see anything. 
              
              Australian trained doctors are equipped with more diagnostic skills to cater to a larger field of medicine. I have 2 seniors from optometry doing med in aus unis. It's really better off to stay there. I may try to apply for foundation studies after NS to do medicine in aus if my financial status allows me to do so.

              <p>i want to do foundation studies too. im currently 15. o level in 2011. have you checked if you can defer university after foundation studies? i think its better to serve first because you will have 2 years to study a little bit and save some money. this may help u cut down some tuition fees.</p>
              <p>Just wondering: you have done your calculations and stuff? how much does it cost you to do foundation studies and the rental and stuff.</p>
              <p>i only know foundation studies is 13k SGD around there</p>
