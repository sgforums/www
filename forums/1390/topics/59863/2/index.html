            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm... PTP is quite slack (I actually got to sleep in the day sometimes, often for 3 hrs in a row). However, you have to compensate that for when fatigue duty comes... You will have to do "sai kang" (shit work), which I honestly feel is quite true.<br><br>One good example. One day, my platoon went on fatigue duty (supposed to carry some big boards back to company line). A few days later, another platoon was sent to return it. Board apparently was untouched between the two times.<br><br>Anyway, the training is manageable. Circuit training is the worst in my opinion, especially the very first one (I was in pain the day after the first one), but subsequent ones I was able to take it in my stride.<br><br>Any lesson with PTIs (Physical Training Instructors) equals to push-up opportunity. They ask you to knock it down for the smallest matter. Perhaps preparation for BMT? So far, I have seen the best PTIs and (what I think) the worst PTIs. The nice ones are very nice, the horrors are tyrants...<br><br>As for push-ups, we have a very weird routine.. Before knocking it down, we clap our hands twice and shout out the company name. Mostly, the people there gave me only 20 per set, but on days when they are terribly pissed off.... can even reach 40 in a set. Then we switch positions and do crunches. Alternate between the two and that is one set of punishment.<br><br>For me, I guess so far the superiors are very reasonable. Somebody is late for 5 BX and we all knock it down. Well, one for all and all for one.<br><br>Also, so far, I think I am very lucky. The company next door, Orion , is only in their first week of enlistment, and their O.C. is already hurling CBs at them.

The nice ones are very nice, the horrors are tyrants...<br><br>As for push-ups, we have a very weird routine.. Before knocking it down, we clap our hands twice and shout out the company name. Mostly, the people there gave me only 20 per set, but on days when they are terribly pissed off.... can even reach 40 in a set. Then we switch positions and do crunches. Alternate between the two and that is one set of punishment.<br><br>For me, I guess so far the superiors are very reasonable. Somebody is late for 5 BX and we all knock it down. Well, one for all and all for one.<br><br>Also, so far, I think I am very lucky. The company next door, Orion , is only in their first week of enlistment, and their O.C. is already hurling CBs at them. Vulgarities adore almost every sentence, and his voice caresses affectionately the ear drums of all in the block.</div></blockquote>now orion is standard batch si boh? sure kanna f**k one..<br>OC pms 4 days a week one...<br>i am from previous orion...though OC cmi....the sir and sargeants are almost all very good..</div>
