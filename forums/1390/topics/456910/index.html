              <p>Please report to the camp MO asap. Let him decide what to do (as you are not the doctor anyway.) </p>
              <p>Slipped disc is not a joke. It is a severe injury. When it is minor, it will cause pain and some weakness. (Obviously, you have experienced some problem already, that's why you went to see a doctor.)</p>
              <p>When it becomes severe, it may cause permanent nerve damage or 
              paralysis. The nerve damage can result in loss of bowel and bladder 
              control as well as sexual dysfunction. It is not going to be funny about this.</p>
              <p>as what alize says, down Pes, excuses...</p>

              <p>I can only tell you my personal experience.</p>
              <p>First it was a long wait about 2 to 3 months. I waited also very long that day. I did not know what the heck was going inside that room. I finally went in. He said what happened. I showed him my swollen wrist. Then, he said I would downgrade me according. I was out of the room.</p>
              <p>I think it will be at your medical center. Most likely, he will at you to point out the pain. May be doing a handstand? LOL. There are always many trainees downgrading, so it should be very fast for you blah. </p>

              <p>In the case of an L5 / S1 bulging disc, the nerves in this area control the bowel, bladder, and legs. The pressure on the lumbar spine nerves mentioned above causes pain that can be felt all the way down to the back of the leg. If an affected person will experience +- changes in their bowel and
               bladder, as well as to experience pain, weakness, and muscle cramps in 
              the legs, please consult your doctor.</p>
