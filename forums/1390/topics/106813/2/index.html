            <div class='col-md body'>I have one hypothesis about  the story about LTA XXXX.  I remember in my NS days in the congested training areas in Singapore ( Mandai, Area D  etc etc),  I did encounter "unknown" officers and senior NCOs , doing god knows what by themselves in the forested areas.<br><br>For example, most of them were reservists, I was "saved" by a pair of LTAs who appeared from nowhere to help me out in an argument with a farmer in Mandai, whose small papaya plantation was stripped bare by my section ( I was away at a commander's O group) .  The farmer (brave soul) was threatening me with a parange, saying that the SAF had to compensate him and he was holding me "hostage" until my superior can come.  Somehow, out of the blue, 2 LTAs came by. I realised they were reservists because of their faded uniforms and long hair and their age.  Luckily they assessed the situation quickly and pretended to be my officers and asked the old man to let me go , while they stayed behind to soothe him.<br><br>On another occasion, I actually bumped into a sniper LTA wearing his ghillie suit and carrying his sniper rifle, while on my way to Battalion Cmd post.  Somehow his area of ops overlapped with our area of ops. He was a reservist, was on a lone recce of his immediate area, and we had a good chat.  Tried to sell me spectacles, as he was a manager of a spectacle shop in Tampines !<br><br></div>
