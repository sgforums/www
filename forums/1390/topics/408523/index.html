              <p>hi!</p>
              <p>I just got my enlistment date and I had a few questions:</p>
              <p>1) Im posted to <strong>BASIC MILITARY TRAINING CENTRE SCHOOL 4. </strong>Where is this? I thought there were only 3 schools??</p>
              <p>2) I enlist on the 11 Nov 2010. Will I get breaks for Christmas (24/25 dec) and new year (31 dec/1 jan)?</p>
              <p>3) I am very keen to become an officer. What are the chances I'll be picked to go OCS? Currently, I am 21 (a little older) as I got deferment to go to uni (very last batch to get deferred before some guy screwed it up and they made it stricter) and I obtained a degree. I passed NAPFA with silver and am PES B1 (everything A but I have G6PD allergy, nothing severe it just means I cant take certain medications).</p>
              <p>4) Im even more keen to be a fighter pilot. I am shortsighted (150 left eye 250 right eye). I haven't done lasik. However, I'm 163 but I hear they're not strict regarding height requirements. How do I go about showing interest in this?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks in advance for the help!</p>

              <p>1) BMTC school 4 is the latest School under BMTC HQ. Formerly there were 2 schools with part of School 1 located at Rocky Hill Camp which is further inland in Tekong as opposed to Ladang Camp, the camp at Tekong where the other 3 current schools are located.</p>
              <p>2) There usually is a break for Public Holidays, except in rare instances.</p>
              <p>3) Your PES Status will allow you to qualify for OCS. You're degree will help a lot too. In fact, as it is you are in a very good position for OCS. Basically its up to you to fuck it up. To bolster your chances, show proper attitude during BMT, push yourself in trainings and get a gold for IPPT, and do well for SIT TEST. SIT TEST being the most improtant to allow you to put a competitive bid for OCS.</p>
              <p>To qualify for command school, atleast an IPPT pass is a requirement, however, a better score would be more competitive.</p>
              <p>4) To be a fighter pilot, you need to sign on. There are no NSFs pilots. During the initial few weeks of BMT, there would be a recruitment officer from each of the three services coming down for recruitment talk. It is recommended that you sign on with him. To get in, you have to pass the Medical (for pilots, it is very stringent) and you have to qualify for OCS. Though, it is known that as long as you pass the requirements for a Pilot, they'll push for you internally to get into OCS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good Luck.</p>
