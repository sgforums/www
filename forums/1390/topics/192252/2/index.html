We don't have to be a rocket scientist to guess the answer.<br><br>.....lets face the fact....MANY of us have relatives in neighbouring countries regardless of our race...why is only the malays loyalty questioned?...why not the chinese, indian and others....I read somewhere SM Goh Chok Tong has relatives in Perak...correct me if i'm wrong.<br><br>.....after more than 30 years of independence we are still grappling with this issue.
