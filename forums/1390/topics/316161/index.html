              <p>While I was serving my reservist training, I thought of a very interesting question.</p>
              <p>Why the hell call working adults back for reservist?</p>
              <p>Economically, it doesn't make sense to take workers who are contributing to the economy away from their jobs.</p>
              <p>Additionally, SAF would have to pay the equivalent amount in working salary back to the company. The cost of recalling working adults back increases with time because of rising salaries due to time.</p>
              <p>Wouldn't it be better to just have NSF soldiers to serve 3 years and be done with reservist training?</p>
              <p>Afterall, NSF soldiers are most likely not to be working, there's no need to pay companies make up salary because there're no companies. Also, these NSF soldiers are not really contributing to the economy at that point in time, GDP-speaking, because they are mostly students.</p>
              <p>I can no longer remember why in the world PM Lee reduced the service length to 2 years and made it 5 working days. Can someone refresh my mind a bit. It's almost crazy that PM Lee doesn't understand basic economics.</p>

              <p>There is one primary goal for the need of NS Reservist.</p>

              <p>This bulk force, make the quantity number, to deter any aggressor to try attack Singapore. Its diplomatic and psychological.</p>
              <p>Be glad when a war really comes, you're a reservist, you're not at the frontline, first.</p>
              <p>Serving 3 years of NSF is definite a no-no, as it requires more logistics, admin and other resources to maintain NSF itself. Supply food, electricity and water to NSFs doesn't come cheap. Imagine the sh!tty bills you are paying for your utilities. </p>
              <p>I doubt anyone would support a 3-year NSF. Any individual education path will be ruin. Many people are already complaining about the 2-year NSF being a "bad break" from continuing their studies or even working in the society, to catch up with our fellow female citizens. NSFs may be student at that point, but long term, they'll still need to contribute to the economy. And remember, most of the so-called students are "graduates" from different institutions, from polys, unis and ITEs, they are "operational ready" to contribute to our economy.</p>
              <p>Even if all your suggestions are taken, it'll takes years to implement, to get use to it as ecomically and socially there are short-term impacts to consider as it'll shake the whole society, especially parents.</p>
              <p>RT, IPPTs, are something I dislike too. But I guess, its the only thing to push up the fitness of all able-bodies militia gentlemen, by hook or by crook, when we are all are working like dogs in this dreaded society.</p>
              <p>Singapore has a small population, at a national level, men are multitasked somehow ... sadly.</p>

It's pretty good except for the fact that if people want to take a break, they can just take a break at their own leisure. Forcing people to take a break via reservist isn't really taking a break. E.g. If I want to take a break, I can just simply apply leave.</p>

              <p>I would recommend taking away reservist and allocate the time back to NSF training. E.g. 10 years of reservist training probably take 15 weeks total. Why not just add the 15 weeks to the current 2 years and be done with NS?</p>
              <p>I'm not too sure but somehow I feel that the cost of keeping a NSF in camp is lower than a reservist in camp. Based on a per day basis.</p>
