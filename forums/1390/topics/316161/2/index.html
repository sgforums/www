              <p>go read the past threads in health and fitness corner in hardwarezone forums. There are people who do workouts very very late at night or early early in the morning (and they just fathered a new kid somemore) for the sake of fitness.</p>
              <p>If you have the will and motivation, you will have the time. Fitness is a self-responsibility. Be glad that you are actually being paid to take care of your own responsibility here.</p>

              <p>On the national scale, having reservists is a good balance between the necessity of having a large standing force and draining the economy by depriving it of workers.</p>
              <p>On the personal scale, reservist is for you to make sure that you keep relatively fit, and remember how to shoot a rifle, throw a grenade, etc, so in case war breaks out you at least have some chance of surviving and defending your family.</p>
              <p>Like others said, it also provides a break from work, which is welcomed by some people :)</p>
              <p>Before you complain about reservist, why not spend some time to think about what would happen if we did not have reservist-- and not think just about yourself or the short term.</p>
              <p>I think it is a win-win situation overall.</p>

              <p>What has LKY got to do with surrendering?</p>
              <p>The point of the conscript army is simple. it's basically all men in singapore is accounted for. everyone counts, be it service, or combat. it's not very huge, but you can't get anywhere nearer with all regular army unless EVERYONE sign on.</p>
              <p>NS is a basic training. in terms of ops, you're assigned according to vocations. just like if you come from design background, are you telling me that all the skills you acquired in the course of study can only be used in the design field? Surely, you can work around other lines as long as your skill set can match with the job requirement?</p>
              <p>I am not giving you any camadarie bullshit. I never treat you like a 12 yr old. but your robotic responses and posts against the ruling party is kind of hilarious. almost every freaking thing you can link to LKY and his party. Since you're not that young, what's the point of freaking whining here? Get a life dude. and that includes all your other party members.</p>

              <p>mind your language friend, we also don't need to go through war to know that it's suffering. so what if you know about his history? the end result is the same. I still fight for my family and friends.</p>

              <p>I already posted before where I was from. but the point is, I'm not trying to bash you for any training. it's just that I don't understand since you were not the service side, you should know roles are interchangable according to vocation.</p>
              <p>seriously, singapore is below average if you were to ask me. But that's because of my own humble background. I can't blame anybody. It's not that we are obliged to fight for singapore. good or bad, it did house us for the lifetime we spent as well as our families and friends. Poor or Rich, it is still a place where we fought in for a living. So in a way, we just repay the nation with our NS of 2 yrs and the reservist, that's it.</p>
              <p>If you can justify all the arguments in a very logical way, I believe no matter where you go, sure got people support.</p>
              <p>if you see right now, only a few in spkers corner including you are merely bashers and most people don't take you seriously. instead of just posting articles from other sites, why don't you post with a more objective manner? like if you want to solve, lets say ERP issues, come out with a precise plan? discuss objectively rather than just pen down a judgmental statement.</p>

              <p>seriously, I can't talk to you properly. I keep repeating the family and friends part also not what I want. it's just that I think regarding to the question what I fight for, I will say that again.</p>
              <p>those people in states will volunteer to join the army for the nation itself. the states don't have their own army but they do have the nation's army.</p>
              <p>Your answers A, B and C is very typical. then don't share here, work it out with your mates and run for election ba.. then we'll hear it first hand from you nobody can steal.</p>
              <p>I don't have numbers on the cost of everything. I don't believe you have either. at least on the spot right now. Nobody can provide any definite numbers on the spot. but if you were to really discuss on a thread specifically targeting let's say the army issue. I'm sure those people in the military nuts forum can provide you with an satisfied answer on figures.</p>
              <p>you can present your logical ideals. but there will be people who accept and don't accept. thats why you need to gain supporters. come up with valid, reasonable solutions for their everyday problems. I'm sure more people will vote for you.</p>

              <p>wa cuddles and Uncle Ver SG, you two got interesting arguement ah.. mind if i step in and give my 1cent? I haven't really given any deeeeeep thoughts about the purpose and usefulness of reservist and conscript army and all, but.. I do know a simple analogy that can relate the purpose of reservist for all NS Men..</p>
              <p>It's just like a family living in a house. You can't expect to be a sleeping member and just sit down watch tv, eat dinner, play PS3, surf internet, do all these and don't do the house chores, do you? You got to contribute and help clean the window, mop the floor and what not..</p>
              <p>Same goes for all man in SG.. We can't live off in a environment, enjoy everything, and then at the end of the day decide that we don't wanna do reservist, do we?</p>

              <p>wa cuddles and Uncle Ver SG, you two got interesting arguement ah.. mind if i step in and give my 1cent? I haven't really given any deeeeeep thoughts about the purpose and usefulness of reservist and conscript army and all, but.. I do know a simple analogy that can relate the purpose of reservist for all NS Men..</p>
              <p>It's just like a family living in a house. You can't expect to be a sleeping member and just sit down watch tv, eat dinner, play PS3, surf internet, do all these and don't do the house chores, do you? You got to contribute and help clean the window, mop the floor and what not..</p>
              <p>Same goes for all man in SG.. We can't live off in a environment, enjoy everything, and then at the end of the day decide that we don't wanna do reservist, do we?</p>

              <p>Too bad, it's my nation, not theirs. The same goes for us when we go over to other countries and take THEIR job, we need not serve their nation.</p>
