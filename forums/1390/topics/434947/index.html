              <p>'Sup,</p>
              <p>I'm 18, a Singapore citizen by birth, and I currently live in Canada, where I emigrated to 2 years ago. I'm perfectly willing to complete my NS obligations, but I have a few questions:</p>
              <p>1) I'm not staying in Singapore after NS. I have a spot in University being held for me, and I intend to return to Canada to pursue my education and career. Will the SG government view me as an 'undesireable' and make me a supply clerk? I don't want to just slack through NS. So, can a foreign PR go to OCS/Specialist school?</p>
              <p>2) My chin-ups literally CMI, so if I fail/just pass NAFPA test and enlist into the full 2-year NS term, will that impact my chances of getting into OCS/whatever? Otherwise I'm perfectly healthy, if slightly overweight, which can be corrected.</p>
              <p>3) Can I stay in barracks even in the weekend? I have no place to go.</p>
              <p>Thanks for your help!</p>

              <p>1) Supply clerk is mostly for people with unfit bodies like pes C and stuff like that.</p>
              <p>2) OCS also have other considerations besides chinups. Passing Physical can help though.</p>
              <p>3) Have to ask commanding officer, but slim chances as that will mean extra administrative work for them, weekend meals have to be indented, duty officer might have to look for you for roll call. ( Army is supposed to be responsible for your well-being and safety)</p>
              <p>Rather you don't stay in, you could get "arrowed" to other duties during the weekend and sometimes if you screw things up, you will still get into trouble.</p>
              <p>Try to find somewhere to stay.</p>
              <p>I don't know about the 14 days leave thing, army training program will run from the day you enlist til maybe around 18 or 21 months later before there's any spare time that the commanding officer will grant leave other than compassionate leave.</p>
              <p>Basically should have to stay around for at least a year and a few months before you can see any time.</p>

              <p>hmmm...u from canada???immigrated???high chance they will send you to OCS and promote you to rank of colonel siting in some planning room next to the supreme commander of the defence force.</p>

              <p>1. If having an undesirable atttitude was the key to paperwork joy and not to undesirably tough and dirty occupations, we would all be expressing them. </p>
              <p>It is however a good way to be denied a coveted place at officer or specialist cadet school.</p>
              <p>You don't have to tell them about your plans for the future or your spot at university- there are plenty of soldiers without plans for further education so you'll fit right in.</p>
              <p><strong>It's nice to know that foreign universities are willing to admit you two years in advance.</strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Locals, take note.</span></strong></p>
              <p>3. Yes you can "stay in". Orphans and those with families overseas do it. There's no other way to have them serve NS. The NS allowance won't cover the most shabby lodging and holding a part time job or "moonlighting" is an offence.</p>
              <p>Anyway, you're free to renounce your citizenship and avoid NS if you choose. There is plenty of info on the forum on that.</p>

              <p>'Sup,</p>
              <p>I'm 18, a Singapore citizen by birth, and I currently live in Canada, where I emigrated to 2 years ago. I'm perfectly willing to complete my NS obligations, but I have a few questions:</p>
              <p>1) I'm not staying in Singapore after NS. I have a spot in University being held for me, and I intend to return to Canada to pursue my education and career. Will the SG government view me as an 'undesireable' and make me a supply clerk? I don't want to just slack through NS. So, can a foreign PR go to OCS/Specialist school?</p>
              <p>2) My chin-ups literally CMI, so if I fail/just pass NAFPA test and enlist into the full 2-year NS term, will that impact my chances of getting into OCS/whatever? Otherwise I'm perfectly healthy, if slightly overweight, which can be corrected.</p>
              <p>3) Can I stay in barracks even in the weekend? I have no place to go.</p>
              <p>Thanks for your help!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Edit: Can  a NSman take all of his 14 days leave at once?</p>

              <p>I've posted on this before. Singapore does not recognise dual citizenship but cannot stop you from holding it.</p>
              <p>If you acquire it, Singapore will continue enforce all obligations including NS. Once you renounce Singapore citizenship, Singapore cannot hold you in default.</p>
              <p>This is easy to do, just sign forms at the embassy abroad and walk out. You can go even if you don't have a country to go to (but it is better to have one).</p>
              <p>Only a foreigner who acquires SG citizenship, must renounce foreign citizenship.</p>

              <p>I don't have dual citizenship. I have Canadian PR status (The card's blue as well), so I can't randomly throw my SG citizenship.</p>

              <p>@Alize: I don't have an 'undesirable' attitude. I'm just asking if I'll get sidelined.</p>
              <p>@The Bear: I wrote to NS already. They keep telling me that they'll get back to me ASAP for the last two weeks. Besides, I managed to get out of paying the bond by asking people on the internet.</p>
