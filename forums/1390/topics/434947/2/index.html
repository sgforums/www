              <p>'Sup,</p>
              <p>I'm 18, a Singapore citizen by birth, and I currently live in Canada, where I emigrated to 2 years ago. I'm perfectly willing to complete my NS obligations, but I have a few questions:</p>
              <p>1) I'm not staying in Singapore after NS. I have a spot in University being held for me, and I intend to return to Canada to pursue my education and career. Will the SG government view me as an 'undesireable' and make me a supply clerk? I don't want to just slack through NS. So, can a foreign PR go to OCS/Specialist school?</p>
              <p>2) My chin-ups literally CMI, so if I fail/just pass NAFPA test and enlist into the full 2-year NS term, will that impact my chances of getting into OCS/whatever? Otherwise I'm perfectly healthy, if slightly overweight, which can be corrected.</p>
              <p>3) Can I stay in barracks even in the weekend? I have no place to go.</p>
              <p>Thanks for your help!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Edit: Can  a NSman take all of his 14 days leave at once?</p>

              <p>Firstly, if you are not a Singapore citizen (even a former citizen), Singapore has no jurisdiction over you.</p>
              <p>Secondly, since when can embassy staff arrest other countries' citizens or even their own citizens on foreign soil.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, an embassy is where Singapore staff are accorded protection by the grace of the host country. It is not a place where Singapore law applies.</p>
              <p>In other words, if someone so much as shows you attitude you should fuck them and say, "that's why you're a security guard and not a cop".</p>
              <p>If you are a foreign citizen, they can only ask your government to send you back, after proving you have committed a crime in Singapore.</p>

              So lets say if I have a brother who has dual citizenship but has'nt served NS, does that mean he can go to the embassy of singapore and just easily renounce even if he's already 16?
              
              Will he be banned from entering singapore or will he be caught should he be entering singapore using the other nation's passport?

              <p>You need to check this out at the SG embassy. I think he should and he can.It does not make sense to you now. Because you dont understand the underlying implications.</p>
              <p>Supposed you are now both citizens for country A and B. You have your family and property in country A. But country B is your country of birth. So suddenly, touch wood!, country A and B become at war. So now, where do you go now? You must choose between A or B especially, you are THE soldier of country B.

              <p>For LRooke, I dont think he can just not do NS by renouncing the SG citizenship. He is too late. He has only a canadian PR, which is nothing. Guess, he has no choice.</p>
              <p>The key is the purpose of NS is really to train up soldier for protection and secruity of Singapore. The first core value of SAF is "loyalty to country". The agenda here then, would be which "country" is TS loyalty to. If citizenship is just a title, then NS would be meaningless to TS.</p>

              <p>NS is a phase in life, signing on is for a career, or work.</p>
              <p>If I go for an Outward Bound course and  enjoyed it, it does not mean I should stay there forever.</p>

              <p>That happens. In theory you canget SAF to admit it caused your injury. In practice that means sueing it.</p>
              <p>Now you know why the SAF provides free medical care to servicemen whatever the cause. Ignorant 18 year olds get treated, they don't complain, and before they know it the legal time bar on personal injury claims is up (3 years) and proof gets difficult anyway.</p>
              <p>It's far cheaper than refusing some patients and treating others for life.</p>

              <p>In a stunning relevation, MINDEF revealed in a press statement last 
              night that SAF took MORE THAN ONE HOUR to send 21 year old SCT Ee Chun 
              Sheng to NUH after he was discovered to be unconscious during a training
               exercise:</p>
              <p><strong>“An SAF medic went on site and tried to resuscitate SCT Ee at
               about 5.15pm. The serviceman was evacuated via a safety vehicle to the 
              Tengah Air Base Medical Centre and arrived at about 5.39pm where an SAF 
              doctor attended to him. SCT Ee was then sent via an ambulance to the 
              National University Hospital (NUH) at 6.05pm and arrived at 6.32pm.”</strong></p>
              <p>SCT Ee was pronounced dead on arrival at NUH. He was training to be a
               ‘Specs’ at the School of Infantry Specialists (SISPEC) after which he 
              will hold the rank of a 3rd Sergeant.</p>
              <p>His unfortunate and unnecessary death was mourned by many ordinary 
              Singaporeans. SCT Ee graduated from Singapore Polytechnic and would have
               a bright future ahead of him if not for his untimely demise.</p>
              <p>Though the cause of his death is not known yet, it is common medical 
              knowledge that few will survive an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for 
              more than five minutes.</p>
              <p>It was reported that SCT Ee was resuscitated on site. What was done 
              for him there? Did the medic have a portable defibrillator? Did he have a
               pulse present? If he was still alive then, he should be sent 
              immediately to NUH rather than sent to the Medical Centre.</p>
              <p>Given the close proximity between Tengah Air Base and NUH, it is 
              incredulous that it took nearly half an hour to transfer SCT Ee to NUH.</p>
              <p>MINDEF should come clean with the public and convene an independent 
              Commission of Inquiry to investigate the circumstances surrounding SCT 
              Ee’s death and whether it could be prevented.</p>
              <p>It should also release the number of NSFs and NSmen who died in the 
              course of their training as well as those who suffered permanent 
              injuries and debility over the years. The figures should then be 
              compared with those of other countries with mandatory conscription such 
              as Taiwan, South Korea and Israel.</p>
              <p>Despite blanket assurances from the SAF that it takes “serious view” 
              of ensuring the “safety” of its soldiers, unnecessary deaths and 
              injuries have been occuring of late and then quietly swept under the 
              carpet as if nothing has happened.</p>
              <p>With National Service exacting a heavy toll on the time and resources
               of every Singapore men, Singaporeans deserve to know the truth or one 
              day, somebody we know may become the next SCT Ee.</p>

              <p>I've been working as a clerk in my unit (due to god-damned unforseen circumstances in BMT) and this is what I can tell you with regards to you going to OCS.<br><br>1) With you having a dual citizenship, your CAT status (military security classification status) might be insufficient to allow them to put you into a commander/leadership position, this might prevent you from going to OCS.</p>
              <p>2) If you've completed your education overseas please inform Mindef to update or at least recognise your level of education as being "A level or Diploma level" equivilant.</p>
              <p>I have had personnel in my unit who wonder why they were not given leadership roles in NS even though they fulfilled the necessary requirements. What they don't realise is that their education level although being "A level equivilant" outside, was not recognised as such within the SAF. Clear this with them by calling them up and ensuring that they recognise your certification.</p>

              <p>Hi, </p>
              <p>I am all for NS, and even when I am living overseas, I will keep in touch, and have my ICT obligation.  That is because Singapore is my country.</p>
              <p>However, if you want to retain your Canadian Citizen, or applying for one, than, there is no meaning in serving in Singapore NS.  Might as well sign up for Canadian military service, where they pay better. </p>
              <p>But if you want to return to serve, I am not sure if you have the chance to go OCS.  But as for staying in the camp, should be no problem.  I used to do that all the while, but had to arrange for my own food. </p>
              <p>I have a cousin who was born in Singapore, but stayed all his life in Malaysia.  For him, he can never apply for Malaysian Citizen, and thus he has no choice but to serve NS.  For him, the MINDEF send him SCDF, finish his minimum obligation, and never call him back.  He is still Singaporean, but Malaysian PR after more than 10 yrs. </p>
              <p>But I am sure, if you want to apply for Canadian Citizen, it is not that difficult.  If you really want to serve NS, sure, buck up your physical first, and you will enjoy the training very much.  </p>
              <p>All the best. </p>

              <p>By the way, I met a Singapore born Canadian in Toronto last year.  Before turning 1, his parents left for Canada and never return home.  He did not serve NS, and had long given up his Singapore Citizenship.  </p>
              <p>Few years back, he visited Singapore after more than 30 yrs away, and was welcome back as foreigner, without any implication.  He told me he was very worried initially, but he did enjoy his time in Singapore. </p>
