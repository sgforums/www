              <p>2 days of regular service is equal to 1 day NS (due to the pay diff). So TS's friend only served 10.5 months of his NS liability, and still owes SAF 13.5 months.</p>

              <p>your friend signed a contract didn't he?</p>
              <p>u can ask him to try asking, that idea might go through if it was his grandfather's army, so i'm not sure.</p>
              <p>but the contract will state that you have joined as a regular, u will need to serve X amount of years, and you will have to pay if u break the bond and how much to pay will be stated in the deeds / contract.  and your friend would have nodded and said "yeah yeah ok" and signed on the piece of paper (many times i might add, i think 7 or more)</p>
              <p>if people could only pay back the salary and just clear NS years, many people would have done it. no need to wait for your friend in 2010 to think about it.</p>

              <p>btw, even after payment. he still has to finish his remaining NS days</p>
              <p>i suggest that he just stay in there for 1yr more (if that is how much is left), take the money then go study.  1yr won't die one...  and what people used to tell is "give garmen money for what? just take money and go when bond (not contract) finishes"</p>
              <p>i started to get disgruntled after 2yrs and i still need to tahan 2+yrs to finally leave.  mine was a working bond, not even NS.</p>
              <p>so tell your friend, 1yr only.  take money, leave and appreciate life outside.</p>

              <p>yeah its quite straightforward and just simple common sense at work. He has already served 2 yrs, which is what the usual NS liability is for NSF and has been getting full pay..and now he would rather 'pay up the difference' or still owe SAF one yr of NS? Does not make any sense.</p>
              <p>The thing is, SAF has been paying him salary of a regular for the past 2 yrs when he has been in the service. There is no such thing as free lunch in this world. If he does not either pay back the money or pay back for the time, how is this fair to the guys who serve their NS taking NSF pay?</p>
              <p>And tell your friend what for get so excited? 1 yr is nothing when he steps into the real world. There are loads of guys I know rotting in local uni who are 1 to 2 yrs older in age than their peers because they retained or went to prison.</p>
              <p>In the real world, 1 year is nothing. There are lots of guys who seem 'delayed' by a yr, do the same tour by a yr late compared to the peers of their age, but eventually leapfrog over the peers and become the boss of their peers. He needs to grow up lah.</p>
