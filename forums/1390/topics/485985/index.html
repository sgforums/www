              <p>Permanent Residents (PRs) who fail to register or enlist for National
               Service (NS) face serious consequences. In a written Parliamentary

              <p>Second Generation Permanent Residents, are mandated by law to 
              register for enlistment to the compulsory full-time national service and
               later, reservist duties when they turn operationally-ready (ORD).</p>
              <p>Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen stated in Parliament that between 
              2006 to 2011, about 8,800 males who had become permanent residents under
               the sponsorship of their parents were enlisted for and served National 
              Service (NS). On the other hand, 4,200 males who had become permanent 
              residents under the sponsorship of their parents renounced their PR 
              status prior to serving national service.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_service_in_Singapore#cite_note-19"></a></sup> Their failure to serve NS will be taken into account to have adverse 
              impact when they subsequently apply to study/ work/ visit/ travel in 
              Singapore. These ex-PRs were sternly warned about the dire consequences 
              of their actions at the point of renunciation.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_service_in_Singapore#cite_note-20"></a></sup></p>
              <p>After completing mandatory full-time national service, they can 
              qualify to apply for the accelerated Singapore citizenship scheme. 
              However, citizenship is not guaranteed for all applicants, as there are 
              certain criteria that must be met such as educational qualification, 
              income qualification and NS work performance/ conduct appraisal in the 
              NS Certificate of Service issued upon ORD. From 2006 to 2010, about 2% 
              of 3,000 Second Generation Permanent Residents who completed full-time 
              national service and applied for Singapore citizenship were rejected.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_service_in_Singapore#cite_note-21"></a></sup></p>
              <p>In the Singapore Parliament on 5 August 2014, the Defence Minister 
              stated that according to records, no such persons have been granted 
              reinstatement of PR or citizenship. He added that the policy has been 
              progressively tightened recently such that no NS-liable PR who renounced
               his PR status in the last decade has been granted approval for work or 
              study. For former PRs who fail to serve NS, any immediate or future 
              applications for renewal of their parents' and immediate family members'
               Re-Entry Permits may be adversely affected, including curtailment of 
              the Re-Entry Permit.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_service_in_Singapore#cite_note-22"></a></sup></p>
              <p>If the person is not granted Singapore citizenship but still holds 
              Singapore permanent residency, he is still obliged by law to serve the 
              national service obligations, i.e. operationally-ready reservist duties/
               in-camp trainings<sup>.</sup><sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_service_in_Singapore#cite_note-23"></a></sup></p>
              <p>Singapore Permanent Residents who served national service but did not
               acquire Singapore citizenship will be treated equally to those 
              permanent residents without service obligation; they would not have 
              access to the privileges granted to Singapore citizens.</p>
