That was when he was just 19.<br><br>Two decades later, he is leader to about 15,000 men in the army. And the gregarious man hardly comes across as shy.<br><br>The original description appeared in a Straits Times report on the young officer-to-be in 1988, when he was nominated for an SAF overseas scholarship. He came from a low-income family, and his mother took on two jobs to bring up his sister and himself.<br><br>In a recent interview on his promotion to brigadier-general, he said: 'At that point, most of us were quite simple in our aim. The SAF offered us a career, a chance to develop our academic side and other skills.<br><br>'So you take it up and think of what you can do in return for the SAF,' he said.<br><br>When asked what had kept him in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) after all these years, his reply came quick: 'The men.'<br><br>'It's because you've touched the lives of many,' he explained.<br><br>He recalled how, as commander of an infantry battalion, he faced many overweight and unfit conscripts with low self-esteem: 'Our job was to make sure that after their two-year stint, they walked away with their heads held high.<br><br>'At the end of the day, when you look at the amount of hard work our national servicemen put in...the least we regulars can do is to try to realise their potential to the maximum.'<br><br></div>

I remember BG Tan has been a General for at least 4 years already, since 2004. He was only 34 or 35 then if I recall correctly.<br><br>The one General I miss is Loh Wai Keong. HeÂ’s the sort of man who will trailblaze wherever he goes. I thought he was going to become COA but he didn't.<br><br>I noticed no PS cum SAFOS has become COA and CNV yet (CAF yes). ItÂ’s always the SAFOS who become COA. The PS will definitely get their star, and then usually they are moved to civil service swiftly.<br><br>IÂ’ve been told by SAFOS scholars that PS cum SAFOS have a substantial edge to getting the star, and have an edge into Admin Service, dunno how true is that.<br><br>As for why the COA post has always gone to a SAFOS and not PS cum SAFOS, I believe itÂ’s wholly due to the mathematical probability (about 7- 9 SAFOS a year and only 1 Â–2 PS cum SAFOS)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually am rather disappointed that BG Bernard Tan went to join DBS. I always thought he was the sort to commit himself to public service for as long as he could. He's one of the sharpest and most intelligent Generals I spoke to. Someone of his calibre could easily be a PS (perm sec) or DS (deputy sec) but I guess remuneration is too much of a carrot to resist. A PS is paid easily 50K I believe..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yea I am surprised too. Must be something about DBS? Able to attract BGs.. BG Wong Ann Chai also went there, which is why I mentioned BG Bernard Tan leaving.</div>
