              <p>hey guys this is interesting, talk more leh. what about the CDF? i think it's interesting how LG Ng Yat Chung had become a 2-star general even though he wasn't the chief of a service. if I remember correctly, he was the head of an important Joint unit and also COS-JS. he later became the CDF.</p>
              <p>and i thought each service's JS position would usually be the next-in-line to the Chief position?</p>

              <p>Ng Yat Chung was COA.</p>
              <p>http://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_135992.html</p>
              <p>FORMER defence chief Ng Yat Chung has joined the senior management of Singapore investment company Temasek Holdings.</p>
              <p>Lieutenant-General Ng, 46, took up the position of portfolio
                      management managing director on Sunday - a newly created role, The
                      Straits Times understands.</p>
              <p>Temasek confirmed the appointment on Tuesday but declined to provide further details.</p>
              <p>The appointment comes less than four months after Lt-Gen Ng
                      stepped down as Chief of Defence Force and handed the baton to then
                      Major-General Desmond Kuek.</p>
              <p>It mirrors similar movements of other military leaders to
                      civilian positions. Lt-Gen Ng's predecessor, Lt-Gen Lim Chuan Poh, for
                      example, is the chairman of the Agency for Science, Technology and
                      Research.</p>
              <p>A career soldier since 1979, Lt-Gen Ng was awarded the
                      Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Overseas Scholarship in 1980 and has since
                      held many key command and staff positions.</p>
              <p> Before taking the helm of the SAF in 2003, he was Chief of Army. He has
                      also served as director for joint operations and planning and Chief of
                      Staff (Joint Staff).</p>
              <p>During his four years at the head of the SAF, Lt-Gen Ng was
                      credited with improving the SAF's operational readiness and steering it
                      into the next generation.</p>
              <p>Outside the military, he is a member of the board of trustees
                      at the National University of Singapore, chairing its campus planning
                      and development committee.</p>
              <p>Lt-Gen Ng is a Cambridge University graduate, has an MBA from
                      Stanford University and recently completed the Advanced Management
                      Programme at Harvard University.</p>
