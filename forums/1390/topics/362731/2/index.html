              <p>at my ex-unit they beg our NSFs to extend a bit more, then send them for overseas detachments for extra allowance.</p>
              <p>a couple of guys did it because after they leave, they don't plan to study. so their thinking is that might as well take a bit more money then ORD.</p>

              <p>That is quite true, but I heard before of someone in the Newsletter who extended it so that he could take part in the National Day performance.</p>
              <p>As for Huoyanjia, the important question is how long do you plan to extend your ORD date, and whether it affects your studies planning or not.</p>
              <p>If it is just for a month or so, it is still acceptable, but please don't tell us you are going to extend it for half a year just for the sake of that 2 bars.</p>
              <p>And try not to delay your studies, it is undoubtly much more important than your 2 bars, as it will decide which career path you will take on in the future.</p>

              saying the short period in authorities out weights the longer term

              <p>Is it worth to slog it out again and also have ORD extended or

              <p>In CV life, officer or no officer, employers are more interested

              <p>are u furthering your studies after your expected ord? if extending is going to affect your future education, then don't carry on.</p>
              <p>however, looking beyond the priviledges and pay, looking beyond the arrows and extra DO duties you should expect to do, being a cadet and eventually commissioning is also a test of your character.</p>
              <p>truth be told, there are some officers that are just wayang and no action. its whether you are the type who wants to change the lives of 30 men and spec u will have under your charge or you just want to look good being an officer so that people can supposedly look up to you and call you "sir" and get the good pay.</p>
              <p>my advice if u can't find the answer is to spend time talking to one of your wing's instructors whom you respect and ask him what is it like to be an officer.</p>
              <p>best of luck.</p>

              <p>Hi TS</p>
              <p>Are Sure you got heat exhausation or physical exhaustion. If heat exhausted you may be medical boarded becos once you had HE above certain degree there are some irreversible pathological changes in your body namely the brain and liver function.</p>
              <p> IF I were to go thru NS again I would do my best and get myself commissioned as an Officer. not becos I want to be somebody or nobody, the lesson learn in OCS are valuable and will be useful in the civilian working life namely command and control , leadership etc . If I  cant be a ocifer , I will slack all the way and be a LOBO or clerk like you.</p>

              <p>And so far, still on status (lobo) without much info from anyone.</p>
              <p>Indeed, there are lessons to be be learned in OCS that can be useful in ones future. As they said, what you learn benefits you.</p>
              <p>But from what you wrote, I assume you had not gone thru' the stuff they put you thru' as a cadet. (The lowest life form in the Army until you make it thru')</p>
              <p>Almost all of my fellow OOC are all not going to recourse and bombarded with reasons to join them. Thus was this post to get reasons not to join them.</p>
              <p>That's the reason, I want to listen to people who had gone thru this path in life (learning from others experience).</p>

              <p>Think about what you want. Your fellow recoursee tried to influence you because they have already given up. They have been in a comfort zone, i.e Slack whole day doing nothing but sai kang with almost no responsibility, for a period of time and i believe they have got so used to the life that they find no motivation to push themselves for a second chance. Self-motivation is the key.</p>
              <p>I agree that you'll learn lots of valuable lessons in OCS, the most important is being able to cope with stress, which is very important in days ahead. Fear of turnouts, holding field appointment during exercise and admin appointment are just some examples.</p>
              <p>I was a OCS recoursee because of a torn ligament and took 3 more months to commision than people from the same batch but i never gave up because i know i can do it.</p>

              <p>I had been a recourse OOC,  pass out in the 1990s with a SOM.</p>
              <p>IMHO, just be a man if you are not one who is up for pressure and challenge.</p>
              <p>You probably get to do all the shit job but that's basically all you need to do, which is great when you are doing your Reservist or ICT.</p>
              <p>I am doing my last ICT soon and I tell you, being an officer in reservist is not the same when you are in NS.</p>
              <p>You have shit load of phones from your CV work/life commitments and you have to put up with Regulars Trainers who are on the ball even for ICT and totally bochap men. While the men have to do most of the manual work, they can sleep once it's done, you have to still burn through the night for all the approvals, orders, logistics blah blah blah.  On top of that, you got meetings and etc etc that usually happens to be during your working hours.</p>
              <p>If this is what you are prepared to deal with during your reservist cycles...by all means be an officer.</p>
              <p>Rank has nothing to do with outside CV work life. My men all drive BMW/Mercs while I only drive a Jap lol :P. But when it comes to ICT, it's still fun coz what comes around goes around, you treat them well during NS, they'll treat you well during ICT. I got one PC who was a bastard to the men during NS.....when he CDO in ICT, nobody gives him a shit.</p>

              <p>Indeed it is very insightful to read your experience and I am sure you're still proud that you had carried out your responsibilities as a leader.</p>
