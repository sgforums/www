              <p>Rather than ask us, you should be asking yourself whether you want to be an officer or not. You will be the 1 who has to motivate yourself through all the tough training since we won't be the 1 suffering all the hardship etc.</p>
              <p>Man, spec, officer all have their place in the army and you can't do without any of them. Do not take your current life as a norm for a man. If you do not recourse, u will be posted out, revocated and do shit elsewhere and daily bookout is a privilege not a norm so don't put high hopes on it.</p>

              <p>I've never heard of an officer saying they want to be a man yet . Ask yourself what you want. Everyone gains different sort of experience and sometimes army experience though can't be directly use at work can be an additional plus point for u in certain job interviews if its related.</p>
