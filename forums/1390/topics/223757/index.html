            <div class='col-md body'>The level of resistance to change and anything new (within this forum) sometimes bothers me Â… itÂ’s not often that I feel compelled to chip in my 2c worth but being a Medic and having used camelbaks (and derivatives) almost my whole NSF/NSMen experience I feel I should try to correct some misconceptions here<br><br>(Those whoÂ’ve read the SBO thread will remember I usually carry 3-4 litres of water on me using a camelback plus bottles)<br><br>Take for instance this comment,<br><br><blockquote><strong>Â“water bottles are still the best and more practical. for example, somemore get heat stroke and needs water urgently. with a water bottle we can quickly pour water onto him and let him drink from the bottle very quickly. we definitely won't be able to this with the water bag.Â” </strong></blockquote>This surely is a case of the tail wagging the dog Â… has anyone ever considered that the best way to prevent the above scenario is to prevent heat exhaustion in the first place?<br><br>Dehydration is the main cause of Heat Related Casualties.  In military operations, dehydration cannot be avoided but itÂ’s severity can be managed.  Management of dehydration state involves a strategy of managing limited portaged water and infrequent water resupply.<br><br>To cut the medical theory short (read <a href="http://www.army.mod.uk/linked_files/atg/other_pubs/Commmanders_Guide_Fluid_Intake.pdf" rel="nofollow">A Commanders Guide to Fluid Intake</a> for more indepth info) ...  a sound practice for a soldier is to take frequent sips during operations and then as much as they can during resup phase.<br><br>Herein lies the problem with the standard water bottle configuration on older webbing Â… accessibility.  Consider a soldier in FBO or a soldier carrying cumbersome/manpacked loads.  It is difficult to access the water bottles and as such rehydration usually in large quantities in infrequent intervals (during rest breaks).<br><br>A camelback system allows the soldier to rehydrate frequently (every 10-15 minutes) in small quantities (a few or more sips) without having to depend on rest breaks or help to access bottles.<br><br>Trust me I know about this from personal experience.  Try carrying a stretcher, MOP plus rifle and you tell me how you can access your water easily.  84mm Ammo carriers and MG ammo carriers will also understand the problem.<br><br>Basically when youÂ’re limited to your carried water, you want to drink frequently but not so much that youÂ’re pissing it all away.  When you have resup, fill up your bottles/bags and then drink as much as you can of whatÂ’s left.<br><br>As for the need to splash water quickly on a heat stroke casualty Â…<br>i)  Firstly most camelbaks IÂ’ve used have a very large inlet orifice Â… bigger than even the mouth of a SAF water bottle.  The 5 added seconds required to access the water bladder is not life threatening in this instance.<br>ii)  In any case, I can also cut the bloody bag and 1206 him after he recovers Â… IÂ’m quite sure heÂ’s not gonna quibble over the few ten dollars when his life is at stake.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Â“the worst part of the waterbag is that it is hard to wash! shld some dumbass pours syrup or sugared water in, its difficult to have a good wash as it hard to dry, or impossible.Â”</strong></blockquote>And the water bladder is harder to wash compared to water bottles?  How so?  The opening on the water bladder is usually bigger than a water bottle.  Again I use camelbaks pretty extensively both when I mountain bike and during NS/Reservist.  I also do put syrup in it, especially for civvy use.  I donÂ’t have a problem keeping it clean Â… try running a solution of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) through it, works wonders.<br><br>Nostalgia, familiarity with the known and resistance to learning the new/unknown, can sometimes get in the way of innovations that really do work and in this case can save lives.<br><br></div>
