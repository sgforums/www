            <div class='col-md body'>I am personally for the idea of a waterbag. The reason is, the water tube will encourage the troops to drink water more frequently why on the move. The old water pouch is not that accessible for those carrying heavy loads. For those whoare medics, 84mm, will noe that the manpack hinders the ability to tak out the bottle. But one thing abt the waterbag i am worried abt is the durability. The water bag is not that durable in the sense that the water bladder seems to leak water after some heavy sessions of chiong suaing as the heavy load seems to have cause the bladder and the tubing to be significantly weaken.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>suddenly so many replies..<br><br>anyway, regarding the waterbag hygiene, it is true that it is hard to wash. the tube for sucking is harder to wash. that is why towards the end of 2nd year for my batch, we'd rather bring the extra water bottle than using the waterbag.<br><br>the suction comes with a cover but the suction part isnt made with the best of material. some might have the habit of biting it, the protruding part will be broken. i changed the entire waterbag because the suction part cant be replaced.<br>this is one dumb cost issue that probably didnt come into their mind. all of the spare parts for the LBV but not the most vulnerable suction.<br><br>personally i dont think the LBV will be the best thing to chiong sua with. its very hot after running up and down. your back is covered up and thus you'd remain sweaty in most course of your training.<br><br>now the paddings..<br>i was also issued with the knee and elbow pads. its ugly lah. imagine those cheapo skate guards thats in green. thats that! it doesnt really protect you but more to hindering your movement. why would you want something blocking your knee while running? the elastic is also loose and small size soldiers like me doesnt really benefit from it.<br>in the first place, isnt army about making little boys into tough men? with all these paddings, its making men in green sissy.<br><br>lastly the fieldpack, its somewhat different to the one i have.<br>it looks softer and its darker in color. mine have a zipper on the top while theirs is secured the same way as the old one does- buckle.<br>i got this feeling that since we can already stuff all the standard items into the old one, probably more items would be included as standard items since its so much more spacious.<br>my friends and i were joking about having umbrellas and 2 bottles of green tea in them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to hijack this thread for a while.............<br><br>I noticed the newsletter mentioned this armoured 5 tonnes for operations other than war. Anyone have idea what this new tonner is like. What is the max lvl of protection for troops? They said there are gun ports in the vehicles but those gun port do not seem to facilitate aiming of weapons but rather just poking the rifle out for firing. Lastly, they said those tonners are going to be transferred to the Guards formation. I wonder for wad purpose as I believe those would suit the logistic support ppls better as they may encounter convoy ambushes. This looks worrying as does this hint SAF might be sending larger contingents to more dangerous peace-keeping missions like middle-east? Would this mean NSF may be involved?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When you're high kneeling and proning for most of the time, in almost any kind of terrain, the pads are heaven-sent. By the way, are the pads of a generic brand?<br><br>As for the fieldpack, no comment as ive not tried humping it for a few klicks.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Waterbags...the one issued to me was made by this company called SOURCE hydration. Been using it for a year, and so far no problems. I don't even wash it regularly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by equlus84:</div><div class="quote_body">Just to hijack this thread for a while.............<br><br>I noticed the newsletter mentioned this armoured 5 tonnes for operations other than war. Anyone have idea what this new tonner is like. What is the max lvl of protection for troops? They said there are gun ports in the vehicles but those gun port do not seem to facilitate aiming of weapons but rather just poking the rifle out for firing. Lastly, they said those tonners are going to be transferred to the Guards formation. I wonder for wad purpose as I believe those would suit the logistic support ppls better as they may encounter convoy ambushes. This looks worrying as does this hint SAF might be sending larger contingents to more dangerous peace-keeping missions like middle-east? Would this mean NSF may be involved?</div></blockquote>Protect against small arms fire only. Try shoot a full mag of 7.62mm AP rds ( AK47 ), sure one or two rds will find its way to hit the poor driver  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>our waterbag is also from SOURCE this brand.<br>the quality of the bag can be considered good lah, but not the suction. washing is the hygiene part, so imagine some hidden particles from every leftover water is left behind...<br><br>the pads are of NO brand i suppose.<br>just a pad where its elastic wraps round your knee or elbow. think i have a photo of it but my site is down ATM. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>the pad is heaven send when u are proning with heavy stuff but it will one way or the other obstruct your movement. we were excited abt this 'heaven's reward' only for us to complain during our ROC training.</div>
