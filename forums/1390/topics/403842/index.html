              <p>When the news of the death of the officer first broke, I recall many dipshits blaming SAF. Turned out that the officer was killed by an NSF driver.</p>
              <p><strong>NSF fined $5,000 for running over officer</strong></p>
              <p>THE circumstances did not merit a jail term, so Private Muhammad Abdul Qaiyuum Muhammed Iskander was fined $5,000 after pleading guilty to accidentally reversing a Land Rover into Second-Lieutenant Nicholas Chan Wei Kit, 21, killing him last July.<br>District Judge Jill Tan also noted that Muhammad Abdul Qaiyuum was still traumatised by the tragic accident, and is still undergoing counselling nearly a year later.<br>The 19-year-old, who pleaded guilty yesterday to causing death by driving negligently, was also disqualified from driving all vehicles for four years.<br>He could have been jailed for up to two years, but Judge Tan said that while his negligence led to a tragic result, she felt that the circumstances did not make a jail term necessary.<br>The court heard that on July 3 last year, Muhammad Abdul Qaiyuum was with 2nd Lt Chan, who was then the Motor Transport Officer of the Infantry Training Institute in Jurong West.<br>Both were full-time national servicemen, and had gone with two other drivers to pick up two military Land Rovers from the motor workshop of Seletar Camp.<br>When Muhammad Abdul Qaiyuum started the engine of one of the vehicles at 11.50am, he noticed 2nd Lt Chan standing behind the vehicle through the rear view mirror.<br>When shifting to first gear, he inadvertently put the vehicle in reverse gear instead.<br>He stepped on the accelerator to move forward. To his shock, the Land Rover lurched backwards and smashed into a fence.<br>2nd Lt Chan was found pinned under a wheel.<br>The other two drivers ran to get help while Muhammad Abdul Qaiyuum stayed behind. He tried to talk to the injured officer but there was no response.<br>More personnel soon arrived and tried to lift the vehicle manually, but were unsuccessful. A military crane was then deployed at 12.15am and 2nd Lt Chan was rushed to the Changi General Hospital soon after.<br>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was administered, but he died at 1pm.<br>In the subsequent investigation, nothing wrong was found with the Land Rover. It was, however, in reverse gear, and Muhammad Abdul Qaiyuum admitted that this was his doing.<br>Asking the court to impose a fine and spare his client a jail term, defence counsel Rudy Marican pointed out that it was a tragic accident that could have happened to any driver.<br>His client was “immeasurably distressed at causing the death of an officer he knew and respected” and is still requiring counselling as he suffers from nightmares, said the lawyer.<br>Speaking to reporters after his parents paid the fine, Muhammad Abdul Qaiyuum said that he was very sorry over the loss of a life.<br>“My heart goes out to the family of 2nd Lt Chan. I’m still sad and constantly wish that it did not happen,” he said softly.<br>Mr Marican added that the family was relieved that the case is over, but realises that the Chans would never get over the loss of their only child.<br>“It’s a very sad case for all involved,” he said.<br>The parents of 2nd Lt Chan were also in court but were too distraught to comment.<br>khush@sph.com.sg</p>

              <p>Read carefully. The accident happened in July last year when KTPH was still under construction.</p>
              <p>Even at this point in time, KTPH will not accept serious medical cases until it is fully up and running. </p>

              <p><br>You are a fucking single cell amoeba to make this remark. Senseless racist remark that can fucking get yourself killed. I pray that you fucking. get stoned to death next time you set foor on Geylang Serai. Do you fucking even know how to engage a gear on a MID LandRover? Do you even fucking know that the gear position in a LandRover are even different to those in most Japanese/Continental motorcars?? Maybe you even fucking believe that all vehilcles are automatic nowadays.</p>

              <p>Its just a description like how Officer was used to refer to the late Nicholas in the same line. Why didnt the poster or even the subject poster call him Nicholas Chan? That's bcos people just describe lah. If the driver was Caucasian, Jew or Indian, I'm sure he'll also refer accordingly. Is describing someone in a reference rather than using their names mean they're animals? Then it shouldn't be limited to race but also on any form of description that isn't that person's name like rank, or gender eg woman</p>

              <p>Officer is in reference to a person of rank, but using the term "Malay" or whatever describe a race as in whole not the person in question. I am sure the driver was guilty of whatever he is charge for, not because he do not like the officer personally.  When i read his post i feel there is racist undertone there, intentional or not i do not know, but others who read it will take it as racism and will respond as such.</p>
