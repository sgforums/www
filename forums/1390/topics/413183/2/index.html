              <p><br>Seriously, you are ought to think thrice now...</p>
              <p>As mentioned from others, from your posts, we can see that <strong>you are only focus on 2 things: Salary &amp; the "prestige" (the so-called).</strong></p>
              <p>The uniform where almost all guys have them in their store room use them for their reservist ICTs. So where the exclusiveness?</p>
              <p>To sign on, if you doesn't have the passion and pride to serve the country, then over time, you will lose <strong>job satisfaction</strong>. Therefore, if you want to quit while on the Regular contract, you are considered to break the contractual bond, so you have to pay back the compensation. If you don't have the money to pay back, then you have to serve the minimum term of engagement (MTE) period of 5 years to be even considered to have done the 2 years of NS (Full-time).</p>
              <p><strong>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></strong>As with many militaries, there exists numerous rivalries such as officer/non-officer, combat/logistics divides, Army/Navy/Air Force.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;" title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from May 2009"><span style="font-size: x-small;">[<em><a title="Wikipedia:Citation needed" href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"><span style="color: #0645ad;">citation needed</span></a></em>]</span></sup> Fortunately, because the members of the SAF are thoroughly integrated into society at large, there are no major military/civilian issues.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;" title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from May 2009"><span style="font-size: x-small;">[<em><a title="Wikipedia:Citation needed" href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"><span style="color: #0645ad;">citation needed</span></a></em>]</span></sup></p>
              <p>Apart from such minor divisions, a more important dichotomy is observed between officers who are polytechnic or local university graduates (<strong>Farmers</strong>), and former scholarship holders who studied overseas (<strong>Scholars</strong>). This phenomenon exists because of fast-tracked careers, quick promotions, a dual-track career in the Civil Service after mandatory retirement offered as enticement for young men to take up SAF scholarships.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #0645ad;"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup> While this state of affairs has existed since the Singapore government started giving out scholarships, the issue was mentioned in <a title="Parliament of Singapore" href="/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Parliament</span></a> for the first time in a speech decrying the class-consciousness and social stratification resulting from the existing policies.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #0645ad;"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup></p>

              <p>A career with the army is similar to a job in many other industries. What characterizes this job is that there's loads of red tape. Very bureaucratic I would say but heck, this is the army. Subordination to powerful personnel within the industry is a must and you generally need to be somebody with "papers" to be able to climb the top rungs. But if you are talking about just a career with money, then yes..there's money and you generally get paid a higher rate at the start as compared to something of your qualification. That said, a career in any sector will do no good if the individual is not interested in the industry. For the army, you need to be someone who enjoys the camaderie of working alongside people with the same aspirations as you. Need to be able to stand a bureaucratic environment where opinions are seldom heard. (unless you are somebody)</p>
              <p>All in all, you never know if you will like it until you try it. For a start, throw away all your perceptions or rather misconceptions about the army, if any. Forget those glam tv commercials that depicts you as a high tech warrior. Do your bmt and get a feel before committing. I've seen many cases of people who signed on the dotted line during unit life when they are certain that the thing they are doing daily is what they wanna do, for a few years at least. Hope that helps.</p>

              <p>Firstly, I agree with some others that say "start your BMT first before deciding" cause it's hard to predict how u personally will enjoy military life.</p>
              <p>As a job, it has similarities to lots of other jobs, especially other public sector jobs (e.g. red tape, bureaucracy, long hours). But at the same time, it's got its plus points (e.g. support if u want to do higher education, work-life balance, job security). Also, there are lots of skills that u can pick up as a regular that can be transferred to the private sector, especially if go through a lot of their courses or pick up a specialization.</p>
              <p>But the thing that's unique about being a regular is that you have to realize ... it's not a JOB per se ... it's a calling. If you're joining and focused on salary, promotions, etc then this may not be thing for you cause you'll get jaded after awhile. BUT, if you're really interested in serving the nation as a military personnel, then you'll not only last a long time in the army but you'll enjoy yourself.</p>
              <p>My dad was a career military man and reached LTC before he retired and now he's working in private sector as a consultant. I've got uncle who served or are serving in the Army and Navy, and they're either doing well as Warrant Officers or Officers. And all of them have a good worklife balance with families that they are able to support well. None of them are super rich or super poor, but comfortably middle class.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, back to my 1st point, keep in mind the pros and cons, and go through BMT first and see if the military life is for you or not.</p>

              <p>I did consider it at one time. But I was declared medically unfit for combat since I have a history of asthma :(</p>
              <p>So I'm left with my ICT and when I go back, I try to do the best I can do since it's the least I can do to contribute to our military.</p>
              <p>Plus, I know that if one day my kids grow up and area interested and get the opportunity to become a regular, I would definitely support them :)</p>
