              Firstly, I am a new user here. I apologise if I have not used the search button properly, or if I have posted this at a wrong section. I thought this is a more reliable place to clarify some doubts which I have had in my mind currently. If I am not able to, I will seek from those who have been through this procedure when school re-opens perhaps.
              
              Anyway, regarding my question, I have come across till this particular page where I was asked to choose between a few options regarding deferment. I am currently 17 years old, and studying at Higher Nitec. I will be graduating in the year of 2013, where I will be 19 years old by then, or 18 since my birthday has not passed. If I were to defer with my current education information, will I be able to defer again when I step into Polytechnic?
              
              I mean, based on what I have heard, we are allowed to defer once only. I am not too sure as to how true is that. I have also read the FAQ where I am allowed to defer for Polytechnic before the age of 20 or 21, where I fit the criteria either ways. So, how will I be able to defer at that point of time?
              
              I am just worried that once I have submitted, I may not be able to make any changes. Given how strict Singapore laws can be at times, I rather play safe somehow. Sorry if this is rather unnecessary, but it just worries me. So, can anyone enlighten me further? Thank you.

              Ah, oh okay. Thank you. I am just uncertained as to what will I be receiving or what should I be doing once I have completed my current course. Hmm, seems like there are more to do apart from the first task that I have received.
              
              And yes, I have already clicked yes to apply deferment with my current education information. Thank you once again.
