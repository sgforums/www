              <p>hi. wat would u guys do if u all were to meet with such situation?</p>
              <p>You are a stay in personnel. of course, there are some other guys living together in same bunk. if one day one of ur bunkmate confess to u tat he's gay and he's very turned on when seeing other guys changing in bunk, walking around in boxer or underwear or when they walk out naked from bathroom after bathing.. he's having sexual fantasy of them and at times he feel like touching them when they are asleep...</p>
              <p>wat would u all do? he's not trying to be perverted but he cant control himself.. he confided in me bcos he's depressed and he trusts me as a friend and buddy and believe tat i will keep his secret.. i advised him to seek the help of MO but he's unwilling as he dun want others to know abt his problem and dun want this to be in his record.. wat should i do? Pretend tat i dunno? let him continue to ogle at the guys without them knowing? or at least let others know abt him so they will not accidentally do things to tempt my friend?</p>
              <p>haiz.. in a dilemma. rather that i dunno abt his sexual orientation..</p>

              <p>Just be a good friend and listen to his woes.</p>
              <p>If you tell the commanders or MO, you will get him into trouble. And I highly doubt he will go to the MO himself, since it could get him in trouble. </p>
              <p>However, if he tries to molest the other guys or sexually assault them, you will have no choice but to tell the truth to your commanders. </p>
