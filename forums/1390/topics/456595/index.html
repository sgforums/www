              <p>EAC,</p>
              <p>i would like to check how is the calculations of the compensation for 10% disability to be count? Which one of the pay slip are they using? Current company or during SAF Regular days? is the calculation based on the MOM calculator also? Because i called them and they said that SAF and other government sector has their own regulations on the compensation.</p>

              <p>My case is a sabotaged one. i was left out in Tekong Yankee 32 for 2 days exercise before i can proceed out to medical centre. and i have to skip myself to the Sispec bus terminal myself to go to the medical centre and report sick. thus i suffer badly now. i was given a 10% disabilty yesterday for my ankle as i got 2 ligament tear area. i was given the card also. i made my injury report in 2011 July 21. Gone for medical board yesterday with 10%. I'm thinking i might not be satisfy with the compensation. i paid back SAF my engagement bonus with the Infantry about 6400+SGD (SAFEC Scheme). </p>

              <p>First thing, first. Are you a NSF, regular or NSmen?</p>
              <p>I dont think you will be compensated for the case, unless you are an NSmen?</p>
              <p>If you are a NSF or regular, you rest, operate and rest until you are cured. Even my regular friend who broke his spine during an air jump accident. He was paid like a few hundred dollars from the SAF. He rested, operated, downgraded and then changed a new vocation. </p>
              <p>For NS men, it is your own insurance that is paying you (provided your insurance cover military activites. That includes you get choked by a fish bone in the camp).The SAF insurance would only pay you if you need to use your own limb for work. For an accident plan, it would be medical bills + months of not working only. </p>
              <p>For your case, you will just get operated and sew back the ligaments together. I don't think there would be compensation for your temporany disability.</p>

              <p>i think the compensation is very unfair too. it seem they will judge base on their own scale which is similar to mom worksman comp which is paying peanut.<br><br>for example the max scale of 180k, a person who earn 1k a mth, can easily hit the cap.</p>
              <p>needless to say, in that sense, compensation is way underrated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>would wish to know ur payout amount from hrsc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>how legit is below thread, i am not sure.</p>
              <p>someone claim, someone obtain high compensation.</p>

              <p>I feel sorry for you.</p>
              <p>Your ankle is torn beyond repair. The compensation is very little.</p>
              <p>About $20,000 is not even enough for me to buy two lots of DBS bank shares now.</p>
              <p>Try to seek for medial treatment, see whether they can sew back or replace the ligament using the hamstring ligament.</p>
              <p>I hope that you get more $$$ if you are regular.</p>
