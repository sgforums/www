            <div class='col-md body'>I was the first among my extended-family's generation to do NS, so quite sotong at first. More or less just live day-to-day through BMT &amp; course time, I guess.<br><br>Also had quit NPCC during sec school -- didn't like the tekaning, &amp; I mean real hazing by sadist Pre-U seniors -- so I instinctively just "squat one corner" dring the Tekong leadership tests.<br><br>Where I really grew up was about 21-22 months in. As my unit winded down to ROD, my BC called up the two A-Levels men in the BTY &amp; issued an ultimatum: follow 6 SIR overseas for jungle training, or be recycled to 46 SAR to serve out the extra 6 months' NS. Rather than kena the extra operational time, I chose the former.<br><br>Brunei was super-siong. My SOC timing would improve by 50 seconds to 8:06 after the 5 weeks there! (Not bad for an ex-fatty recruit.) But I also picked up an independent streak, being my unit's sole rep in that Arty attachment (3 officers &amp; 4 men of 4 different units). Not only must I fight alone for my off-in-lieus after my return (luckily with a new BC, with whom the bolder me discovered I could "boss" over"), but the unit itself had forgotten about me &amp; left me stranded at the airport! Thankfully, a 6 SIR tonner gave me a ride, albeit dropping me off (illegally) along the PIE highway near my home. My COS was so surprised at my phone call that he didn't reject when I told him about taking 2 days' off (not proper SOP, mind you).<br><br>When I finally reported back, my buddies commented how "hard" I looked (quite true, I had shrunken cheeks for the first time in my life). I also found out about my double promotion to CPL during my absence. Not long after, I was inducted (2 weeks!) as a BMT instructor by the incoming Arty Training Cadre to help out with the new mono-intake. Quite senang with the recruits -- was voted most popular &amp; the only instructor to receive everyone's signature on the POP photo ~lol~ -- &amp; then, as they moved on to trade course, spent my last 3 months' clearing my 40+ days of offs/leave. My unit wanted to attach me out again to Thailand (as an Arty controller) during this last period, but the emboldened me made a big fuss &amp; eventually they arrowed someone else. Wouldn't have mind going, actually, but the timing's all wrong for this lao-jiao by then ~lol~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me, I can't help but feel that my 1yr10mths NSF would be somewhat of a blight or dark spot in my life.<br><br>I was an SSG in a top NCC unit during my sec school days, so I was generally positive towards NS before enlisting.  I wanted to get at least 3 stripes on my sleeve.  Of course, when enlistment date neared, I was still lamenting, "why must we serve." Haha.  But I wasn't really scared or fearful.<br><br>Gradually throughout BMT, I slowly but surely lost interest in being a commander.  From my own BMT experience, reading through forums, advice from friends who had served and my BMT commanders' personal accounts, I felt command school wasn't for me.  Furthermore I just got attached before I enlisted (what a time huh. lol) and that definitely impacted my decision.  I wanted to burn as little weekends as possible.  I also hated route march with a passion...to me it's the most disgusting thing in NS.  Even worse than outfield...<br><br>I also got tired of the inane 'wait to rush rush to wait culture' and the inefficiency in general.<br><br>My eczema tended to flare up in BMT (at one point, my bunkmate was even freaked out when he saw my back view in the shower cubicle cos of the open wounds caused by me scratching due to the eczema...) so I decided to use it to downgrade when I learnt (via an 'interview') that I would be posted to a particularly shiong unit.  At the point I beat myself up for anyhow doing the computer test at CMPB during my medical checkup...<br><br>Things got really bad when I got posted to abovementioned unit.  I lived in trepidation day to day, having to do saikang while worrying first about whether I could get downgraded and then later about what would happen to me.  My unit also tended to ignore 'excuses' and push us to join in whatever training that was scheduled.  Someone with high blood pressure and downgraded to PES E was made to join in a high risk activity...I grew even more tired of the army.<br><br>Finally, a resolution.  I got downgraded to C9L9.  A couple weeks later, I got posted out, but not out of the camp.  Now I'm a clerk.  In my camp, it's probably the worse of both worlds.  I feel that as a combatant, if you're lucky to be posted into an 'interesting' vocation (read: NOT infantry or Guards or RP or Sea Soldier) there are at least interesting things to learn and experience to offset the general cons of chiong sua-ing.  As a clerk or other service personnel, life's generally more slack and you get more time for social commitments and for yourself, whatever you want to do which offsets the mind-numbing and boring office work.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Same thoughts and same problems. From young I had a deep interest in the military and wanted to go command sch. I had ezcema since young but it improved much before I enlisted. After I enlisted in Tekong to a rather slack company, I got sick of the inefficiency and how things were done. I lost interest in going command school too. Worse was that I was posted to an Infantry unit as a rifleman. Life there was tough and couldnt stand the environment. My mindset was also totally different from that of the mono intake people who were mostly hokien beng. I decided to downgrade using my ezcema problem. My ezcema tends to flare up after going outfield for days, so after one of my field camps, I saw the MO and subsequently got downgraded to C9L9 temporary and finally C1L3 permanent. Right now, I'm still in the same unit but serving as a clerk.<br><br>you're from infantry?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by k2406:</div><div class="quote_body">For me, I can't help but feel that my 1yr10mths NSF would be somewhat of a blight or dark spot in my life.<br><br>I was an SSG in a top NCC unit during my sec school days, so I was generally positive towards NS before enlisting.  I wanted to get at least 3 stripes on my sleeve.  Of course, when enlistment date neared, I was still lamenting, "why must we serve." Haha.  But I wasn't really scared or fearful.<br><br>Gradually throughout BMT, I slowly but surely lost interest in being a commander.  From my own BMT experience, reading through forums, advice from friends who had served and my BMT commanders' personal accounts, I felt command school wasn't for me.  Furthermore I just got attached before I enlisted (what a time huh. lol) and that definitely impacted my decision.  I wanted to burn as little weekends as possible.  I also hated route march with a passion...to me it's the most disgusting thing in NS.  Even worse than outfield...<br><br>I also got tired of the inane 'wait to rush rush to wait culture' and the inefficiency in general.<br><br>My eczema tended to flare up in BMT (at one point, my bunkmate was even freaked out when he saw my back view in the shower cubicle cos of the open wounds caused by me scratching due to the eczema...) so I decided to use it to downgrade when I learnt (via an 'interview') that I would be posted to a particularly shiong unit.  At the point I beat myself up for anyhow doing the computer test at CMPB during my medical checkup...<br><br>Things got really bad when I got posted to abovementioned unit.  I lived in trepidation day to day, having to do saikang while worrying first about whether I could get downgraded and then later about what would happen to me.  My unit also tended to ignore 'excuses' and push us to join in whatever training that was scheduled.  Someone with high blood pressure and downgraded to PES E was made to join in a high risk activity...I grew even more tired of the army.<br><br>Finally, a resolution.  I got downgraded to C9L9.  A couple weeks later, I got posted out, but not out of the camp.  Now I'm a clerk.  In my camp, it's probably the worse of both worlds.  I feel that as a combatant, if you're lucky to be posted into an 'interesting' vocation (read: NOT infantry or Guards or RP or Sea Soldier) there are at least interesting things to learn and experience to offset the general cons of chiong sua-ing.  As a clerk or other service personnel, life's generally more slack and you get more time for social commitments and for yourself, whatever you want to do which offsets the mind-numbing and boring office work.</div></blockquote></div>

Worse was that I was posted to an Infantry unit as a rifleman. Life there was tough and couldnt stand the environment. My mindset was also totally different from that of the mono intake people who were mostly hokien beng. I decided to downgrade using my ezcema problem.
