Btw, which vocation are u interested in exactly? There's wso(ada),wso(fighter),wso(C3),wso(uav). As far as i know, most pple go either C3 or ADA. The "chopping" rate for C3 is very high and for ADA, be prepared to run even more in ur SBO + MANPAD during ur weapons training phase in air force sch. As for wso(fighter), it is highly unlikely for a woman to be selected.<br><br>Btw, wat course are u taking now? If u are an engin student, then i suggest u think it thru b4 signing on as a combat officer. U'll clock zero relevant experience after ur four yr stint in the armed forces. In tat case, it wld be better for u to sign on as an aeo or join the navy as an neo.</div>
