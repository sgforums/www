              <p>Alot of ppl here don't know: Tough training is different from tekan.</p>
              <p>Gohmatthew, this is not right but you can't win everything. Your son will be fucked back for every little thing if you complain.</p>
              <p>What goes around comes around. My motto:</p>
              <p><strong>* In camp you fuck me every day, out of camp life fuck you every day.</strong> *</p>
              <p>Your son was fucked by one broke son of a bitch.</p>
              <p>Even if he is not a broke son of a bitch, he is still a son of a bitch.</p>
              <p>He may be a pathetic wank.</p>
              <p>Even if he is not a pathetic wank, he may not stay married for long.</p>
              <p>Even if he stays married for long, he may not raise good children.</p>
              <p>Even if he raises good children, they may not look after him.</p>

              <p>BMT is BMT la... 100 push ups for punishment is already wth.  I'm not a very fit guy, but I remember doing (or trying to do) 100 push ups for warm up.  It felt like it was insane but like what the rest say, just suck thumb and do. Push ups, just do lor... cannot do also just pretend to hump the floor and shout out louder.  Sgt scold just take lor...  One ear in, one ear out.  Smile smile, "Yes, Sgt!" but whisper to myself, "Pray I don't find a big fat centipede during field camp and throw it inside your SBO."  </p>
              <p>BMT teaches an important life lesson.  There are just somethings that you can do fucking nothing about.  Just suck it up, and get through with it. Just like NS. =)</p>

              <p>I can only say that it's for his own good and since it's just BMT, the road is long ahead of him.</p>
              <p>If 100 push-ups as punishments are deemed to be overdose then my guess is your son cant even pass IPPT.</p>
              <p>"1 for all and all for 1" mentality is inculcated through training such as this. I'm pretty sure you will be the first to fled Singapore, the place you call home when there's a war.</p>
              <p>I'm sure your son will grow up just like you: unable to handle the tough times and gives up at the slightest discomfort of situation. It's a good thing that Singapore needs more people like this so that the better citizens can get better benefits that they deserves.</p>

I meant some commander like section commander is allowed to give 2o push up. It is really surprising to lump tough training n tekan together. This is creating a situation where parent like to intervene in their son;s NS matter. ST forum reportedly has a parent filing a complain demanding an answer in a serviceman reprort sick outside,if MC is given less than 6 days, will he need to come back to endorse the MC. Some of the commanders really bloody ignorant of the training regulation.</p></div>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Recently my son did his BMT training at Tekong. There was this over enthusiastic NSF Sgt who goes around punishing recruits for the slightest mistakes they made and even coughing during fall in will get you 40 push-ups as punishment.</p>
              <p>He usually rotates his victims and catch them for slightest mistakes made and minimum punishment from him is 40 to 100 push ups. Once my son was caught for a mistake and told to do 100 push-ups. Despite trying his best to complete the 100 push-ups, he was accused for not trying and given another punishment which is lifting the rifle over his head. Already so tired from doing the push-ups, he now lifted his rifle overhead and despite that was accused again for not trying his best because he bended his arm and the Sgt punished the entire platoon with more push-ups. </p>
              <p>Don't they have check and balance system to make sure that all trainings are contained within certain set perimeters instead of whims and fancy of individual Sgts.</p>

              <p>Ask ur son call SAF hotline if buay Tahan.</p>
              <p>Ask ur son if cannot take it go report to MO to see army psychiatrist or ask MO to refer to counuselling centre.If cannot take the training see private psychiatrist also can.</p>
              <p>U complain to OC also can should have given u the OC or CO office number.</p>
