              <p>yep, though we can safely say conditions did have an improvement... subjected to how each individual company does its training; QFT.</p>
              <p>and actually everything stems from the environment itself, not so much on the sgts or the officers/wo. being the centre of BMT, no choice certain things have to be done unpleasantly which many say they do not like/wish to do. when in unit, not so much of shyt; and sometimes, sticking thru thick and thin even transcends across boundaries.</p>
              <p>"Is that what army teach the boys when next time they are sgt,
              they also torture the new boys?" all in all it's the environment issue; alot of sgts who passed out from sispec also go unit doing other vocations, which is what most prefer. in fact nowadays lesser nsfs get postings that deal with new boys as u call it. not like the older days</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Recently my son did his BMT training at Tekong. There was this
              over enthusiastic NSF Sgt who goes around punishing recruits for
              the slightest mistakes they made and even coughing during fall in
              will get you 40 push-ups as punishment.</p>
              <p>He usually rotates his victims and catch them for slightest
              mistakes made and minimum punishment from him is 40 to 100 push
              ups. Once my son was caught for a mistake and told to do 100
              push-ups. Despite trying his best to complete the 100 push-ups, he
              was accused for not trying and given another punishment which is
              lifting the rifle over his head. Already so tired from doing the
              push-ups, he now lifted his rifle overhead and despite that was
              accused again for not trying his best because he bended his arm and
              the Sgt punished the entire platoon with more push-ups. </p>
              <p>Don't they have check and balance system to make sure that all
              trainings are contained within certain set perimeters instead of
              whims and fancy of individual Sgts.</p>

              <p>2. My platoon keep getting turnout at night for partying at night to relieve daily stress, and in army, 7 hours of uninterrupted rest = meal breaks, rest between activities, lectures in lecture room or auditorium etc, means whenever no activity = counted into the 7 hrs of rest, for this dunnid to fight with army le.</p>

              <p>If the BMT Sergeant needs to punish his men excessively to keep up the discipline, i think the fault lies with the platoon instructors and officer. Soldiers of today are different from the past, they are educated to start with and are more inquisitive than the soldiers of my father's generation who are not highly educated or not English educated. My dad told me his platoon commander  in 1969 was only O levels educated.</p>
              <p>Leading by fear is easier to inculcate military life into recruits than leading by leadership. Unfortunately that will only increase animosity and the lack of initiative by the soldiers during a moment of crisis. I went through BMT during a time where it was really strict and punishments can vary from mild to downright sadistic. But when i become a commander myself, i realise that it cannot work in a combat unit, where trust within each other is paramount regardless of rank. That is why in my reservist infantry battalion the most screwed up commanders tend to be formerly BMT instructors.</p>

              <p>Bro, I just completed BMT like 2 months ago.</p>
              <p>1. I kena 200 push up for unsatisfied standby area before I just
              do.</p>
              <p>2. My platoon keep getting turnout at night for partying at

              le.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">technically it shouldnt be that way.. the 7 hours directive is meant for those in BMT to have 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep at night.. like if reville is at 5.30am, latest time to lights off is strictly by 10.30pm. whatever breaks there are during daytime doesnt count into it, though some ppl may contest that rest between activities counts also =/ so did your coy give u enough sleep at night? hope u all didnt actually party when u are supposed to be sleeping. the turnout is mainly due to excessive noise?</span></p>
