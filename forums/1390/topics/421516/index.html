              <p>Hi, if I have a 1 year temporary pes status, how long do I have to wait before trying to go for a medical review to make it permanent again? For reviews, do I have to bring any documents/specialist memos if I have already submitted them? I am since not seeing my specialist anymore because the condition has already by diagnosed.</p>
              <p>Last month it was published in the RO that I have an appointment at the medical center for a review, and when I went there I kenna screw by the MO because there's still 3 more months before my temp pes expires. I feel that he is being very unprofessional so I ask, what are my rights exactly in this situation?</p>

              <p>Normally u need to go for a review 1mth before your Pes status is up, also u need to bring along your latest doc memo on your condition so you can either be up/down graded again.</p>

              <p>Well u can go before your 1 year is up, but you need to provide new memo of your condition, the temp 1 year is normally give for you to sort out your problem with your doctor. Of cos in some case, if you did not provide enough evidences that you are still undergoing tx or etc, you are deemed fit and be upgraded.</p>

              <p>i have patellofemoral pain syndrome, i think otherwise known as runners knee.</p>
              <p>my specialist told me that they have done everything they can do for me (physio, insoles) and that there are no new updates for my condition since it will probably always be there.</p>
              <p>when i told the MO this, he still asked for a memo of some sort. when i told him there's no memo he flared up at me and said 'i know what games u are playing here'</p>
              <p>is it impossible to get a perm pes status before my temp pes runs out? i am not trying to downgrade myself and would be glad even if he brought me up to pes b. but he seems to be of the opinion that i am trying to chaogeng and even refered me to the ortho in mmi.</p>

              <p>Ok, since that's the case, simple either ask the MO to request for your medical condition from your specialist or tell your specialist to write something on your condition to the MO. Then whether up/down grade then depends on board.</p>
