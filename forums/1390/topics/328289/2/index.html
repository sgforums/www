              <p>Go have a chat with your camp Orientation Officer (OO for short). Or the officer who took over the role of OO in 3G SAF. Ask camp RSM if need be. Do not be afraid. During my time,  OOs were present in camps to handle cases exactly like yours.</p>
              <p>If you got problems outside camp, RSM can help by putting you in touch with the appropriate Provost section if need be. Tell them your problem, and they will take over from there on. Follow their instructions to you.</p>

In fact, one can be easily jaded by it. Not to mention the fatigue, mental and physical stress upon it.  But of course, find something to motivate u. Book out is a main motivation for most NSFs. In case, it might be alittle hard to imagine and await for.<br><br> Then, there are somethings that can make u life easier, if possible, a small radio while on duty? Or some of ur favourite tibits to eat along ur rest time. I am not sure what u are exactly doing, so i hope this can help?<br><br>  Anyway, u said the problem is 'me'. But what trait of you, that is making u so stressed? Not adjusted to camp life? Someone in camp fugging u up, that u find difficult to ignore?  During NS, it is a time of change. U can try changing for the better, making urself tougher. It isn't easy. But at the end of it, u will feel satisfied about urself.<br><br>I think u really should tell us what exactly about 'me' is the problem ... ... Then, there will be more direct and helpful advice/suggestions.  Meanwhile, dun AWOL, it is the next most stupid thing to do.<br><br><br>Edit: *Quote removed with respect to TS request*</p></div>

              <p>=/ Please take things easily and don't do anything irrationaly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like what others have adivised you to do so, speak to your PC and OC first, let them know that you're not doing well mentally, and you're on the verge of breaking down. And most importantly, you're having sucidal thoughts. You must let them know that this is not a keng case.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If after all this, they still don't give a phuck, you give a call to the SAF hotline, let them know your situation and you've already went to the COC but no one is willing to render aid to you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally, you must have some faith in humanity. Don't keep thinking, "no one cares about me, I tell them they will just tell me to phuck off". There are people who cares about you. Don't give up without trying!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Keeping everything to yourself is very torturous. Sometimes, all you need is just to relax and confide in someone you trust, it need not be a "proffesional" like a psychiatrist. Do you have a religion? Perhaps confide in them? Your family? Let them know, see how they can help.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you really think that all these is not going to help, then please, seek help from the MO to get a refferal to a psychiatrist. Why worry bout your future being messed up, when your current life will soon be if you don't get help soon? Don't worry about people condeming you in the future. People who can think will judge you positively, as you're one who knows what's wrong with yourself and is willing to bring a change about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm sure most of the forumers here will be more than willing to lend you our ears. If you think your message can't be displayed publicly, maybe a private message will do?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All the best for you! =)</p>

              <p>subsequently, i had to go for physiotheraphy every wed at 930am and my coy always call me to take the 1st fast craft out of tekong. i always reach mainland at around 7 in the morning. on mainland, my parents will be somewhere nearby waiting for me to cal them and pick me up to have breakfast with me. after that, they send me to CGH for the session and bring me home to rest. when its time to book in, my dad will send me back to SFT. this went on till i POP. can u imagine, every week my parents wake up so early to fetch me?</p>
              <p>hope that by telling u my story, it will help u make up your mind to speak to your family. if not, u can always pm me and tell me what's bothering u.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Yup, u could PM me also, if u feel the nedd to talk ... <br><br>  There is chinese saying, (loosely translated) At home, u depend on ur family, Outside, u depend  on ur frens. <br><br>  As frens, they shouldn't shun u because u have a strange problem. If so, then they are worthy to be ur frens ... Give it a try... They might become up with better suggestions because they know u better than us here. <br><br>  Anyway, being labelled whatever stupid lame name in camp, doesn't matter. Once u go out n ORD, u realised that u start everything again, learning things on the job, build new relations. I have like 101 nicknames in camp, some harmless, while some insulting. <br><br>But no, i still make sure i tell those where the line is, if they cross it, they will not going to feel happy either ... Since u are doing some sort of security duties, it is hard to adapt and make it ur rountine. Worse still, it messes up ur body clock and everything. It will be tough adapting to it.  Make it into a goal urself. If u can adapt more or less there, treat urself to something nice. (The other non-material thing is pride and self-satisfication, but that will be ahard to impress upon u, and like most ppl said it "what is pride, can it be eaten?")<br><br>As for duty wise, as i am not in it, i can't comment much. I duno how long has this been going on. But maybe whoever planned it, say "this mth xiong for this guy, next mth xiong another guy" Maybe, did u clarify whyy u duty so much? If the reply is unsatisfactory (like ask u to suck thumb n FO) , u can go up the Chain Of Command. I am sure, in such duties, they certainly do not want to overstress any person to make Dave Teo 2. <br><br><br> There is a chance that the SAF hotline will direct back to ur unit. BUT if ur case is genuine, there is no need to be afraid of. If u are afraid of people laughing (or hating or anything) at ur problem, then there is forever no way to solve ur problem. And u came here to solve the problem, right ???</p></div>

              <p>Hi desperatelyextreme</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am a Singaporean psychologist who now works in Australia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Been a long time since I ORD, and I'm not too familiar with how the SAF Counselling Centre works. Seems like you feel that talking to your officers or MO is not going to work. Likely because they are 'part of the problem' (Just my postulation, but I believe most of the forummers here would agree some officers can be a pain in the arse). One option available is to go see a private counsellor on weekends when you book out. I don't think you need to see a psychiatrist at this stage. There are counsellors in non-profit agencies, e.g family service centres, or those in private practices. Every one has his own unique experience undergoing NS. Sometimes it is not just about gritting your teeth and getting through it like how 'the others' did. Each of us carry our own past experiences in life, and these can have profound impact on the way we cope with NS. Also, I understand not everyone have a supportive family they can turn to. As for confidentiality, don't worry. Counsellors are bounded by their professional ethics to keep your information private. Of course there are exceptions. In your case given you mentioned suicide ideation there is a duty of care to break that confidentiality if necessary to ensure your physical and emotional safety. Without your permission, and if not in contrary to duty of care, the private counsellor you see do not have to and can not inform your officers you've been to see him/her. I cringed when I read that the person you spoke to on the SAF Hotline behaved so unprofessionally. I am sure you will get better service and understanding from counsellors outside SAF.</p>

              <p>yeah, TS should go see an outside doctor.</p>
              <p>i personally never see MO during my 2 years of NS cos' i don't trust those farkers.</p>
              <p>it's like they have diploma level only and their attitude / service really sucks and i rather pay S$35 to see outside clinic doctor.</p>
              <p>and don't trust the SAF hotline or counsellors......find outside ones.</p>
              <p>SAF counsellors, you can more or less expect the attitude.</p>
              <p>and you must keep telling yourself to live life day by day, DO NOT LOOK ahead!!!!!</p>
              <p>yes, in life, we must plan for the future, but you're in NS now, and if you look ahead and plan far, you will go crazy because you're hating every day of your life now.</p>
              <p>sometimes in my NS life back then, i was something like you, but i live day by day, and then, before i knew it, 1 month gone.....and after some times, 6 months gone....</p>
              <p>i can tell you that after your NS has passed 1 year, the remaining 1 year will be easy, because around the 10th month or so, you'll be clearing all your off-in-lieu, leave, entitled off etc.....plus the public holidays, sats and suns......and you're left with only 8.5 - 9 months.</p>
              <p>and you also need to get a life outside camp after your booking out.</p>
              <p>like when you book out sat, you should take up some hobbies you like, like Wow or DOTA gaming etc.</p>
              <p>too much escapism is not good, but escapism and fantasy can really relieve your stress and if you don't get obsess with them, they can solve a lot of your stress.</p>
              <p>really must integrate some escapism into your life and it's what helped people like me pass NS.</p>
              <p>and taunts and verbal abuse is very common......will get much lesser once you become lao jioa, don't worry.</p>
              <p>the one thing you should never do is : DO NOT BECOME A 2ND DAVE TEO!!!!!!!</p>
              <p>it's the worst farking mistake any NSF can make in life and it's not worth it.</p>

              <p>if like me recently, got mild fever + dierea + dizziness + flu, then of course costs will go up. :-D</p>
              <p>anyway, i never trust new doctors, including MO.</p>
              <p>10 / 10 times u see these noob docs, they wrongly diagnose the condition.</p>
              <p>e.g: got one time new doctor gave me wrong type of medicine for my fever and i end up vomitting severely</p>
              <p>e.g: got one time new doctor gave me too strong medicine and i got diereal for days</p>
              <p>e.g: got one time new doctor gave me medicine too weak and i end up going back to see him 2 times still cannot recover, then later i went to another doctor</p>
