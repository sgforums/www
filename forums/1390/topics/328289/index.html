              <p><br>saf hotline person might route back this problem to the unit 's s1 branch.<br><br>hospital / polyclinic maybe can. the doctor i think will write a referral letter to an saf psychiatrist for appointment.</p>

              <p>May I ask why you have to see the NS doctor?</p>
              <p>You work normal hours, at least some of the days, right?</p>
              <p>Perhaps you could see a normal doctor. Most work into the night, some until midnight.</p>
              <p>Have a chat with them, and get a referral from them. Even if you dont get the referral, the doctor, if male, will understand since they will likely have done NS as well.</p>

              <p>Problem with Accepting that Camp life is "Like that one lor"</p>
              <p>It is not a church and this is Singapore , Mix of Kacang Puteh and Rojak.</p>
              <p>Nobody can treat U like your family does. You have to learn to be independent and figure out the jungle yourself , soon you will find that NS is nothing compared to the private sector.</p>
              <p>Working  in the real Singapore flooded by sickening FTs that promises your bosses everything and delivers nothing then leave all the "Sai Kang to you" After it is done, they raise their heads higher than yours and demands more than you.</p>
              <p>If we're not ready to face the world you can start now in NS working with true rojak people who have to earn our Citizenship.</p>
