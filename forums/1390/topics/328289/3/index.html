              <p>To desperatelyextreme: That's the way mah! must relax, don't take NS too seriously.</p>
              <p>just do what you're told, and don't be too garang or too slack.</p>
              <p>be a "good" soldier, not thinking soldier.</p>
              <p>although chief of army says he wants thinking soldiers, if you try this, you'll get back-stab by superiors who think you're trying to be smart alec.</p>
              <p>try to keep low profile also.</p>
              <p>whenever you're very depressed, just read the following paragraph below or have it tattooed onto your chest:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>All Singaporean males have to serve NS, so be it. It's only 2 farking years, we just farking serve and return to the government, and we serve and fark off. You're not the first victim of NS, and you won't be the last. Your father, my father, me myself etc.....we're do NS not because we love SG or love the gahmen......it's because we have no other choice.</p>
              <p>This is in return for being born in Singapore, a country with no natural disasters or war. Or would you prefer to be born in a country with no NS but has tons of war, conflicts and earthquakes etc.?</p>
              <p>How many people like to serve NS? last time in my camp of 70 people excluding regulars, no NSF wanna serve one more day of NS.</p>
              <p>if you're depressed and you want to kill yourself, then YOU LOSE, your family lose and the SG gahmen WINS. You want that to happen?</p>
              <p>show them how farking brave you are by not dying and living through these 2 years (minus weekends, minus holidays, minus off-in-lieu, minus leave and entitlement, its not even 1.6 months of NS!!!!)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After NS, you can return to civilian life and enjoy liao. Civilian life got fun, got girls, got</p>
              <p>sex, got laughter, got joy.......that should be your main motivation for passing NS.</p>
              <p>now, just live day by day and don't count. Before you know it........ORD LOH!!!!!! FFI clearance! collect pink IC!!!!!! i can still remember that i felt like a god on my ORD day. :D</p>
              <p>and don't try to keng........because superiors and mates can spot it easily and give you hell.</p>
              <p>try to be involved in NS, try to have a positive vibe, try to be helpful and others will be kind towards you in return, no kidding.</p>
              <p>and some time from today, things will get way better when you become lao-jiao and see new NSFs being posted into your camp.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>on a side note, i agree with what Angmokio says:</p>
              <p>NS for Singaporean males, Jobs for foreign talents (meaning, rich fat big white expats).</p>
              <p>however, i would like to edit his sentence with:</p>
              <p>NS for Singaporean males, Jobs <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and SG girls</strong></span></span> for foreign talents</p>
