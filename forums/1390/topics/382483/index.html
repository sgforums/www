              <p><span style="color: #333399;">Well, I kinda experienced this when i went over to this camp to pass my brother some things. I had to head to the pass office to exchange for a pass. Well I did not bring along my IC along with me and so I asked if my other id was ok which is my club id. It has my photo, my ic, full name.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">Well the person who attended to me said no. Then he interrogated me. (1) He said "Why you didnt bring your IC". (I need a reason to not to bring, i didnt know i had to?). Well I replied, "Cos i left it at home?" WOW then guess what he said. (2) HE said "Why you put at home?" (Isnt this guy too much?) (FYI, im a civilian) I replied, " Cos I forgot to bring?" (3) He asked again, "Why you forgot to bring?!" I was so pissed that I said, "You mean i cant forget to bring?" </span></p>
              <p>Well i was rejected of my id.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">I mean what kinda attitude is that fellow trying to do to a civilian? No respect? If he doesnt even respect someone who is a civilian, how does he respect officers?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">Then I asked for his name. He covered his name on his No. 4. But ive already managed to see it. So I wanted to speak to one of his superior to clarify his disgusting way of talking. Well I know in the pass office there wouldnt be any officer around. But i asked him. He asked the SGT who happens to be oblivious as well. So i waited there for 10 min without anyone doing anything.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">Annoyed, I sent a mail to Mindef, Chief Of Army and etc. The reply I got was only from the Customer Service Officer which was, "We have already informed the camp and the person attended to me will be councelled." </span><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>What is the actual punishment n procedure for such barbaric and uncivilised manners? You mean they put such gangsters to interact with the public? SAF taught this to them for NS? Don't think they'd teach immoral values. Lack of manners you can forget talking about discipline to protect the citizens and country. Try asking him to speak this manner to his officers and see what he get, COUNSELLING? In his dreams. So the punishment from mindef is counselling? </strong></span></p>

              <p>Are civilians wanting to pass things to someone in camp even allowed to enter the camp?</p>
              <p>In the past, i never allow civilians into camp for such a reason except those who are driving into camp to fetch their spouse. Those who want to pass something to anyone, normally we call the person to come down to the guard room and they pass each other the stuff at the gate with the NSF inside camp and the civilian outside camp.</p>
              <p>Anyway the person was doing his job and its just a matter of attitude which is mostly just going to get him a verbal warning only.</p>

              <p>Exactly.  I'd be looking at the brother for a potential security breach.</p>
              <p>Second, as GC or DO I would have been reprimanding the guard - for wasting that much time talking to this chick.  All he had to do was say, "No IC no entry" and be done with it.</p>
              <p>Third, the kid was most likely an NS man.  He's one of the unwilling, going into the unknown to do the unnecessary for the ungrateful, and here you have a sanctimonious little peahen trying to justify her fuckup at the same time expecting service as if she was at a counter in Tangs instead of at the gate of a military facility.  Really now, who owes who an apology?</p>

              <p>Fair nuff.  Like I said, the kid should have told her that an IC was required, and if no IC was produced there was no more scope for discussion.  That should have been the end of that, but he decided to be a smartarse and got a slap on the wrist for it, and given that two attempted breaches of security protocols were attempted by this girl and her brother, she's got some cheek demanding that the kid be punished.</p>
              <p>For God's sake, she wrote to the Chief of Army on account of the kid being rude - does she think the COA has nothing better to do than deal with petty bullshit like this?  Who the hell does she think she is?  What's next, 7 days DB for sneezing in the wrong direction?</p>

If you cannot get in surely you can leave it in the guard room and ask the guy to pick it up later. The guard is right not to let you in with only some clubs ID. Surely you can used your driving license? Anyway did not let u in also complained  but if let u in, wait you go complained our Army camp security so lax.....then more problem</p></div>

              <p>Sorry, I am with Gedanken on this.</p>
              <p>1. It was a military establishment you are attempting to enter, not some shopping centre or restaurant. All military camps have restricted access to those who have no valid reason to enter, due to the sensitive nature of work and armed conduct being carried out inside.</p>
              <p>2. All military personnel are trained to be aggressive, espacially those on guard duty. In this day and age of terrorism, where even bespectacled plumb pettite ladies can carry bombs strapped on their bodies, such as what happened in India, guards have a special responsibility to be suspicious. Hundreds of our boys lives inside the camp are dependant on his performance.</p>
              <p>3. NRIC is the best form of identification, for it is tamper proof, unlike other identification papers. If you did not bring such along, it is only correct our guards deny your request and even interogate your intentions. You had made a mistake and you are in the wrong.</p>
              <p>4. It is our responsibility to carry our NRIC everday. To forget is not excusable. In Malaysia, you would be rudely hauled to the police station, treated as an alien,  and you will have to call someone who knows you to come forward and identify you before letting you go. Similarly, police here can do and would do the same, but without the corruption and seldom with rudeness. Again, you are at fault.</p>
              <p>5. In our attempts to be a gracious society, be glad that you had a reply from SAF. But our guard must never be let down. Lives are dependant on it. Infact, from this incident, I will promote the guard if i had the power to do so. He did the right thing, at the right place and at the right time - stopping an entry for one with no identification and aggresively interogating her intentions. A military camp is not a restaurant.</p>

              <p>The guard is supposed to stop unauthorised entry into any army camp. In fact, bringing an IC to change for a camp pass does not mean that army camps are places where any civilian can just change their pass and go in for a walk. In practice, many camps do not even allow civilians in without official reason with or without an IC.</p>
              <p>Noone will know whether the message is really relayed down to the respective unit or individual. This is the type of thing that they may just discard without relaying down but just giving a PR reply to TS juz for the sake of replying.</p>
