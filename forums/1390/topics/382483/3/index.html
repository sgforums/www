              <p>Do note that an airport is a public place but a military base is a place of high security and no civilian is allowed to enter a military camp without proper identification or purpose.</p>
              <p>A RP can challenge anyone who request to enter the camp and its the proper thing a RP should do and reject entry to anyone without proper forms of identification. Further questioning is up to the individual RP and he did not ask anything that is considered stupid in the eyes of security.</p>

              <p>U don't have to force your way in. As long as you request to
              enter the camp, ur intentions is more important and whether letting
              you in or not is a different matter.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Your example is one of trying to enter illegally. As such i highlighted that TS was trying to enter via legal means. And i believe it is consencus that the guard can refuse entry.</span></p>
              <p>How would you know whether someone is just trying to come closer
              to the camp to spy on the camp etc?</p>
              <p>Do not rely on wikipedia for anything important. Please go read
              the actual penal code if you want to be sure since you cannot go
              tell a police when they caught you for breaking a law that
              wikipedia says that its not against the law.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">I believe i pointed out that within the National Registration Act, it does not say that it is a must to carry it. Anyway, even if a person who does not bring around her IC is punishable, the military also dont have authority over it. The guard can deny entry but nothing else.</span></p>

              <p>sbst275 u keep mention about the guard attitude and ORD liao all

              <p>For god sake.. he is doing his job.. I think the guard did his

              <p>In the first place, the guard may have politely ask for "her"

              <p>"she" can't produce it, the guard has the right to be on alert
              and ask what is the intention of coming here. Without being able to
              produce a proper identification.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #333399;">I was so pissed that I said, "You

              <p>That is her reply what. Reply comes after the question. And i believe the guard asked some pretty silly questions. I mean, for the sake of sanity, what information is he trying to obtain by asking the following:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;"> "Why you didnt bring

              <p>Airport is not related to SAF so there is no need to discuss or talk so much about the airport here. The point is simply that you do not enter a security organsation without proper identification and purpose.</p>
              <p>As long as you choose to enter any restricted place, you are subjected to the questioning of the guards but you are not forced to answer anything you do not want to since you are free to leave the way you came.</p>

              <p>I will clearly define for you which areas are restricted in Changi Airport. I know this, because I have dealings there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cargo Complex and that area along Airline House, Freight Ter and ATC tower is definitely restricted. So are the points at BT, T1, T2, and T3 AFTER you pass immigration.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All areas which the public can currently access is called securitised public domain, which means the public can move in and out, but there is a heightened sense of security(that is why there are guards patrolling there). But to clarify, that is NOT a restricted zone.</p>

              <p>Theres always a difference between in camp and out of camp. The job of anyone in the guardroom does not require politeness and that is strictly on no part of the guardroom standing order that my guards must be polite to anyone who tries to enter the camp.</p>
              <p>For external events however, behavior is something that has more importance and more focused on. Do not bother saying they need to always be polite etc so that they will be polite during such events since not everyone is polite all the time in the 1st place and only when its needed. Thats simply just human nature.</p>
              <p>Even if you are a tax payer, that does not mean you deserve anything. Go to alot of shopping centers and even a paying customer does not ensure you surely get good service when service is their job and not that of the SAF.</p>

              <p>Personally, i give my guards the right to question anyone who wants to enter the camp since thats their job. TS or anyone else has no obligations to answer anything and is free to leave if he/she wants to.</p>
              <p>Sometimes questioning can result in certain clues or slips in a person's motives into an army camp which might be questionable. There should be no reason to stop or disallow questioning even if most people are normal civilians since we cannot even afford any cases of security breaches. Its always better to be safe than sorry.</p>

              <p>Remember that TS was not held in the guardroom and forced to answer any questions. She was free to leave if she did not want to answer anything but she chose to answer. Since TS chose to answer, there is no reason for her to come complain here since in a way she asked for it</p>
              <p>Anyway, sometimes its the indirect questions where people gives the slips and not direct questions which any terrorist etc would have prepared to answer.</p>
              <p>Tax are paid to purchase equipment and support the army not paid for SAF to provide you any customer service when you visit an army camp uninvited. Your safety is the only service SAF has to and has given you.</p>

              <p>I don't see why this has to become a huge issue.</p>
              <p>A simple polite but firm line of "Sorry, you need your NRIC/Driving Licence to sign in because it is the only official identification allowed" would have sufficed.</p>
              <p>TS's brother should have gone out of camp to collect the item instead. With the security climate as it is today, it is understandable that guards are more vigilant and suspicious of non-regular visitors to their camps.</p>
