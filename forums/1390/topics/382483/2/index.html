              <p>Driving license etc are allowed because they are more or less official identification given but things like clubs ID cards that the TS tried to give cannot be used as such cards can be fraud easily, using a false name and just putting a person's photo on it.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The guard are to be on alert and question anyone that comes near to the gate without a proper reason to enter. Passing thing to ur brother is not a proper reason, the guard need not have to compromise that. Who knows what is inside the bag? Maybe a bomb..</p>

              <p>Okay.... I had an exam in the morning, so I missed this topic.</p>
              <p>Let me sum up a few things:</p>
              <p>1. The guard did the correct protocol. No valid ID means no entry, period. And valid ID refers to official photo ID (e.g. IC, driving licence, 11B). Club/gym pass is not valid, because it is not from the powers-that-be, and they are more easily faked.</p>
              <p>Imagine if Mas Selamat gets in with a gym card that says 'Lim Ah Mas'. Dang....</p>
              <p>Anyway, this is just basic common sense. You want to enter an official restricted area, you need to have official ID. Seriously, no one needs to be told about that.</p>
              <p>2. The guard should have been a bit more tactful. After all, we're dealing with civillians here. Just stand firm and say, 'Sorry, but I need your IC before I can change your pass.'</p>
              <p>Just do your job with both firmness and tact. If the civillian were to raise a ruckus and escalate it up to the Chief of Army..... so be it. Which brings me to my next point.....</p>
              <p>3. Escalating this minor issue to MINDEF, the Chief of Army, <em>et al </em>is seriously, for the lack of a better way to say it...... taking it to <em>ridiculous </em>extremes.</p>

              <p>Aiyo, dun be so harsh on her la. The guard has the right to deny entry. But does he have the right to interrogate(as claimed by TS) civillians which i assume has not entered the camp proper (i guess shes at the guardhouse.) Is he overstepping his authority?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;"> (1) He said "Why you didnt
                                      bring your IC". (I need a reason to not to bring, i didnt know
                                      i had to?). Well I replied, "Cos i left it at home?" WOW then guess
                                      what he said. (2) HE said "Why you put at home?" (Isnt this
                                      guy too much?) (FYI, im a civilian) I replied, " Cos I forgot to
                                      bring?" (3) He asked again, "Why you forgot to bring?!" I was so
                                      pissed that I said, "You mean i cant forget to bring?"</span></p>
              <p> I can understand if he askes about the purpose of the visit.But the questions he asked is also abit erm.. weird.  If he asked in a stern manner, its somewhat intimidating. If he asked in a more informal manner, its like trying to be funny. And what is he trying to find out by asking such questions? Anyway, whether a person brings IC or not on the streets also doesnt concern the military what.</p>

              <p>In the guardroom, the guard has his authority in a sense. Just like everywhere u go, u can't enter without going through the guards at the entrance so he has authority the question anyone though the questions might not seem appropriate.</p>
              <p>However do note that as mentioned by many others, everyone is supposed to carry their IC with them at all times and u cannot blame a guard for being suspicious of someone who does otherwise. Sometimes guards find suspicious ppl by such questioning and observing their behavior like the case of a RP who caught someone who tried to enter a camp illegally sometime back though i forgot how etc.</p>

              <p>look most of the guys doing guard duty are nsf, not skilled or schooled in service. Hell most of the time they don't even think and know they shoudl provide good service.</p>
              <p>What he did was not wrong. And i highly doubt the story was just as put forward. My best guess would be that the pass -exchanger was probably nasty to the guy but couldn't win. So decided to do funny things.</p>

              <p>U don't have to force your way in. As long as you request to enter the camp, ur intentions is more important and whether letting you in or not is a different matter.</p>
              <p>How would you know whether someone is just trying to come closer to the camp to spy on the camp etc?</p>
              <p>Do not rely on wikipedia for anything important. Please go read the actual penal code if you want to be sure since you cannot go tell a police when they caught you for breaking a law that wikipedia says that its not against the law.</p>

              <p>Dun go kpo and ask around why didn't bring this and tat... later if any dispute, ppl can say you started challenging and escalate a incident. you think this is talking to a soldier booking in is it? you're talking to a civilian for goodness sake</p>
              <p>If tis occurs outside, a complain would sure fire out. ask tis and tat for?</p>
