            <div class='col-md body'>It's an old thread but since someone brought it up, we shall talk about it again. My deepest condolences goes out to 2 SG Hu En Hui 's family, who lost their son in the training accident.<br><br>There were training accidents during my time and during the time of my predecessors and accidents still occur now. Another accident is one too many as precious lives are lost.<br><br>But I have faith in the commanders and SAF that steps are taken to prevent these accidents from happening again and that neglient personel are punished. The only possible way to have no training accidents is to have no training at all, which is unrealistic.<br><br>To that forummer who has been PMing and harressing me, you seem to hold the view that SAF deliberately caused the death of its soldiers or do not care about the welfare of its soldier.I strongly disagree.<br><br>By branding people as zealots, you are implying you are such a person yourself.</div>
