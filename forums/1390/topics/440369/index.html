              <p>Hi all, may i know when is the vocational assessment for Commando? My best friend who is in his final year in poly would like to go for the test, but in the event that he doesnt get selected, he is considering writing to CMPB to appeal for a chance at it. I understand that it is Commandos choosing their recruits and not the other way round, but no harm trying.</p>
              <p>thanks.</p>

              There's no other way to get selected anymore, I went down to cmpb and tried volunteering for commando bmt but the lady at the counter told me if i'm not selected means that I'm out for sure. By the way, I was selected for the VA. I guess unless you sign on as a commando specialist or officer I don't think there's fair chance of you going in Pasir Ris Camp for BMT. I hope that clears up your doubt.

              <p>yeah ... why not just try and ask ? ....</p>

              <p>so he went to see his MP ......and he got switched from blue to green and posted to 1st CDO ... </p>
              <p>later on, he made spec, and went on to be one of the very very few NSFs to complete ranger school and get his ranger tab before he ORD'ed ....</p>
              <p>that's more than one decade ago ....</p>
              <p>if your friend wants it badly enough, then he has to go out and get it ...</p>
