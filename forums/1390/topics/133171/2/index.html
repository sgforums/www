            <div class='col-md body'>I am in favour of national service for all Singaporeans, male and female. Everyone should serve the 2 years (I did 2.5 years my time) and the 13-year reservist cycles. Women will be deployed mainly to public hospitals and trained as assistant nurses; the rest to the police force and civil defence force. We leave the option open for some to go into the army but that should remain a minority.<br><br>Israel has a similar system of compulsory national service for all...we should follow.</div>

If anything, you display the very mindset the psychological aspect of national defence will be trying to correct. Perhaps it dosent work for you, but there is nothing to say it dosent work for others.<br><br>I completed my NS a few years ago, and no, I dont think I want to consider going through it again. Like most of my peers, I was looking forward to ORD as well. That said, you dont find me going round saying NS was a complete waste of time in every sense of the word. And for that matter, please do note that not everyone who declares SAF as a waste of time is neccesarily saying it based on the same factors. Some, like yourself, thinks defending a small country like Singapore is physically impossible. Others may think its a waste of time because of manpower and training issues.<br><br>You feel Singaporeans will go into a panicky frenzy when an arty shell explodes here. Well...that shell isnt going to come without any warning, so do you think Singapores will need that long to freak out? Instead, I am much more worried about the effects of an unexpected terrorist attack.<br><br>I am quite amused when you question the operational readiness of our reservists. I do wonder if you are one yourself, because if so, your impression does happen to be a tiny minority. Unfortunately, people seem to be consumed by talks of the inefficienty of our NSF guys, and presume the NSmen are in a worse state of affairs. Well...quite the opposite actually.<br><br>Finally, you make plenty of assumptions on expected social responses to a military attack. But until a war actually breaks out, I must point out its almost impossible to make such predictions. As some have pointed out, in times of war when retreat is not an option, and the realisation that the protection of loved ones, and all we hold dear rests solely on us and no one else starts to sink in, who knows how many will throw up their hands in despair, and who will be galvanised to take up arms and fight to the last?<br><br>Sometimes, the choice isnt even given to you.<br><br>Whatever the case, I dont expect you to suddenly change your stance overnight. I would just hope that you would spend a little time reflecting on what you presume as the definitive thruth, and considering adopting a more eclectic viewpoint before settling back to whatever position you happen to be comfortable in.</div>

It seems really unfair and illogical to me. Like you said, many girls are very tough, so why not make them serve NS? At most, you can make them nurses, instructors or clerks. These vocations require more mental toughness than physical toughness. Since many ladies are very tough psychologically, it would appear logical that these positions be filled by them.<br><br>What? The fact is that some comments made by them have given the impression that many of them do not appreciate the sarcrifices we have made.

            <div class='col-md body'>seriously guys dont appreciate this NS thing at all so why should girls. if u really want people to understand project the right image and not complain that it is a waste of time. the impression is an image perpertrated by guys.<br><br>it is not true that girls get ahead in the jobs market by reason of their non NS liability. in fact, it is still true that woman who are doing the same jobs are paid much lower than man in the job market as employers prefer to promote man over woman because they are the ones who would take childcare leave and maternity leave and so on. this is soemthing that girls have to accept. they may start work earlier but seriously they do not earn more.<br><br>division of labour does not truely mean that all girls become nurses or clerks doing admin work. just like not all guys are cut out to be combat soldiers, neither are all girls meant to be nurses. to compare our situation with the israelis is a bit uncalled for. you must see beyond that two years that you are serving to that of the economy of the nation. we can conscript the girls into army for an equivalent two years. it might damage our economy, you might have to halve your current NS allowance. the motivation of concripting girls should not be just to even the playing fields to satisfy your albeit senseless call for equality there must be a real need for it as the cost is tremendous. singapore would have to double its defence budget. are u willing to suffer cuts in the areas of education and healthcare?<br><br>then what about a month in bmt just for the experience? three months is insufficient to train a soldier properly. if we just put them through army for a month, what is your objective? to make them talk about army more? or to show them what you guys go through? there must be a proper aim and objectives to be achieve you want to carry out such a plan.<br><br>i never said that woman should not appreciate NS or they cant appreciate it. however to be appreciated by others, there is a clear need for you guys to appreciate it. true two years is a long time. but its for u to make it a positive experience.<br><br>and its says a lot about u if you have to resort to expletives to get your point across.<br></div>

So why should girls be exempt if we are to be truly egalitarian?<br><br>The argument about the economy is tried and without basis. This is simply a regurgitation of an old argument. Firstly, how much do these girls contribute to the economy at 18? They are mostly students..Secondly, an 18-year old guy can contribute as much as an 18-year old girl to the economy. If the economy is really going to suffer that much by having all 18-year olds in national service, we can stagger NS so that both boys and girls can serve their 2 years of NS within a period of say, 10 years. If you want to let some of them out of NS to support the economy, fine...but let it be a 50:50 mix of the genders. Thirdly, having the girls in our pubic hospitals as assistant nurses will relieve the severe shortage of nursing staff, allows registered nurses to do higher-quality nursing work and by removing our reliance on foreign nurses, greatly improve the economy indeed. Remember a foreign assistant nurse is paid at least $800 a month. Most NS boys get a fraction of that..</div>

Perhaps it dosent work for you, but there is nothing to say it dosent work for others.<br><br>I completed my NS a few years ago, and no, I dont think I want to consider going through it again. Like most of my peers, I was looking forward to ORD as well. That said, you dont find me going round saying NS was a complete waste of time in every sense of the word. And for that matter, please do note that not everyone who declares SAF as a waste of time is neccesarily saying it based on the same factors. Some, like yourself, thinks defending a small country like Singapore is physically impossible. Others may think its a waste of time because of manpower and training issues.<br><br>You feel Singaporeans will go into a panicky frenzy when an arty shell explodes here. Well...that shell isnt going to come without any warning, so do you think Singapores will need that long to freak out? Instead, I am much more worried about the effects of an unexpected terrorist attack.<br><br>I am quite amused when you question the operational readiness of our reservists. I do wonder if you are one yourself, because if so, your impression does happen to be a tiny minority. Unfortunately, people seem to be consumed by talks of the inefficienty of our NSF guys, and presume the NSmen are in a worse state of affairs. Well...quite the opposite actually.<br><br>Finally, you make plenty of assumptions on expected social responses to a military attack. But until a war actually breaks out, I must point out its almost impossible to make such predictions. As some have pointed out, in times of war when retreat is not an option, and the realisation that the protection of loved ones, and all we hold dear rests solely on us and no one else starts to sink in, who knows how many will throw up their hands in despair, and who will be galvanised to take up arms and fight to the last?<br><br>Sometimes, the choice isnt even given to you.<br><br>Whatever the case, I dont expect you to suddenly change your stance overnight. I would just hope that you would spend a little time reflecting on what you presume as the definitive thruth, and considering adopting a more eclectic viewpoint before settling back to whatever position you happen to be comfortable in.</div></blockquote>You served in SPF, so it's a different story. No cheong suahing for you. Catching crooks does not require you to go outfield, does it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is an extract from LKY's memoir. Juz to remind us why we need to have NS in the 1st place.<br><br>While things have improved, we all know too well that any nations will use their armed forces to back them in their sovereignty dispute. Besides, we still have terrorists threats to counter against.<br><br>Building an army from scratch<br><br>WHEN Parliament was due to open in December 1965, four months after our separation from Malaysia, Brigadier Syed Mohamed Syed Ahmad Alsagoff, who was in charge of a Malaysian brigade stationed in Singapore, called on me and insisted that his motorcycle outriders escort me to Parliament. Alsagoff was a stout, heavy-built Arab Muslim with a moustache, a Singaporean by birth who had joined the Malayan Armed Forces.<br><br>To my amazement he acted as if he was the commander-in-chief of the army in Singapore, ready at any time to take over control of the island. At that time, the First and Second Singapore Infantry Regiments (1 and 2 SIR) of about 1,000 men each were under Malaysian command. The Malaysian government had placed 700 Malaysians in 1 and 2 SIR, and posted out 300 Singaporean soldiers to various Malaysian units.<br><br>I weighed up the situation and concluded that the Tunku wanted to remind us and the foreign diplomats who would be present, that Malaysia was still in charge in Singapore.<br>If I told him off for his presumptuousness, Alsagoff would report this back to his superiors in Kuala Lumpur and they would take other steps to show me who wielded real power in Singapore. I decided it was best to acquiesce.<br>So, for the ceremonial opening of the first Parliament of the Republic of Singapore, Malaysian army outriders "escorted" me from my office in City Hall to Parliament House.<br><br>Shortly after separation, at the request of the Malaysian government, we had sent the 2nd battalion SIR to Sabah for Confrontation duties. We wanted to demonstrate our good faith and solidarity with Malaysia even though a formal defence treaty had not been concluded. This left their barracks, Camp Temasek, vacant. We then agreed to a Malaysian proposal that one Malaysian regiment be sent down to Camp Temasek. The 2nd battalion SIR was due to return from its duties in Borneo in February 1966, and arrangements were made at staff level for the Malaysian regiment to withdraw.<br><br>The Malaysian Defence Minister requested that instead of reoccupying Camp Temasek, one Singapore battalion should be sent to the Malayan mainland to enable the Malaysian regiment to remain where it was.<br><br>Keng Swee did not agree. We wanted both our own battalions in Singapore.<br>We believed the Malaysians had changed their minds because they wanted to keep one battalion of Malaysian forces in Singapore to control us.<br><br>The Malaysians refused to move out, so the SIR advance party had to live under canvas at Farrer Park. Keng Swee saw me urgently to warn that if our troops were under canvas for too long, with poor facilities for their mess and toilets, there was the risk of a riot or a mutiny. He compared himself to a British general in charge of troops the majority of whom were Italians.<br>The Malaysians could take advantage of this and, through Brigadier Alsagoff, mount a coup. He advised me to move from my home in Oxley Road into the Istana Villa in the Istana domain and to post Gurkha police guards around just in case.<br><br>For the next few weeks, my family and I stayed there with a company of Gurkhas on standby. Shortly afterwards, the British vacated a camp called Khatib in the north of Singapore, near Sembawang. We offered it to the Malaysians and they agreed in mid-March 1966 to move out of our camp to Khatib, where they remained for 18 months before withdrawing of their own accord in November 1967.<br><br><strong>Their unreasonableness only made us more determined to build up the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) so that they could not intimidate us in this way. It stiffened our resolve and made us dig our heels in. </strong><br><br>Keng Swee, ever the intrepid fighter, had written in his paper to Defco (Defence Council):<br>"It is foolish to allow ourselves to be hypnotised by the disparity in the population ratios between Singapore and her neighbours. What counts is the fighting strength of the armed forces, not the size of populations. After five years of conscription, we can field an army of 150,000 by mobilising those on the reserve service. By using older persons and women for non-combatant duties, we should eventually be able to field an army with a combat strength of 250,000 consisting of men between the ages of 18 and 35. The war-making potential of a small, vigorous, well-educated and highly motivated population should never be underestimated."<br><br>This was an ambitious plan based on the Israeli practice of mobilising the maximum number possible in the shortest time possible. We thought it important for people in and outside Singapore to know that despite our small population, we could mobilise a large fighting force at short notice. Ours was no easy task. We had to reorientate people's minds to accept the need for a people's army and overcome their traditional dislike for soldiering.<br><br>Every Chinese parent knew the saying hao han bu dang bing, hao tie bu da ding (a good lad does not become a soldier, good steel does not become nails). We set up national cadet corps and national police cadet corps in all secondary schools so that parents would identify the army and police with their sons and daughters.<br><br>We wanted the people to regard our soldiers as their protectors - a reversal from the days when army and police uniforms aroused fear and resentment as symbols of colonial coercion. People must admire military valour.<br>As Keng Swee said in sorrow: "The Spartan approach to life does not come about naturally in a community that lives by buying and selling."<br><br>I had to get people to change their attitudes. We also had to improve the physical condition of our young by getting them to participate in sports and physical activity of all kinds, and to develop a taste for adventure and strenuous, thrilling activities that were not without danger to themselves.<br>Persuasion alone was not enough. We needed institutions, well-organised, well-staffed and well-directed, to follow up the exhortations and stirring speeches. The prime responsibility was that of the Ministry of Education.<br>Only if we changed people's thinking and attitudes could we raise a large citizen army like Switzerland's or Israel's. We gave ourselves a decade to accomplish this.<br><br></div>
