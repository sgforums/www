            <div class='col-md body'>What pisses me off is that the girls seems to think NS is a real walk in the park because eg. BMTC looks like a resort. I would like to see some of them spend 2 nights trying to dig a fire trench by candle light, only to be told on the third day to fill it back in. I would like to see some of the girls having a walk about in the vincinity of Lim Chu Kang with burst blisters covering their foot. I would like them to show the medic their feet only to be told by the medic that there is nothing much he can do. The girls do not understand the oppurtunities we have given up in order to do our duty as citizens. 2 years is a long time. You can get/almost get a degree in 2 years. You can evev qualify for entry into a number of professional bodies in 2 years.<br><br>I am not even asking them to reward us with liberal amounts of gratuitous sex...i am just asking them to let us be. Maybe all NSF/NS soldiers/policemen/Firefighters should take a one week strike and let the nation burn itself to the ground.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

Glory? Honour? can eat? Serve and fark off?<br>That's the mentality of most NSFs...even officers, specs<br>NSFs (except the enlightened few) do not believe in SAF..just striving to ORD<br><br>NSmen is the bulk of our force..how many people here find reservist a waste of time? how many treat the training seriously? how many are really operationally ready? Sure<br><br>there's one battalion who had one of the best ATEC scores...remarkable for a NS unit..<br>but 1? 2? U are sending out only 1 battalion to fight?<br><br>Another thing about ATEC..Is it 'real' in the sense?<br>Do casualties, dead people really go out of action after a certain scenario or do they mysteriously revive after every exercise? With such a mentality that people revive, get<br><br>cured..it seems like we have an invincible army..How true is that?<br>Of course, we need to prevent people who want to chao keng..1st day die, can shake leg for the rest of ATEC..but in a real situation, that's not the case<br>I think u can imagine?<br>When evacuating with casualties during exercises, do u run 2-3km back to the actual CCP..or just simulate running a few hundred metres and then followed by the order of<br><br>exercise cut? Of course I know it's very xiong doing such exercises..but in war, what makes u think that while retrograding, u won't be within enemy fire?<br>How realistic is ATEC? Bullets flying pass your helmet, hitting your buddy's head, blowing it up..Still rational? Still willing to think logically and think of the overall situation?<br>And how many casualties will render a platoon ineffective? 3..just 3 and a platoon can start retreating (at a slowed down pace)<br><br>Too talk about realistic training, there's Section/platoon/coy live firing?<br>Such a well controlled exercise and with the route so well planned and every cover so well placed for u doesn't seem very realistic to me..<br>The attack looks great when fighting dummy targets, everyone moves wonderfully doing leap and bounds..wow..<br>All live firing exercises are conducted under very controlled conditions..coz of safety regulations (which are needed), but the realistic value drops too much...<br>Recent 'paintball' like equipment gives me better hope now..<br><br>There are certain exercises which certain units do more realistic stuff(Commando's Ex Fireball with live rounds or something like that, or certain SOF equipment that shoots<br><br>something similar like paintball but better)..but then it's only those few..Their Operations aren't exactly what the main bulk of the Army is.<br><br>For support units like Artillery, I do feel they are more useful in the Army, at least they can do damage at without having heavy casualties..but if I'm not wrong there's<br><br>equipment that can analyse the trajectory, speed and stuff to locate where the arty guns are located? Arty bombardment back on ur arty guns isn't a good thing..(but<br><br>again..maybe the oppressor doesn't have that type of technology..)<br><br>For maneuver arms (Armour), I do not have much to comment..It could probably the only saving point of the Army..<br><br>Regulars? I believe most people have heard/experienced how farked up regulars can be..there are of course the enlightened few as usual, but they won't be the main bulk of<br><br>our fighting forces<br><br>NS is great fun which lets u try things u may never do..but without doing them, would ur life really be any lesser? If so, how much? See the girls...<br>Sure, confidence gets boosted and stuff..again how many people in NS really get to go through certain jobs? Support/Admin/Logistics staff are important, but in the process,<br><br>how many of them would benefit from NS? Learning how to type? learning how to manage human relations? learning how to wayang?<br>It's not necessary to learn all these in NS. U can learn in those in your future jobs too<br><br>Telling me about how united ur unit is, how much pride u have in ur unit is meaningless..because this is on the incapabilities of the SAF mainly the Army<br>That's one of the few advantages NS gives, but when ur unit is required to fight a war, I have doubts how effective or how much<br><br>There may be some untruths here, which you can raise it against me and if I do not have anything to refute back, I will gladly accept it..</div>
