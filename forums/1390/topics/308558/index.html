              <p>Indonesia has asked Singapore to exempt Indonesian citizens who are permanent residents from performing National Service.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda said that such an exemption was necessary as Indonesian citizens doing military service in another country risk losing their citizenship.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>‘For our citizens, whatever the reason, undertaking foreign military training would mean losing their citizenship under the citizenship law,’ Mr Hassan was quoted as saying by the Republika daily on Friday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He said that the issue of national service for Indonesian citizens with permanent resident status had been around since the Singapore government started requiring foreign citizens with such status to be enlisted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>‘In our communication with the Singapore government, we have requested that Indonesian citizens, including those with permanent resident status, to be exempted from doing national service,’ he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He did not disclose when the Indonesian government had made the request.</p>
              <p>He also said the government could only remind Indonesians that under the law, their citizenship could be revoked if they agreed to be enlisted.</p>

              <p>I think Indon government should look at themselves and ask WHY their citizens are migrating. Rather than asking other govts to exempt its citizen from PR, it should instead look at the root of the problem.</p>
              <p>Indon PRs WANTING to serve NS in Singapore simply means that life is so bad there that they feel they are better off serving NS overseas and staying at the new country.</p>
              <p>But I feel sad for Singaporeans who serves NS and do not understand and will refuse to understand that they took many things for granted.</p>
