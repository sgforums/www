              <p>I can identify with that sense of helplessness, fear of losing freedom - that feeling.. the 2-3 days before my enlistment. That was way back 12 years ago. The feeling like i'm going to prison or something...and BMTC being at Tekong makes it worse.</p>
              <p>But even prior to enlistment, I was quite 'siao on' about military matters and I do understand the need for NS. But when it comes down to personal sacrifice, can't help but feel that way.</p>
              <p>That anxiety is quickly overcomed, or rather forgotten once you get busy.</p>

              <p>On your opening topic - Why NS?</p>
              <p>It is not really a choice of country above self, sacrifice or sacred duty. Those are 'novel' ideas I call it.</p>
              <p>NS is for very practical reasons. Singapore just won't be able to stay an independent country with there's no strong SAF.</p>
              <p>There are powers at work, rivalry between countries, economic reasons, human greed, racial/religious envy, etc. at work - in the region, between our neighbours, globally.</p>
              <p>There's alot going on everyday (in another dimension, if I may call it), that ordinary people are not aware of. People in some specialised units, intelligence units, certain sensitive combat units are well aware of the challenges and risks.</p>
              <p>What kept us safe and nobody dare to touch us is because SAF is like an 'insurance' that we will hit them 10x as hard and utterly destroy anyone that tries to undermine our independence as a country.</p>
              <p>So no choice - its for practical survival reasons. </p>
              <p>If deterrence fail - we must be able to match our 'gurantee' and deliver the goods, a very heavy punch to destroy any aggressor.</p>

              <p>Basically you cant compare civilian life to ns life. Lack of freedom is the biggest worry right now. Even as a commander, you listen to your higher ups and suck thumb. Total control over every shit, and for myself, even my enciks seem to be bigger than my sirs, totally because they have experience. When shit happens, my enciks will nag at my officers, and they couldnt fight back because they have no experience (ie without enciks my BMT would be screwed)</p>
              <p>Well now I'm considered a regular (havent commission yet), I signed on without much hesitation because BMT was fun for me... unfortunately I'm not sure whether i will regret my decision (probably will). Hopefully they let me resign once the bond expires... if not, suck thumb. In NS, the only thing you can do is suck thumb. Cant be helped when shit happens. - Biggest worry for me now..</p>

              <p>You are right to question and worry about NS.The PAP will indoctrinate you, your friends and family will also tell you that NS is necessary and we need to protect singapore and all that crap. The bottom line is that you have to ask yourself. Who am I protecting and what am I fighting for?</p>
              <p>-Are you going to fight and die for a HDB flat that your parents or you do not own, but are mere tenants?</p>
              <p>-Will you fight to protect the 2 million foriegners in singapore earning a living here and going to school here?</p>
              <p>You have to sit down and coldly and inpartially ask yourself, what is my stake in the country such that is worth 2 years of my life and years of reservist training after that. If you can answer this questions to your satisfaction, then you should enjoy your time in NS with pride. If not, better try to skyve as much as possible.</p>

              <p><strong><span>The 1960s</span></strong></p>
              <div class="section separator"></div>
              <div><span>The 1960s: when absurdly 
              wide hems were fashionable and the world madly idolised the Beatles, the
               1960s was a turbulent period in the history of Singapore.  <br><br>Independence
               in 1965 was achieved in a background of internal turmoil and regional 
              uncertainty.  The 1961 Bukit Ho Swee fire savaged the squatter 
              settlements while riots in 1964 and 1969 crippled the country with 
              violence and social upheaval.   Externally, the <em>Konfrontasi</em>, the Communist presence in Southeast Asia and the Vietnam War immersed the region in uncertainty.   <br><br>While
               the 1960s may be synonymous with strife and poverty, it was also a 
              period of change.  The Women's Charter was passed by Parliament in 1961.
                In the same year, the Economic Development Board was established to 
              boost foreign investment.  The Housing Development Board, headed by the 
              late Mr. Lim Kim San, embarked on its quest to provide affordable 
              quality homes to Singaporeans and completed 54,000 flats by 1965.    On 
              17 Aug 67, Singapore's first cohort of full-time national servicemen 
              were enlisted.  <br><br>At the time of her independence, Singapore's 
              Army comprised only two regular infantry battalions - the First and 
              Second Battalions, Singapore Infantry Regiment (SIR).  However, the 
              impending British Withdrawal made the raising of her own army critical. 
               Conscription was deemed the best option  due to her limited resources 
              and economic constraints.  On the 27 Feb 67, the National Service 
              (Amendment Bill) was first read in Parliament.  Pink enlistement 
              reminder cards were sent to Singaporean males who were born between 1 
              Jan 49 and 30 Jun 49.  These young men formed the first generation of 
              National Servicemen who reported for enlistment on 17 Aug 67. <br><br>The
               1960s were the formative years of independent Singapore.  Through the 
              difficulties of the period, Singapore emerged into the 1970s a young, 
              but progressive nation.  The stories below describe how life was like 
              for Singapore in those early years. </span></div>

              <div>
              <div class="section separator"></div>
              <div><span>The 1970s was an interesting decade.  Disco ruled the day (and night!) and mini skirts were the rage.  Movies like <em>Grease</em> and <em>Saturday Night Fever </em>enjoyed immense popularity, while enduring Hollywood films like <em>Jaws</em> and <em>Star Wars</em> also made their debuts. In Singapore, Bruce Lee's <em>Big Boss</em> was a chart-topper. The decade was also a momentous one for a much 
              loved icon of Singapore - Singapore Airlines (SIA) took to the skies for
               the first time on 2 Oct 1972 following its split from the former 
              Malaysian-Singapore Airlines.  Another 'icon', McDonald's, opened the 
              first of many outlets at Liat Towers on 27 Oct 1979.<br><br>On the 
              economic and military fronts, it was a decade of building and laying the
               right foundations.  The British Withdrawal threatened to leave a huge 
              gap in our security and economy.  While statutory boards like the 
              Economic Development Board (EDB) and the Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) 
              spearheaded the quest for foreign investments and industrial space, the 
              Army was rapidly expanding to provide a credible defence for our newly 
              won sovereignty. Officers now had to serve three years in National 
              Service to utilise their training and knowledge, while other ranks 
              served between two and two and a half years.  In 1978, Hokkien was 
              banned as a language of instruction to streamline training.  <br><br>Throughout
               the decade the mettle of our fledging Army and our National Servicemen 
              were put to the test.  The resolution of terrorist threats in the Laju 
              Incident in '74, the successful handling of the influx of Vietnamese 
              refugees in '75 and the perseverance of Army personnel during the local 
              floods of '78, earned the respect and confidence of Singaporeans.<br><br>In
               the midst of a fluid cultural and social landscape, challenges from 
              within and without were thus present in Singapore during the 1970s. But 
              Singaporeans, both the lay man as well as the soldier, weathered these 
              storms admirably, continually strove for excellence, and laid a solid 
              foundation for a nation that was coming of age.</span></div>

              <div class="section separator"></div>
              <div><span>The 80s: When earrings and shoulder-pads were huge, when people were not ashamed to wear acid-washed jeans <em>with</em> acid-washed jackets, when Madonna showed the world it was OK to wear lingerie in public.<br><br>The 80s: When the Queen of Caldecott Hill, Zoe Tay, won <em>Star Search</em>, when Michael Chiang's <em>Army Daze </em>actually made National Service look fun, when Joey Wong enchanted Leslie Cheung (and the nation) in <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em>.<br><br>The
               80s: When it was cool to be a "Centrepoint Kid", when soft-drinks were 
              still sold in glass bottles, when children first realised they did not 
              want to grow up at the Toys "R" Us in Marine Parade; the decade that 
              Zouk's Mambo Night endlessly relives.<br><br>More topically, the 1980s 
              were the years Singapore's economy boomed, with an increasingly educated
               workforce being employed by high-technology industries like wafer 
              fabrication.  Those years also saw the inauguration of Changi Airport 
              (and without the fuss of a naming competition too); Singaporeans began 
              to zoom around the island on MRT trains; racial harmony was promoted 
              through public housing policies; graduate women were encouraged to be 
              mothers.<br><br>The SAF, too, continued to play an important role in nation-building, one that was highlighted when <em>Total Defence</em> was introduced in 1984. The SAF's role in rescue operations following 
              the collapse of the Hotel New World and the Cable Car accident showed 
              that the military forces were crucial to the handling of civil crises. 
              The decade also saw the expansion of the Army's capabilities. The first 
              Silent Mobilisation Exercise was conducted for reservists, demonstrating
               the operational readiness of our NSmen. On the regional front, 
              Singapore had its first bilateral exercises with regional neighbours, 
              Malaysia (Ex SEMANGAT BERSATU 1/89), and Indonesia (Ex SAFKAR INDOPURA 
              1/89).<br> <br>The Army was crucial to Singapore;s growth in coherence 
              and confidence as a nation in this decade. Consequently, the Army's own 
              scope expanded, and robustness as a fighting force increased.  Upon 
              those foundations laid down by their forebears in the 1960s and 1970s, 
              the Army built skywards.</span></div>

              <p>You have to sit down and coldly and inpartially ask yourself,
              what is my stake in the country such that is worth 2 years of my
              life and years of reservist training after that. If you can answer
              this questions to your satisfaction, then you should enjoy your
              time in NS with pride. If not, better try to skyve as much as
              possible.</p>

              <p>you are saying he should only defend singapore if his life in singapoe is worth defending but he has not experience life as an adult yet, hes just a teenager going to NS. although at 18, a person has rights and responsibility but it is still too young to decide whether his life in the future will be good. this point of view for him to feel about NS is not correct for him.</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 13.1307px;">singapore needs to be defended, no one will defend singapore except singaporeans. 18 years old is the prime age to perform this tusk. look at it this way, anything that you want to do now can be done 2 years later, anything that you want to do 2 years later can be done 4 years later and so on. when you are older and cant defend singapore anymore, you will feel safe knowing that your son is protecting you while you sleep at night.</span></p>

              <p>NS was introduced in 1967, just 2 years after Singapore’s independence to ensure the peace and stability of our nation.</p>
              <p><strong>We are a 'little red dot'.</strong></p>
              <p>With a population of 4.4 million and a land of 699 square km, 
              Singapore is amongst the 20 smallest countries in the world. Singapore 
              is too small to change the world. Instead, we must adapt as the world 
              changes around us.</p>
              <p><img src="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/asiamap.jpg" alt="Storming the hideout" width="400" height="300"></p>
              <h3 class="sIFR-replaced"><span class="sIFR-alternate"> Importance of NS </span></h3>
              <p>We must be able to defend Singapore ourselves. No one else is 
              responsible for our security and we cannot depend on others to come to 
              our defence.</p>
              <p>Our defence is predicated on deterrence. That is why we invest 
              heavily and consistently in building up a strong defence force to 
              provide that deterrence.</p>
              <p>At the same time, we seek to be friends with as many countries 
              as possible in the region and beyond. By having friends who can help us 
              in our times of need, we enhance our security.</p>
              <h3 class="sIFR-replaced"><span class="sIFR-alternate"> Need for NS </span></h3>
              <p>NS is our only viable option to building up a credible defence 
              force to ensure our survival. A conscription force by law which obliges 
              all eligible people to enlist would create a sizeable standing force 
              ready to guarantee our security.</p>
              <p>The <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr> maintains itself in a high state of operational readiness at all times so that it is able to react swiftly to any threat.</p>
              <p>To meet the defence challenges in the 21st century, the <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr> is upgrading and transforming itself into a highly sophisticated, well-integrated fighting force.</p>
              <p><img src="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/storming.jpg" alt="Third Generation SAF" width="400" height="300"></p>
              <p>The Third Generation <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr> will be a network-centric organisation. Our forces will be 
              interconnected, equipped with electronic information systems, and be 
              able to fight cooperatively, and in an integrated manner, on land, in 
              the air and on the sea.</p>
              <p>Within the nation itself, the <abbr title="Singapore Police Force">SPF</abbr> upholds the law and maintains order, keeping the streets safe for family and friends.</p>
              <p>And in case of any crisis or emergency, such as a major accident or a terrorist attack, the <abbr title="Singapore Civil Defence Force">SCDF</abbr> will be there to rescue and save the lives of fellow citizens.</p>
              <p>All together, the <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr>, <abbr title="Singapore Police Force">SPF</abbr> and <abbr title="Singapore Civil Defence Force">SCDF</abbr> play a key role in Singapore’s Total Defence—Military Defence, Civil 
              Defence, Economic Defence, Social Defence and Psychological Defence.</p>
