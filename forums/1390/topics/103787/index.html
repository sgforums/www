            <div class='col-md body'>Marine Recruit Dies During Endurance Test<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Paul Floeckher<br>WSAV News 3<br><br>Friday, November 19, 2004<br><br>A Parris Island Marine recruit who died from unknown causes Thursday morning has been identified.<br><br>A Parris Island spokesman says Bret Moran, 18, of Bronx, N.Y., was unresponsive when training officers tried to awaken him around 2:30 a.m. for a nine-mile hike to complete the training exercise known as the Crucible. Efforts to revive Moran failed and he was taken to Beaufort Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead about an hour later.<br><br>"There's no tougher day in the Marine Corps than a day in which you lose one of your own," said Major Ken White, Parris Island public affairs director.<br><br>The Marine Recruit Depot is investigating the circumstances surrounding Moran's death, White said. An autopsy will be done to determine the cause of death, according to Beaufort County coroner Curt Copeland.<br><br>"We would hope that the command investigation brings to light exactly what happened to this recruit and, hopefully, what medical conditions contributed to his death," White said.<br><br>Moran enlisted in the Marine Corps on July 22nd and arrived at Parris Island on September 8th. He was in his 10th week of basic training and would have graduated on December 3rd, White said.<br><br>Chaplains spoke with the other 73 recruits in Moran's training platoon Thursday to help them cope with their loss. The platoon came together for a memorial service Friday afternoon.<br><br>"These recruits are dealing with their grief, but they have said that they are going to endeavor themselves to work harder at the task of becoming Marines in the memory of their comrade," White said.<br><br>The last time a Parris Island recruit died was in 2002, from cardiac arrest. The Marine Recruit Depot suffers one death per year on average, White said.<br><br>The Crucible is the ultimate test for any recruit. It is the final challenge they must pass before earning the title of Marine.<br><br>The whole exercise lasts 54 hours, in which recruits must endure approximately 40 miles of marching. In addition to numerous problem-solving challenges, recruits must face food and sleep deprivation -- getting only four hours of sleep each night and having only three MREs (meals ready-to-eat) on hand.<br><br>More than 500 recruits were on the Crucible Wednesday night, White said. Approximately 19,000 recruits graduate from Parris Island each year.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>We hope that our SAF will take note of this incident and remind all commanders of the responsibility they have towards training their soldiers.Condolences to the family of a fellow soldier in arms, no matter what flag he fights under.</div>
