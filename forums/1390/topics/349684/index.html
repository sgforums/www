              Have a letter from my family doctor indicating i have childhood asthma, just given an inhaler as i'm usually left panting and catching my breath after SOC and long runs, and experiencing chest tightness presently.
                                                  
              Presently in CDO TI doing BMT and going to POP soon. When i show my camp MO the letters and medication, is it possible for him to do a report of my condition to my superiors, elaborating that my physical condition might not be suitable for CDO vocations?
                                                  
              If not, will i be sent to a specialist to review my case? My lungs were checked to be clear, but my doctor advised me that asthma attacks could be exercise-induced.
                                
                                Thanks in advance.

              I'm not requesting for a downgrade actually, just that after i have the recurrence of my condition, my parents advised against staying on in CDO. Told my instructor and he said to hand in my report ASAP before i'm given my confirmed vocation.
              
              I'm just interested in knowing the procedures on whether the MO can help in informing the superiors of my present condition so that I will be able to get posted out to other combat voactions. Probably a support combat like MP.

                                so it's actually called a revocate? If he recommends that i revocate, being medically boarded means i have to go to CGH for a checkup/review?
              I have just been given ventolin as well. I never had an attack, but was sent to hospital to be given regular puffs of some medication (can't remember what) i think i was really close to having an attack during the last SOC test.

              <p>Well revocate yes, maybe you'll not be a CDO but since there's no downgrade in your case there's still likely you'll go to some active unit like SIR, Armour, Arty etc.....</p>
