If there's no word from her by tonight, by all means close it.<br><br>And before this thread does get closed, I'd like to toss in my own S$0.02. Personally, I don't expect others to worship the ground I walk on when I'm in uniform, and I neither do I expect large adoring crowds who clamour for me. I don't expect people in uniform to be treated like kings.<br><br>However, mistyblue, I don't expect you to be treating them with such contempt either. To be belittling all their efforts is surely not the voice of one who is grateful. It is precisely due thanks to people who stay awake at night guarding our camps and doing outfield exercises that you get to sleep in your warm comfortable bed. When I'm out in the jungle doing a 24-km forced march at 2am in the morning with 26kg of full battle gear on my back, I do so hoping that my efforts will go some way in keeping our country safe.<br><br>I agree that the SAF is one big wayang, but hell, we do one heck of a wayang. It is precisely because of our wayang kulit that no one dares to mess with us, and we can be a safe and prosperous nation.<br><br>And look at what our wayang has cost us - we've had people entering the army alive but leaving it dead. People have been KILLED - the dunking case comes to mind. Numerous others have been injured. I should know. As a medic spec I've had to do life-saving intervention on several occasions.<br><br>Seriously, it would do you a whole lot of good to try to put yourself in the shoes of those NSFs, NSmen and regulars who sacrifice so much to keep you safe.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe the reason why some may feel that soldiers in Singapore are not getting or should not be getting any respect from civilians is because perhaps our soldiers and country is far too young for it. We may be successful on our own with what we have achieved through half a century and be proud of it. Our soldiers may have played a role (no matter how minor it may be as compared to other countries) in the region's security or peace keeping missions but to some people it may take more than that to earn a respect.<br><br>Soldiers are not models nor the hunks you see during manhunt or fashion show on stage.<br><br>So for those who feel that our soldiers are sissy ah guas i hope one day we can prove it otherwise. As for those soldiers who have served or are serving and find that civilians give you that scrutinizing look or disrespect despair not because over that uniform you are wearing is a job or duty that earns an honor greater than any respect anyone will give you.<br><br>There are soldiers who are committed to what they do and they did their best in silence without the need for any cheers, salute or praises. There are soldiers who died during missions or trainings and the best respect they can get is the cover of our nation's flag and the shots from the rifles honoring them for their deeds and sacrifice. This in itself is the respect a true soldier can get that nothing can ever balance with on the other side of the scale.</div>

She's been keeping silent for quite a while.<br><br>I won't be surprised if she has already given up on us 'narrow-minded boys' whom she thinks are demanding far too much when we ask not to be treated with contempt.<br><br>My sergeant during my combat medic course once told me, 'There will be those who don't appreciate your efforts no matter what.

We can't really change the hearts of everyone, but we can still continue doing the right thing.
