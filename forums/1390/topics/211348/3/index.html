            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gedanken:</div><div class="quote_body">Ah, New Zealand.  Nuff said.  Comrade Clarke has systematically gutted the military to the point where they have nothing that can be described as an air force, so what do you expect?<br><br>Second, I'm not sure how in-depth your talks with the Vietnam vets were, but after a while you'll see that they've got a pretty strong agenda to push and that skews their view of things pretty badly.  They participated in an unpopular war - it's fair comment that the Americans and their allies had no place being there.  Even Robert McNamara admitted that they thought they were fighting communism and didn't realise they were fighting nationalism.  As a result, they got much less respect than the veterans of any other war.<br><br>As for the change in recruitment policy, why not take a look at the general trend of change in warfare and the resulting effects on selection criteria?  Back when I was in 1CDO, nobody wore glasses but now it's no longer an obstacle to selection.  What with technology getting more complex and requiring less manpower, is it really surprising that the numbers and physical requirements are falling?  I wouldn't go misattributing the trend to the wrong causes too quickly.<br><br>Bottom line: Think through all the factors and don't go generalising based on one war in one country, and proposing that it applies across Western nations.<br><br>Tell ya what - hop over the Tasman to my back yard and I'll show you plenty of people who have respect for the uniform and what it stands for, and not only on 25 April.  Over here, your average joe is more than happy to hoist a pint to someone who serves or has served.</div></blockquote>It is true that the Labour Government had cut the combat wing from the Air Force. But one can argue that its a symtom rather than a cause. Furthermore, although the Air Force's combat capability was removed, substantial funding was provided for the Army to purchase new equipment.<br><br>I must confess that my conversations with the Vets were hardly in-depth but I think you agree with me that a consequence of that war was that the civilians absolutely despise the military. What I'm saying in my previous posting was that this consequence's residue is still felt to a slight degree in this region.<br><br>I agree with you that there are many other factors that influenced the recruitment policies, but my point being that due to the deteriorating civil-military relationship, the military had to recuit from a wider circle, including grandmothers and foreigners. The factors that you listed which included technology made this recruitment possible but not necessary desirable. For example, with improved technology, I can recruit a man with less physically able, but it doesn't mean I would really like to recruit him, but only because I have to as nobody with a better physical wants to apply.<br><br>Of course, the statement that western society do not respect the military is flawed as we are unsure of the benchmark of respect, as in who should we compare it to? Both in terms of geographical and time dimension. As in, are we comparing western society to SAF or to Japan's SDF? Are we comparing the level of respect that they are getting now to the ones that they get in they were in WWII or just after Vietnam?<br><br>Nevertheless, I am willing to say now that I am not going to conclude that western society has less respect for their military but instead it remain a hypothesis which I will explore if chances arrive in the future. By the way, I do think that the Australia military is a rather unique case in current situation and I would love the chance to do a study on it given the chance and resources.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well well well well well.  Congratulations, mistyblue - you're the quintessential ugly Singaporean.  Anything anybody brings up, and your first thought is "What about ME?  Look at me!  Look at MEEEEEE!!!!".  Are you the sort to frantically hit the "close door" button when you see paramedics running for the lift because you don't want to be late for your facial? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Listen up, Miss The-Universe-Relolves-Around-Me, this isn't about you.  It isn't about any single person.  It's about the country, and you're just one small part of it.<br><br>You think it's all about minds?  A mind by itself is not going to be waiting on a beach somewhere in the wee hours of the morning, holding a rifle waiting to shoot the first non-Singaporean that steps off the boat.<br><br>The guys who have been there will know that I'm not talking in hypotheticals here.  You see, there's this little thing called the official Secrets Act that prevents soldiers from telling know-nothing-talk-nonstop civilians what's really going on.  It's probably because your little minds couldn't handle it.<br><br>Kid, what's going down, you don't wanna know.  Just stay ignorant and have a good night's sleep.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by wisefool83:</div><div class="quote_body">It is true that the Labour Government had cut the combat wing from the Air Force. But one can argue that its a symtom rather than a cause. Furthermore, although the Air Force's combat capability was removed, substantial funding was provided for the Army to purchase new equipment.<br><br>I must confess that my conversations with the Vets were hardly in-depth but I think you agree with me that a consequence of that war was that the civilians absolutely despise the military. What I'm saying in my previous posting was that this consequence's residue is still felt to a slight degree in this region.<br><br>I agree with you that there are many other factors that influenced the recruitment policies, but my point being that due to the deteriorating civil-military relationship, the military had to recuit from a wider circle, including grandmothers and foreigners. The factors that you listed which included technology made this recruitment possible but not necessary desirable. For example, with improved technology, I can recruit a man with less physically able, but it doesn't mean I would really like to recruit him, but only because I have to as nobody with a better physical wants to apply.<br><br>Of course, the statement that western society do not respect the military is flawed as we are unsure of the benchmark of respect, as in who should we compare it to? Both in terms of geographical and time dimension. As in, are we comparing western society to SAF or to Japan's SDF? Are we comparing the level of respect that they are getting now to the ones that they get in they were in WWII or just after Vietnam?<br><br>Nevertheless, I am willing to say now that I am not going to conclude that western society has less respect for their military but instead it remain a hypothesis which I will explore if chances arrive in the future. By the way, I do think that the Australia military is a rather unique case in current situation and I would love the chance to do a study on it given the chance and resources.</div></blockquote>Well, I've got a different take on the situation, wisefool83.  Over here, it's more a case of distrust for the politicians than it is of civilians despising the military.  The general Australian view of things is that the government was to blame for the Vietnam mess, not the soldiers who got sent there.<br><br>As for the issue fo physical requirements, the benchmark for combat roles is still reasonably stringent, but for non-frontline roles (which are increasing as technology improves), standards may be relaxed.  For example, someone flying a fighter would have to be in much better physical shape than his UAV-flying counterpart.<br><br>Either way, these days I will agree that it's more fashionable for people to openly despise the military, although my guess is that it's driven by a fear of being branded right-wing.</div>
