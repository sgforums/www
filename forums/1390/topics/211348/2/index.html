Where do you get that?</div></blockquote>I currently reside in a western society. According to one of my lecturer who was a Vietnam veteran and serveral older people, including one whose spouse took part in D-Day, whom I've converse with, soldiers that came back from Vietnam did not even dare to wear their uniform in public. In those days, they would get spat at just for being in uniform. Over the years their reputation had of course improved dramatically, but a lot these western societies are still having great difficulties in getting people to join the uniform. New Zealand, which I am currently residing in, had such high turnover rate that they can hardly replace those who leave. Australia is forced to lower its standard for recruitment, so "horizontally developed" people, Assmatic and even people from overseas can join them. U.S can also only recruit people from lower income groups and street kids. Recently they are so desperate they have to resort to recruit "Ah Ma" over the age 40+. The Army was traditionally dispised upon in the UK, although the navy was respected.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah, New Zealand.  Nuff said.  Comrade Clarke has systematically gutted the military to the point where they have nothing that can be described as an air force, so what do you expect?<br><br>Second, I'm not sure how in-depth your talks with the Vietnam vets were, but after a while you'll see that they've got a pretty strong agenda to push and that skews their view of things pretty badly.  They participated in an unpopular war - it's fair comment that the Americans and their allies had no place being there.  Even Robert McNamara admitted that they thought they were fighting communism and didn't realise they were fighting nationalism.  As a result, they got much less respect than the veterans of any other war.<br><br>As for the change in recruitment policy, why not take a look at the general trend of change in warfare and the resulting effects on selection criteria?  Back when I was in 1CDO, nobody wore glasses but now it's no longer an obstacle to selection.  What with technology getting more complex and requiring less manpower, is it really surprising that the numbers and physical requirements are falling?  I wouldn't go misattributing the trend to the wrong causes too quickly.<br><br>Bottom line: Think through all the factors and don't go generalising based on one war in one country, and proposing that it applies across Western nations.<br><br>Tell ya what - hop over the Tasman to my back yard and I'll show you plenty of people who have respect for the uniform and what it stands for, and not only on 25 April.

If you have an issue with the food, its only your problem. Don't blame anyone for your issue. Besides, my tax dollar goes to your food and I think its a waste on you.<br><br>I serve my country in other ways. I think I am more military than you are. Besides, Boys here should open up their minds and stop thinking the only way to serve the country is to do NS and what they do is so great that everyone should kneel when they go by just to show respect.  Move along BOYS and grow up.<br><br>No one wants a war. But it is a real joke when our BOYs tell us to respect them when they had never been in any battle or do anything constructive except train with the Army. So just by default that these BOYs are in NS, NS BOYS demand civilians should show respect to them. As said, What is respect and How does NS BOYS expect us civilians to show respect.<br><br>I wonder if these BOYs respect their own parents and family enough to demand respect from others.  Besides, you are just going out of point talking about war. But it is a fact that compared to the military forces in the region, Singapore army is the only one who had never had to step in any conflict. Even the local police force had to deal with civilian issues here and there but the army is just going to all sorts of places for exercise. Any old-timer army personnel can tell you, the standard of our BOYs dropped and the BOYs are treated like girls otherwise they are fragile and will break or complain to Mommy and Mommy will complain to ministry of defense.<br><br>If any BOY is man enough, and he treats he fellow people with respect, other people would also respect him. If any BOY demand respect just because he "served" the country by NS, then he deseved to be disrespected because he did not open his eyes and see the contribution of ever other person around him.  If BOYs keep thinking they lose out, or the only way to serve the country is NS, the Girls had it easy and start comparing with other selective places, then they jolly well remain as BOYS and it is not a wonder the locals are losing to the global competition. If NS is that bad, all the BOYs in Singapore should just give up citizenship when they are 17 and migrate out of the country. I look the at the new generation of NS boys, go into and out of army, still look immature, whinnie and soft compared to the older generations where the boys go in and come out as men- tough and strong.<br><br>Respect? Point a gun at me I also won't respect. Pay me to go into NS? I think I will do better than you in NS.</div>
