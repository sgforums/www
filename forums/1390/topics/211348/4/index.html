Only know how to carry on that what girls and non NS people's effort is great too.Whoever said they were not?

I sleep well because I know we forge strong ties with US, Isreal and other strong nations by having their investments in Singapore so that the neighbouring countries will think twice about striking us without strong counterstrike from these other countries. I sleep well because through our economic success and abilities to make this region boom, we give our neighbours less reasons to strike us and more reason to cooperate with us. Remember, we will never have enough men to fight any war like China. We rely on other strategies and we rely on the power of money to buy the best equipment and best training environment for our men.<br><br></div></blockquote>If my post earlier had been mis-interpreted or that I did not make my post clear, I apologize. But yes, the civilian sector is important, and yes though death in labour is real, living is also a sad thing if you choose to look at things that way.<br><br>You sleep well at the expense of those who are there to defend you while you type away, down-playing their efforts. Tell me this, when Timor Leste was seeking seperation, there are many NSFs who volunteered, in Operation Flying Eagle in relief efforts there are also NSFs. I'm not saying that the the contributions of those made in the economic sector and so on are any less important, I am thankful for them to let us live in a society which is what it is today. But I'm making specific reference to the Military and Law Enforcement communities as the fact here is that you constantly downplay and slam their efforts even if its a wayang show, at least they bother wayang.While you type  away in the relative comfort and security of your home, I hope you know that although the wayang show goes on, the threat we face in this day and age is real. The men and women standing at the frontlines fear that a day comes when they have to pull the trigger, not because they don't have the guts nor the training which you seem as wayanging to put them through, but because they know that the very action they are carrying out bears the responsibility of life and death. You can make millions and lose millions in the stock market overnight, but you do not have to die, at the frontline with a faceless enemy, one wrong decision, one decision too late and you may have to end up hosing what ever is left of the victims off the streets.<br><br>As a whole, I believe none of the NSFs nor Regulars here are demanding respect from the civilians or anything, but just pleading them to be left to do their work of safe-guarding the nation from any threats foreign and domestic.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think,..... Misty should google up the Russo-Finnish war of 1939-1940. It is a classical example of how a small country can stop an invasion from a regional power and it also proves a bunch of well trained Conscript army soldiers can defeat an enemy on-slaughter.<br><br>Just for some hisotrical infomations, Finland broke free from Russia during the early 20th century, after a coup led by the whites. Thus when the Red Soviets managed to build a large and better equipped armed forces, Stalin gave orders to recapture this "renegade province". He took advantage of the fact that the major allied powers were anxiously dealing with Hilter's expansion and America was an isolationist country. Britain was eager to cherry up with the Soviets as they were facing a common enemy, Germany.<br><br>Thus no single country dared to commit troops and vast amount of war materials to help the Finns. Sweden a close neighbour, only commit a small squadron of fighters named as "volunteers". Many countries felt that Finland was doomed, and is destined to be subjected under harsh rule once captured, just like Estonia, Latvia......<br><br>The Finlands were poorly equipped with mainly WW1 gears and donations from friendly nations before the war. Wad more, their main forces are made up of conscripts and reservists, which are usually down-played as less efficient and skilled. But in the end, they won. From wad i noe, initially the Finns faced many failures due to lack of exposure to in real combat, but in the end, they manage to put their acts together and defeat the Reds. Contrary to popular believes, the Reds no doubt better equipped, were badly demoralised dat even the political Comissars in the units can't rally the men to fight effectively. In fact, many of their resupply lines were ambushed and many gears fell into the hands of the Finns during hasty retreats.<br>It may surprise u that Finland democratic republic some wad like the Swiss and their govt during the war was made up of a a coalition govt. This is contrary to some old politcal bigwigs who claim that a small country with a huge involvement of oppositions will be a corrupted, impoverish one that will be marked by social unrest, thus an authorian govt is the best solution.<br><br>U must noe, no doubt other countries have a full time force, but it is not as if all their troops have seen or experience some form of combat. Even countries that boast that they have gone to war and won, those troops that fought are most probably old or dead, thus so much of being "bloodied".</div>

Busted knees that will never heal right. A slip disk that prevents them frm carrying heavy loads or even frm playing a game of tennis when they're older.<br>A lost finger,a disfigured face.....all that from doing something we mostly never wanted to tell me all that is any easier or less painful that you would belittle us like that?<br>You make it sound as though it's a game.It's not and nowhere is it more easily seen then when we are on our "wargames" We bleed during those "games".Some have even lost their lives.<br><br>Is it to much to ask for alittle bit of respect for what we do considering that while we whine about it,we still do it knowning that with the shit that goes on in there our chances of getting a life injury is actually pretty damn high?A little respect of not insulting us or belittlering what we actually do.<br><br>Oh and to add....something that you seem not to reliase here....CHOICE.Child birth is CHOICE.The female capt CHOICE(even though i respect that.)
