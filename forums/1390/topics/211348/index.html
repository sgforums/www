I feel the civilians take the SAF for granted.<br>The peace and prosperity we enjoy now was hard-earned and fought over by the generations before us.<br>I'm not saying that the SAF is the only reason why there is peace and prosperity in Singapore but you cannot deny that it is a key contributor.<br><br>Red Ameoba's reply that we should not respect the SAF because we are a consript force defies logic.<br>All the more we are a conscript force and our NSFs are sacrificing their energy and time to do their duty... all the more we should be giving them our full support and respect.<br>Just because you have no pride in yourself, doesn't mean you should assume other people don't want to be appreciated or respected for their sacrifice.<br><br>And just because we respect and appreciate the SAF doesn't mean soldiers have the right to bully civilians either.<br><br>I'm sure I'm not alone when I say I've served my time in NS with pride.

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe people in the arm should respect the fact that every bullet they fire comes from our collective tax dollar also .. ever grain of rice they eat comes from our collective tax dollar... then respect the things, experience and exercise that the soldiers get at the expense of the country that they are given a chance to serve the nation that they can grow up, mature and understand the big picture of Singapore's vulnerability.<br><br>Respect is a mutual thing. What do you mean that civilians don't respect soldiers. Be specific! What do soldiers expect civilians to do? Kneel when they walk past? Offer money to them?  Normal civilian don't even get respect from each other.  So what does a Soldier expect??? Use some brain!!<br><br>Have any Singapore soldier/general actually go fight off enemies or do they get laughed at during exercise with Thai forces or Indonesian forces? Have any Singaporean soldier or general actually ever killed anyone and almost get killed and survived or once again, they go off to joint exercise to see war veterans snub singaporean soldiers cause they can only talk about "fake" war exercise that is unreal but never steped into a mine field fighting off enemies?<br><br>Respect? First Gain the respect of your fellow Soldiers in the region before talking about respect from the civilians.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most of the western societies in general don't particularly respect their uniform personel anymore, not since Vietnam war. The only few country that I can think of that really show extra-ordinary respect to their armed-forces would be Japan. I think Singaporeans' attitude towards SAF is still alright, like some people here say, a large portion of the population was in the SAF anyway. We generally just take SAF as a phrase in life rather than a particular segment of society. Requesting special respect for SAF in Singapore is not much different than asking people to give special respect for students.<br><br>On a side note though, SAF's reputation in the international military community is relatively high. I've personally heard and overheard comments on the intelligence and sharpness on SAF commanders. A particular scenario was depict to me by the New Zealand ex-Chief of Army, "A command exercise was carried out and an NZ battalion and a SAF battalion was each given the task of reaching a particular location within 48 hours with an enemy battalion trying to stop them. The NZ battalion was able to reach just at the 48th hour and the SAF battalion drove the enemy all the way way within 32-36hours.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by wisefool83:</div><div class="quote_body">Most of the western societies in general don't particularly respect their uniform personel anymore, not since Vietnam war. The only few country that I can think of that really show extra-ordinary respect to their armed-forces would be Japan. I think Singaporeans' attitude towards SAF is still alright, like some people here say, a large portion of the population was in the SAF anyway. We generally just take SAF as a phrase in life rather than a particular segment of society. Requesting special respect for SAF in Singapore is not much different than asking people to give special respect for students.<br><br>On a side note though, SAF's reputation in the international military community is relatively high. I've personally heard and overheard comments on the intelligence and sharpness on SAF commanders. A particular scenario was depict to me by the New Zealand ex-Chief of Army, "A command exercise was carried out and an NZ battalion and a SAF battalion was each given the task of reaching a particular location within 48 hours with an enemy battalion trying to stop them. The NZ battalion was able to reach just at the 48th hour and the SAF battalion drove the enemy all the way way within 32-36hours.</div></blockquote>This is an interesting factor, because our locals always treat the SAF as some disdainful organisation that screws up everything it touches, but overseas missions have proved otherwise.<br><br>Perhaps it's just that our boys can slack when they are not needed, but step up to the batting plate when they are called upon. Truly Singaporean...do fast fast, do swee swee, can exercise cut faster.</div>
