            <div class='col-md body'>would like to know more about being a regular engineering specialist in armour. what is the 21 weeks basic training like for starters? is it a stay in training and only can book out in the weekends? will the training be like the basics of how a vehicle (engine) works and functions and getting to know the various armor vehicles in SAF? as an engineering spec, can i choose to be with the armour instead of dealing with land rovers and tonners? after the basic tech training, will i pass out as a 3SG? i understand that the salary scale per individual is based on educational level but after 3SG, when will one get a shot at 2SG? what is the CPF deductions and contribution (from MINDEF) be like - what is the percentage? too many queries, need answers from those in service or been through it. thanks.</div>

FMT are under the company's strength and will be in a RCV during exercises. During outfield, may be required to camo the vehicle. FMT also are on the constant move with the company though they lagger at the 'rear' with the OC and stuffs when they reach their designation and are only deployed out when needed.<br>As for MMT, they are under HQ (Workshop) strength and may not be out in a vehicle during exercises. Those who are 'arrowed' to be on the move will be in a Bronco (3 ATS, 1 Comms Tech + 1 Turret Mech) and attached to a company to assist the FMT.<br><br>For base technicians, I am not too sure.<br><br>By the way, technicians also need to apply camo sometimes... (At least in my unit...)</div>
