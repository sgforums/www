              <p>Unless you really have alot of interest in repairing vehicles, i don't really see whats so interesting about being an autotech after spending my NSF life as 1.</p>
              <p>If you have questions about this vocation feel free to pm me but i'm a wheeled autotech so questions regarding and the armoured and track autotech i can only answer to what i know which might not be everything involved in their work.</p>

              <p>Though most major repairs are outsourced to contractors, i won't say autotech learn nothing. Before any vehicle is sent out to contractor, it has to be first diagnosed by a autotech to find out the fault and certify its a fault that is contractor level repair before its sent out. We don't ask contractors to come diagnose the faults and repair, we tell them what we want them to repair. Contractor level jobs are not really that many so don't just assume autotechs know nothing.</p>
              <p>Even as a NSF i was given a chance to learn vehicle diagnostics and i would say i used to be decent at diagnosing Man 5 ton air system and electrical faults since my MSG was a 5 Ton SME and i've got alot of chances to learn from him.</p>

              <p>The only vehicle now that is often passed to contractor now should be the new landrover replacement since its still under warrenty and due to that, its not really our responsibility to repair all faults on them if the part that is faulty is under warrenty</p>

              <p>C are all the tracked vehicles such as cranes etc, generator is also under C.</p>
              <p>I believe you should have a choice since all 3 platforms have their differences and a regular would need to be able to specialise in 1 of them but you might be trained in some of the other platforms as well.</p>
              <p>Vehicles and bikes are all under B which includes practically everything with wheels that can move on the road.</p>
              <p>Its generally a stayout vocation with OT during peak periods like exercise and LAB. There are outfields though since all autotech are expected to be able to repair vehicles out in the field without proper lighting and sometimes equipment.</p>
              <p>The basic course is 3 months with 2 months of on job training.</p>
              <p>Duty is something everyone in the army does so no exemptions from that regardless of vocation. Depending on camp, generally a 3SG can be anything from a guard to a guard comm. COS duty is quite rare since most units are stayout while BOS will require you to gain a much higher rank before you will do it.</p>

              <p>Hmm Bedok camp autotech should be in my former battalion but we belong to different company so i don't really know much about the workload on their side. Our workload really depends on the unit we are supporting since autotechs for B vehicles are split into 2 battalions, 1 in Jurong 1 in Selarang and they will sent their autotechs to all the other camps to provide on site support. Personally i was stationed at Sembawang Camp so i was supporting 1TPT.</p>
              <p>Regarding guard duty for personnel at Bedok camp, last i heard they do it at Selarang camp instead and not in Bedok camp since our HQ side don't have enough people for guard duty there it seems that time.</p>
              <p>Every unit will have an annual LAB inspection which is when people would come down and inspect every single vehicle in that camp. This is the time autotechs become very busy since we need to push out as many vehicles from the workshop as we can and aim for a 100% servicibility. Other busy periods would be when the unit is going for exercise especially oversea exercises. Since i serve 1TPT which practically supports vehicles for alot of activities, we tend to get alot of work during these periods but occasionally there are slack periods and i've bookout at 3pm before but such occasions are really rare.</p>

              <p>So far i only know my friends at Kranji camp 3 have the option of COS or Guard duty while all the rest is strictly guard.</p>
              <p>When units got for overseas exericse, only certain number of technicians will be attached but generally a regular will have the chance to go Wallaby etc at least once and be attached to an overseas base for at least a year or something throughout their 10 yr service term.</p>
              <p>When there are OT its up to you whether you want to stayin or bookout since we generally can work till about 10pm depending on workload. Whether you have a bunk or not depends on the camp you are in since not all camps will allocate bunk space to autotechs. For my company, i think we're the only ones who have bunks allocated to us but most of us only use it to change and sleep after guard duty.</p>

              <p>That i'm afriad would be a question you would need autotech from the other 2 forces to comment since the training etc are all not the same.</p>
