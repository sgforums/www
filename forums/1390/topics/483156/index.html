              <p><strong>Compensations for Service Injuries<br></strong></p>
              <p>Service injuries are injuries sustained while serving NS.<br> This also includes injuries sustained when reporting for duty or
              going home after duty.<br> <br> You will get free medical treatment for such injuries even after
              ORD for lifetime.<br> <br> Remember to first report your injury to your unit MO. Also remember
              to collect and keep all documents relating to your injury and your
              treatment. These will help when you submit the injury report and
              seek claims.</p>

              <p><strong>Service Injuries</strong><br> <br> If you sustained an injury during your NS training, it may be
              considered as attributable to service only when service is the
              cause of injury. If you sustained an injury during in-camp training
              (ICT), you are required to report immediately to your unit’s
              Medical Officer and unit S1. This is so that your unit can arrange
              to attend to your injury, and document your injury sustained in
              your medical docket and to officially file an in-service training
              injury report.<br> <br> Before MINDEF determines that an injury is attributable to service,
              you are responsible for bearing all medical expenses. Treatment for
              your injury must be sought at government or restructured hospitals
              at your eligible ward and referred to by a government or SAF
              Medical Officer.<br> <br> In the case of permanent disablement due to service injury, a
              medical board will be convened. Eligibility for disability
              compensation will be based on the degree of residual permanent
              disability as endorsed by the SAF Medical Board.<br> <br> If your service injury requires continuous medical or
              hospitalisation leave beyond your in-camp training (ICT) period,
              you are eligible for a stepped-down compensation as a form of
              ex-gratia payment. Compensation will be based on your civilian pay
              or an equivalent regular serviceman’s pay (whichever is higher) if
              you do not receive any income from your employers. This ex-gratia
              payment is compensation for your loss of income during this period.
              Payment will cease when you are no longer on
              medical/hospitalisation leave or when disability compensation is
              paid, whichever is earlier.</p>

              <p><strong>How does an injured serviceman make a claim for the
              medical costs incurred for service injury?</strong><br> <br> The PMC (Personnel Management Centre) will issue all serviceman
              with the SI (Service Injury) Card if their injuries have been
              approved as attributable to service by the Pensions / Awards
              Officer. The serviceman must produce this card to be eligible for
              fully-subsidised medical treatment at the government / restructured
              hospitals.<br> <br> If the SI Card is not produced when seeking treatment, the
              serviceman will have to pay for all the medical cost first and seek
              reimbursement via the respective PMCs with the following
              documents:<br> <br> a. the original medical bills and payment receipts<br> <br> b. a memorandum from the attending doctor to prove that the
              treatment received was for his service injury.<br> <br> The serviceman is required to notify his PMC immediately when he
              loses his SI Card. There will be an administrative charge of $15
              for each replacement of lost or defaced SI Card. He will need to
              make the payment via MINDEF Cashier / Internet and submit the
              receipt to the unit PMC before he will be issued a new SI
              Card.<br> <br> While waiting for the SI Card to be issued or replaced, the
              serviceman may approach the respective PMCs for the issuance of the
              SI Memo (a temporary identification document) for the
              fully-subsidised medical treatment.</p>
