They'll need to cross the Straits of Malacca first.

The US Regular Army, according to one source, is "only" 519,471 big, excluding their National Guard &amp; Army Reserve. Combined, the trio number about 1 million in strength. <span style="font-style: italic;">48 MILLION?</span> ~lol~<br><br>But Indonesia's is organized territorically -- &amp; it's a big country -- &amp;, as I understand their system, also garrison-style with one or more BNs attached to each KODAM. So their infantry operational strength is clustered only in the thousands, but geographically scattered all over their domains &amp;, from our viewpoint, little formal tri-service collaboration &amp; zero combat-arms organization (unlike Malaysia's, which in turn the SAF has almost 15 years' experience on).</div>
