            <div class='col-md body'>If war comes to SG...........run, hide and surrender to the enemy is out of the question.<br><br>Remember WW2 where the allied forces [mostly ang mohs], retreated to Sg and surrendered to the japs.......reason being that SEA is not their homeland......they must have thought why wanna die in Asian country....might as well surrender....get locked up and when liberated by their countrymen.....can go home!<br><br>But .....in reality, it did not happen like dat. Instead, they became slave labour for the Japs.....until many died.  Japs won't wanna use their labourers to build death railways etc, but use the allied soldiers, many were ill-fed, ill-treated and later died or severely incapacitated.<br><br>So, same goes for us. If war comes and we just run and surrender, and wait for war to end so can go back to our families, is not gonna happen. Our enemies.....or conquerors, will ensure they use us as slave labourers to rebuild their land. They won't wanna care if we have enough to eat, or see our families. All they wanna do is plunder our land, make slaves of our able bodied men and have a merry time with our women, wife, daughters sisters!!<br><br>Do you cowards who think that running away or surrender will do you any good??  Think again!!<br><br>For me....I'll fight and take as many with me to hell!

You wouldn't go bomb civilians. The military personnel to be killed are technically not innocent because they are directly contributing to the war effort. Of course civillians will get hit, but it is not the objective of a pre-emptive strike to bomb out civillians a-la-Hiroshima.</div>
