I think since they like to act so much might as well transfer them to the Music and Drama company for good! Even if he stay behind also not much of use as alot of Att C, trouble the clerk some more!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

In 1 week can fall sick(food poisioning and headache) twice each having 2 days ATT C. And this happens very often. Is it true that once u have ATT C u have to be at home 24hrs? Otherwise considered malingering?</div></blockquote>Tell him ATTC means stay in camp. Coz safer for him- He has shown a tendency to be ill; hence he needs to be in an enviroment where there is medical coverage 24/7. The camp is such an environement. Plus, Army food is very unlikely to upset his stomach.<br><br>So even if he report sick outside, tell him he has to come back to camp so that his status can be monitored and he can receive the best possible care. Of course, if he can get himself admitted into hospital (and wants to pay) then fine. Fair play to him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Edit: To up the BS factor (and piss him off more) remind him that as a member of the SAF, and as a person in whom the SAF has invested alot of time and money, the SAF has a vested interest in ensuring a speedy recovery.</div>
