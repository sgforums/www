            <div class='col-md body'>Many many years ago, I was invited to a recruitment talk by SOF. It was before a batch of us were to ROD from full time NS.  In the talk then, the commander spoke about who he would like to see and he made it plain that it was not all commandos (or guardsmen)  he was looking for. (Why else would he invite "normal" infantry officers and NCOs to the talk???).  The only thing he stressed, which I remember to this day are:-<br><br>1) If you have a special civilian skill already... it is a plus-point<br>2) High IPPT scores<br>3) Can swim well<br>4) Not too "gung-ho"<br>5) Reasonable academic record<br><br>Point number 4, he dwelled on for quite a bit of time.  He said that he wanted "calculated risk takers" not " gamblers".  No such thing as the gung-ho Rambos or the SWAT movie type of person. The mission of the SOF is not always hostage rescue. He briefed us on the type of missions that SOF will conduct... which explains the other recruitment criteria.</div>
