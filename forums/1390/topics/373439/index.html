              <p><span>Singapore: More frequent and larger increments in the rank
              allowance for NSmen is among the recommendations put up by the fifth
              committee set up to Recognise the Contributions of Operationally Ready
              National Servicemen to Total Defence or RECORD V (Five). </span></p>
              <p><span> Releasing its recommendations at a news conference Thursday, the
              committee chaired by Minister of State for Defence, Associate Prof Koo
              Tsai Kee also listed proposals such as enhanced fitness corners in
              housing estates for the Individual Physical Proficiency Test (or IPPT),
              a new SAFRA clubhouse in Punggol, and a HomeTeam NS clubhouse in the
              eastern part of Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span>The committee said it identified five key considerations in coming up with the latest proposals.
              <br> <br> They are rising aspirations, the importance of leadership, encouraging
              fitness, globalisation and increased work demands, and building
              cohesion.
              <br> <br>To meet rising aspirations, the committee's recommendation was for
              more frequent and larger increments in rank allowance with the quantum
              of each increment based on the contribution of the NSman since his last
              increment.
              <br> <br>So as to better recognise NSmen in combat vocations, the committee
              also suggested a greater combat allowance so that the allowance premium
              given remains substantial throughout the operationally ready NS cycle.
              <br> <br>It was also proposed that those holding command appointments should
              be given an "add-on allowance" to recognise their greater demand and
              heavier responsibilities.
              <br> <br>Emphasizing the importance of family support for NSmen the
              committee suggested that NSmen who have performed well during in-camp
              training should be presented with vouchers for defence and national
              education related attractions.
              <br> <br>To encourage fitness, the committee said existing fitness corners
              in housing estates for IPPT training should be enhanced along with the
              creation of new fitness corners designed for such training.
              <br> <br>To help NSmen better balance their military training and work
              demands during in-camp training, current business centres within camps
              should be enhanced to provide wireless internet access.
              <br> <br>The committee also said NSmen should also be allowed to bring into
              camp their company-configured laptops, Blackberry devices and PDAs for
              use during non-training hours.
              <br> <br>Finally, the committee called for a new SAFRA clubhouse in Punggol,
              while Home Team NS could consider building one in the eastern part of
              Singapore.
