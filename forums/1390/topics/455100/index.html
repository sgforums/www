              <p>tell your friend dun talk cock , army license is army license , ONLY CAN DRIVE ARMY VEHICLE. you will get your civillian license when you clock your 7000km. and 2 months before ord then you can apply.

              <p>Hello pillow, you're right.</p>
              <p>SAF military driving licence is learn, take text, failed 9 time OOC (Out of Course). There's no way a Military Driving Licence will allow you to drive Civilian Vehicle. The only way to do so is to obtain a Civilian Licence, in this case, you can convert your Military Driving Licence 2 mths before you ORD and clocked at least 7000km (any driver vocation care to double confirm my statement?). There's no shortcut in life pal.</p>

              driving instructor will be able to advise when to sit for the test and 
              do the necessary booking on your behalf.</p>

              safely with other road users and how you comply with and observe traffic
               rules and regulations. It is conducted on the public roads.</p>
              <p class="contenttxt">During the test the 
              examiner will assess your driving performance with a checklist. All 
              possible driving errors are shown on the checklist. If the learner

              the less serious mistakes he will accumulate penalty points ranging from
               2 to 10 for each mistake. A learner driver who accumulates penalty 
              points in excess of a predetermined number of points fails the test. 
              Whether or not you succeed in your driving test, the checklist used for 
              the test will be given to you at the end of the test so that you can
