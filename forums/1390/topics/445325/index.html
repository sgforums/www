I signed my clearance form and all that stuff already. So i was thinking what if I happen to not be careful during army days including bmt, long time ago and maybe lost life jailing things like my rifle or rifle pin (which hopefully I don't think I did), can they still blame you for this after 5 months? I am not sure whether its a mental disorder.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Erm if you got all the signatures on the clearance form already, you should have no problem ORD. At that time my company run around the whole camp chasing all the S1-4 and those in charge of signing, my OC saw it collect whole company clearance form and tell us he will get all the thing done for us. If like your ORD date is near, start washing and packing your stuff. I believe your parents don't want you to bring dusty stuff back home. Don't be like me ORD go back collect IC still got things to bring home.</div>

              <p><br> <br>If you might just lost some minor things, then you just need to sign a 1206 form to compensate money back. If you really lost important rifle component parts, they would have call a Military Police by then before ORD/ disruption. Parts such as LED lens, battery cap only need to write some statements to explain why/ when/ where/ how you lost it. Unless C equippment (eg. blank attachment), then CO may then want to charge with an offence such as monetary fine/ confinement/ SOL<br><br><span style="color: #c0c0c0;"><em>- edited due to poster giving incorrect info -</em></span></p>

              <p><br>as far as i know, so as long as a person have had taken back your NRIC, it's very difficult to chase back the loaned stuff as the person is already back to civilian status (no longer a full-time soldier). therefore, the person is legally not obliged to go back to camp unless he is issued with a SAF100, for which is the standard notice for any reservist call up.<br><br>furthermore, once the clearance form and any loan books are signed, it's the proof in case of any dispute arises to counter argue back that all the parties involved have checked clear, and thus it's not the person's fault anymore.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.ns.sg"><strong><br></strong></a><strong>What is meant by no longer liable for National Service?</strong><br>Under the Enlistment Act, Chapter 93, NSmen will not be liable for NS call-ups when they reach the statutory age limit of 40 for Warrant Officers, Specialists and Enlistees ( WOSEs) and 50 for Officers. In other words, personnel reaching the stated statutory age limit will no longer be liable to be called up for any NS activities such as ICT, IPPT, mobilisation etc.<br><strong><br>Do I have to keep the notification letter?</strong><br>Your National Service liability status will have been updated in our system once you reached your statutory age limit. There is hence no requirement for you to keep the notification letter unless you just want to retain it for reference.<br><br><strong>How can I go about obtaining a replacement copy of the notification letter?</strong><br>As highlighted in para 3, there is actually no requirement for you to keep the notification letter. Should you however still require a replacement copy, you may contact NS Call Centre at 1800-3676767 or email us at contact@ns.sg.<br><br><br><strong>Will all NSmen who reach their statutory age receive the notification letter?</strong><br>Generally, all NSmen will receive the notification letters except for those who are released and discharged on medical grounds or those who renounced their citizenship.<br><br><strong>Do I still need to apply for Exit Permit or inform MINDEF Notification Centre when I travel overseas henceforth?</strong><br>No.<br><br><strong>Will I still enjoy the NSmen tax relief now that I have completed my NS liability?</strong><br>Yes. Generally, all NSmen will continue to enjoy a tax relief of S$1,500.00 from their taxable income unless subsequently revoked by the Proper Authority.</p>
