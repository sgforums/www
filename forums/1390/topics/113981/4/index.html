            <div class='col-md body'>It is very saddening to see my junior batches of officers allowing such things to happen to their own Comms Parade. Nothing happened during Charlie Hotel though  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Anyway, about the airforce guy, he is a WSO (Fighter) from the badge i saw la.... poor guy.. he was actually on heavy medication due to the previous week's training but he was insistent on doing it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I really hope that the punishments were given only after due consideration on a case by case basis.. It definitely is not fair to just tar everyone with the same brush: people can fall ill suddenly, and they should not be punished.<br><br>In my opinion, 21 extras is too much for falling out of a commissioning parade, especially since those are newly commissioned. Imagine getting punished already on your first day of duty...<br><br>I could already feel the heat at the spectator stands, and somemore, people should be more forgiving of mistakes. They fell asleep. So what? Does that make them any worse officers? Officers are after all still humans.</div>
