            <div class='col-md body'>From mindef.gov.sg :-<br><br>379 officer cadets (OCTs) from the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) were commissioned as officers in a parade graced by President S R Nathan at the SAFTI Military Institute this evening.<br><br>A total of 379 cadets from the Officer Cadet School (OCS) were commissioned - 325 from the Army, 40 from the Navy, and 14 from the Air Force. Four officer cadets from the Royal Brunei Armed Forces were also among them.  Seven of the SAF cadets received top accolades as Sword-of-Honour winners.<br><br>The parade marked the completion of an intensive 42 weeks of training, which included a four-week tri-service term where officer cadets of the three services trained together. They were trained and assessed in physical fitness, military knowledge, and leadership. The newly commissioned officers will be assigned combat, instructional or staff appointments in the various units of the SAF.<br><br>Also present at the parade were Minister for Defence, Teo Chee Hean, Minister in Prime MinisterÂ’s Office and Second Minister for Finance, Mr Lim Hng Kiang, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Mayor for North East CDC, Mr Zainal Abidin, Chief of Defence Force, LG Ng Yat Chung, and Chief of Navy, RADM Ronnie Tay, Members of Parliament, grassroots leaders, residents from the neighbourhood, NCC cadets, and students from junior colleges.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SPEECH BY PRESIDENT S R NATHAN, AT THE 55/04 OFFICER CADET COURSE COMMMISSIONING PARADE AT SAFTI MI  </strong><br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/images/23jan05_ocsParade2_sml.jpg"><br><br>Graduands of the 55/04 Officer Cader Course, Parents, Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The year 2004 ended on a somber note which none of us in the region had expected. The earthquake and tsunamis that wiped out various coastal settlements plunged many people into suffering and helplessness. Our hearts go out to the many victims and their families. We also mourn for the Singaporeans whom we lost to the tsunamis. While Singapore is fortunate to have escaped this natural disaster, we are making our best effort to help our neighbors who were badly affected to rebuild their home and their communities. The Singapore Armed Forces, being always ready and vigilant, has been playing a significant role in these efforts.<br><br>This evening, we are witnessing a significant moment for each of you. You are about to be commissioned as officers of the Singapore Armed Forces. My warmest congratulations to you, the graduands. Together with your parents and friends, we celebrate your success after ten months of rigorous and demanding military training to earn you well-deserved place among the Officer Corps.<br><br>You now become part of the proud and distinguished tradition of excellence. Since the first batch of office cadets were commissioned on 16 Jul 1967, this tradition has been upheld by all who have come through the halls of SAFTI. Remember that only the ablest and the committed earn the right and honor to lead our men and women in the SAF. With this honor, you are also entrusted with the solemn responsibility of overcoming any challenge Â– be it safeguarding the peace and security of our nation, or enhancing our role as a responsible state alongside other countries in the world.<br><br>Today, the security climate is undergoing rapid and far-reaching changes. The SAF faces a wider spectrum of threats to our security, both conventional and non-conventional. Terrorism is a real and continuing threat. Already, the Army is on duty round the clock guarding key installations, and the Air Force and Navy are on alert 24 by 7.<br><br>On top of sustaining vigilance in our homeland, the SAF must also stand ready to play a part in helping to preserve peace and security in our region and other parts of the world. One example is the ongoing Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief operation as a result of the recent earthquake and the tsunamis. Our friends called for assistance, and the SAF has shown the world that itÂ’s ready for this call.<br><br>In the aftermath of the tsunami disaster, the SAF has responded swiftly, establishing facilities for and indeed effectively sending relief teams and supplies to our friends, especially Indonesia and Thailand. This was an operation unprecedented in scale in the SAFÂ’s history. Nevertheless, the SAF was ready and able to deliver. We have shown our friends our willingness to help when needed. We sent in our helicopter landing ships and heavy-lift helicopters to fulfill a critical need. I am pleased and proud, as a Singaporean, to see the operational readiness and capability of the SAF has enabled us to lend a helping hand.<br><br>We must always be prepared for the unexpected. IÂ’m glad that the SAF is cognisant of this and has matured to what it is today.<br><br>As commanders, you have a vital role in motivating and training your men to be operationally ready for any eventuality. I am glad to see that the Officer Cadet School believes strongly in preparing you to be Fit, Operationally Competent, Confident and Cohesive. Now, you need to do likewise for the men and women you will lead.<br><br>The rigorous training in OCS would have tested you to the limits of your mental and physical endurance. You have gained the mental and physical resilience necessary for overcoming adverse and unpredictable situations. Replicate your success in your troops. Provide them with demanding and realistic training so that they will be fighting fit and be able to achieve their missions under the most challenging of situations. Prepare them to be highly competent in conducting a wide spectrum of operations both in peacetime and operational settings. You will thereby successfully engender a core of operationally ready National Servicemen, capable of answering the nationÂ’s call for any unprecedented events.<br><br>Remember also that no mission is ever achieved by one single man or woman. You will need to build cohesion within your team as well as with the larger unit you work in. Build the esprit de corps necessary for great teamwork, which is often the key to successful mission accomplishment. The ongoing Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief has many good examples of how our people Â– Regulars, NSFs, NSmen and Volunteers Â– have come together to work for a common goal. We should continue to embrace such a culture.<br><br>As you continue to demand high standards of fitness, cohesion and operational readiness, do not forget to ensure the welfare and safety of your soldiers. Take the time to listen to their problems and concerns and encourage the weaker ones. Ensure that training safety is carried out. Only when your soldiers know that you care for them, will they put their wholehearted trust in your leadership and follow you willingly. They will emerge from National Service with great satisfaction, and you can be proud that you have been instrumental in creating a positive NS experience for them.<br><br>As you assume command after your commissioning, always remember to uphold the professional image of the SAF through your exemplary bearing and personal conduct. Hold steadfast to the SAF Core Values. Let these ideals be your personal code of conduct. They will serve as an indispensable guide, the spiritual bedrock upon which moral strength is derived.<br><br>It also gives me great pleasure to witness today the commissioning of four cadets from the Royal Brunei Armed Forces. Your graduation from the SAF Officer Cadet School bears testimony to the close ties and warm friendship that exists between our armed forces and our nations. The close friendships you have forged these past few months with your fellow cadets from the SAF will further strengthen the bonds between our nations well into the future.<br><br>Today is indeed a proud moment for you, your parents, and for all of us here today. I join your families and friends in congratulating you on your commissioning. The task now falls squarely upon your shoulders, as newly commissioned officers of the SAF, to take on any challenges that face our nation. I am confident that with the skills, knowledge and qualities imparted to you, you are now ready to face and overcome these challenges. Carry out your duties to the best of your abilities. Always uphold the OCS motto: Â“To Lead, To Excel, To OvercomeÂ”.<br><br>I wish you the very best in your future roles as commissioned officers of the SAF.<br><br></div>
