              <p>Confirmed... if you never go for IPPT, usually is fine only, but will depend on CO of your unit, some first time already charged, but usually fine only. Even second time also fine.</p>
              <p>Skipping of IPPT also results in fine for first time and second time, third time will be charged.</p>
              <p>The DB is similar to a civilian jail, as in the cells are small and cramp. Its all bricks and no windows at all. The toilet (squating type) is in the cell, and usually several of you will share the cell. There is a 3 men cell and up to a 7 men cell (if i remember correctly).</p>
              <p>You have to shave botak and wear their clothes, its something like in jail. Do foot drills and exercise everyday. Simply speaking all the people in DB looks very down and most of them have the kua lan face.</p>
              <p>And in DB, if you kua lan with the officers or what, then you will be sentence to a dark cell in which there will be no light at all, except a door that is locked from outside most of the time. If you get sentenced into this cell, then good luck to you, cause its usually 3-7 days. You will only sleep inside, no exercise nothing at all for you. Whole day inside that cell, excpt for 15 mintues a day in which you come out to empty your potty and bath. Yes you shit and urine into a potty. In this room, cause its brick its warm in the day and cold at night. So imagine closing your eyes 23 hours and 45 minutes every day for 7 days. TORTURE!!!!</p>
              <p>And if I never remember wrongly, going to DB is equivalent to go to jail/prison. You will have a mark!!!</p>
              <p>Why I know all these?? Because I went to DB before (as a visitor)..</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think singapore not strict enough. people miss 1 ippt should just go firing range and get sentenced to death, same like smuggling drugs. why? because serving the nation is fucking more important than making a living. we don't care that you need your job or you need to do OT or whatever problem, if you lose your job, that's fine, starve to death, no problem, just remember to come for ippt. your ippt is more important than your job, no money sleep in the street at most, no money to eat at least starve to death, but MUST COME FOR IPPT!!!</div>
