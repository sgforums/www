              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Im a NSmen that have a perm C1L3 and excuse outfield training due to skin allergy during service times. I like to check who should I find to change my ICT unit?</p>
              <p>My problems:</p>
              <p>After ORD, I went for further studies and during then I received a letter which said I have been posted to a unit. After 4years of studies, when I return back to SG, my unit is so happy to recall me back for the next ICT.</p>
              <p>During the ICT, the exercise involved urban training which is dusty and my skin unable to cope and that is when I fall out during training and return to bunk (of coz being excuse all training). My officer came to me and told me to get specialist letter and ask for re-vocation if possible because my current unit is 99% active in outfield.</p>
              <p>After ICT, I went back to my specialist and wrote a letter to MO as new case of skin allergy has found on me and downgrade my pes to Temp C2L3 + excuse outfield training. Reason is due to grass, dust and etc.</p>
              <p>I submitted my specialist letter to MO to acknowledge and further downgrade me which he did  but he did not request to change my ICT unit.</p>
              <p>Questions:</p>
              <p>1) Who should I look for to re-vocate or change of unit?</p>
              <p>Anyone can provide a clear advice.. <br></p>

              <p>I have seen the MO several times but MO only constantly extend my downgrade. Used to 6mths temp C2 to 1 year Temp C2.</p>
              <p>I dont think he able to refer for revocate because he doesnt know my unit training plan and no idea if it is 99% active outfield.</p>
              <p>I tried spoken to my camp NSHRC and they ask me to see MO, the ball keep passing between them and no action taken.</p>
              <p>If I email to <a href="mailto:contact@ns.sg">contact@ns.sg</a> will they assist on my request with no S1 or MO referral letter?</p>
              <p>My Unit S1 is NSmen too and I have no idea how to get him and explain my scenario or get him to write me referral letter.</p>
              <p>Any suggestion?</p>
