              <p>i guess it all depends on ur superiors, either ur OC or CO..</p>
              <p>i've never heard of disruption for poly, only disruption for uni..</p>
              <p>my platoon mate started poly in april (we ORD in June). My OC approve to let him go for his studies, but have to come back to camp in case of any emergencies or any callbacks..</p>
              <p>u can try consulting ur future unit's S1 branch.</p>

              <p>im not sure how things will work for you in police, if you are going there for ur NS.</p>
              <p>my mate wasn't given disruption.. he was just allowed to go and study, on condition that he still has to do his guard duties or come back to camp if needed. he will still ORD with us.</p>

              <p>Disruption and deferment are 2 different things. What do you actually want?</p>
              <p>Disruption is to end your NSF service a few months before ORD to persue your studies and payback later while deferement is to delay the start of NS.</p>
              <p>Disruptions are mostly for uni students and is on a case by case basis depending on how much your unit manpower officer willing to fight for you.</p>
              <p>Deferment is granted to anyone who wans to persue A's or Dip and are below the age of 20 on the year of enrolment.</p>

              <p>That depends on your unit. If what you want is a disruption, why do you care that you are enlisting in 10 days? Go in le, after training school and you are posted to a perm unit, from there then go check with your superior about such procedures.</p>
              <p>Since you enlisting to SPF and not SAF, you might get better answers by asking in the SPF forums and not the SAF forum as well.</p>

              <p>Hmm. I also have a similar problem to you....For me, I push my admission to poly to the admission year(current admission year is 2010, pushed to 2011).</p>
              <p>Reason for this is because of this kind of problems, it crashes with NS. I just wanted to avoid unnecessary trouble of asking here and asking there for disruptions, or come back to camp during school holidays, etc.</p>
              <p>The other reason is because, imagine you're going to ORD soon, I'm sure you would want to like...take a break or something? And not just rush straightaway into school and then face a whole lot new people...</p>
              <p>Take a break, fly around the world, go on tour, have fun, or just have a kit-kat before you face school again.</p>

              <p>First 1-2  months in poly is not too hectic anyway even if you have to run both sides. If you have the will to do it, its possible.</p>
              <p>Just wait till you have enlisted and check with your superiors about this since how SPF works is not something most of us here can really advice.</p>
              <p>Good luck for your O's. Feel free to drop by homework forum if you have questions and need help with your studies.</p>
