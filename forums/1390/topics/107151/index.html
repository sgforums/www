            <div class='col-md body'>this may give us some clue:<br><br>Unarmed but dangerous<br><br>What is your role and responsibility?<br>My job is to turn men into fighters. The human body itself can be a very deadly weapon, so I teach my trainees the techniques of <strong>close combat training (CCT)</strong>. In the process, I also want to make them more aggressive.<br><br>How did you become an instructor?<br>All CCT instructors must have at least a brown belt in Taekwondo. I attended a five-week course at the School of Physical Training (SPT), where, for two weeks, I learnt more Taekwondo techniques. After that, for another three weeks, I learnt close combat techniques, including throws, punches and how to break falls. This package comprises key elements of various martial arts. After this, I went for a six-week on-the-job training phase where I was evaluated on my instructional methods.<br><br>What is your work day like?<br>I conduct lessons in one unit in the morning, and move to another unit for more lessons in the afternoon. Sometimes I spend the whole day at the same place. In a week, I can visit up to eight or nine units. CCT instructors are given quite a lot of independence, and I do my own physical training in the free time between lessons. After all, there are good sporting facilities in many camps.<br><br>Whom do you teach?<br><strong>From recruits to commanders</strong>! In a unit, these could be the officer commanding, platoon commanders and sergeants all coming together for my lesson. Although I address them accordingly, I still treat them all as my trainees. There is no distinction or any discrimination during training.<br><br>How do the younger trainees compare to the older ones?<br>The younger trainees are more flexible, but the older ones tend to absorb and pick up techniques more quickly. However, the enthusiasm shown by both groups is the same. They are all eager to learn!<br><br>What attracted you to martial arts?<br>I took up Taekwondo when I was 15 years old. I felt I should be able to defend myself and when I saw people doing Taekwondo, I thought to myself, 'When pushed to the limit, the human body can really achieve some amazing things!' I read up on other martial arts techniques, and whenever I have questions, I clarify them with other instructors in SPT.<br><br>What do you like best about being an instructor?<br>I feel proud knowing that I am training officers and specialists, people who are also instructors to other soldiers.<br><br>What do your trainees say about your teaching methods?<br>Most of them say I am very approachable, so whenever they are in doubt, they feel comfortable enough to ask me questions. But it is important to draw a line between training and having fun.<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/cyberpioneer/images/features_nov04_img2.jpg"><br><br>--cyberpioneer<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SAF started Taekwondo in 1972. At first only the commandos were introduced to this martial art. However later many combat units also took TKD as the standard form of unarmed combat. But, in 1985, they felt that in many aspects of tkd were no use in war, so they introduced unarmed combat in 4 grades. Since tkd was too focused on patterns and kicking. The SAF was initially training under the koreans in the late seventeens and the early 80s by the taiwanese.The training was very tough..Trainees were often encouraged to 'play' with real bayonets. The instructors would often make the trainees to lose the fear and be more aggressive by making them lying down and dropping bayonets on their chests. The UC syllabus however was a radically different syllabus consisting of 11 throws and other forms of locks and etc taken from other martial arts and hence the shortcomings of TKD were dealt with effectively. ... However during training, rather than unarmed combat emphasis was placed upon flexibility and the ability to kick high. Hence the trainees did splits for long periods which proved to be physically and mentally very taxing..The syllabus was more comprehensive in that there were techniques such as defence against rope and stick attack. However time was short to learn all the techniques in the 4 grades as majority of the time the trainees were being "stretched" to their limit. Hence perfection and effectiveness was lacking.  Adding to that, after a 1995 incident involving a trainee who got killed after a throw went wrong there was a massive cut in the syllabus. Hence UC was cut to just 2 grades with the number of throws going down from 11 to2 !! Further changes were made to make the techniques less dangerous for the trainees which ended up defeating the purpose of the techniques themselves as they were intended to be dangerous in the first place!!! However a new phase of unarmed combat came in 2003 with a radical change in syllabus to accomodate more realistic situations with more effective techniques!! UC is moving away from TKD and gongfu style techniques to practical and effective ways of hand to hand combat at close range.Hence, the name changes from UC to close combat. As close combat instructors our job is to teach skills to the layman! Hence the techniques implemented are far from gong fu style patterns but more realistic and more target oriented training that aims to inculcate aggression and fighting spirit togehter with a killer instinct! To say that the techniques are Wayang would be seriously wrong as these very techniques are being used by Israel in their unarmed combat called Krav Maga! Hence to clear the doubts let me say that UCIs or CCIs are not gong fu masters.. We're just a special breed of soldiers who are trained to fight with bare hands and legs. Based on aggression and speed, coupled with killer instinct it is possible to effectively eliminate simple yet life threatining threats such as a knife attack or any unarmed attack.  Just because NSF trainees lack enthusiasm does not mean that the techniques are no good! For anybody to benefit from these techniques there needs to be enthusiasm not just on the instructors part but also on the trainees part! We are trying hard to make lessons interactive and realistic so do give us some credit! Just to let you guys know.. All UCIs aka CCIs hold TKD black belt 1st dan. Hence we've seen martial arts too. But we also teach non martial art techniques and incorporate them into our lessons! In most cases we use simple strikes at effective locations such as the groin or the nose to achieve control over hostage crisis etc.. We are not taiji master or any sinseh for that matter.. We're just fighters who happen to know martial arts too!! So please do not call us wayang kulit etc.. It is very easy to sit at the desktop and accuse people of being incompetent..If you do have any doubts please visit us at TKD clubs around Singapore and watch us train... Or just drop by one of our demos held anually at various locations...But dont come too near... haha!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For those who think bcct is useless(gordonator), please think again... It is called Basic close combat training. hence it involves very fundamental aspects of unarmed combat like punching, kicking etc. It is also for discipline and physical endurance.Even, u learn any martial arts out there, u will have to start from the very basics. Thats why  you stand under the sun in horse riding stance. ICCT and ACCT have much more interesting things in store for you... Like locks and throws...  So BCCT is intended for the blur fellow who knows nothing about how to inflict pain!!! And believe me there are such ppl in NS!!"Just attending 9 lessons of BCCT to become a super fighter is nearly impossible.Everyone knoe that learning and to master a certain martial art takes years.We are trying our best to teach the soldiers the most simple ways to handle any situations they might encounter not just in war but also on the streets.<br></div>

Didn't know I sorta belonged to the pioneer batches too. We also did baynonet-fighting, but our UC training wasn't that specialized: very basic &amp; TKD-ish with its throws (mostly) &amp; kicks/punches, &amp; altogether not that emphasized cuz we used to cancel the one-fifth of the total schedules due to other combat needs or make-up training.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many of you might be saying that why close combat still is around and needed due to uses of high tech weaponry in the armed forces around the world. But one has to concede that there are situations where high tech weaponry is not the best or easiest response .<br><br>1.Any situation where military installations (either yours or theirs) are overrun. (e.g., Fire bases, missile sites, radar installations, and supply depots.)<br><br>2.Any conflict in the Asian Theater of Operations. Traditionally, Asian forces are dominated by communist trained insurgents that extensively use the strategy of "grabbing the belt". (i.e., Close ranks on the enemy and force them to fire upon themselves.)<br><br>3.Situations of domestic terrorism where counter-insurgency operations in an urban environment are implemented.<br>Situations where military forces are employed as peacekeepers.<br><br>4.Military operations that include infiltration and sabotage.<br><br>5.Situations involving evasion and escape (SERE).

            <div class='col-md body'>IntegraType-R is right.Not all the men are interested in martial arts. Somemore now, SAf is too safety conscience.Alot of of stuffs or deadly moves are not allowed to teach the trainees due to TSR or lesson plans.Every training are to follow the lesson plans due to some accidents or death cases. Now, many of the soldiers are too 'kia see'.U ask them to do dangerous moves, they will sae u siao.How to teach them in this way if they do not change their thinking. Many of the UCIs, CCIs or even UCAIs are TKD fighters.Its not surprise if u find out that your instructors are either safsa or national fighters for TKD.Sometimes, it is not they dont want to teach u the deadly moves, but is they cannot due to TSR.They do not only teach close combat to normal combat units but also teach TKD to the MP, Cdos and SOF.<br></div>
