              <p>It's best you don't lose anything. but I think pes letter is not that important. must bring IC, and those things they ask you to bring very subjective. I don't bring a clock cos I wake up with my watch. if you're going into where you are going, better to bring a watch, then can monitor your timings.</p>
              <p>Bring washing powder(for me I put in a coke bottle), snake powder, glucose, clothes hangers, some cloth for area cleaning, chinese chess set if you play. OH most important, slippers!</p>
              <p>it's always because of the standardising that some items are essential. like clothes how many hanging, how many folded. blah blah..</p>
              <p>I forgot to bring slippers and I have to go toilet barefoot for the confinement period. then again, you can borrow from your buddy if he don't mind.</p>

              <p>hiyo.. PTP and BMT all in PRC. Vocational training some in PRC some go other camps. BCT is shortened to a crash course like period but it will be a lot to learn. the highlights is never during the BMT. it's only during Airborne course which I feel like it's the best part of my life. all the training for 3 weeks just for less than a minute floating in the air.</p>
              <p>the whole experience is great. PRC is like a holiday school so don't worry that much. back at hendon will be hell.. because of ATEC, some evaluation, if you don't know.. :)</p>
              <p><br>oh, got something known as Ironman challenge before you pass to hendon, which is also part of BCT.</p>

              <p>I'm so sorry for you. cdos have to get under 9.14 for 2.4km. so Running is inevitable. that including 6km ahm, and 21km ahm. Ironman challenge I don't know got change or not.. but it's just some running, clearing some obstacles, doing some crawling around, testing on your weapon knowledge. very easy one(subjective) don't worry!</p>
              <p>BCT in PRC is just the tip of the ice berg, when you pass over to hendon, you still got turnouts, and that's when you get banished back to a recruit life again. so you'll get trained again and again. don't worry about not siong enough! :) it's true there's less(doesn't mean don't have) tekan, but the tight training schedule will be a challenge! it'll be around 9-10 months before you earn your beret.</p>
              <p>And that's only just turning operational.. :D more training comes and life gets hectic with endless outfields carrying heavier loads. all for Atec, which is basically a proficiency test of all combat units on their performance and etc.. part and parcel of NSF life.</p>
              <p>Lastly, you start with platoons of 60-70+ people, and it gets trimmed down before you get to hendon. we work in small numbers so don't worry about efficiency nor imtimidating factors.. either way, you'll be required to get it over with.</p>
              <p>all officers go thru spec course aka leader course. and only a handful like maybe 15% become selected. I don't know if they remained that way cos the last i know of is they cut down the number of leaders..</p>
              <p>Just try to adapt the military life first, before thinking so much.. :D</p>
