I don't think medical students qualify to use the DR prefix in front of their names.<br><br>Not sure of the mechanism of sudden cardiac death but i don't think it's the fault of the medical system, after all, this COL probably collapsed and died on the spot. The reports did say that he was given immediate medical attention and was even shocked with the defibrillators. It's just another unfortunate incident that happens rather frequently, people collapsing and dying suddenly following strenuous activity.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

Locally, the Indians tend to have a much higher risk compared to the Chinese or the Malays.

Defib can be done in a moving ambulance; all the more with the new Ford Ambulance. The mistake was to delay transport to the hospital where better and intense treatment could be given.<br><br>Sadly, I believe there may be a trial for those medical personnel and others involved.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </strong>[/b]</blockquote>I think the medics are acting according to some standing orders for them. It seems that everytime incidents of collaspe happen, they take at least 20 to 30 minutes to evacuate the victim.<br><br>Maybe the medics should have expedite the situation according to their experience and instinct. I can't say that I'm right as I'm not a medic. These are just my thoughts.<br><br>Then again, how could one expect fast evacuation when you can spend 2 hours waiting to see MO at Medical Centre, and another few hours for your medicine and status?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

If he was in asystole, they needed to get the adrenaline in before there is any ECG tracing to talk about.<br><br>My guess is that they couldn't even get a drip set in, not to talk about defibrillation. You can certainly do defib in an ambulance but you will find it very difficult to set a drip in a moving ambulance if you haven't had much experience. If they couldn't get a drip in on firm ground, they cannot hope to do it in the ambulance.<br><br>Most of the medics haven't set drips since SMM, especially if they are combat medics. In my experience, only service medics in the sickbay set drips on a regular basis.</div>
