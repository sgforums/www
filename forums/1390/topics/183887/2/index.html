            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by juay323:</div><div class="quote_body">This concern of your is actuallynot founded if u ponder deeper into the system. On the contrary, the SAF cookhouses operated by Singapore Food Industries and NTUC Foodfare have have to comform to strict dietry standards in the meals that they prepare as stapulated in  their terms of contract. To govern this system, the are mechanisms in place to check the the quality of food which is prepared.<br><br>a) Firstly, individuals soldiers perform weeky surveys of the food that is prepared.<br><br>b) Secondly, DSTA performs surprise sport checks on the cook house from time to time to collect food samples to sent to the laboratories for analysis to ensure that the dietry requirements are met (with some degree ofdiscrepancises built in of course)<br><br>While, it is undeniable that deep fried foofs are unhealty, but they are only served once a week ( another term in their contract ). From what i also understand and observe at my ex cook house, they are also not allowed to serve more than 1 type of processed food (sardines, fishballs, fish cake etc) item in the menu for each meal.<br><br>In fact, for the typical SAF soldiers, if he were to just stick to the cookhouse diet and not eat other canteen foods and maintain a level of physical activity they is no reason for him to gain too much weight. Of course not everyone abide by this and some will even skip their meals at the cookhouse just to patronise the canteen.......<br><br>Besides, if the cookhouse were only to serve all the healthy foods, do u think all the soldiers would really like it? On the other hand, to applease the typical 19-20 yr old enlistee the cookhouses just have to prepare fried food every meal to please them.....but they do it? The answer is obviously no too. So the system is balance by serving them a variety of foods in the weekly menu to balance the 2 issues of variety and nutritional contents.<br><br>Lastly, if u really doubt what i am saying, just visit your cookhouse for every meal in any given week and draw yr own observations and conclusions.......<br><br></div></blockquote>u've never really eaten cookhouse food have u?<br><br>Anyways, SFI is also another big WAYANG lar.  My camp cookhouse had this very bad habit of serving a lot of canned preserve meats.  How healthy can that get?  The food also salty like hell.<br><br>True, the soldiers survey, and the food improves... for a week.  Den the same ol' shit happens again.<br><br>Seriously, i don't blame the food for the deaths.  I believe its the water and the air that we have.  Singapore's air isn't getting any cleaner.</div>

But, can any other contractor or the old SAF cooks fare any better in providing better nutrition? .....i'll leave u all to decide. My point is that the food is indeed meant to be nutritious. The fact that units tolerate such misadventure by SFI to serve such oily, fattening and salty food is infact mismanagement by yr unit comd, logistics officer....they have not demanded for standards frm the contractors which they have every right to do so to begin with.<br><br>3) Lets also not deviate too much frm this topic, and be too speculative in our own assumptions on the poosible casuation of the death. Lets all be respectful to the deceased officer and his family. We will leave the postmortem to deliver the facts.<br><br></blockquote></div>
