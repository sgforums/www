Kicking the rifle would be one of the last things i would do. I imagine force of the kick might be enough to either cause the recruit to jerk the trigger, or to cause the firing mechanism to slam onto the bullet. That could very well be the most serious mistake your friend made in the army.<br><br>Btw, i made the same mistake as the recruit, but in different circumstances. Not something that stuck in my mind though.</div>
