            <div class='col-md body'>1). I shot an IV line into my buddy's arm during my combat medic course. Unfortunately, I shot right at the junction of two veins. In the end, my buddy got a huge haematoma on his arm of about 6cm in diameter. To those who don't know what a haematoma is, it is a swelling underneath the skin due to the accumulation of blood.<br><br>Luckily my buddy was pretty cool about it. My sergeant really f-ed me upside down though.<br><br>2). Bayonet fighting practice. I didn't fix my bayonet properly to my rifle. As a result, while we were doing 'Slash', my bayonet flew into the air..... and landed on my friend's head. Pointed end down.<br><br>Luckily he was wearing his helmet. Amazing that the sergeants didn't see that.<br><br>3). The whole unit was supposed to have three days' off. But during off, we received a last-minute order to come back on the second day to prepare for CO change-of-command parade. All the COS messaged everyone to come back.<br><br>Unfortunately, I had just changed my handphone number and didn't receive the message. I end up being 'accidental' AWOL for one day.<br><br>Once again, I was v.v.lucky. As the whole unit was ORD-ing soon, everything was pretty havoc. No one seemed to notice my absence in the chaos.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was almost kanna charged when my M113's batteries went flat without my knowledge. It happened so when one of electricians when into the vehicle, without my knowledge, to do some periodic checks and forgot to "off" the master switch. I discovered it the next day and reported it to the tech squad. NB, the tech squad's CSM informed my CSM and I was called to the office. The tech squad's CSM insisted that I was to be charged but my CSM managed to pacify him. In the end, I kanna screwed upside and signed 3 extra duties.<br><br>Later, then I know, the electrician denied the responsibilties and said he never went into my M113. I went to the workshop and screwed him upside down and showed him the evidences (every check on the vehicle was recorded in the vehicle's maintenance logbook). We had a heaty exchange, I used all my XYZs in my dictionary on him. First time, in the battlion history, a CPL screwed a 2SG. Shiok siah. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

During this time, all my charges were kept in Tupperware boxes as per SOP.<br><br>Anyway, by the time it became my turn to set up my charge, it had stopped raining for a few hours and the ground had dried up.  After I set up my charges and lit the fuse on order, a captain came up and started giving me grief about only wrapping the last 2 cm of the det cord with PVC tape.<br><br>Sure, if it had still been raining or if the ground was wet, SOP would have been to wrap the last 10 cm or so, just to make sure that the exposed end didn't get wet.  However, the ground was dry, so I debated the point with him.<br><br>To cut a long story short, he pulled rank on me and I gave him chapter and verse about the tape issue (we had both attended the same Pioneer course).  It degenerated into a screaming match, until we realised that the fuse was still burning and we were standing right in the middle of the firing chain.  We bolted for cover and thankfully, neither of us was injured.<br><br>Anyway, the postscript is that I got hauled up to my OC, who gave me a good bollocking for verbally abusing a superior officer, but since the firing chain detonated as planned, I got away with no extras. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>during one weekend guard duty, there was a mobilisation exercise going on. a SSG in charge of the mobilisation came down to the guardhouse requesting the back gate of the camp to be open for the mobilisation advance party and key appointment holders to come in.<br><br>normally during weekends, all gates are to be closed or in this case, appoint someone from our side to man the gate if it was to be opened. but as it was weekend, there was no one i could spare to man the back gate whole day from 12nn to 8pm. the guards got their whole duties to do, beside they wouldn't know how to operate the gate anyway.<br><br>luckily, the SSG reassured me that he'll send some NSman to man the back gate for the whole mobilisation. i agreed and opened the back gate and proceeded back to the guardhouse. there were NSman maning the gate when i left.<br><br>the next day, a e-mail from CO shooted down to my CSM. turns out the stupid NSman left the back gate big big for the whole mobilisation and my CO happened to drive past the camp and saw it. he complained why the back gate was open during a weekend and possibilities of breach of security. anyone could have drove in and plant a bomb or something.<br><br>the CSM f**ked me upsidedown why i let the NSman man the back gate? i reasoned to him that i couldn't spare any man at all as the guards got their own duties to do. he then lectured me why i didn't brief the NSman on the proper gate handling procedures. ok this i got nothing to say, i never knew NSman was so gong one! common sense tell us, especially during weekends, all gates are to be manned closed right?<br><br>i was kinda expecting extras, but in the end nothing. haha.</div>
