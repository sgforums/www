              <p>Hello, NS pre-enlistee here, I am going for the CMPB Checkup and the MAPAS soon.</p>
              <p>1. Do we have 10-Year Series for the <em>MAPAS</em> questions? <br>Go bookshops such as Popular?</p>
              <div id="second_col"><img title="MAPAS test" src="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/mapas.jpg" alt="Pre-enlistee taking the MAPAS test" width="400" height="300">
              <p><br><em>After you have completed the medical screening, you will 
                                sit for a computer-based Manpower APtitude Assessment System (MAPAS) 
                                test. MAPAS consists of a series of tests (e.g. psychomotor skills, 
                                mental-spatial ability, etc.) to assess the mental abilities of <abbr title="Full-time National Servicemen">NSFs</abbr>.
                                 The test scores are used to place NSFs in vocations/ appointments 
                                where their abilities can be best used. The entire test is about 2½ 
                                hours.</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. How to get posted to SPF/ SCDF to do NS? <br>Is it must need to speak to the customer service officer at the counters at CMPB? <br>Is it must need to call the 24/7 NS hotline at 1800-3676767 to request/ express interest?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How? What to do?</p>
