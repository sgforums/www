Besides the fact that he was a pretty likeable guy, most of the officers and specialists treated him with some deferrence.  I still remember seeing once how the HQ CSM actually asked him if he could do guard duty.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But the fact that your runner was such an integral cog to how you ran your platoon and obviously was smart enough to do both the combat side of things along with the admin side, proves my point (in my other post) to doubters out there that some LCPs in key positions should be promoted to CPLs and even sometimes given opportunities to hold higher appointments.<br><br>Just to round out the story, my CO's runner after ORD, went on to a pretty good US university and got 2 degrees.</div>
