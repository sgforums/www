            <div class='col-md body'>In this issue of Army News, we put our focus on Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Specialists. They are the experts in bomb neutralisation and disposal of explosive traps.<br><br>EOD Specialists need to be precise and thorough when solving problems. They have to think and move at the speed of light when faced with a challenging situation. They must maintain a high level of equipment competence and are truly experts in conquering obstacles and moving troops.<br><br>Army News spoke to EOD Specialist, 2WO Chay Chan Yin, to find out more about this vocation.<br><br>Army News: What is the main responsibility of an EOD Specialist?<br><br>2WO Chay: Our responsibility is to render safe explosive ordnance as well as improvised explosive devices. <strong>All EOD specialists usually operate in three-man teams with the most senior as the team commanders. Everyone in the team is rotated for stand-by duties as well as to carry out training. </strong><br><br><strong>Army News: What makes a good EOD Specialist?<br><br>2WO Chay: There are three main factors. First, it is very important for an EOD Specialist to remain cool, calm and to maintain his composure when operating in any situation. Second, he must have very sound analytical ability, especially during incidents involving improvised explosive devices. Finally, he should have a good level of physical fitness.<br></strong><br>Army News: What challenges does an EOD Specialist face?<br><br>2WO Chay: I think the toughest part is keeping pace with the rapid development in technology for conventional explosive ordnance as well as the trends of terrorist bombing activities. Today, you have a set procedure to settle a certain problem, but the next day, there may be something new whereby you must scratch your head again and come up with additional precautions and procedures. ItÂ’s very important that both the individual and the unit are always aware of the latest developments.<br><br>Army News: How do you feel about the risks involved in your job?<br><br>2WO Chay: We just have to be very careful all the time. Within the EOD cohort, we have this saying, Â“A mistake you make can always be the very last mistake you can ever make!Â” The mistake could cost you your life in a real operation.<br><br>Army News: Is there any interesting incident that you can recall?<br><br>2WO Chay: I will remember one incident for life. A British fragmentation hand grenade that had been left behind from World War II was found at a camp at Changi. The safety features for the grenade were all gone. I had no choice but to dispose it on the spot. It was near the buildings within the compound as well as the main road. We had to coordinate with the police to evacuate all personnel in the building. I also had to coordinate with the airport authorities to ensure that no aircraft flew by during the operation. The airport authorities only gave me ten minutes to carry out my job, which meant that I had to work really fast. The experience was truly unforgettable.<br><br>-army news interactive.<br><br></div>
