              <p>Ok so I'm currently a PR here and i need to serve NS soon. My ultimate plan is to leave to UK and get a citizenship there by say 30+ years of age but I am planning on getting a Singaporean citizenship after NS because it's much easier to travel with a  and also I'm looking at a sea career so it'll be easier for me to port at countries without needing to apply for a visa etc. </p>
              <p>What I want to know is can you renounce the singaporean citizenship after the 2 years of NS? I ask this because I read online that males cannot renounce until NS is completed but does this mean the 10 year cycle ORD is included? </p>

              <p>So what do you want actually? UK or Singapore citizenship?</p>
              <p>If you are a PR, you can renounce your Singapore PR, and leave the country, without having to serve NS. However, you will be blacklisted by ICA, and will probably never be able to regain your PR status again.</p>
              <p>If you do stay to do NS, they will offer you Singapore citizenship after you complete your 2 years military service, but you will have to renounce your original citizenship first.</p>
              <p>Taking up UK citizenship will require several years of living in the UK. You will not be recalled back for reservist duties if you live overseas.</p>
              <p>Hope that answers your question.</p>

              <p>Second Generation Permanent Residents are required to go through 
              compulsory full-time national service as well as reservist duties after 
              they have completed their full-time national service and turns 
              operationally-ready (ORD).</p>
              <p>Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen stated in Parliament that between 
              2006 to 2011, about 8,800 males who had become permanent residents under
               the sponsorship of their parents were enlisted for and served National 
              Service (NS). On the other hand, 4,200 males who had become permanent 
              residents under the sponsorship of their parents renounced their PR 
              status prior to serving national service.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Singapore#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> Their failure to serve NS will be taken into account to have adverse 
              impact when they subsequently apply to study/ work/ visit/ travel in 
              Singapore. These ex-PRs were sternly warned about the dire consequences 
              of their actions at the point of renunciation.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Singapore#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>After completing full-time national service, they are eligible to 
              apply for Singapore citizenship. However, citizenship is not guaranteed 
              for all applicants, as there are certain criteria that must be met such 
              as educational qualification, income qualification and NS work 
              performance/ conduct appraisal in the NS Certificate of Service upon 
              ORD. From 2006 to 2010, about 2% of 3,000 Second Generation Permanent 
              Residents who completed full-time national service and applied for 
              Singapore citizenship were rejected.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Singapore#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>If the person does not hold Singapore citizenship but still holds 
              Singapore permanent residency, he is still required to serve the service
               requirement, i.e. reservist duties after he turns operationally-ready.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Singapore#cite_note-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Singapore Permanent Residents who served national service but did not
               acquire Singapore citizenship will be treated equally to those 
              permanent residents without service obligation; they would not have 
              access to the privileges granted to Singapore citizens.</p>
