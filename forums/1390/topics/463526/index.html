They are otherwise civilians, and in peacetime have careers outside the military. Reservists usually go for training on an annual basis to refresh their skills. This person is usually a former active-duty member of the armed forces, and they remain a reservist either voluntarily, or by obligation. In some countries such as Israel, Norway, Singapore, and Switzerland, reservists are conscripted soldiers who are called up for training and service when necessary.<br><br>When a conscript completes his full-time service, he is considered to be "operationally ready", and is thereafter known as an Operationally-Ready National Serviceman (NSman). NSmen are the equivalent of other militaries' reservists. The difference in nomenclature is because these NSmen will form the bulk of the Singapore Armed Forces in times of war. The term Operationally-Ready National Servicemen conveys more importance than the reservists. Similarly, Operationally-Ready NSmen of the SPF and SCDF are available to be called on in time of need.</p></div>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Military Justice System in the
                  SAF</span></span></strong><br> <br> 1. Overview<br> The military justice system in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is
                  expected to treat every service personnel fairly and equally,
                  regardless of race, rank or vocation.</p>
              <p> <br> 2. Multi-levelled Approach</p>
              <p>The military justice system is based on the SAF Act, which was
                  implemented in 1972. All servicemen are subjected to the SAF Act,
                  SAF Regulations, and orders of whatever form issued pursuant to
                  them.</p>
              <p>While discipline is paramount in the military, not all offences
                  committed by SAF servicemen are dealt with by formal investigations
                  and charges. Essentially, offenders can be dealt with either by way
                  of informal or formal punishment systems.</p>
              <p> <br> 3. Informal Punishment System<br> Commanders are empowered to mete out informal punishments like
                  push-ups and weekend confinement to servicemen who have committed
                  disciplinary breaches, like being late, sluggish, or improperly
                  dressed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Formal Punishment System<br> If the offence that a serviceman committed is of a more serious
                  nature, he may be formally dealt with by his disciplinary officer
                  by way of a summary trial, or brought before a subordinate military
                  court (more commonly known as the General Court Martial or
                  GCM).</p>
              <p>(a) Summary Trial</p>
              <p>The offences that can be dealt with by summary trial are
                  essentially military offences, such as absence without leave
                  (AWOL), non-compliance with lawful orders or insubordination.</p>
              <p>Depending on the rank of the serviceman in question, and the
                  type of the disciplinary body hearing the case, the possible
                  sentences that may be imposed can vary, and these can include fines
                  or detention.</p>
              <p>The summary trial is carried out in accordance with relevant SAF
                  regulations, and the records of the summary trial are sent to the
                  office of the Director, Legal Services of the SAF.</p>
              <p>(b) General Court Martial</p>
              <p>The General Court Martial exists as a separate forum from that
                  of the summary trial. Unlike the summary trial, the GCM can deal
                  with a wider range of offences, and can impose a wider range of
                  punishments including imprisonment and discharge, on top of
                  sentences like detention and fines. The GCM is also a more public
                  and open forum, and its proceedings are conducted using similar
                  legal rules and procedures as those used in a civil criminal
                  court.</p>
              <p>Generally, only serious offences investigated by the Military
                  Police Command, and which are referred to the office of the
                  Director of Legal Services, will result in the accused serviceman
                  being charged in a GCM. In such a case, a military prosecutor will
                  draw up a formal charge sheet and present it before the GCM.</p>
              <p>General Courts Martial can be further sub-divided into two
                  categories, namely the Panel Courts Martial - consisting of a
                  President and usually two other members, and Judge Courts Martial -
                  consisting of a single President only.</p>
              <p>Currently, the practice is for military offences to be heard by
                  Panel Courts Martial, while civil offences like misuse of drugs and
                  penal code offences may be dealt with by a Judge Court Martial.</p>
              <p><br> The current policy is also for an NSman, who is or was a District
                  Judge in the Subordinate Courts, to preside in a GCM. There are
                  currently 10 NSmen who have been appointed by the Armed Forces
                  Council to perform duty as President of a court martial. They are
                  rostered by the Registrar of the Subordinate Military Court to hear
                  cases during their in-camp training. In the case of a Panel Court
                  Martial, the other two members are rostered from among some 155
                  military officers appointed by the Chief of Defence Force.</p>
              <p> <br> 5. Ways to Seek Redress</p>
              <p>There are numerous safeguards and avenues set out in the
                  military justice system for an SAF serviceman to seek redress if he
                  is unhappy about the punishment imposed on him.</p>
              <p>Generally, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with an informal
                  punishment meted out to him may request a higher level commander to
                  review the punishment, or request for formal disciplinary
                  dealing.</p>
              <p>In the case of a summary trial, a serviceman brought before the
                  disciplinary officer may elect instead to be tried by a court
                  martial. Alternatively, an aggrieved serviceman may request that
                  his conviction or punishment imposed at the summary trial be
                  reviewed by MINDEF's Director Manpower (a delegated authority of
                  the Armed Forces Council).</p>
              <p>In the case of a GCM, a serviceman may choose to be represented
                  by a lawyer or an SAF defending officer if his case will be heard
                  by a court martial. The SAF has about 200 trained defending
                  officers. While an SAF defending officer comes free to the
                  serviceman, he has to bear the cost of engaging a lawyer. At the
                  end of the trial, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with the
                  decision of the court martial may petition the Reviewing Authority
                  (the AFC or a committee of its members) for a review of his case.
                  The serviceman can also appeal to the Military Court of Appeal
                  (MCA) for a reconsideration of his conviction, or his sentence, or
                  both.</p>
              <p>The MCA, when convened to hear an appeal, sits as a panel of
                  five members. Heading the MCA is a President, who is appointed by
                  the Chief Justice. By law, he must be a person qualified to be a
                  Judge of the Supreme Court. The current President of the MCA is
                  Justice Choo Han Teck. Four other members - two civilian members
                  who are qualified legal practitioners with at least five years
                  experience each, and two senior military officers - make up the
                  rest of the MCA. The MCA is the highest court in the military
                  justice system.</p>
              <p> <br> 6. Impartial Hearings<br> It is important to recognise that the GCM and the MCA are tribunals
                  headed by presidents who are outside the SAF chain of command.</p>
              <p>Being an "outsider", the president of these forums will hear the
                  case impartially like any other civil criminal case. The
                  proceedings in the GCM and the MCA are also heard in a public
                  forum, and these military courts adopt many of the same legal
                  procedures and safeguards as that used in the civil criminal
                  courts. All servicemen formally charged with an offence can bring
                  their case to these forums.</p>

                  oversees its daily operations, and supported by four units
                  specialising in the various specific operational responsibilities
                  of the SAF MPC.</p>

                  the Security Operation Unit (SOU) and the Special Security and
                  Protection (SSP) Branch. It is the active wing of the SAF MPC and
                  executes most of the operational and ceremonial duties and roles
                  carried out by the SAF MPC.</p>
              <p>The LECC was formed by combining the former Active Provost
                  Company (APC) and the former Zone Provost Company (ZPC). Its duties
                  include most of the important ceremonial duties required within the
                  SAF as previously handled by the APC, and a traffic platoon which
                  ensures the compliance of traffic regulations by military personnel
                  on the road as well as performing escort duties. It also performs
                  regular raids for contraband and/or miscreants on various camps of
                  the SAF as was conducted by the ZPC. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Enforcement

              <p><span>Feeling the need to check on your important office projects during
                           your In-Camp Training (ICT)? Fret not! To help NSmen better manage 
                          their work commitments when they are back for military training, 
                          business centres with wireless internet access have been set up at the 
                          Infantry Training Institute in Jurong Camp II, Armour Training Institute
                           in Sungei Gedong Camp and Army Logistics Training Institute in Kranji 
                          Camp III. NSmen will be allowed to bring their laptops, Personal Digital
                           Assistants and Blackberries into these business centres with prior 
                          registration before their ICT.<br><br>While these three business centres
                           are part of the pilot implementation to be conducted till June, NSmen 
                          can look forward to more being set up at the rest of the training 
                          institutes over a 18-month period from mid-2010 onwards. CPL (NS) 
                          Ravinder Paul Singh, an Armour Technician from 2nd General Service 
                          Maintenance Company has found this initiative highly beneficial to NSmen
                           like him. He shared, "As a Senior IT Engineer for Hewlett-Packard, it 
                          is extremely critical for me to access my e-mails all the time since I 
                          have a few teams to manage. Previously, without internet access in camp,
                           I could only work over the phone in my free time which can be quite 
                          tedious. With internet access now, I can clear my workload easily in 
                          camp and not worry about it. In a way, this also allows me to focus 
                          better on my trainings."<br><br>For LTA (NS) Adrian Ang, a Signal 
                          Officer from 1st Battalion, Army Maintenance Base, the business centre 
                          helps him to keep in touch with his family members and friends. He said,
                           "As I have family members and friends, I mainly use instant messaging 
                          programs like Skype and MSN Messenger to keep in touch with them. The 
                          internet at business centres will be very useful for helping me to stay 
                          connected even while I am in ICT."<br><br>While the business centres 
                          have brought convenience and value to the NSmen, they also realise that 
                          their training remains top priority. LTA (NS) Ang said, "After all, we 
                          are not here to surf the internet for two weeks. But nonetheless, as 
                          long as my men have fulfilled all their trainings and attained the 
                          expected standards, I feel that it will be a lot more fruitful for them 
                          to come to the business centre and follow up on their work."<br><br><strong>For more information on RECORD V and the other initiatives, log on to <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/record">www.mindef.gov.sg/record </a></strong></span></p>

              <div><span>Currently, NSmen on in-camp training (ICT) can access the Internet through the Internet access facilities at their camps.<br><br>To
                   help NSmen better balance their military training and work demands 
                  during ICT, business centres with wireless Internet access and basic 
                  facilities will be set up in selected camps. This is to enable NSmen to 
                  access their office network outside of training hours. NSmen will also 
                  be allowed to bring in and use their work devices, such as 
                  office-configured laptops, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and 
                  Blackberries, within these business centres.<br><br>The following basic 
                  facilities will be available in the enhanced business centres, namely 
                  photocopiers, facsimile, skype facilities (usage rate paid by users), as
                   well as wired and wireless internet access.<br><br>Security will not be
                   compromised as a result of the increased flexibility given to NSmen. To
                   ensure compliance with the security rules, NSmen must safe-keep their 
                  devices in the lockers provided and use them only within the compounds 
                  of the business centres. As an additional layer of security, closed 
                  circuit television (CCTV) will be installed in the business centres. All
                   devices with image-capturing capability such as camera handphones will 
                  continue to be prohibited in accordance with the current MINDEF Security
                   Policy. As some company laptops and Blackberries come with image 
                  capturing devices, these will be allowed for use only within the 
                  business centres. No laptops or phones with image capturing devices will
                   be allowed outside of the business centres.<br><br>A pilot 
                  implementation will be conducted in the last quarter of this year in the
                   Armour Training Institute (ATI) located in Sungei Gedong Camp, the 
                  Infantry Training Institute (ITI) located in Jurong Camp II, and the 
                  Army Logistics Training Institute (ALTI) located in Kranji Camp III 
                  where most NSmen would attend their ICTs. A review will be conducted by 
                  the middle of next year before this concept is implemented SAF-wide. 
                  More information will be made available to the NSmen closer to the pilot
                   implementation.</span></div>

              <p>Do you know your unit's commander/CO ? If you can get in touch and explain in person, you might be able to get off/leave for part of the reservist or some arrangement can be made...your CO/Commander can also grant deferment.</p>
              <p>Although this is NOT the norm and should not be the normal protocol - because otherwise your CO/Commander/S1 (also a NSman) will be crazily busy over everyone deferring. But in your case, if you can find them and explain, they should be reasonable enough to arrange something.</p>
              <p>Worst case...go on the first day to report (don't AWOL, not worth it). Then find your S1/CO and explain, apply off/leave/arrange something out...or if can't try ask them if can defer...</p>
              <p>Try to work out something and offer something in return la...that will be easier for them and everyone.</p>
              <p>Once again, don't AWOL la....if you're sincere and have a serious problem (not chao keng), this one time special occasion, your unit commanders should be able to help.</p>

              <p><span>From 1 Sep 2012, camera mobile phones will be permitted in
              designated areas within 14 Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) camps as
              part of a pilot security zoning programme.</span></p>
              <p>Selected for the high volume of Operationally-Ready National
              Servicemen (NSmen) and full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) who
              pass through for training or administration, these include camps
              that house fitness conditioning centres, training institutes, the
              Central Manpower Base and Basic Military Training Centre.</p>
              <p>Areas in camps where camera mobile phones are allowed are termed
              Green Zones, though the existing security stance on photography
              remains the same. Unless authorised by unit commanders for special
              events such as open houses, graduation parades and cohesion
              activities, photography is prohibited. Examples of Green Zones
              include medical centres, accommodation bunks and cookhouses.</p>
              <p>Within the Red Zones, which are areas where sensitive and
              classified information is present, camera mobile phones are not
              allowed. Before entering a Red Zone, camera mobile phones must be
              deposited in lockers. Examples of Red Zones include units'
              operation rooms and offices with computer access to classified
              information.</p>
              <p>The pilot programme was implemented for the convenience of
              servicemen, and because of the proliferation of smart phones,
              according to Chief of Staff-General Staff Brigadier-General Tung
              Yui Fai, who announced this initiative at the Infantry Training
              Institute (ITI) on 31 Aug.</p>
              <p>He added: "This security zoning allows us to better secure areas
              we think we need to protect better. At the same time, it allows
              flexibility and convenience for our servicemen who operate within
              the camp."</p>
              <p>Enhanced security measures will be in place at the Red Zones.
              Where practical, a perimeter fence will be erected to demarcate the
              Red from the Green Zones; clear signboards will be prominently
              displayed at the entrance of a Red Zone, and digital locks and
              close-circuit cameras will be installed for added security.</p>
              <p>Only camera mobile phones are allowed in this pilot programme,
              which will last for six to nine months before a review is
              conducted. Tablets such as iPads, laptops and digital cameras are
              still prohibited.</p>
              <p>For NSman 3rd Sergeant (3SG) (NS) Lavin Achudan, a
              marketing manager with Johnson &amp; Johnson who uses an iPhone 4S
              to access his work emails, being able to bring his camera phone
              into camp eases his workload. Previously, he would borrow his
              brother’s basic NOKIA phone when he had to go for his In-Camp
              Training.</p>
              <p>"As a marketing manager, I have to constantly reply to emails
              from my sales team and customers, and replying emails in the
              shortest time possible is my highest priority. Allowing me to bring
              my iPhone to camp allows me to communicate with my customers
              efficiently, and that is very important to me," said the platoon
              sergeant of 731st Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment.
               </p>
              <p>"When I am not training, I can reply to these emails
              immediately, as opposed to having to wait till I book out at night
              to reply to emails. It allows me to reply whenever I have time...
              It's about the convenience of being able to bring in a phone which
              I always use, which happens to have a camera," added the
              28-year-old.</p>
              <p>Echoing this sentiment is 20-year-old NSF 2nd Lieutenant
              (2LT) Kok Chun Hou, who is a curriculum coordinator at ITI. He
              uses a basic NOKIA phone in camp and an iPhone 3GS outside of
              camp.</p>
              <p>Citing some inconveniences of using two phones, such as having
              to input contacts into both phones, 2LT Kok said: "This current NSF
              generation grew up in the IT age; it's our habit to stay connected.
              We live, work and play differently from previous generations, so
              connectivity is very important to us."</p>
              <p>"I would also use my smart phone for personal banking and
              stock-investing. With the implementation of the pilot scheme, I now
              have the option of just stepping out of the office to use my smart
              phone," he said.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>==============================================================</strong></em></span></p>
              <p><span>For the convenience of our servicemen, the Singapore Armed
              Forces (SAF) will be implementing a pilot security zoning programme
              across 14 selected SAF camps. Under the pilot security zoning
              programme, these 14 camps will be segregated into two distinct
              zones: Red and Green Zone.</span></p>
              <p><span>From 1 Sep 2012, servicemen will be allowed to carry
              camera equipped mobile phones into the Green Zones of the 14
              selected SAF camps. For servicemen who need to enter the Red Zone,
              they must deposit their camera equipped mobile phones at designated
              lockers prior to entry.</span></p>
              <p>Photography in all SAF camp premises for both Red and Green
              Zones remain prohibited unless expressedly allowed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) will be implementing a
              pilot security zoning programme across 14 selected SAF camps on 1
              Sep 2012. These 14 selected SAF camps will be segregated into
              either Red or Green Zone. Servicemen will be allowed to carry
              camera equipped mobile phones in the Green Zones. Possession of
              camera equipped mobile phone is prohibited in Red Zones. Before
              entering a Red Zone, servicemen who possess a camera equipped
              mobile phone are required to deposit them at the provided
              lockers.<br> <br> <strong>Red Zones.</strong> Areas where sensitive and classified
              information and equipment are processed and managed. These areas
              may include server rooms, unit operation rooms, and offices with
              computer access to sensitive information. All other areas outside
              the Red Zone will be designated as Green Zones. Some examples of
              Green Zone areas are medical centres, accommodation bunks and
              cookhouses.<br> <br> Enhanced security measures will be implemented in the Red Zone.
              Wherever practical, a perimeter fence will be established to
              segregate the Red and Green Zones. Clear warning signboards will be
              prominently displayed at the entrance to inform servicemen that
              they are about to enter a Red Zone. Digital locks will also be
              installed to control access into the Red Zones. CCTVs with images
              wired to the unit operations room will also be installed at
              selected locations within the Red Zone.<br> <br> Photography in all SAF camp premises continues to be prohibited
              regardless of the zone.<br></span></p>
