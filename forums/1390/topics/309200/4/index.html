              <p>and the reason why they haven't caught him yet, is because they too slack to search.</p>
              <p>and the police dogs, too slack to sniff him out properly.</p>

              <p>If he escaped on his own, the likelihood that he is hiding in

              <p>If he has other JI accomplices who assisted his escape, most

              <p>But judging from a statement given by the petrol kiosk
                  attendant, most likely he escape on his own, because he was headed
                  to the cemetery.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If he had accomplices, they would have put him in a car and
                  drove off somewhere else to hide.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lots of drinkable water in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve.</p>

              <p>Most likely I would also dig a hole to camouflage and hide.</p>

              Arena,
              
              Actually, ISD's past is also linked with MINDEF when it belonged to the British. This dept was handed over from the british to our government and was subsequently maintained under the umbrella of MHA, just like MSD under MINDEF (not SAF). Probably why you can't find ISD in SPF website but they can be found in the MHA site.
              
              Interestingly, I was told (from the horses mouth)- not all ISD ppl has police background; their powers do not come from police powers; detention center and inmates not guarded by SPF at all.
              
              Nevertheless, I could be mistaken, but that's what I know from working with them all those years.
              
              Cheers
