              <p>Bukit batok nature park, forested xiao guilin area. I think he's not in the wild.</p>
              <p>He may be hiding at the corner of HDB block staircase or on HDB block roof top. No one goes there and he prob knows SPF and SAF are looking for him in forested areas.</p>

              <p><br>yeah man. maybe you are right. there's a possibility. but who knows? just days after our youth olympic victory, he escaped. very coincidental. but then again...we wouldn't really benefit if we let him go on that condition of not harming singapore right? even if we keep him or not, if ppl wanna attack us, they can still try. if we let him go, yeah maybe they will think we are nice and all and they will reciprocate. but wad are the chances of such ppl to reciprocate? they are doing this for their idealogy, something they strongly believe in so much so they dun mind hijacking a plane and crash it into changi airport. so there again...we don't know if it's possible or not. anyway, its been official that the JI cell in singapore has been crushed/crippled.</p>

              know they can depend on the public to spot him in build-up
              area.</p>
              <p>The problem is MS has quite a common face. I am sure in my life
              i've seen quite a few people who look like him.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you really think that right now he is on the 'run' without any aid or shelter...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have serious doubt on that. I think he must have reached some safe-house of some sort by now....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can't imagine someone on the run for so long... no proper shelter and food....</p>

              <p>I disagree. No doubt they have combed through the areas that he is most probably at, it doesn't mean he stays at one spot right?! I am sure he has been constantly moving.</p>
              <p>They started combing through Whitley and that was already 1-2 days after he first escaped, he probably ran to upper bukit timah then. When they combed upper bukit timah, he ran back down to macritchie area. As the police and SAF shift their locations to search, he is also constantly shifting.</p>
              <p>If he had any help with money, they wouldn't have found the clothes that he was wearing when he escaped which he discarded. he would have been safely taken away in a vehicle and would have changed out of his clothes in the house.</p>
