              <p><span id="intelliTXT"> MORE than 100 SAF soldiers
                  have joined the island-wide manhount for Singapore's most wanted man,
                  Mas Selamat Kastari, the leader of the Singapore Jemaah Islamiyah (JI)
                  network, who escaped from detention on Wednesday afternoon. </span></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT"><br> The SAF military police and guardsmen were brought in at about 6.30 am
                  on Thursday to beef up the huge security blockcade around the wooded
                  Malcolm Park, near the Singapore Chinese Girls' School and the
                  vicinity. <br> <br> They arrived in a convoy, which included a 5-tonner truck, several Land
                  rovers, and quickly took up positions along with the hundreds of
                  police, special operations and Gurkha forces that have been massing
                  overnight in the area near the Whitley Road Detention Centre, where the
                  JI militant fled at about 4.05 pm on Wednesday, sparking the biggest
                  island-wide manhunt. <br> <br> Residents leaving the areas near Goldhill Avenue, Barker Road and
                  Malcolm Park, had their cars scrutinised and even had to open their
                  boots on Thursday morning, causing a long traffic tailback along Dunean
                  Road. <br> <br> Students of SCGS, St Joseph Institution and Anglo Chinese School were
                  advised by their principals and teachers to stay calm and vigilant and
                  told of why they were surrounded by a strong police presence. <br> <br> But this was not reassuring enough for many parents who decided to pull their children out of school for the day. <br> <br> One mother, who would only give her name as Ms Tan, said she was taking
                  her primary school daughter home because she felt 'uneasy' and
                  preferred to have the girl at home. <br> <br> In SCGS alone, more than half a dozen parents were seen leaving with
                  their daughters when they were told of the manhunt for the runaway
                  terror leader. All the schools in the vicinity were carefully combed by
                  the police forces before the students turned up. <br> <br> The Ministry of Home Affairs issued a brief statement on Wednesday
                  night about the escaped leader. It said Mas Selamat walks with a limp,
                  and was not believed to be armed. <br> <br> The escaped terror leader, 47, took over as head of the JI network here
                  in 1999, and later plotted to crash a hijacked plane into Changi
                  Airport. <br> <br> Officers seen checking houses, vehicles <br> Late on Wednesday night, officers with flashlights were seen going
                  house to house along Malcolm Road, near St Joseph's Institution and
                  behind Catholic Junior College, questioning residents and checking the
                  leafy neighbourhood. <br> <br> Elsewhere, officers stopped vehicles at roadblocks<br> questioned residents, and showed pictures of Mas Selamat. <br> <br> The alert also went out to all border checkpoints, the Police Coast
                  Guard, and even taxi companies, which broadcast a message to cabbies
                  telling them to look out for the suspect. <br> <br> Scores of plainclothes police officers also swarmed convenience stores
                  and petrol stations, going through the leafy neighbourhood. <br> <br> The lockdown, from late afternoon through the night, gave the whole
                  area an almost surreal feel, with scores of police vehicles flashing
                  blue and white lights lined up along the roads. <br> <br> There were roadblocks at several areas, and grim-faced personnel, their
                  neon green work vests glowing in the glare of lights, checked car boots
                  and spoke urgently into walkie-talkies. The huge uniformed presence
                  signalled immediately to residents of the affected areas that something
                  big was going on. <br> <br> Some residents worried <br> Mrs Jasmine Lim, 42, whose car was checked as she entered Goldhill Estate where she lives, said some residents were worried. <br> <br> The mother of four said she called her two older children, aged 22 and
                  19, and told them to get home early. 'I have a security alarm that I
                  normally don't activate so early, but tonight I will,' she said. <br> <br> Senior accounts manager Terry Chia, 44, said police stopped him on his way home and showed him a picture of Mas Selamat. <br> <br> He did not think anything of it at the time, but said he began to worry when he learnt that the escapee was a JI detainee. <br> <br> The Indonesian-born JI leader escaped a dragnet that resulted in the
                  detention of 13 JI members here in December 2001. The group had been
                  planning to attack targets here. <br> <br> While in hiding, Mas Selamat plotted to hijack a plane and crash it
                  into Changi Airport. The plot was foiled. He was arrested in Indonesia
                  twice, before being handed over to Singapore in February 2006, and has
                  been detained under the Internal Security Act since March that year. </span></p>

              <p>in movies,</p>
              <ul>
              <li> the guards are big and burly, with expressionless faces like the Terminator, buldging muscles and 12 packs abs, super alert, armed and not afraid to shoot. They don't even need to sleep or go to the toilet!<br> </li>
              <li>they've got high powered search lights which will put the kallang spotlights to shame.<br> </li>
              <li>big ferel guard dogs the size of tigers, probably infected with rabies.<br> </li>
              <li>high tech biometric systems.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in singapore,</p>
              <ul>
              <li>the guards are either fat lazy old men forced out of their retirement, or little kids serving the nation as conscripts.</li>
              <li> they probably don't remember how to fire a gun, lest shoot someone, hell, for all you know, they are only given a baton for self defence.</li>
              <li> they don't have search lights, only torchlights and candles.</li>
              <li>they have cute overfed poodles and malteses prowling the centre</li>
              <li>and no money for biometric system, because the fund goes into building the ERP, so they use the old fashioned notebook and pen, which can be easily forged.<br></li>
