              <p>He has no money on him, how can he take a cab?!! you think police hasn't thought of that?</p>
              <p>Supposed he realises taking a cab is the best way out (rather than walking and hiding) and since he has no money, he takes a cab and runs off when he reaches the destination, the cabby would have alerted the cops to such a high profile incident after the police started looking for him. He should have avoided any behaviour that is high profile and grabs the attention of anyone, otherwise it would have been told to the authorities, which means so far his means have been covert.</p>
              <p>I find it difficult to believe he escaped from the detention centre without any help though. I am sure it's been all planned and he had help, whether it's from his own JI people or an insider job is anyone's guess.</p>

              something i don't understand.
              why is everyone blaming wong kan seng?
              to me, when he apologised, i actually saw no need.
              was he the one looking after ms when he ran away? no.
              yes, the security needs reviews. &amp; how do we know that? it's because this jackass ran away. 
              &amp; for what give cash reward. put one animation clip that guy bomb your family on tv. i think whole singapore will look for him.

              <p>If they think they can catch Mas Kastari just by trekking on
              those footpaths, then I think the government is dumber than I
              thought they were.</p>
              <p><strong>I think the government knows that. How are you so sure that the search teams are only walking on the tracks?<br></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He's definitely not going to stay on the footpaths waiting for
              police to come catch him.</p>
              <p><strong>As above. He is a well-trained fella with a myriad of skills.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He definitely won't be in public places.</p>
              <p><strong>DUH?</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After they do a sector to sector search, they should quarrantine
              the sector to prevent him from getting in.</p>
              <p><strong>Agree. Do you want to volunteer?</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think our SAF and police force are incompetent and a total
              disgrace.</p>
              <p><strong>Easy for you to say. Are you one of those soldiers or policemen who are spending countless hours searching and planning? Or are you probably one of those wankers who disturb our soldiers on duty? For you to make such sweeping statements here, when you probably don't even know jackshit about what's really going on, then you are the disgrace. <br></strong></p>
