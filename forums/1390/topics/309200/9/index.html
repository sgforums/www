              <p>i kinda predicted they will be discovered, but just wondering what actions they will take since Operationally it's supposed to be a "find MSK" mission. Not flush IMs out.</p>
              <p>But i guess the orders given to them is, "destroy targets of opportunity"</p>
              <p><br>So to those people growing Poppies and Marijuana in the wild thinking you can go back harvest them...  don't hope too much.</p>

              <p>i don't remember government ever giving any rewards for catching a criminal.</p>

              <p>Or $1,000,000 for winning an olympic gold.. even if you are chinese born.</p>

              think many people are quite disappointed with the country's defence

              <p>Is ISD under SPF or directly under MHA?</p>
              <p>I don't think it's fair to blame SAF for this. They did nothing wrong and I know many SAF soldiers who feel that they are bearing the brunt and suffering like this all because of MHA's momentary mistake.</p>
