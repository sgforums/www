            <div class='col-md body'>What do you think of the level of professionalism in the SAF?Are we there yet or do we have a long way to go?Below is my opinion of how superiors could inhibit the solving of a recruit's problems with his superior.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Sometimes, going through the chain of command is not very practical, if the person you are complaining about and your immediate superior are buddies.If your superior is not impartial enough, and your case is not heard and the situation worsens, what then is the recourse?Realistically, can a mere recruit ever know enough about the system to find himself some help?No.Even lao jiaos like us still have many queries about the SAF.<br><br>Impartialism and professionalism must form the priority of every man, spec and officer in the SAF if everyone is to b guaranteed fair and equal treatment.Treat others as you would like others to treat you.I really feel sorry for those NSFs who are bullied, abused by higher-ups and run into a brick wall when they go through the chain of command.If they take the brave step of writing a letter to their MP, they are co-opted and charged.What the hell is this?This is mere abuse and usage of a very loose definition of insubordination.If the complaints are heard and resolved promptly and fairly, these unfortunate events might have been avoided.<br><br>So, guys, please treat your men well, and keep an eye out for other troopers who are not under you as well.We are all soldiers and we wear the green, be it for 2 years or 20 years.But each is a human being with feelings, a life and emotional capabilities that differ amongst individuals.Surely it is not hard to be a real man and assist the ones in trouble and help the desperate?Let us all serve our time in peace and ensure we leave the army with a sane mind and healthy emotions</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Professionalism is the concept of doing things to the best of each man's ability and being impartial in the process.It's useless if you claim to follow some set of rules, say ISO 14001, but steps are only taken to alleviate pollution in camps when the audit draws near.Instead of doing things for the sake of doing, each soldier should understand the big picture and understand that each action has a reason.It's not out of defiance that people refuse to do certian things,it's more often than not due to a lack of knowledge and a sense of ownership in that activity.IF they see the big picture and come to realise that it's in their best interest to do so,a whole new ball game will begin.<br><br>Empower and enlighten your men, so that they will be more willing to understand and work from a standpoint they once thought impossible or unbelievable.A professional soldier does things for the good of others, giving his best in his vocation, yet not risking danger or following stupid orders.The culture must change for the latter to happen.Commanders must ensure that they play a part by not misusing or abusing their authority with regards to their guys, because in a military context, there is little legal recourse for a man to refuse a direct order, no matter how stupid or denigrating it may be.Commanders have the moral and professional obligation to do their jobs well and without prejudice to any individual trooper save for cases where they require the undivided attention and assistance of their superior.<br><br>(I was thinking of something on the lines of KM :Knowledge Management, anyone here has any experience on implementing KM in their units?Care to share?)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This post brings back memories. Back when I was still wet behind the ears as a puny corporal, I often had strong inclinations to challenge, question and improve the environment in which i held my stint. I too, was hot under the collar and believed that a fair competent and "professional"; organisation could materialise. I was ready to stand up my beliefs, coupled with notions of impartiality, to right blatant wrongs. Today, one can easily accuse me of being cynical or pessismistic.<br><br>Your definition of professionalism is one sided where applicable in a military context, although many moons back, I was ready to believe a more holistic package could exist in the SAF.<br><br>Firstly, we all know professionalism towards tangible goals are more than satisfactory to everyone as they are direct benchmarks of competency and egos. Ranks and salaries are intricately pegged to achieving such targets.<br><br>Now, the "conscience" of professionalism like you say, is what fails in the system and piques soldiers (ok, ex-soldiers) like me. Impartiality to me, is only a privilege granted to those lucky enough to receive it. The SAF is a large organistion with dozens and hundreds of tributaries. The hierachies further down the channels are still cumbersome. This disrupts the flow of information. Checking up on the integrity and conduct of every decision is near impossible. Even as a peacetime unit, time is scarce to hardworking (or pretending) commanders.<br><br>Cleansing the body of bad blood is near impossible too, as no staffing is permanent. Enlistees come and leave very often. Good values that were cultivated over the periods come and go like the seasons in this transit that we call National service.<br><br>1) Superiors getting exposed to likable and detestable behaviour over the long term.<br><br>2) Recruits in turn exposed to the cynicism and sadism.<br><br>3) They leave and new freshly shaved fodder take their transient positions.<br><br>Can there be a panacea for cancerous cells that strike without warning at any point of the body? And what more, for this continually changing landscape?<br><br>Professionalism in the army is only a distant ideal in reality. It is like a game of roulette deciding your win or loss. My advice is for recruits to enter and learn the rules of the jungle, apply them for survival, and to leave intact. Dispose all pre-concieved ideas of equity that we see in dramas or read during moral education classes and just play the game wisely.<br><br></div>

Start some more badge markers (like the Expert Infantrymen Badge in the US), to make promotion based on performance rather than time based, and to allow excellent individuals to go for promotion courses for example.<br><br>Maybe stick everybody to PTEs, and only promote the capable to LCP and above, offering 3SG/OCT and a regular sign on to those motivated individuals. I doubt that those who sign on during BMT, or before that, are able to make an informed decision on what a regular's life is about.  And if promotion is merit based, instead of time based, enlistees would undoubtedly treat the CB hole on their side with more pride. What's the diff btwn CPL and PTE anyway? Both do the same shit just diff pay!<br><br>To address the issue of professionalism, it is necessary to discuss the improvement morale of the enlistees. Enlisted men are the main body of the army, if you don't motivate them, why should they treat their uniform, or their service term with respect?</div>

I do think that these initiatives are good ones, because by reducing the service term, it's easier to motivate the troops to do better.<br><br>What we need more is some opportunities for enlisted men to distinguish themselves and excel. Start some more badge markers (like the Expert Infantrymen Badge in the US), to make promotion based on performance rather than time based, and to allow excellent individuals to go for promotion courses for example.<br><br>Maybe stick everybody to PTEs, and only promote the capable to LCP and above, offering 3SG/OCT and a regular sign on to those motivated individuals. I doubt that those who sign on during BMT, or before that, are able to make an informed decision on what a regular's life is about.  And if promotion is merit based, instead of time based, enlistees would undoubtedly treat the CB hole on their side with more pride. What's the diff btwn CPL and PTE anyway? Both do the same shit just diff pay!<br><br>To address the issue of professionalism, it is necessary to discuss the improvement morale of the enlistees. Enlisted men are the main body of the army, if you don't motivate them, why should they treat their uniform, or their service term with respect? </div></blockquote>Clap clap! well said. I like ur last paragraph. Jiang chu wo men ah bin ke de xing shen!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway i feel tat every unit should employ a personnel to listen to the problems face by the men esp NSF. Let say once a moth, this fella will come to the unit to hold an interview or QNA session with the men juz like BMT. In army, if u have problems, u raise up the problems to any army related ppl, u will have the tendency of kena tekan n revenge will be taken. Hence due to this lack of human right in SAF, this persoonel muz have the power to overcome those high ranking regulars in the unit.</div>
