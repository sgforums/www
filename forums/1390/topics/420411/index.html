              <p>My A level result not released yet but in case i didn't do well will they let me retake as a private candidate? The full duration of the exam is 14 cont days + 1 days on another week in november. </p>
              <p>I heard that they are more sympathetic towards those who did very badly, but lets say i didnt do badly but not good enough will they let me take the exam? I don't mind doing duties on weekends to accumulate days offs for the exam as well. ALso, since we have 14 days annual leave, can i use them?</p>
              <p>What kind of vocations is more likely to grant the permission? Since im the leadership batch im pondering whether i shd give up command sch completely if its too busy and get another vocation ( im quite sure i wont get infantry). POPing in April. </p>
              <p>Anyone with such exp? ANd thanks in advance :D</p>

              <p>It really depends on the unit. But then again, the scenario is usually take leave for stay out and free off for those who stayed in.. but have to return back to camp after their exams. <br><br></p>

              <p>Yes. There is a directive which permits you free off to take your A levels. But then its time off granted... so if your exams is like 2pm. They might release you at 1230pm... and if your paper ends at 330pm, they may request you to return back to camp at 500pm. <br><br>Thats y for stay out units, they usually ask you clear your off or leave. Save the trouble.</p>

              <p>yes, it can be done. but at the expense of your own leave and of course you have to accumulate your own duty offs.</p>
              <p>since some superiors aren't inclined to give so many free offs.</p>
              <p>but for your info,</p>
              <p>1) it's more costly to register as a private candidate as compared to school candidates.</p>
              <p>2) you have to retake the full sitting in order to submit the results for uni admission. it means GP + 4 other subjects.</p>
              <p>3) your SPAs can only be roll over for reuse for the next following year. so if you took your 1st attempt in 2010, you can only reuse your SPA in 2011. if you want to retake in 2012, you would have to sit for a practical paper, which under SEAB, requires you to be trained for this in a MOE registered private school. cost of preparatory courses are around $2k+ per science subjects.</p>
              <p>4) There is a new syllabus for some of the subjects starting in 2011, so if your paper you sat for in 2010 is not offered in 2011, you might have to relearn the syllabus, and to take practical papers if applicable.</p>
              <p>Please check the SEAB website for more details.</p>

              <p>it is  <strong>not a directive. </strong></p>
              <p>SAF only encourages nsf to go upgrade themselves, when their duties permit.</p>
              <p>that means that if your superior is F-up, and there's an exercise that you die-die have to go, you have to forgo your exams.</p>
              <p>usually warrant officers are friendler, but depends from case to case.</p>
              <p>and question is, will you have the time to revise and study? if you get into sispec or ocs, confirm no time for you to prepare for exams, since it is common for weekends to be burnt for fieldcamps, SOC etc.</p>
              <p>Everything in ns is a privilege, not a right.</p>
              <p>you have a right to 14 days of leave, but its a privilege to be able to choose when to take it.</p>
              <p>some units only allows block leaves, where they force you to take 1 week of leave to clear your leave quota.</p>
              <p>so, to sum it up:</p>
              <p>1) to retake, try not to get into command sch, else you don't have time to prepare.</p>
              <p>2) be nice to your superiors. give them a good impression, and dun give them excuses to f you up. you don't want to miss any papers.</p>
