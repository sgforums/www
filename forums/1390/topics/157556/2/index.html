I was practically wet throughout the 10 days. And believe me when i say its farking farking cold when you sleep in yur wet no.4 while its raining *shiver*.  Basha quite useless actually, it will leak if the rain gets heavy.<br><br>Some of my mates suay suay built basha on low ground, practically slept in a puddle. Drainage is important, esp if yur basha is located downslope.<br><br>Watch out for centipedes, esp at reclaimed land. A big one (about 15cm long) bit one of my platoon mates near the groin area while he was sleeping.  And another one was hiding in my buddy's helmet, lucky he saw it before putting it on.  And of course, there are the wild boars, cute fellas, until they start raiding your camp at night and scare the sh!t out of you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

Besides, by the time finishing digging set up, sentry duty, etc, too tired, just collapse and go to sleep, after securing all the stuff of course.<br><br>Oh interesting tip.  With all the cushioning in the helmet these days, did you know it makes a decent pillow?  No need to actually strap it down of course.  Also, one less thing for the instructors to steal if you are lying in it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bashas are pretty much useless when the rain hits the forest floor. If it doesn't flood, you will still get wet when water leaks through the weathered wax coating.<br><br>Even if it does not rain, the dew point around 4am is sure to keep your day-wear number 4 wet for you to put it on. I remember I literally slathered on plenty of the foot powder before wearing the uniform. Since it has a slight smell, it did make field camp smell less bad. Also, instructors couldn't really fault me, since it is a issued item.<br><br>Make full use of this chance to do your personal body maintainence, because once you get into your unit, you won't even bother to change out your clothes, even for a 5 day exercise (that's me.)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>change your UNDERWEAR and SOCKS <span style="text-decoration: underline;">every night</span>. don't care if you don't want to change your long 4s or whatever, but these areas are important so change to dry ones at night when they ask you to powder bath. remember to POWDER THEM too. well don't worry they'll ask you to powder yourself with prickly heat so its ok. but remember these two are important. (don't over powder ok cause i did it once and i almost died from 'freezing'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) trust me, foot rot and crotch rot is NOT nice..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>drink lots of water while on march.<br><br>during a company file formation, try not to get the laaaaast man (but no choice in this cause it's usually plt 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4 and in that their individual sections) cause you'd have to kneel while waiting for your turn and that sucks. i was the company's last platoon, last section, last bed.<br><br>at reclaimed land campsite(the one near SIT test site), you better make sure you put alot of insect repellent (put on your 4s not on skin cause it's been known to burn.) put at the collars, button areas, sleeves, SBO even. don't be like me, put on my cuffs (the wrist area of my 4s) then next morning forgot i put it there, wipe my whole face with it (cause that's what you do when you want to remove/apply camo) then the next thing i knew, my forehead and eyes were burning. nice. don't think other camp sites have that bad a case of the mozzies but reclaimed land's got SOF mozzies i tell you. they bite EVERYWHERE. from legs to hands to face to groin. so enjoy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>if you want to throw your rations to lighten your load, don't get caught. period.<br><br>load your SBO with biscuits from the accessory pack (your commanders will tell you to do this anyway) so that you can eat during lessons. i tell you you'll be shagged so people will tend to sleep, so to play it safe load the biscuits. Standard Biscuit Order / Full Biscuit Order.<br><br>your movements better be FAST. try not to give sloppy movement, else "whole lot knock it down!"<br><br>try to smuggle in a snickers bar. don't get caught. period. disposal is by black tape. (i did NOT say this ok.)<br><br>sprinkle prickly heat around your basha to minimise the possibility of a centipede coming in. during my camp, 2 of my friends kena on the same night. one had 2 bites, the other had one big one on the arm.<br><br>don't need to take out the black attachment and washer cause the commanders won't take that anymore. it's not a tactical 'advantage' or however you put it, you know what i mean? hell, if you take it out chances are that you are more likely to lose it. mags, dunno about the rest but i put mine in my side pockets. rifle, just sling around body and hug. if you're paranoid, unbutton your 4, put your rifle in between, button over.<br><br>go to beach road, get the glow-tapes. put small tapes on everything of yours that's loose. eg, helmet, bottles, powder bottle, rifle maybe, sbo, ET kit..etc.. this will help you find you stuff at night. well, it helped me.<br><br>if you want to make life easier, get an extra tent pin so it'll be easier for you to remove the pins which are already stuck in the ground. if you want to leave it outside, you can get one of those silent straws that are lying around and tie it to the extra pin.<br><br>just enjoy fieldcamp lah. remember this one won't be as bad as the ones you'll get in command school (or so they say). look at how fast time flies and soon you'll know it's over. the end of field camp (the trip back to coy line) isn't the end yet. you still have to clean your stores etc. it'll be damn hectic i tell you. have fun.<br><br>edit: omg didn't know i could ramble so much.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> carry on carry on..</div>
