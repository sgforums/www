              <p>Actually my guess is there are at least 70% of the regulars who signed on for the money, I happen to fall into the majority.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But as one progresses on with his/her job (haven't you forgot that females do sign-on too..?) , one might realize that his/her job gives a great sense of satisfaction, like how I feel after signing on. The complains about how army life is, about how you can't dye your hair, how you miss out on life if you have to be called back to camp at the very last minute, about how overly regimental army life is, these complains are still coming out of our mouths no doubt. But there are some of us who realize that deep in our heart, we truly appreciate our jobs, especially those who's army vocation are those who are already doing their operation role in protecting our country during peacetime, not those majority vocation who will only be useful in times of war (like infantry armour etc etc).</p>

              <p>Hi Silverng, I was a contract regular and I just ORDed in 2005. Well, 2 sides of the coin to everything. I did not regret because personally, I think serving in the force is different from working in the commercial sector. There are definitely takeaways throughout my stay in the force.</p>
              <p>If you are planning to sign on, please have a clear idea what you expect or what you hope to achieve, It can be as simple as an experience in life but the bottomline is, please do not regret your decision (sorry Ferguson but nothing personal) and take things with an open mind.</p>
              <p>Seriously I enjoyed my stay in the force despite the fact that there are bad times (which job doesn't) and I'm glad I made very very good friends in the force...</p>
              <p>I did not continut because I was offered a conversion of vocation which I rejected and I realised that it was time for me to do something different again after a few years. Actually, I'm considered active in my NS unit (Reservist) now because I am an appointment holder.</p>
              <p>If you will like more insights about the life of a regular, as well as life after leaving the regular force, I can help to answer some queries and doubts that you may have.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I signed on partially b'coz of the salary, but quite regret as most of my classmate they can earn better outside. Plus, now this job is no longer metal bowl job, u got to really perform or know lots of higher level personnel inside to make yourself move further up, if not, imagine after ur PP1 contract, 30+ age, who wanna employ u... most of my friend ORD, either they sell car, if not insurance or pasa malam. mostly be an agent. The most headache is the IPPT, my friend they work or perform very well kanna penalise due to unable pass IPPT, wat a pity for them.</p></div>
