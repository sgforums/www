              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I am currently pursuing a full-time PhD in NUS but MINDEF keeps calling me up for ICTs and such (I was a Bionix commander). So ok, for first 4 years of my PhD I did not complain and went for every training and never missed one. Then this year, my 5th and final year when I die-die must hand up my PhD thesis, they suay suay called me up for ICT. So I applied for deferment (with all proper documents) but of course they reject with the reason that PhD has no class timetable. I think those ppl in MINDEF dun even know what PhD is (they probably think PhD is like undergrad with lectures and tutorials).</p>
              <p>So I call up my battalion 2ic and the guy said same thing. PhD is not considered course-based by MINDEF so cannot defer (These ppl really dun know what is scientific research-based degree). So finally I got hold of my CO and he told me to see him in camp 1st day of ICT. So I did just that and he finally granted my deferment. At last I met an intelligent person in the army.</p>
              <p>So my question is why does MINDEF keep calling up postgrad students when it will disrupt our studies?</p>

              <p>Hey bapo, you got something against postgrads? My arm thicker than your thigh, #@ break ur ...</p>
              <p>OK serious now. Of course postgrads are not "white horses". I come from low income family and work like hell to get where I am. I applaud our government for creating a clean and relatively crime free environment and I think serving an average of 2 weeks per year ICT is not too much to ask. Furthermore I am quite a siao-on soldier, always get marksman, always get IPPT gold, always disciplined. However, we are citizens, not slaves. There should be a little give-and-take, a little incentive for serving NS. After being a good little soldier for 2.5yrs and plus not missing any ICT, if I request one deferment so that I can complete my higher studies, I think MINDEF should approve.</p>
              <p>Why are overseas postgrads not called up while I am? Just because I am geographically located within our borders? That is quite unfair. Do you mean people who study locally are not as worthy? I think this policy is detrimental to producing quality academics from local institutions. Oh yes, I am indeed grateful to the CO who understood my situation. Because of him, I managed to complete and submit my thesis on time.</p>

              <p>Hi Lokey, actually from my lab, 5 yrs is average. Many guys take 6 yrs. I know one guy who just graduated who took 7 yrs (He very nearly became a woodbridge case, imagine 4 yrs undergrad + 7 yrs PhD = 13 yrs in NUS! I 9 yrs already cuckoo!). Cuz my lab project all super hard plus supervising professor super hiam and super slow like tortoise. Ok lah, I like research plus can get good pay as a Prof in future. BTW I submitted and waiting for oral defense.</p>

              <p>Do people who work overseas get recalled to singapore for reservisit? Â you can request the govt to recall them to do that than.</p>

              <p>Hey bapo, you got something against postgrads? My arm thicker than your thigh, #@ break ur ...</p>
              <p>OK serious now. Of course postgrads are not "white horses". I come from low income family and work like hell to get where I am. I applaud our government for creating a clean and relatively crime free environment and I think serving an average of 2 weeks per year ICT is not too much to ask. Furthermore I am quite a siao-on soldier, always get marksman, always get IPPT gold, always disciplined. However, we are citizens, not slaves. There should be a little give-and-take, a little incentive for serving NS. After being a good little soldier for 2.5yrs and plus not missing any ICT, if I request one deferment so that I can complete my higher studies, I think MINDEF should approve.</p>
              <p>Why are overseas postgrads not called up while I am? Just because I am geographically located within our borders? That is quite unfair. Do you mean people who study locally are not as worthy? I think this policy is detrimental to producing quality academics from local institutions. Oh yes, I am indeed grateful to the CO who understood my situation. Because of him, I managed to complete and submit my thesis on time.</p>

              <p>The thing is this, if you are working and they call you up, they reimburse your salary. But I am paying my own school fees of SGD2400 a semester plus I am studying full-time and not taking in a salary. If they are willing to reimburse me, then it won't be so bad, but that is not the case. That's why I made the comparison to overseas students. Since students are not taking in salary, then shouldn't all full-time students be disrupted regardless of location?</p>

              <p>fierce "debate"..</p>
              <p>anyway.. IHL status are given to local Uni Undergrad only as the 3 specific Unis have made arrangements for their students to be called up for ICTs only during their Fixed vacation periods.</p>
              <p>research based PHD could be a problem as they do not have fixed lessons like Undergrad degrees.. same for attachment programs falling within ICTs duration..</p>
              <p>as for overseas students.. both undergrad n postgrad students are on distruption and most probably be living in that country unless there are summer/winter holidays. there is no point calling them back as their schedules would not be e same as local undergrad degrees. only when they have finished their degrees will they come back to "serve".</p>

              <p>Do you think a research based PHD will require just one year to repeat? Research activity is something very subjective and very often are not easily repeatable like modular forms of education.Â </p>

              <p>well the subject is not about dollars n cents and perharps when u are in a position to make policy than you might want to include NUS pHd candidate get ICT disruption during the entired programme.</p>
              <p>As for individuals studied overseas, Mindef accepted the exit permit for a duration of the study. That is a period of 3 - 4 years.Â There are enough time for unit to plan out their strength.</p>
              <p>Not to trivalizes NUS students butÂ I thinkÂ Mindef simplyÂ useÂ common sense that nobody would really want the person to fly back for 2 weeks. who know it might be their final exam week? Same story as yours.</p>
              <p>but of course in the exit permit it state that if there is a emergency recalled individual must returned. If SGÂ happen to fight with neighbouring country all overseasÂ NS men must eitherÂ at somepoint take a flight and para drop into Singapore or Swim to the shore.Â Pedra BlancaÂ would be theÂ nearest stop.</p>
