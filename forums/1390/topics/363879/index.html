              <p>Yes, it is possible for you to join the RSAF, but it depends on what you want to sign on as. These two links will show you an example in the differences in eyesight requirement for different vocations:</p>

              <p>Most people will tell you that it is not worth it to sign on. I will tell you that to each his own. One man's meat is another man's poison. However, if a lot of people tell you that it is not worth it, you might want to explore why the majority says so.</p>
              <p>I won't bluff you, I signed on that dotted line before but I got out due to a special reason. Still, you might want to get yourself a clearer look at the culture and organisation before you sign on the dotted line. That is because the organisation and culture is not what most people can tolerate. You need to have an, I will say unconventional, mindset to stay on.</p>
              <p>I won't discourage nor encourage you to sign on. It's your decision. Do keep in mind that it's the recruitment's job to sell you the good stuff and not tell you the bad stuff. After all, no sane salesman will tell what's wrong with his product. You need to be clear as to whether you want to stay till 50 or you might opt for a career switch at around 28 to 30?</p>
              <p>Now onto your questions proper:</p>
              <p><em>"Just wondering, as a poly student, what are the chances of
                                      getting into OCS?"</em></p>
              <p>It depends on your BMT performance. The chances of you getting into OCS as a regular is higher than that of an NSF.</p>
              <p><em>"And if I have secured a place in uni, and signed
                                      on. Do they pay for my school fees even though its a arts
                                      degree?"</em></p>
              <p>Yes, if you sign on as an officer, you will most likely be given Local Study Award which pays for your tuition fees + some allowances during the course of your study. You can't, however, opt to study for certain courses. <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/air_force/careers/scholarships_and_sponsorships/officers.html">Check here for the list.</a> Most arts degree will be okay for you. Also, since you mentioned arts degree, I guess engineering jobs are out for you.</p>
              <p><em>"And hows the pay structure like?"</em></p>
              <p>Ok this is supposed to be classified. However, since you asked, I shall use my example. That time I signed on as an A level graduate as a WSO in the RSAF (since you asked about the RSAF I assume you are interested in it). My starting monthly pay is $1970 including 15% CPF contribution as an officer cadet. That's the lowest starting pay among the officer pay structure. There are 3 pay schemes: Scheme A, B and C. Scheme A is for A level and Poly graduates. Of course, poly graduates get a bit more than A level graduates. Scheme B is for degree graduates. Scheme C is for the high flyers and they must be in Scheme B before they can qualify for Scheme C through a selection process. Also, some Scheme A people can crossover to Scheme B if they do not hold the necessary qualifications but they are very good in their performances. Of course, there are the scholars whose payscales are calculated differently but will it be fair for me to say that you are most likely not a 4.0 GPA and thus your chance of landing a Merit Scholarship is not that high? Sorry if I sound a bit offensive but I have got to present you the truth. Ok, as a guide, for a Scheme B CPT (aka degree qualification), it's around $3000+ starting.</p>
              <p>"Other than that, I'm wearing specs, both eyes less than 400. Any
                                      possibilities to join the airforce?"</p>
              <p>Now looking at <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/air_force/careers/opportunities.html">this link</a>, you can even be a pilot even though both your eyes have 500 deg each. Most importantly, in the RSAF, you can't be colour blind. That's because red and green are important colours in aviation and aircraft recognition. As such, you can be a pilot or a WSO PROVIDED you pass the medical, COMPASS test (a test of your ability to do what your vocation requires of you) and training. I will discount Air Engineering Officer because you mentioned that you are going for an arts degree in university.</p>
              <p>If you have any questions, you are always welcome to ask questions about RSAF in these threads: h<a href="/forums/1390/topics/324100?page=10">ttp://www.sgforums.com/forums/1390/topics/324100?page=10</a> or <a href="/forums/1390/topics/308047?page=17">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1390/topics/308047?page=17</a></p>
              <p>And oh, someone by the nick of Gloater/Gloaterback will probably reply here or PM you to warn against taking my advice because: " I am
                                      not one of your peers in school (NUS) with questionable IQ. I was warning
                                      the unsuspecting and innocent forummers about taking what you say
                                      wholesale and not with a pinch of salt. Your credibility is
                                      doubtful because you have the proven tendency to believe things you
                                      have no basis in believing. Such as the results of your internet
                                      adversaries, amongst other farmer assumptions."</p>
              <p>I believe I must include contrary opinions about me to make it more balanced. Your choice as to whether you want to take my advice as true or not.</p>
              <p>Remember, in the end, it's your life. You have one chance, live it and love it.</p>

                                          likely not a 4.0 GPA and thus your chance of landing a Merit
                                          Scholarship is not that high? </strong>Sorry if I sound a bit offensive but
                                          I have got to present you the truth. Ok, as a guide, for a Scheme B
                                          CPT (aka degree qualification), it's around $3000+ starting.</p>
              <p>"Other than that, I'm wearing specs, both eyes less than 400.
                                          Any possibilities to join the airforce?"</p>
              <p>Now looking at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/air_force/careers/opportunities.html">this link</a>, you can even be a pilot even though
                                          both your eyes have 500 deg each. Most importantly, in the RSAF,
                                          you can't be colour blind. That's because red and green are
                                          important colours in aviation and aircraft recognition. As such,
                                          you can be a pilot or a WSO PROVIDED you pass the medical, COMPASS
                                          test (a test of your ability to do what your vocation requires of
                                          you) and training. I will discount Air Engineering Officer because
                                          you mentioned that you are going for an arts degree in

                                          believe things you have no basis in believing. Such as the results

              <p>look at you giving advice when you know squat again. I am not interested in 'stalking' you and neither am i concerned with your farmer university delusions. Afterall, fools have the right to daydream. But you time and again spout false information in the guise of giving 'advice' to those who seek it, that leaves me with no choice.</p>
              <p>Pls look at what i quoted of you which I bold.</p>
              <p>You are so tragically wrong again, and why? Cos you are a farmer. That's why yours is a farmer's view.</p>
              <p>SMS the farmer scholarship has the same payscale as ATA and MTA. At its highest, it's only scheme C.  So you are wrong to claim that they have 'special payscale' or that they are 'scholars'.</p>
              <p>Next, he does not require a GPA of 4.0 to be offered the SMS. I know at least 3 poly graduates who were offered the SMS. Only 2 of them have a diploma with merit. You do not need 4.0 either to get a diploma with merit. If i'm not wrong just top 20% of the cohort, anyone poly grad or students here please correct me if i'm wrong. Unlike some people, I don't 'sound so sure' when it comes to matter that I have no actual experience in.</p>
              <p>SMS holders are not considered scholars in SAF, like three other people in a single thread here earlier who told you, SMS is a farmer scholarship, for A level holders, very bad results like 4A with no S papers also can get. In other words, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">anyone can get it</span>, like what 3 of us in the thread agreed earlier. Of course everything is relative. Perhaps to you, you don't see the joke we see, because in the loser law school you're about to enrol, one can get in with BBA and the average  there is AAB. Pathetic...</p>
              <p>SMS's pay is NOT calculated differently. By the sheer fact that they adhere to the same pay scales and their pay is calculated the same way as everyone else, is a clear indication that they are half fuck scholars in the SAF.</p>
              <p>How can SMS's pay be calculated differently and not just with Schemes A/B/C? SMS is an SAF product. Scheme A/B/C are SAF payscale. SMS, just like ATA and MTA adhere to this payscale like everyone else in the SAF. Get it?</p>
              <p>The ONLY reason SAFOS's pay is calculated differently, is because they are PSC scholars. Wake up.</p>
              <p>Please don't waste people's time by giving misguided and false information about scholars and their lives when you were never one. I even know of SMS people who fail to get scheme C.</p>

              <p>Pitot is correct. Fixed wings like f16 and fighter jets are considered 'fixed wing'. the wings are fixed and do not rotate. rotor like choppers will find themselves having a harder time switching to commercial piloting. In piloting both military and commercial, what happens is that the number of hours in which you fly are clocked. So a military pilot who goes to any airline to be a commercial pilot, will get a starting pay based on the number of hours he's clocked flying fixed wing as a military pilot. That is the reason why a military pilot who goes to a commercial airline does not start as a first officer or get some measly peanut pay of some moron starting out at an airline at the start.</p>
              <p>A rotor pilot does not get to clock his hours as fixed wing so all the hours he clocked up in his military career may translate to zero when he considers a career change.</p>
              <p>Among pilots in the RSAF, there exists different stratification of classes, you can see the stratification manifesting in pay differences and also the demand of each class.</p>
              <p>Fighter pilots are paid more and have higher prestige than transport pilots. This is one class difference. You can fly fixed wing and still end up as transport pilot, cos you dun have what it takes physically and mentally to be fighter.</p>
              <p>Fixed wings are paid more and have higher prestige than rotors like choppers. The demand to become fixed wing is also higher lah.</p>
              <p>Of cos with the purchase of the Apache, which is a rotor with fighting capabilities, things are thrown into a bit of disarray. The pilots who fly Apache are below fighter jet pilots but probably on par with transport fixed wing pilots.</p>
              <p>Of cos judging from this, you can see clearly the lowest rung is the helicopter transport pilot. And the highest class of pilot is the fighter fixed wing pilot. Of course the rung of prestige manifests in pay too. These things are all interconnected.</p>
