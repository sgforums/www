              <p>Well for one, I don't see y one who has an A level and is able to enter a reknowned uni but has interest in a military career unable to join the SAF as a career? Are you deeming our forces as 2nd best?</p>
              <p>Read again, I said A levels are useful in the advancement of academia as it gives a wide spectrum of undergrad degrees for one to study. Unlike a dip holder. And no, a level holders can get various jobs rather than those you've mentioned. Spend a good 90cents and get the Straits times. Flip to the Classfieds section and look. Why don't you try to dispense some actual credible advice? cos all u've been doing is talk with no evidence. Take the Apache bit for eg. y don't u post some proof that it's owned by the RSAF since u're so adament about it?</p>
              <p>Gloater is an elitist. Google the word, or get a friend to help you if you have trouble.His blatant views on non-scholars are evidence on that. Though his take on scholar schemes, rank advancement etc are correct. He misses out on the fact that the whole organisation runs as a whole. With out each component the SAF is nth. thus without the men, and the non-scholar officers, the whole organisation is ruined. one must not forget that the SAF is an armed forced. A degree from cambridge and mangement cert from havard may make you a LG in here in sg. But it might not matter as much in the defense of the nation, Practically,If you get my drift. No offense to anyone.</p>
              <p>SgCDO, <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/arc/careerprogression_officer.html">http://www.mindef.gov.sg/arc/careerprogression_officer.html</a> here is all you need to know about the technical aspects of an officer's career. Sorry but to be frank mate but with a GPA of that, i think you might only be able to qualify for the LSA. The general bulk of officers, otherwise deemed as farmers(though i detest that word) will only retire as majors. So you and your family (both current and future) have got to be prepared for that. But the positive bit is that if you complete the cdo training and Sign on as a CDO officer. Ur pay would be higher than say an infantry officer. Cos u'll have a higher combat allowance, airbourne jump allowance etc.</p>
              <p>Gloater, ST tech, Keppel and SIA eng are "govt linked" so I might not know as much. But it's definitely not the case in the private sector. Just like how  BGs/MGs/LG will never ever get positions as MDs and directors of a private company. hahahah=)</p>

              <p>You've confused a realist with an elitist.</p>
              <p>Second, I never said that an organisation doesn't run as a whole. In fact I have nothing but utnost respect for non-A level specialists and some officers. I just pointed out some people, not them lah, no need to name names.. some KKJ bus captains who go to the local U here from JC and think they're some high flier hold delusionals thoughts which is a joke. Just read this forum and you will know. i know what a joke it is. So I laugh. This syndome doesn't afflict the diploma officers and not the NCOs.</p>
              <p>Third, so you claim that leadership don't matter to the defence of the nation hahaha? Who's in charge of national defence? SAF. Go join the dots of what you said to me, and what i said to you. Yes, practically. As with any organisation and country, leadership sets the pulse and controls the outcome of the unit with their mandates. So yes, practically. Isn't that how civilisations and countries rose and fell at the hands of one lone person like Napoleon to a party like GuoMinDang? Did I ever say the leaders of any civilisation does NOT require his underlings to carry out his mandates? Sounds like you badly need to attend one of those management 'certs' you spoke about. =) speaking of those, it's got no value. Only losers who can't get into b-school of top schools end up with those certs, so they can claim they have HYPSM in their CVs (ie some farmers in GLCs and ministries i know). The high fliers dun bother with management certs (even the name sounds like fuck to me), they do an MBA in a top b-school mid-career</p>
              <p>Finally, GLCs are part of the private sector. I am in the private sector of my family business so I am well aware of that and i find it funny to have to explain it. Anything that declares profit and loss cannot not be private, regardless of who the people sitting on its board and where they came from historically. If you are in business, shouldn't you know that? To you, is SIA part of the civil service then? LOL Is that why DBS axed 900 people last year after the US financial meltdown? Ahhh no wonder. hahaha!</p>
              <p>Go find out who the CEO of the Ascendas subsidiary in India is. He left the SAF way before he became BG.  I do know plenty of other young scholars who leave the force for consultancy jobs. I know at least 3 who have offers from McKinsey before they return to service and during their service. 2 of them left the force as 31 yr old LTCs to try. Others become AOs. </p>
              <p>In any case, you can talk about 'real private sector' all you want. It doesn't change the fact that majority of foreign companies in SG are small ass fries, if you want to talk and compare, you will only look silly comparing the size and presence of the largest GLCs here from SIA, DBS, Singtel and even SPH to the local presence of foreign companies. From staff strength, assets, profits to remuneration. With the exception of very few names, so many of my friends like to crap about working for some German or British company. Their office takes up a few pathetic floors in a tower, and the local staff strength only in the measley hundreds. They get shit pay and 14 day annual leave, no bonus and no AWS because their profit and loss aren't done in SG. If you work for Google in SG, do you think you will get the same benefits as its staff in the US where its listed? Does Google feel obligation to share its profits there when it's announced there? If it doesn't share but its announced there listed there, what do you think happens to the morale? So do they care about the measley SG office with 30 little pussies eating crumbs oceans away? Companies are listed in their home countries. No point being part of a larger entity when the HQ isn't here, which means you get no share of the profits in the form of bonuses unless you're in the oil and banking industries.</p>
              <p>You wanna compare Keppel, SIA and SIngtel's profits per yr that is in the billions (not millions), with the output of the Singapore unit of a foreign company here? Or about their fixed assets right here like their buildings, containers and investments? Hahaha! Eat your heart out and don't get me started on bonuses.</p>

                                                                              truth that everyone in SG knows and NUS farmers have written about is
                                                                              that the SG economy and yes this means private sector =) is dominated
                                                                              by GLCs, which is why the state has initiatives to encourage
                                                                              entrepreneurship. Homegrown companies like Venture, SC Global, Wing Tai, HPL and CDL that made it big enough to compete globally remain elusive. The foreign companies make up a big % when you
                                                                              combine all of them. Each one seen individually, do you think they put
                                                                              their eggs here or their home country hahaha?</p>
              <p>Take a stroll and ask people who work in SG office of MNCs like Loreal, Ogilvy, some shit foreign PR, advertising, FMCG (google if you dunno. one eg is Nestle) and electronics firm, and ask them what kind of shit bonus and benefits they get. Their companies are not listed here. Of course they get squat. Why do you think staff of the most profitable homegrown listed companies here are
                                      known to take home up to 8 month bonus during good times? Please its no secret. Go and ask Keppel and ST employees how they laughed to the bank the past few yrs all things (personal performance component ) being equal. Except oil and banking sectors before the bust, go and ask what kind of 'bonus' local staff of foreign firms get hahaha.</p>
              <p><strong>Everyone takes care of their own kind. </strong>You will do well in life to remember that. :) Maybe one day when you finally step out to work and meet enough people and have enough 'peers' your age in various sectors, you will look back and remember this conversation hahaha!</p>

              <p>Never though I would demand such a long post from u gloater.Thought only the likes of T2000. hahah you're right some captains do confused themselves as scholars. I do not claim that leadership means nth. I'm just unsure of our military's take on leadership. It's too academia based. Good results do not equate to leadership.That is the point i'm drving at. Soley that=) Then again, u might argue that there are various checks in placed before each promotion but yet the bottom line is we as a whole are very academia based for the SAF. Actually not really, LG NG took a management cert from Havard if i'm not mistaken.</p>
              <p>And yes i know what GLCs are and i know SIA isn't in the civil service. But essentially they're all under temasek holdings or the GIC.</p>
              <p>U talk about soldiers who leave mid career, but i'm talking abt soldiers (most COL n abv) who are given a "2nd life"at these GLCs or such after their age limit 45 0r 47 is hit. Mis- communication there.</p>
              <p>I see no relavence in the last 2 paragraphs but an attempt to belittle my age or to nitty grit on the smaller MNCs and show me to the "real" world. Yes we know that the corporate world is a dog eat dog world. We know abt how google etc employees here don't get what their "peers" in the country of listing is getting.  To each to our own. Not everyone's blessed to have studied in a great school or landed a great job.  It appears you have life cut out for you. Kudos to u, for i'm guessing your effort paid off. Be humble and stop belittling the majority who landed jobs in "MNCs" , small private companies or are not receiving great amounts of performance bonuses.</p>
              <p>Chill man.Need every post from you be a mighty comeback?=)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw gloater if you are planning to cont a debate with me i'll be glad if u PM me. Not that i don't appreciate the public banter but i'm sure you would agree that it's in the TS, SGcdo and everyone's best interest not to take up space here.</p>

                                      gloater.Thought only the likes of T2000. hahah you're
                                      right some captains do confused themselves as scholars. I do not
                                      claim that leadership means nth. I'm just unsure of our military's
                                      take on leadership. It's too academia based. Good results do not
                                      equate to leadership.That is the point i'm drving at. Soley
                                      that=) Then again, u might argue that there are various checks
                                      in placed before each promotion but yet the bottom line is we as a
                                      whole are very academia based for the SAF. Actually not really, LG
                                      NG took a management cert from Havard if i'm not mistaken.</p>
              <p>And yes i know what GLCs are and i know SIA isn't in the civil

                                      GIC.</p>
              <p>U talk about soldiers who leave mid career, but i'm talking abt
                                      soldiers (most COL n abv) who are given a "2nd life"at these GLCs
                                      or such after their age limit 45 0r 47 is hit. Mis-

              <p>You will get LSA if you apply. Its given to anyone with A level or Dip who wants to sign on. Good luck. And how long have you known your gf? you sound very young. A lot of people think their GF when they are 20 is who they will end up marrying but they always end up marrying a different girl later. that is life.</p>

              <p>If the selection requires someone with everything -  outstanding results, leadership, fitness, character, and most importantly the 'suitable' personality for what is needed, then yes, if you are not in the circuit of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span> of the above parameters, you will not see the selection done. This is simple logic. If I require a maid living in puerto rico, with good character, great fitness so she can mop my floors impeccably, and strong leadership skills so I can promote her to become the head of all maids, then you not living in puerto rico will not get to see the selection process of my maid. It does not mean my maid only has one criterion. There are maids with everything. You havent seen them cos you've no exposure to the finalists of my maid position because of the situation I explained to you.I did not see your invitation to PM. Sorry. Hope you can understand now.</p>

              <p>The only possibility left is that (hope you understand analogies),
                  you have a daughter whom you badly wish could become my maid LOL, but she
                  lacks any one of the criteria I ask for. This is life and you can't
                  always win. Or do you expect the world to revolve around you? Why so bitter and upset that your daughter cannot be my
                  maid? She can't do something else? LOL This is a free market. There is
                  supply and then demand. If thats what I need and want in my maid, you
                  haven't earned the right to tell me I'm wrong in my demands of my maid.</p>
              <p>I'm
                  not a soldier, but one thing i've known is that the
                  people who whine about something, only do so cos they can't make it in
                  that. If I didn't have money, I'll try to discredit wealth. Won't i? haha yes I would.</p>

                      is all you need to know about the technical aspects of an officer's
                      career. Sorry but to be frank mate but with a GPA of that, i think
                      you might only be able to qualify for the LSA. The general bulk of
                      officers, otherwise deemed as farmers(though i detest that word)
                      will only retire as majors. So you and your family (both current
                      and future) have got to be prepared for that. But the positive bit
                      is that if you complete the cdo training and Sign on as a CDO
                      officer. Ur pay would be higher than say an infantry officer. Cos
                      u'll have a higher combat allowance, airbourne jump allowance
                      etc.</p>

              <p>Majority of farmer officers retire at MAJ but there have been rare instance of CDO officers who become COL and BG. CDO does have a higher premium than others. But by the time they go beyond Bn level they have to switch out of CDO. CDO remains the elite formation in the army and still have the cut above the rest of the formation factor. The other 3 combat arms come next (no, guards are not underpaid CDO, they are not even close, they're just INF who do rapelling once in their lives), and finally it's the combat support arms - signals, arty, combat engineer.</p>

              <p>The military is not a democracy, and if you cannot follow simple internet decorum of not typing in caps as outlined by generations of users since the first days of ARPANet, then you're just going to invite much more flaming.</p>
              <p>It's simple, type as everyone else, because it is polite to do so. Secondly, if you "yell" in CAPS, no one will give two hoots about what you are saying, do you recognise that fact?</p>
              <p>To Jus-tea, Gloater, please keep this thread on topic, anything else, you can PM each other.</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>Time off to study is dependent on your unit commander's approval and that is as good as zilch.</p>
              <p>If you get LSA, you will be paid $9000 annual allowance in addition to your tuition fees being covered. You will not be paid regular salary during the course of your study though.</p>
              <p>Oh btw, you don't get stuck as LTA for 4 to 5 years as an LSA. You will get your CPT within 6 months after returning from your studies. I believe Gloater is well-versed with that.</p>
              <p>As for Terminator, I think his Caps Lock button is stuck. Time to junk that keyboard eh?</p>
