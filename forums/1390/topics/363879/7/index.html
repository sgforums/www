              <p>No need. I have asked around. The reason i didn't know of this
              is because they didn't kena it. It wasn't until 2006 that it was
              introduced and scholars in all 3 services - army, navy and airforce
              - are victims. Its supposed to be about 5 mths, SAF make the
              scholars go to OCS as 'officer-on-course', upon their return from
              US army, so that they can get reacquainted with the sg army system.
              Apparently its felt that US Army though tougher and more
              professional, may not get one reacquainted enough with the BS
              prevalent in SAF, thus the reacquaintance is necessary to do the
              trick.<br> <br> And FYI LSA farmers do not do this pro tem thing, because only
              officers who disrupt from OCS do it. It's ONLY for disruptees. LSA
              do NOT get to disrupt from OCS. Disrupt what shit. LSA farmers
              enlist after JC at 19, they serve out their full 9 mths of OCS,
              even after they get their farmer awards, they cannot leave the army
              until the middle of second year of NS, isn't that when your term
              starts?  When they graduate, they'd be 24.<br> <br> The pro term whatever the fuck, has nothing to do with
              promotion.<br> <br> Promotion to CPT remains at 6 mths (shortened down from 1 yr) upon
              graduation for all graduate officers. OCS disruptees and non OCS
              disruptees, scholars or farmers alike, will get the promotion 6
              mths from graduation, doesn't matter where they are. This is only
              for those who sign on before they study.</p>
              <p>After SAFOS get reacquainted with the BS of the SAF system, they
              do their PC tour. Note that all tours are timed towards doing ATEC,
              any farmer who start their PC tour earlier, will also finish it at
              the same time as scholars. It just means those who start later do a
              shorter one. This is common sense, if you serve as a man in NS
              you'll also know. 2 OS of the same age, one starts his OC tour
              earlier, the other starts 1 yr later, both have to finish up that
              tour &amp; do ATEC together. So the one who started later just
              means he do a 1-yr OC tour. The OS who starts earlier do a 2 yr OC
              tour.</p>
              <p>For those losers who finish studying on their own and realise
              can't find a job with proper salary with their lousy degrees (a lot
              of them) and then sign on, this doesn't apply to them. Sorry. Have
              to go through 9 mths of OCS first, they will backpay them their
              local school fees. After 9 mths of OCS then wait 6 mths.</p>

              <p>How is that state secret? Didn't SAF openly tell them to go to OCS as officer-on-course? Didn't SAF openly require those who signed on after they have done their own degree, to go do OCS? you mean its classified ah? It's as classified as your ass i guess.</p>
              <p>Of cos official statement is getting reacquainted with local system lah. You take me too literally, everything I say when I garnish my own opinion you also think its some state secret. The getting acquainted with BS is my own comment cos I do think and recognise there is BS there, but which organisation doesn't?? Your farmer U and your future employers also have BS, if not much more than SAF. and I am not well connected. I juz have friends, unlike you. And to jog your memory, it was you who talked about pro-term, not me.</p>
              <p>And dun talk about not saying anything I said, as if you'd have known anything having not gone anywhere in uniform beyond passing out from Air wing. I doubt you even knew about the US army officer course for returning scholars. In any case its no secret, it's rather openly boasted that we have strong defence ties with the United States (besides procurement of weaponry), and our soldiers can choose to do the Ranger course in Singapore or with the US army. A lot of enciks proudly boast about this in camp and online.</p>
              <p>To conclude, I fail to see how anything that is 1) published information, pls refer to at least 2 websites I offered that spoke of safos's US army training 2) openly declared to the people involved - going to OCS as officer-on-course - can be imagined as 'sensitive' information. your logical faculties are thrown into serious question, which I guess can be explained by how in spite of which, you can have a place in the 'premier' law school here.</p>

              <p>2) SIA</p>
              <p>For SAF.. we need to go for the pilot interview before our BMT.. so which means.. we must already decide whether do we want to sign on as a regular.</p>
              <p>What about for SIA? is there any requirements? Do SAF pilots have more chance of getting into SIA ?</p>
              <p>For what i know is.. SIA offers a better job scope then SAF but how do we get to SIA eventually as a pilot or co-pilot ?</p>

              <p>CDO officer are ones who spend time in my camp meeting]. CDO regulars spec just sleep in the bunk waiting for command and things to do. CDO officer do most of the paperwork. If you are not doing paperwork then you are not in the command chain then no use.</p>
              <p>You now know what is the command HQ. People who talk about which people go where. something like command and conquer. but playing with real humans.</p>
              <p>CDO normally does internal promotion from BMT to medic, spec to officer, very different from our normal system.  </p>

              <p>When ask my friend (SAF scholar) why dont  you vote

              <p>Sign on is really okay. Depends on individual. Some people like
                                                  army life some dont. FYI, sign on Degree holder usually do
                                                  paperwork, 80% admin, busy writing, changing directive, replying
                                                  email. Only the footman get to run around. Usually smart ones would
                                                  ended in the office. Army vocation is really a job.</p>

              <p>There has been at least 2 scholars who wanted to and chose to go CDO. But there are not many of them. The second one is 10 years younger than the first one.</p>
              <p>What are you talking about? Intelligence is a place for farmers. Its even nicknamed Farmer's Paradise. Few scholars want to go there. SAF career is about command, and as a full time intel officer, you do not really have real command experience. How many people does an intel CO command in a typical intel unit, say the air photo unit compared to an armour or infantry? We all know, since its sensitive no need to spell it out here. When I say intel, I mean the people who are in the Intel officer track, and not just an officer posted to army intel or someone doing an S2 staff tour.</p>
              <p>Since SAF started the Intel Officer scheme since the early turn of 2000, they only managed to attract two scholars. Only attracted two in nine years is pathetic. Scholar sign on with their sights to make service chief, sign on as Intel officer cannot make service chief, out of the question. Estab of MIO chief is 2 star thats why so far all of them are 1 star who took it on.</p>
              <p>The intel track is for farmers who can't chiong sua but want combat officer pay. Its also particularly appealing to farmers because otherwise they'd never be given the chance to do any form of "brainy" work in the SAF and it helps that scholars avoid taking up this IO scheme so all the farmers can chiong there and sign on as AO and feel like they're kings there.</p>
              <p>Lets just say it's A LOT like signing as logistics or engineering officer. All the commonalities are there. No need to chiong sua, good for people with poor leadership and poor command on the field but still gian for uniformed pay, good for farmers cos no scholar sign on as logistics and engineering, and rarely any as intel, all the scholars so far (except two) sign on as combat and combat support (arty) officers only.</p>
              <p>Your admin, paper work, dunno what 80% thing is also wrong. In command appointments for junior officers like PC/OC, the chiong sua or any outdoor component (even the PT) in total aggregate at least 50% if not more than paper work component of managing a coy. It's obvious you're neither a degree holder, an officer or know any real scholar.</p>

              <p>I also found out there are actually fools who thought that there are no OS IOs or that the IO scheme is non-uniformed or is some DXO scheme or they are not 'military personnel' or don't have military ranks.</p>

              <p>1) What era was this? He should only get his 3rd bar one year after he comes back, and not immediately.</p>
              <p>2) 3 Bar is considered very junior. Do you mean to you, 3 bar is very senior?!</p>
              <p>3) All scholars have to do their PC/OC tours. What are you talking about? You mean in your world they don't have to? Gee. In fact, since they fly off at 19 and return after they're done studying before they start their career and first tour (PC), your example of CPT (rank wise) in an attempt to claim that
                          your friend or the like of him is not junior (and they magically don't
                          seem to need to do PC/OC tour) is an<strong> epic failure</strong>..scholars are possibly the only people you see around who do their PC tours as CPTs</p>
              <p>4) When scholars do their PC and OC tours, they ARE 3 Bar. In fact, they are the only people whom you can find who are CPT PCs around. Because they study first before doing PC tour.  I am very sure you have not served your NS.</p>
              <p>5) Not all officers who go overseas on sponsorships are scholars. Some ATA (SAS) go overseas - Australia, UK, US whatever and are award holders. SMS holders are barely regarded as scholars, the parade commander of this year NDP, a SMS is some 40 yr old half colonel who progresses at farmer speed.</p>
              <p>I'm glad that you "cannot stop laughing", you seem to know you're a joke. And you need to improve your English.</p>
