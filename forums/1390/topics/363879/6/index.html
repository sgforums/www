              <p>Do ur BMT, then post to unit, experience ur unit life. If you
                      can accept that kind of life than go ahead, I am saying be it u are
                      so called "born to be soldier", "I love Sg", "interest" or "want
                      money only" type.</p>
              <p>Be it watever type of person you are, life inside SAF can be
                      fustrating because most things that you are going to experience has
                      nothing to do with actual soldiering and common sense just
                      sometimes thrown out of the window, you can be doing something that
                      you know is down right stupid and ridiculous (and sometimes morally
                      wrong) BUT you have NO CHOICE but to do it. Regardless you like it
                      or not.</p>
              <p>Be wise, experience first, sign on liao is for next 10 years, if
                      u find it sucks, still ok, 2 years nia. Just dun sign on liao then
                      u find it sucks, u lan lan LPPL inside and wait long long.</p>

              <p>10 yrs meh? First there is 3-yr contract for short term, offered to those SAF do not see the potential to make it even for SAVER standard. Second, even if you sign on to SAVER, the minimum term of engagement is not 10 yrs.</p>
              <p>SAVER means you got a contract up to 45 yrs old, however, you can leave anytime you wish once your minimum term of engagement is up. Thats why people can leave and do leave the SAF anytime they wish, no need to wait till 45. The minimum term of engagement for LSA is 4 yrs, MTA and SMS is 6 yrs. Those without SMS/MTA and LSA can't be longer than 4 yrs when SAF didn't even pay for studies.</p>
              <p>Accuracy of facts aside, i do agree with the general message that you should be clear of <strong>why</strong> you want to sign on, and also experience soldiering life first. When you have, i advise you to sign on only because you have genuine interest in the job and not cos you want to 'marry your gf'. Even if its for 1 or 2 yrs, or longer, whatever, it's only fair to yourself and the organisation. Don't make use of people, especially if lets say they believe in you. Don't waste your time or the organisation's. Even if you say its only 1 or 2 yrs, isn't time money? Live life with a purpose.</p>
              <p>Since you are posted to CDO, you may find yourself really taking to CDO life, which is a bit unique from the other formations. They're very close knit, very tight group, and they believe in their CDO pride. It may really be your thing. Or it may not. who knows?</p>

              <p>I was reading what you said. Its interesting. FYI, I know for a fact that those losers who sign on for LSA after they finish their degrees on their own in the bumpkins' unis, have to sit through 9 mths of OCS if they didn't go OCS in their NS days, after passing out OCS they still wait additional 1 yr (and now shortened to 6 months) before they get their CPT. I'm very sure cos i met many of these post degree losers who sign on after they realised can't get a good salary with their lousy degrees.So now shortened to 6 mth this is good news for them esp. Maybe SAF changed the policy for them, cos otherwise they may feel they waited till 50 yrs old before they get it.</p>
              <p>Anyway CPT is nothing, is like a bone they throw out. the fact that CPT is by default says it all. The proof in the pudding is in the MAJ and beyond.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>As for your 'conjecture' of the route of SAFOS, this is what happens. Let me demystify you. They disrupt after Delta Coy in OCS at 19, go overseas, graduate after 4 years.</p>
              <p>They return to service (23 yr old and their bond begins to count down from here) and are sent immediately to the US Army for 6 months of training in a basic officer's course..

              <p>Except 1 or 2 yrs I know, they traditionally have been known to top that US army course, beating all the Americans. It's well known, but you just need to be in the circuit to know. next time you see a SAFOS (not junior one back for school holiday attachment, ask one who graduated from university and returned from US army), just ask him. He'll tell you.</p>

              <p>I read that there are people in the army with Arts degree.</p>
              <p>If I managed to secure a spot in one of the local university. In the following cases, how would it affect my chances of getting into OCS and then into a combat role?</p>
              <p>1) Sign-On immediately after graduation</p>
              <p>2) Sign-On after BMT, possible to defer OCS training and finish uni first?</p>
              <p>I read about LSA and SMS, seems like SMS is a better sponsorship and that you can go into overseas uni?</p>
              <p>If I get offered a SMS but decided to opt for a overseas uni, can I defer NS after BMT?</p>
              <p>And what are my chances of getting into RSAF? My results are good enough to barely get into business degree and getting into arts should be no problem. CCA records are only okay, but I have alot of student leadership experience.</p>

              <p>The last I know it was one year after graduation for all degree
              holders. Although i won't rule out that they shortened it to 6
              months so you may be right. Btw do you mind 'sharing' the link of
              this 'directive'? I'm not distrusting u. I said already I find it
              probable that its been shortened to 6 mths cos CPT is just a token,
              doesn't mean anything. Just wanna see it for interest.</p>
              <p>All degree holders signed on to SAF before they do their degree
              get their CPT 6mths (if you believe the farmer's info that its been
              changed) or 1 year (if nothing's changed) from the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">time of graduation</span>.</p>
              <p>You're assuming that all LSA people get their farmer awards
              during NSF days after A levels. Of cos we know this to be patently
              untrue, considering that LSA is given out to all ages and all year
              round in a lelong manner. I personally know more than 10 LSA who
              got theirs after they finished their studies in the bumpkins'
              universities, then they apply to sign on. 7 of them didn't even
              make it to OCS during their NS days. so much for 'quality' *rolls
              eyes</p>
              <p>LSA, ATA, SMS can be applied anytime and also a lot of the
              applicants and holders are not 19 yr old when they apply. in fact
              ATA is only given to those with considerable NSF experience. Not
              sure about MTA but I do think MTA are better and truer soldiers
              than these kucing kuraps, MTA at least went to the best military
              schools like Westpoint.</p>
              <p>As we know from this thread,
              http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/showthread.php?t=2298642&amp;page=12
              lots of local bumpkins in the farmer schools telling their
              classmates and girls that they're "high flying scholars" and then
              kena laugh at in hardwarezone. Just see the fucking comments from
              the hwz forummers about it and u can't resist laughing even if u're
              who they're laughing about.</p>
              <p>I was reading what you said. Its interesting. FYI, I know for a
              fact that those losers who sign on for LSA after they finish their
              degrees on their own in the bumpkins' unis, have to sit through 9
              mths of OCS if they didn't go OCS in their NS days, after passing
              out OCS they still wait additional 1 yr (and now shortened to 6
              months) before they get their CPT. I'm very sure cos i met many of
              these post degree losers who sign on after they realised can't get
              a good salary with their lousy degrees.So now shortened to 6 mth
              this is good news for them esp. Maybe SAF changed the policy for
              them, cos otherwise they may feel they waited till 50 yrs old
              before they get it.</p>
              <p>Anyway CPT is nothing, is like a bone they throw out. the fact
              that CPT is by default says it all. The proof in the pudding is in
              the MAJ and beyond.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>As for your 'conjecture' of the route of SAFOS, this is what
              happens. Let me demystify you. They disrupt after Delta Coy in OCS
              at 19, go overseas, graduate after 4 years.</p>
              <p>They return to service (23 yr old and their bond begins to count
              down from here) and are sent immediately to the US Army for 6
              months of training in a basic officer's course.. These 6 months
              with the US Army is meant to 'replace' the time they 'lost' in OCS
              when they disrupted they go to fort benning the most common one, or
              fort knox, etc. I'm quite sure no one else in this place knows
              this.</p>
              <p>Except 1 or 2 yrs I know, they traditionally have been known to
              top that US army course, beating all the Americans. It's well
              known, but you just need to be in the circuit to know. next time
              you see a SAFOS (not junior one back for vacation training, ask one
              who graduated from university and returned from US army), just ask
              him. He'll tell you.</p>

              <p>After that they come back and start their tours. Is 'this' what

              <p>Wait I shall go find the link.</p>
              <p>In any case, maybe you are citing army but for RSAF, the SAFOS
                                                                  do come back for their pro term training that they missed.</p>

              <p>No need. I have asked around. The reason i didn't know of this is because they didn't kena it. It wasn't until 2006 that it was introduced and scholars in all 3 services - army, navy and airforce - are victims. Its supposed to be about 5 mths, SAF make the scholars go to OCS as 'officer-on-course', upon their return from US army, so that they can get reacquainted with the sg army system. Apparently its felt that US Army though tougher and more professional, may not get one reacquainted enough with the BS prevalent in SAF, thus the reacquaintance is necessary to do the trick.<br><br>And FYI LSA farmers do not do this pro tem thing, because only officers who disrupt from OCS do it. It's ONLY for disruptees. LSA do NOT get to disrupt from OCS. Disrupt what shit. LSA farmers enlist after JC at 19, they serve out their full 9 mths of OCS, even after they get their farmer awards, they cannot leave the army until the middle of second year of NS, isn't that when your term starts?  When they graduate, they'd be 24. <br><br>The pro term whatever the fuck, has nothing to do with promotion. <br><br>Promotion to CPT remains at 6 mths (shortened down from 1 yr) upon graduation for all graduate officers. OCS disruptees and non OCS disruptees, scholars or farmers alike, will get the promotion 6 mths from graduation, doesn't matter where they are. This is only for those who sign on before they study.</p>
              <p>After SAFOS get reacquainted with the BS of the SAF system, they do their PC tour. Note that all tours are timed towards doing ATEC, any farmer who start their PC tour earlier, will also finish it at the same time as scholars. It just means those who start later do a shorter one. This is common sense, if you serve as a man in NS you'll also know. 2 OS of the same age, one starts his OC tour earlier, the other starts 1 yr later, both have to finish up that tour &amp; do ATEC together. So the one who started later just means he do a 1-yr OC tour. The OS who starts earlier do a 2 yr OC tour.</p>
              <p>For those losers who finish studying on their own and realise can't find a job with proper salary with their lousy degrees (a lot of them) and then sign on, this doesn't apply to them. Sorry. Have to go through 9 mths of OCS first, they will backpay them their local school fees. After 9 mths of OCS then wait 6 mths.</p>

              <p>Engineering grads in SG do not earn much, they don't start off at 3k, can dream and tan ku ku, in fact sg is where engineers are paid one of the worst salaries in the world. in developed countries like the US, engineers are very well paid and respected, not here. LOL. dun believe, ask HR companies lor. Can get $2.5 in these tough times can steal laughter already. if not during 'good times', its about $2.7k only.</p>
              <p>of cos I am talking about private sector, since someone here claimed that bangla construction workers and civil engineers can earn 3k. the only people who get above $3.5k for engineering right after graduation is sign on as engineering officer, unfortunately.</p>

              <p>And what are my chances of getting into RSAF? My results are
                      good enough to barely get into business degree and getting into

              <p>I'd advise you to apply for SMS. LSA is really no hope..you will not get a chance to be CO or rather you have a 0.01% chance. I think too tall also not very good for pilot. You can ask texerax to confirm this.</p>
