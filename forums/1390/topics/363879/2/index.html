              <p>What a load of Hogwash.</p>
              <p>1. You need to calm down.</p>
              <p>2. "A GPA 4 OR BETTER=CERT OF MERIT DIPLOMA." For Sg diplomas, there is no such thing as "or better". Polys in sg max out at gpa 4. Students with a GPA lower than that of 4 would also be able to attain a Diploma with merit if they fall within the top percentile. Both qualifications have their own merits. For eg, if you were to join the workforce, a dip would be better as you would have more exp and command a higher pay. But an A level gives you a wider variety in areas of academia (provided you don't screw it up).</p>
              <p>3.Even though Gloater/gloaterback's opinions might reek of elitism. He does put to light certain aspects of the SAF the some might not know. Though i must admit his biasness and insensitiveness are uncalled for.</p>
              <p>4. Fudgester is right. Do serve bmt first. after all, there's no rush. They aren't gonna deny you the chance of Study awards and what not if you decide to sign on after BMT. Besides, you wouldn't want to buy a car without test driving first it no?=)</p>
              <p>5. It would be good to discuss your academic positioning with a recruitment officer as I believe they're in the best position to further advice you on the relevancy of your degree of interest. As our military is very academicaly driven, I would advise a degree that you have confidence to do well in. As your future pay would be directly pegged to your academic qualification. i.e degree = $X degree with good honours = $X + $ Y. All the info can be found on the mindef website. Btw, there are no "junk" degrees. They are just niches in their various industries.</p>

              <p>He is very agitated and can't help but yell at the top of his voice for the love of his mother because he's the TERMINATOR. <br><br>In any case, I've stated plainly that unlike somebody hor, no need to name names, I don't try to "sound so dead sure" about issues that I don't have actual experience in, not like you know someone lah. So since I did not go to poly, I said in no uncertain terms that I am not sure if dip with merit = GPA 4.0. I didn't even know that poly has a GPA system like US universities. I was told by my friends in poly that diploma with merit is either the top graduating 20% or 10%. And I know at least  1 diploma holder who got SMS without getting that leh. I think TS has an EXTREMELY high chance of getting it. Don't listen to crap talkers like someone.</p>
              <p>Thanks for your info Jus-Tea. What is the percentile set in polys in order for a student to graduate with diploma with merit then? Is it 5, 10 or 20%?</p>
              <p>Indeed now that you have offered the info that GPA 4.0 is the max in polys, even if you fail to obtain 4.0 by a large margin, you can still graduate with dip with merit, which was what I said earlier about someone talking cock about 4.0 and SMS.</p>

                      those who are with helicopters and those good carrier plans that
                      gets higher chances of being SIA pilot because they more or less do
                      the same thing whereas fighter pilots job scoopes are very

              <p>Another
                      thing to add about this. How can it ever be conceivably possible
                      logically for rotor to have more transferable experience than fixed
                      wing?! LOL. Have you ever seen a fixed wing suspended stationary in the
                      air? Do you think the ability to land a rotored craft is closer than a
                      fixed wing military jet to landing a commercial plane?</p>
              <p>Also, it's not true that anyone with myopia above 150 will be disqualified immediately by RSAF on that basis alone, if he meets all the other criteria for pilot. I know of a handful of people who had their myopia lasik-ed for the job. Singapore has the highest myopia rate in the world.</p>

              <p>if you become a transport pilot cos you can't pass the fitness tests for fighter, you will work a lot with army if i'm not wrong, you will be involved in their exercises by transporting their men. who do you think pilot the choppers from which the Guardsmen rappel from? And then you will do a lot of airborne work with army too so their soldiers can parachute off your chopper.. i think they use Chinooks for this?? Not as sure about that. Also, overseas humanitarian efforts like the Aceh and Mauboloh (spelling?) one require our RSAF transport pilots to send soldiers, commanders and supplies and relief aid there.</p>
              <p>Another thing, the Apaches may be piloted by RSAF pilots but they're owned by Army.</p>

              <p>Actually it will be better for you to sign on as an engineering officer, since you have an engineering Diploma. If you have a really outstanding GPA and study record, the chances of you becoming an officer will almost be 100% if you sign on.</p>
              <p>Quite a number of engineering courses are sponsored by the government, and that is why I advice you to be an engineering officer, as the government will only pay for something related to your field of work.</p>
              <p>As for how long you will get you CPT rank, it will depend mostly on whether your are a scholar or a farmer. If you are a scholar, expect yourself to be a CPT within 2 years after being promoted to LTA, provided that your performance is sufficiently good. But if you are a farmer...read rednano's post above.</p>
              <p>The amount of people who go to OCS from CDO is not definite or set down, but if you sign on as a CDO officer, the chances of you entering are almost 100%, provided that you do not get into any trouble in during your CDO BMT.</p>

              <p>I don't think so at all, i'm not trying to pooh pooh, but serious, it is what I know to be true. My relative used to have this boss, is a farmer Col. After he retired, they found him a job in a civilian ministry, but the position is one that is held by an civilian scholar (eg OMS) that is &gt;15 years younger than him! Quite malu lor.I am not exaggerating. In the ministries, there are specific ranks too (director, deputy director, branch head), and judged according to the size of that ministry. And his position in the size of the ministry is held typically by a 27 year old scholar one. now why do i say scholar? if you think SAF has many safos for its size, the scenery in the cv ministries is far worse. There are so many scholars flying into your face from all directions. This is because the total staff strength of all the CV ministries combined excluding MOE's huge army of teachers, is comparable to the armed forces staff strength, but channelled into all the ministries are Overseas Merit Scholars (OMS), one of the best 3 scholarships by psc after SAFOS and SPFOS and each year, there used to be about 40 OMS before the number was halved a few years ago, compared to only about 8 safos per yr. So its literally a case of everywhere you turn you see an OMS situation. they are the ones holding the middle management DD, D, the branch heads and up to the PS, DS positions.</p>
              <p>But I am relating the experience of someone who after all left as a farmer Col, suay right? If SGcommando leaves SAF in his late 20s after his minimum term of engagement and applies for a job in a civilian sector, it's fine even if his military experience is not utilised. Honestly there are plenty of people who change line during that age in both public and private sector, bankers who suddenly open bakeries, people in HR line who go to cooking school and be a chef, its very common, so no big deal.</p>
              <p>The farmer Col i know left at 45. But now things are different, you can stay until 50. By then, you should have enough to retire. Please note that SAVERS is a frontloading scheme, in which salary you would have gotten from 45 to 55, is 'frontloaded' into your pay, which is why SAF officers are paid substantially more than their civilian counterparts for the same calibre.</p>
              <p>But yeah, through the case above, i knew for a fact that the civilian ministries do not take military experience into consideration unless you are a safos scholar or UNLESS you were a SAF engineering or logistics officer. The service formations will the most transferable skills when they want to leave the organisation, and have the least prestige/pay for career within the organisation when they are in it. That is a fact. Service support will always be second class citizen because their role is meant to support the combat arms, service vs combat is a perennial tension in all armed forces in the world. But they have the most transferable skills. That's why SAF created the MDES structure for them.</p>

              <p>the government sponsors engineering course for engineering courses, because clearly engin officers have to be engin trained but combat officers can be from any vocations, second statement is patently untrue hence. The combat officers I know have physics degree, 1 got economics and another 1 studied government (a humanities degree in Kennedy Sch of Government). And SAF allowed them to study anything they wished as long it fell within a specified list of programmes and its quite a long list.</p>

              <p>You are considering a career in the SAF for the wrong reason - going to settle down with your GF in about XX yrs. Please lah, you can do so as well persevering in any other sectors, trust me its not only SAF guys who get married, if that is the case, sg population would have depleted. And among all the jobs available to you whether it's SAF or otherwise, you may just find something that you have a passion for. Isn't it normal to make something you are passionate about your career? Strange.</p>

I was told by my friends in poly that diploma with merit is either the top graduating 20% or 10%. And I know at least  1 diploma holder who got SMS without getting that leh.

              <p>Thanks for your info Jus-Tea. What is the percentile set in polys in order for a student to graduate with diploma with merit then? Is it 5, 10 or 20%?</p>
              <p>Indeed now that you have offered the info that GPA 4.0 is the max in polys, even if you fail to obtain 4.0 by a large margin, you can still graduate with dip with merit, which was what I said earlier about someone talking cock about 4.0 and SMS.</p>

              <p>I disgree. The lowest possible GPA by estimate to get a dip with merit is 3.7. It might seem far from 4 but it is actually tough to attain.

An A/DIST =GPA of 4 and B+ = GPA 3.5. Thus mathematically a good 80% of the modules attained in poly needs to be A/DIST to safely attain a dip w/merit.

              <p>All graduates, including those who study themselves in farmer university and then join SAF, not just SMS/SAS, get CPT 1 year after graduation. CPT is the only one that is automatically conferred upon the attainment of a degree, so getting the CPT doesn't count for squat. So those bumpkins whose names I shall not name who got CPT 1 yr upon graduation think this means they can be MAJ at 27, wake up from your dreams.</p>
              <p>Didn't know logistics and service side is not as transferable as I thought, as I was told by my friends and family who are combat officers that the service side is the one with the most transferable skills in the SAF and can find a job easily in ST engineering, Keppel, SIA engineering, etc.Looks like aint such luck.</p>
              <p>SInce SGcommando is only looking for CPT pay to sustain his wish to marry his gf, and he will get his CPT 1 yr after graduation, he can sign on as LSA. He will get that rank and marry his gf.</p>
