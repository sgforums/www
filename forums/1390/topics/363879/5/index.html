              <p>You do not need to sign on with a degree or the LSA. The SAF did not state that non graduates cannot sign on as officers. To tell you the truth, if you intend to be serious about your SAF career (and not have a just stay until I can marry my gf mindset), there is no difference at all between you signing on as you are now, and you signing on with LSA. LSA people do not progress any better or faster than non graduates. In fact since you are signing on as a CDO officer, I'm quite sure you will end up earning more than the LSA non CDO officers haahahah. sad (for them, not you) but true..other than the face-value hollow CPT 1 yr after graduation, LSA people do not progress and have not shown historically to progress any further than non graduate officers.</p>

              <p>Time off to study is dependent on your unit commander's approval

              <p>If you get LSA, you will be paid $9000 annual allowance in

              <p>Oh btw, you don't get stuck as LTA for 4 to 5 years as an LSA.
                      You will get your CPT within 6 months after returning from your

              <p>Please wake up. It's not LSA, its ALL degree holders get CPT ONE YEAR (not six months) after they graduate, including those who join the SAF after they do their degree on their own. You think your farmer LSA is such a big fark? SAFOS 1 yr you can 6 months? Hahahahaha my stomach aches.. from the laughing</p>

              <p>SAS is not the same rung as SMS (although I wouldn't take either), as the way you put it "SMS/SAS". SAS is on same par as LSA. SAS/LSA are not much different. It is MTA that is same rung as SMS. It should be SMS/MTA and LSA/SAS. Go check it out in army website yourself.</p>
              <p>SMS/MTA salary, allowance (salary is monthly salary of a A level/Diploma 2LT/LTA paid out every month, during my time only $2.6K+ thereabout, now is more.., allowance is given out every month. The allowance is given out monthly, about $2.5K a month, about $30k a year.)</p>
              <p>SAS got salary, no allowance. Those who take this up and try to go overseas are poor church mice abroad. LOL. LSA no salary, but got token ANNUAL allowance. it's only given out once a yr = $9k.</p>

              <p>Seriously as a dip holder signing on as a officer, your progress will be slow especially if you got to compete with all the scholars out there. But advice to you is, try to get a degree when u sign on study part time.....it's help may not be a lot but it will.</p>

              <p>Guys, please don't quarrel.</p>
              <p>Question, for 2LT allowance, how much is it after self cpf
              deduction? And what amount are paid to my bank account? I heard
              before government got give bonus every month?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Er ok that time as a WSO(C3) 2LT, it's around $ 2000+ but less than $2100. CPF contribution is 15%.</p>
              <p>As for gloater, I am speechless. I did NOT say that ONLY LSA holders get CPT after their degree studies. Please go scrutinise my statement again. Anyway, LSA do get CPT within 6 months because they are considered having gone through the 6 mths or so of pro term training. All degree holders will get their CPT within 6 months upon completion of their vocational training. That's why graduate officers' scheme people get it 1 year because they have their 9 months of OCS to go through. SAFOS will get it after their vocational training which lasts for at least 6 months?</p>
              <p>Don't kid me about this promotion thing. I just read the directive that day. It states there clearly that "all officers with degree qualification will be promoted to CPT within 6 months upon completion of their training or return from studies under LSA."</p>
              <p>You are a foreign university graduate, so be it. Don't try to smoke your way with this though. You are obviously not in touch with the recent directives unless of course, you are working with MINDEF.</p>

              <p>People, I hope u all are not mistaken once again.. I always wanted to have a 
                      career in the force since young.. and now i am coming of age.. I am very proud to be selected as CDO.. Like I said earlier on.. Interest is interest.. Money is money.. Money come 1st in Singapore.. Something like dancing.. U have to learn a lot and do very well in dancing to earn good.. Thats the reason many Singaporean do it as a hobby.. please get my point.. I am NOT only using the force to earn good money and apply for Unis.. Is for my interest too.. Am I suppose to bring home 2k as a specialist every month just because of my interest itself? Wont that be very selfish to my GF and the family next time? oh btw.. U dun wanna know wad kind of background my GF is..<br><br>To add on.. I am definitely not some young tucks who watch too much Rambo and wanna be Hero.. I love the great outdoor.. and definitely want something more than just 9-5 job..</p>

              <p>Do ur BMT, then post to unit, experience ur unit life. If you can accept that kind of life than go ahead, I am saying be it u are so called "born to be soldier", "I love Sg", "interest" or "want money only" type.</p>
              <p>Be it watever type of person you are, life inside SAF can be fustrating because most things that you are going to experience has nothing to do with actual soldiering and common sense just sometimes thrown out of the window, you can be doing something that you know is down right stupid and ridiculous (and sometimes morally wrong) BUT you have NO CHOICE but to do it. Regardless you like it or not.</p>
              <p>Be wise, experience first, sign on liao is for next 10 years, if u find it sucks, still ok, 2 years nia. Just dun sign on liao then u find it sucks, u lan lan LPPL inside and wait long long.</p>
