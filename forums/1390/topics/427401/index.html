              <p>1) When you return to Singapore for your basic military training, there will be recruitment talks conducted. You can express your interest then, you do not really have to apply it way beforehand.</p>
              <p>2) There isnt really anything much you can prepare beforehand for COMPASS test. Its all about psychomotor and mental skills. Its a matter of have or don't have. Don't need to be too stressed up about it.</p>
              <p>3) I would suggest that you think through carefully before signing on. Its not all honour and glory as depicted on advertisements. Remember... advertisements are meant to attract..</p>

              <p>Perhaps someone can explain what exactly is so bad about the RSAF that pilots keep leaving after their bond ? A friend of a friend just left and all he would say was that it was "bureaucratic".. But frankly, which place isn't ? All large organizations are bureaucratic.</p>
              <p>Yeaps, i agree that its not all honor and glory. Likewise, certain deemed "glamourous" jobs are not half as glamourous when you're in them but I dun see people leaving as quickly as they do in the RSAF.

              <p>Maybe it's the pay that makes people go commercial.</p>
              <p>Anyway the test is really easy, it's only useful for sceening retards from NSFs and officers (jk). There was some basic math. I remember moving a joystick around to try and keep a dot within a moving square or something.</p>
              <p>The interview by 3 officers is far more important. Topics: reasons for passion for flying, other interests, etc. It's easy since most of the applicants are 19 years old. You're not expected to demonstrate great insight. Most importantly you have to demonstrate maturity (more than confidence and intelligence) otherwise they might be tempted to offer you a specialist position. Be prepared for dumb interviewers. For example, officer A asks you a question and you answer. Officer B wasn't listening. He asks you the same question in the same words. You fumble and they aren't impressed and offer you a chance to be, gasp, a specialist.</p>

              <p>Yes its an interview for pilot, but if the interview board doesn't see fit to let you try OCS, they do offer you a chance to be a specialist.</p>
              <p>You don't have to be an officer first. An enlistee or even a foreigner can. The recruiting officer said if you pass, they will offer citizenship.</p>
              <p>We need pilots. For other roles without strict physical constraints, RSAF is more picky. They may bar those who served NSF as enlistees. If they allow you, you sign a contract first, then try OCS. I'm not sure if it means that if you fail, you're stuck in as a specialist.</p>

              <p>thats not dumb....the officers apparently were not convinced with the explaination so another officer asked the same question again.if the interview goes bad they probably end up insulting the interviewee like u described to be sent to a specialist position instead.thats probably due to  the interviewee not looking like tom cruise or even having officer material at interview.</p>

              <p>lionel,</p>
              <p>u could go out n meet the spore flight trainers....but they have codes of conduct when dealing with situations like this.so thats not a good idea.trainee pilots arent much of a help either n they are somewhat as arrogant and dumb as alize .u can see now why a group of abos or coons beat the beejeezuz out of 2 rsaf trainee pilots not long ago at pierce next to their squadron while out fishing.all over  for a stick of ciggy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>try getting help from commercial pilots in singapore.quite a few are from the force.the interview would be just like any interview.just be normal and dont display any signs of fear...like what alize described.they arent goin to ask u a math test orally..just a couple of simple questions from the place u were in to what u intend to do etc etc.dont reply like a 19 year old kid.....reply to the adult officers like what a real man would reply.</p>
              <p>so whats wrong with perth anyway?dont u want to stay on there n get a job or something?</p>
