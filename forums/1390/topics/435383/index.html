              <p>Hi, does anybody know how is the compensation for service injury sustained computated? Any special formula? I heard from my friend that if there are many payout on the particular month, the amount will be lesser as MINDEF have a maximum threshold for each month.</p>
              <p>Anybody can clarify?</p>

              <p>actually got some criteria factors for the compensation department to factor in:</p>
              <p>e.g.<br><br>- how the incident occur?<br>- while on official duty/ performing an official act under superior's instructions/ during own time in camp/ on the way to and fro home to camp?<br>- full/ partial neglient? who's fault?<br>- relativity of pre-existing medical condition in relation to the injury?<br>- rank and NSF pay at that time of injury?<br>- medical opinions from camp MO and hospital specialist reports</p>

              <p>We both have slipped disc. I;ve checked with the NSHRC. They said that service injuries sustained after Apr 2008 is liable for the workman compensation scheme <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>plus</strong></span> a special award.

              <p>I guess the language is in "service injuries sustained after Apr 2008" which they use to rule out the special award.</p>
              <p>What is the reason your payout began only this year?</p>
              <p>What year did you report the injury and file for the payment?</p>

              <p>I received my service injury card to offset any cost for future medical expense relating to the injury in 2009 and that is after I follow up repeatedly with my unit chief clerk. The card came with a letter stating that they will notify me to go for the PD board but nobody contacted me at all. Since 2010, I've been enquiring with the relevant department on the compensation issue and it finally got resolved this month.</p>
              <p>The reason they provided for the delay was the injury report was 'lost somewhere'. 4G army indeed...</p>
              <p>Note: My injury report was filed within one week of my injury in 11 Sep 2004.</p>
