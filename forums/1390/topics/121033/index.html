            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys i served in 1996 8th Mono Intake as a Section Commander cum Company Reconnaissance Team member and i would be pleased to help you with any questions on us, Guards. Since i am only a specialist i wouldn't be answer all things that a officer can but i would do my best.<br><br>So anyone interested to know more about us or is going to join us? Muahahahhahaha.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>. How can i be selected for Guardsman ?<br><br>Basically bad luck...lol. Anyway for men, its normally mono-intake but we had some BMTC A'levels/Poly recuits joining us after their POP. Strangely for 8th mono intake, mostly if not all the men that are in the mono-intake are living in the westside like clementi lah, westcoast and tiong bahru?<br><br>BMTC recuits be prepared to see a couple of 3-tonners driving into the parade squard where you would be informed of your posting and see act fierce looking Sgts in brown berets picking up you guys...lol  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>For specialists leh, it is after the BMT POP, then going SISPEC. You would not know your unit posting then. Gnn, i have great hopes of going to the sinnang vocations like clerks / signals etc after BSLC but gnn, i got selected to go ASLC by then, quite confirm u will know your posting liao. You could confirm it further by asking around which units are going to intake commanders.<br><br>2. Guards Converstion Course = Siong ?<br><br>Its nothing when compared to the endless excercises you would be doing later. It should be either 8weeks or 12weeks of converstion, memory faded.<br>But GCC is same whether u are man, specialist or officer.<br><br>You would be doing plenty of running, SOC, combat drills, road marches, 2km combat swim and of course your 1st taste of rappelling. Grand finale is this competition thingy among all the companies on a section level. The course is packed that's for sure but its should be piece of cake if u are from the SISPEC or OCS and not so if u are a newbird.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>3. I can't swim how?!<br><br>Sorry  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> , even non-swimmers in my company are issued life-jackets and are expected to train with the others in the swimming pool to be followed by a swim in the open sea. With life-jacket it is quite safe, you should not drown even when u are doing it with No. 4 uniform later.<br><br>4. Rapelling, i am scared ?<br><br>Yes me too. Everyone is at the beginning and even seasoned Guardsman would be get a bit apprehensive at fixed or heli rapelling from time to time. It is safe imho as compared to roping which is just clinging onto the rope and control your descent via your hands and legs grip only.<br><br>Got many types of rapelling but normally we are asked to do, walkdown, bouncing, casualty types, heliborne only. Advanced australian or headdown types are taught to us commanders and i dun remembered man being asked to do these. Australian is to basically face down and walk down the cliff whereas headdown is head going down and your hand controls your descent only.<br><br>Your 1st rapelling should be done in camp from the fixed towers or buildings lah, nothing much. The weight of FBO is great for making a rapid drop down. Remember to keep your L-shape though when doing the commonly used walk down type. Further sessions are done at Hendon Camp for their cliff, helicopter rapelling lessons at Sembawang airbase, mission rapelling in Thailand, Singapore and Australia.<br><br>A nice trick we always do at your 1st cliff rapelling is the instructors acting fustrated and blur when doing your karabina when it is your turn to descent. Trust me, your balls will shrink when your Rapel Master tell u he don't remember or confirm how to tie you but just ask u to go ... lol <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>5. Ok, i am a man in the Guards Unit now and what vocation would i be assigned?<br><br>It is determined after a meeting between the specialists and your PC after your converstion course lah. Our rifle companies layout is quite like the infantry companies. 7 men a session.<br><br>Normally the best man would be assigned as 2IC in the section. Solid looking guys would be assigned to GPMG teams, Blur Sotongs to the 84mm, smarter more educated ones would be signalers. The rest is basically anyhow pick. And lastly the most attitude problem would be the runners for the PC, CSM and OC. So hopefully we can control you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Do expect a change of vocation anytime soon after you have been assigned as there might be some downgraders among the sessions and you would be assigned around to make unit more balanced. For example, a 1st M203 from section 1 could become 2nd Saw from section 2, etc.<br><br>6. Which Guards Vocation in Rifle Company most siong?<br><br>Imho, some of you guys might disagree with me....some of the more siong guys ranked.....<br><br>1. GPMG assistant<br><br>Expected to walk with the men though not as much firemovement but when sometimes carrying spare barrels, tripod and 7.62mm metal boxes is no joke.<br><br>2. GPMG gunner<br><br>Siong with heavy gun, spare barrel and some ammo. Cleaning weapon is damn sian.<br><br>3. Medic<br><br>This is controversial. A medic might not go through conversation course and has service side blue beret. Keke....due to timing of their passout from medical school. But their load of stretcher and their 1st-aid pack can be quite tiring.<br><br>4. 84mm gunner<br><br>Beast of a gun but at least carrying no ammo. Normally act as block force so not so bad and normally dun walk so much.<br><br>5. 84mm assistant<br><br>84mm rounds looks sad but it isn't as bad as those CB 7.62mm boxes. Not expected to walk alot also.<br><br>6. SAW gunner<br><br>Expected to carry bunaglore torpedo (especially if fully filled with clay) then its more siong then M203 gunner. The weapon is lighter but more cumbersome and harder to chiong than the M203. SAW is harder to clean than M16..yap it tends to rust and rust and has a bit more parts.<br><br>7.  LAW gunner.<br><br>Ok lah, its a matter of getting used to the stupid law tube but some guys never got used to cling-kong of their helmet ever. Only M16 to clean!!<br><br>8. M203 gunner<br><br>Can be quite sinang as compared to your SAW and LAW friends. M203 yes it is heavy and has additional barrel to clean but its really ok...just M203 weapon nia and often nothing else.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FAO Part 2<br><br>6. Guards Converstion Course is over liao, heard we got chance to go overseas sibo?<br><br>You will get the chance to go Thailand, Brunei and Australia confirmed. But places like Hawaii and New Zealand is all depending on timing. My company has filmed the SAF movie u seen in Singapore Discovery Centre ...keke..while the other 2 companies went to Hawaii to train with USMC and New Zealand to do cold cold defense mission.<br><br>Thailand aka Ex. Cresendo was fine, though weather is hot but it is not humid, the vegetation is sparse and quite good to chiong. You will get to do a sibei high cliff rapalling also...lagi exciting. You will enjoy this much more than Lim Chu Kang. Bunk and canteen food = lagi best. The R&amp;R is quite ok also...<br><br>Brunei aka Ex. Lancer. Cry also no tears. The missions leading to Mount Biang, like orientation, topography, mini missions all already fucking siong liao. When the orders come to do Mount Biang, u can see the faces of the laojiaos or regulars crestfallen and they are actually facing some stress....later when u are climbing it u will know. The hardest mission u will ever do in your whole NS life.Fucking bunk with loads of rats, cicadas flying around....dirty. Shit canteen...R&amp;R has no where to go.<br><br>Australia aka Ex. Wallabi or Wallalu. Cooling and dry but their rainstorm is scary. Terrain quite dusty...often can see uniform in mud. Beautiful horizon at night, you would get very realistic training when being inserted 40mins sitting on the SuperPumas onto the objective. SuperPumas will also insert support units like LSV and scout motorscycles also...This is normally A-TEC the test of your operation readiness. I enjoyed this part of Army the most, really realistic mission, very fit and all very garang.<br><br>Can never forget the ATEC morning assault on objective. Morning mist covering a hill. CRT reached the objective and assist commanders into attacking positions. CO threw a thunderflash and entire Guards Battalion attack the objective screaming and firing their weapons. Best fire and movement i seen from the guys, total dedication....awesome firing of even blanks. Even the ATEC assessors are surpised by the ferocity of the assault as some of the guys got carried away and got aggressive against some of the enemies (the agressors).<br><br>7. Can please tell me about how is life without training at the bunk?<br><br>Yap, normally the commanders will not disturb u liao except maybe the CSM arrow the platoon to do some fatigue lah. All platoon will have share-buy a TV and every bunk has a mini-stereo. No training can often ask for night-off from the PC....normally will be granted.<br><br>Some of us like to play football, basketball, or even go for a leisure jog around the camp. Somehow most of us becomes interested in physical fitness then. Often there are push-up competitions among the men. One man once sustained 1500 push-ups without getting up from the floor. Yes some of us a bit mad liao.<br><br>Always someone will be cooking maggi mee to it....sometimes adding egg, keke. Eat alot normally, always will ask guys who book out to help buy food back. Of course, feel free to call your woman and sweettalk her hoping for a "special" during the weekend.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>8. Will the instructors tekan me?<br><br>Keke...yes maybe abit during the mono-intake BMT to help moulding you into a more disciplined soldier and also abit during the GCC course. But most of us do that jokingly i mean we will make u do silly and funny things that make everyone laugh for example making u sing infront of platoon, etc. No such bullshit like forced water parades, standby-cupboard, etc.<br><br>The commanders commands respect from the man. We Commanders are often inspired by the excellent CSMs in 1st Guards, especially SSGT Suresh with ranger tab for example. We set example for everyone to follow, if u think mission is siong for you guys, do check around what the commanders are doing. We are often planning and meeting for the next day activities while the man are already resting.<br><br>Often u can find Commanders doing the same thing as the man, be it SOC, running, etc. Some commanders even sleep in the same bunk with their men, i am one of them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> We are like big brothers to the troopers, everyone is family. Anytime a Guards Commander order a man to do something, we are prepared to do even more.<br><br>When no mission, we are quite lobo in the bunks.....the men, sect cmdr and CSM are very close, often we bookout together and sometimes even organize BBQ in the company line.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>9. What does a Guardsman do in wartime actually?<br><br>Ok. It all depends. Out of the 2 Guards Battalion either 1st or 3rd Guards are given differently specialities like heliborne or coast assault. My 1st battalion, Bravo Company did alot of heliborne operations including TAG, terminal air guidance. Terminal Air Guidance is simply put it assisting the the SSAF helicopters to land &amp; pickup troops and equipment. Giving security to them also in the landing zone.<br><br>However that is only part of the job. ...<br>Being elite infantry, as my OC said we are expected to be in the thick of the fighting. Circumstances permitting, we are not so defensive orientated like holding a line but attack, defend abit then attack again. The Commandos are to be doing the sabotage, clandestine missions, Armour guys assaulting the main defense line engaging well-prepared defensive positions and enemy armour. Infantry guys being general purpose and they are expected most of the time to dig in and hold their line. However for Guards, due to heavy helicopter support we are like very mobile infantry best used for littoral warfare and when u need guys to assault a heavily defended hill, u need infantry soldiers like us.<br><br>Not to mention our 1st Guards old camp at Dieppe Barracks is just walking distance to Sembawang Chopper Airbase...keke....u will get used to the choppers sound. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
