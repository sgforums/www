SAD. Platoon SGT are Platoon 2nd in comd. He need to be well verse in his job. In short, tons of experience.<br><br>Just one example, to carry out a area defence, what must he do before, during and after? If he has not done any as a sect comd, how is he going to do it well as a PS?<br><br>One more point, time spend with man. From what I see, hear and feel. These PS dun really get much respect like what 'we' get in the past. They dun get the command and respect much from the man. Reason are they are not steady (buey zai) be it in command and control or people management.<br><br>Most regular PS in the past work their way up from sect comd tour which lasted 2 years and some even longer as they went over to support coy as sect comd.<br><br>Well, all this comes down to the retaining of manpower as SAF cannot retain 'us' in the past, even today people are leaving. To fill up the vacum, steps are skip.<br><br>NCOs are the backbone of any and every ARMY. Till today in US ARMY, any new commission officer post to a unit, he need to under study his Platoon SGT for as long as 6mths before he take over command. That can oni happen in a regular ARMY and we are not. Still it sad to see this is happening in SAF.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
