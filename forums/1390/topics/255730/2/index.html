One group got ambushed and was under heavy fire. The other american group managed to capture the OC and runner of the VietCong unit. Do note the OC and runner surrendered, making them POWs<br><br>Hearing the gun fire from a distance, the 2Lt knows the OC can call off the ambush and save his other team. So he threatens the OC with a gun. The OC refused, and the 2LT killed the runner in cold blood.<br><br>Although the other team was brutally massacred... should the 2Lt have killed the runner, given the OC and runner both surrendered and were by the Geneva Code -POWs and to be free of all mil torture.</div></blockquote>That's from the show "Rules of Engagement"<br><br>The laws of armed conflict outlaws torture but we all know not everyone abides by it. The common soldiers are not required to be POW-trained. I think the justification is they are unlikely to be operating behind enemy lines and chances of them getting captured are unlikely (but we all know that's BS.

POW training is meant to be harsh. I dun think the enemy would give you a king coil bed when they're torturing you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> The training was already quite watered down when I went but still, it made me wish many times over that I wasn't there.</div>
