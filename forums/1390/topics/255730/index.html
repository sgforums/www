Having info could save his men or other fellow soldiers' lives. What's more how would a commander know if the enemy is not doing the same to POWs?<br><br>I had a similar interesting discussion with WOs once when I was in Army... and many people feel when you're at the point in time... to hell with the Geneva Code and what not, the lives of the men you lead are at stake.<br><br>lemme paint you this scenario, based on a movie about the 70's US-Viet COng War.<br><br>An American team split up along a mangrove, each led by a 2Lt. One group got ambushed and was under heavy fire. The other american group managed to capture the OC and runner of the VietCong unit. Do note the OC and runner surrendered, making them POWs<br><br>Hearing the gun fire from a distance, the 2Lt knows the OC can call off the ambush and save his other team. So he threatens the OC with a gun. The OC refused, and the 2LT killed the runner in cold blood.<br><br>Although the other team was brutally massacred... should the 2Lt have killed the runner, given the OC and runner both surrendered and were by the Geneva Code -POWs and to be free of all mil torture.</div>

It helps build a steady resilience in the battlefield...which is important even without capture.</div>
