              BMT</span></strong><br> This 9-week programme trains combat-fit recruits in the basic
              military skills to prepare them for advanced vocational training.
              The programme includes weapon training with the SAR 21 rifle which
              will teach recruits technical handling and marksmanship skills; a
              Battle Inoculation Course that simulates a real battlefield; a
              Field Camp which develops basic survival skills; progressive
              training to complete a 24-km route march which builds combat
              fitness and endurance; and hand grenade training.<br> <em><span style="font: inherit;">For those who fail to achieve the
              NAPFA test silver award, they are required to undergo an 8-week
              Physical Training Phase (PTP) prior to the PES A/B1

              BMT</span></strong><br> As evidence has shown that obese recruits are able to achieve
              optimum fitness levels and weight loss in about 19 weeks, the new
              BMT programme for recruits with Body Mass Index (BMI) scores
              exceeding 27.0 will be 19 weeks. This BMT programme is designed to
              help obese recruits improve their physical fitness progressively
              while equipping them with basic soldiering skills and
              knowledge.</p>

              for recruits who are medically fit for deployment in selected
              combat and combat support vocations, such as signal operators,
              combat medics and naval system operators. These recruits will be
              given a new medical classification of PES B2, in place of the
              existing PES C1 classification. This is to ensure that the medical
              classification of our soldiers is consistent with their deployment.
              The new 9-week programme will include customised physical training,
              as well as basic combat training to prepare them for their combat
              and combat support roles.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES C
              BMT</span></strong><br> The 9-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES C recruits. This

              training to prepare them for combat service support vocations, such
              as service medic, and those related to logistics and
              administration.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES E
              BMT</span></strong><br> The 4-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES E recruits. This

              <p><img class="block-images-content-spacing" src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/strengthenNS/assets/images/about_ns_01.jpg" alt="" width="354" height="522" align="left"></p>
              <p>NS
                                 has been the cornerstone of our nation’s defence and security since 
                                independence. Our national servicemen form the backbone of the Singapore
                                 Armed Forces (SAF), Singapore Police Force (SPF) and Singapore Civil 
                                Defence Force (SCDF) that keep Singapore safe and secure.</p>
              <p>To date, more than 900,000 male Singaporeans have served NS and 
                                journeyed through this rite of passage. For many, this defining 
                                experience bonds servicemen from different backgrounds and across 
                                generations.</p>
              <p>The need for NS became clear when Singapore gained independence in 
                                1965. It would not have been possible to raise a regular force of a 
                                sufficient size to protect this island state given our small population.
                                 On 21 February 1967, then Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew announced the 
                                introduction of full-time NS. Conscription began with 900 of 9,000 
                                eligible conscripts enlisting for full-time NS, while the rest served 
                                part-time in the People’s Defence Force, the Vigilante Corps and the 
                                Special Constabulary. Full-time NS was extended to the SPF and SCDF in 
                                1975 and 1981 respectively.</p>
              <p>For over 47 years, NS has evolved into a national institution that is well accepted and a part of our way of life.</p>
              <p>When NS was introduced, officers served three years and other ranks 
                                served two years, followed by ten years of reserve service. In 1971, the
                                 length of service was changed to two-and-a-half years for servicemen 
                                holding the rank of corporal and above. In 1983, the reservist training 
                                cycle was extended from 10 to 13 years, to meet operational needs.</p>
              <p>In 2005, arising from improvements in training and technology, the 
                                duration of full-time NS was reduced from two-and-a-half years to two 
                                years. The Operationally Ready National Service (ORNS) duration was 
                                shortened to ten years in 2006. (ORNS replaced the term “reservist” in 
                                1994 to better signify the operational roles and readiness of our main 
                                fighting force.)</p>
              <p>The roles of national servicemen have changed over time. Our first 
                                few batches of enlistees were trained in infantry battalions. Enlistees 
                                also started joining the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) and Republic 
                                of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) in 1969 and 1970 respectively. In 1975, 
                                the first intake of full-time Police National Servicemen was enlisted 
                                and deployed for peacetime and emergency functions, such as crime 
                                prevention patrols and protection of key installations, and preparation 
                                and training for national emergencies and disasters. The SCDF enlisted 
                                its first intake of NSFs in 1981 to provide emergency services to the 
                                nation during peacetime and crises.</p>
              <p>Since then, our servicemen’s roles have expanded. They are now 
                                trained for a wide spectrum of operations. In the SAF, our servicemen 
                                are trained to fight within units that have to operate in a 
                                decentralised manner and in urban terrain. They are also technologically
                                 savvy, and able to operate sophisticated equipment. This will enable 
                                the SAF to achieve mission success decisively and efficiently.</p>
              <p>Beyond protecting Singapore from armed conflicts, our servicemen are 
                                now involved in countering terrorism, dealing with the aftermath of 
                                natural disasters and tackling health epidemics. For instance, our NSFs 
                                and NSmen from the SAF and the Home Team aided relief efforts in 
                                Indonesia and Thailand in the wake of the Boxing Day tsunami of 2004, 
                                working shoulder to shoulder with our regular forces. Our SCDF NSmen 
                                have participated in a total of nine relief missions in the Asia-Pacific
                                 region, as part of Operation Lionheart. Back home, our SAF NSFs 
                                contributed to detection, contact tracing and quarantine management 
                                efforts during the SARS crisis in 2003. SAF medics were also deployed at
                                 Changi Airport to augment efforts to screen air travellers.</p>
              <p>The changing roles of our servicemen reflect the need for NS to 
                                evolve and keep pace with the changes in our society as well as our 
                                threat environment. This is necessary if NS is to remain relevant.</p>
              <p>NS, as the bedrock of our fighting force and national security, 
                                remains critical for Singapore’s continued survival and success. A 
                                strong defence underpins the peace and prosperity we enjoy, by 
                                safeguarding Singapore’s independence and sovereignty, as well as 
                                providing us with the political space and freedom to act in 
                                Singaporeans’ best interests.</p>
              <p>The turbulence and instability in our regional security environment 
                                in recent years underscore the continued importance of defence for this 
                                generation. Countries have become increasingly assertive over the 
                                maritime and territorial disputes in the East and South China Seas. 
                                Tensions in Northeast Asia in particular have risen, as overlapping 
                                claims intersect with historical animosities, domestic nationalism and 
                                changing power dynamics. We also have to contend with non-traditional 
                                threats such as terrorism, piracy, natural disasters and health 
                                epidemics. These unpredictable threats are complex, with no easy 
                                solutions.</p>

                                      the SAF, and 230 Regulars in the SPF and SCDF, to improve training and inculcate
                                      values more effectively. These Regulars will be well-versed in the latest training
                                      methods and technology. They can also better emphasise and enforce training

              <li class="reset_margId"> Increase deployment flexibility for NSFs by taking into account skills and

                                                   Vocational Assessment Centre (VAC) conducts a battery of tests called 
                                                  the Manpower Aptitude Assessment System (MAPAS) to assess your mental 
                                                  abilities. This is so that we can maximize our limited manpower by 
                                                  putting people where their abilities can be best used.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Your
                                                   Vocational Assessment scores will affect important decisions, which 
                                                  include assignment to a vocation and selection to be a commander 
                                                  (Officer, Specialist).</span></em></span><br><br>Therefore, you should put in as 
                                                  much effort as possible to do the tests well and accurately, as this 
                                                  will not only help the nation maximize it's limited manpower, but also 
                                                  help us place you into vocations that will make good use of your 
                                                  abilities.<br><br><strong>What are the tests like</strong><br><br>We use different
                                                   sub-tests to measure different types of mental ability. Some of the 
                                                  mental abilities that we measure include memory, speed of responding, 
                                                  abstract reasoning, following complex instructions, solving mathematical
                                                   problems, mental spatial ability, and psycho-motor skills. Please click
                                                   on the following links to try out some of these tests.<br><br> a)	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Word analogies</span><br> b)	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Number reasoning</span><br> c)	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Picture reasoning</span><br><br>All
                                                   the sub-tests are computer administered. Most of the sub-tests will 
                                                  present a problem or question on the screen and you will need to respond
                                                   accordingly.  Some sub-tests however, measure speed or hand-eye 
                                                  co-ordination and may look like simple computer games.<br><br><strong>How long is the test at VAC </strong><br><br>Since
                                                   we have to be as accurate as possible, we need to measure as wide a 
                                                  range of your abilities as is possible. Thus, the testing will require 
                                                  about 2 to 2 1/2 hours of your time.<br><br><strong>What to do</strong><br><br> </span></p>

              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do not worry too much.</span> All we require you to do is to do your best. Each sub-test has instructions to guide you on what to do.</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ask for help:</span> If you have problems understanding any of the sub-tests or the 
                                                  instructions during testing, there will be people on-site to help you. </li>
