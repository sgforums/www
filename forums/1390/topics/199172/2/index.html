I repeat again. You have five chances to become a Guardsmen.<br><br>ONE. Is to sign on. And like I mentioned...its only a chance. Doesnt mean you will get it.<br><br>TWO. You will be called to enlist str8 into the Guards Formation. Meaning BMT as an infantryman in Guards formation. After bmt then u will train for your GCC. Also depends on chance.<br><br>THREE. You will have your bmt in Tekong but after POP you will be enlisted to Guards formation. Normally this kind of cases you will be in their support company doing recce and stuffs or a guards rifleman. You will attend GCC.<br><br>FOUR. After POP, you will go to command school. sispec/ocs. then after you graduate from there and hopefully you are posted to Guards Formation. You will attend GCC.<br><br>FIVE. After POP from bmtc, if you are posted to Guards Formation as a support service, ie driver, storeman, clerk etc....... You may request from your S1 to go for the GCC. But this only apply if you are in Guards Formation.<br><br>GCC stands for guards conversion course.<br><br>All of the above are chances. There is no way you can become a guardsman at your own will.<br><br>Obviously you need to be fit to become guardsman. Guardsman are trained like infantry except they specialize in heliborn.<br><br>Does this answer your doubts?<br><br></div>

My CO, RSM, and the 4 CSMs are commandos/SOF during NS. They were tough, creative but very fair.<br><br>The basics then included -<br>1) Coastal swim/watermanship/small boats<br>2) Basic survival course<br>3) All sorts of advance obstacle courses, sometimes included swimming and shooting at the range with timing. (Depends on how creative the commanders are).<br>4) Basic demolition/explosives, weapons training<br>5) All sorts of running with timing, including passing a 10KM run(in fact during the course we were not allowed to walk, we run everywhere we go).<br>6) All sorts of turnouts and "games" played on us.<br>7) Forced marches are common.<br>8 )  Repelling from cliffs and helicopters, heli-ops<br>9) Typography with timing, plus advance obsticle course and shooting range with timing (I hated this one).<br>10) All sorts of lessons and exercises.<br><br>These are all that I remember. These days - the course should be very much easier and different, plus with internet forums, you are provided with tips. Back then, it was a surprise everyday.<br><br>I'm not too sure why you want to be a guardsman. Some advice as an old guardman - you want to be on-the-ball, be a commando or an officer at least. If not, slack and do admin work. If you are a guardsman, you will always be sandwiched between the commandos and infantry. Fact is, the commando unit is better in most ways, and infantry units will always strive to match or beat the guards standards, and some intakes do. Being caught in between is tough, you get negative comments and guards units tend to be benchmarks for all units to beat (sort of whipping boy).<br>I also get the impression that guards standards these days are not really as tough as what it used to be. They seem to be closer to the infantry now.<br><br>Army news just had an article about the first reservist officer doing GCC to be a guardsman. A Reservist - so how difficult can it be?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm just curious to find out wad is the difference between Guards ATEC and infantry ATEC? For guards it is one deliberate assault, one defense and one hasty assault. How abt the infantry? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>
