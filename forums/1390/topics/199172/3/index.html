I did my conversion 16 years ago.<br><br>Back then -<br>The course varies from 4-8 weeks, depending on rank. How tough it was also depends on the intake and commanders. My CO, RSM, and the 4 CSMs are commandos/SOF during NS. They were tough, creative but very fair.<br><br>The basics then included -<br>1) Coastal swim/watermanship/small boats<br>2) Basic survival course<br>3) All sorts of advance obstacle courses, sometimes included swimming and shooting at the range with timing. (Depends on how creative the commanders are).<br>4) Basic demolition/explosives, weapons training<br>5) All sorts of running with timing, including passing a 10KM run(in fact during the course we were not allowed to walk, we run everywhere we go).<br>6) All sorts of turnouts and "games" played on us.<br>7) Forced marches are common.<br>8 )  Repelling from cliffs and helicopters, heli-ops<br>9) Typography with timing, plus advance obsticle course and shooting range with timing (I hated this one).<br>10) All sorts of lessons and exercises.<br><br>These are all that I remember. These days - the course should be very much easier and different, plus with internet forums, you are provided with tips. Back then, it was a surprise everyday.<br><br>I'm not too sure why you want to be a guardsman. Some advice as an old guardman - you want to be on-the-ball, be a commando or an officer at least. If not, slack and do admin work. If you are a guardsman, you will always be sandwiched between the commandos and infantry. Fact is, the commando unit is better in most ways, and infantry units will always strive to match or beat the guards standards, and some intakes do. Being caught in between is tough, you get negative comments and guards units tend to be benchmarks for all units to beat (sort of whipping boy).<br>I also get the impression that guards standards these days are not really as tough as what it used to be. They seem to be closer to the infantry now.<br><br>Army news just had an article about the first reservist officer doing GCC to be a guardsman. A Reservist - so how difficult can it be? </div></blockquote>Hmmm, so bcoy, urs is 4 to 8 weeks. I thought the traditional conversion course is at least 3 to 4 months spreadout?

The only time I know about it being spread out was for the sniper teams (we had sniper teams in the battalion back then) - they had to do their course and carry on with the conversion after that.<br><br>I have always heard about things between guards units and the commandos, including things that happen during btec. However, for the record, I did not see anything personally, and since it was so long ago, I will not comment on it.

Also, this varies from each intake. We did a few of this type of training. The closest to yours would be (mine done at old safti) -<br><br>1) Swim in long no. 4 with dummy m16, minus boots, one lap across pool.<br>2) Wear boots, and FBO, run to repelling tower, hook up, do normal repel.<br>3) Put down full pack, clear SOC plus additional obsticals (AOC).<br>4) Run to Peng Kang hill, do section assualt, fire and movement.<br>5) Run down Peng Kang hill, run to 100m range to do range (can't remember distance). Cannot remember how many rounds given, but really hard to control breathing.<br><br>All of this took about 45 minutes I think. This was just one of the courses I went thru.

            <div class='col-md body'>My advice for Guardsmen or Guardswomen of the future or Guards wannabes.........U must have lots humility and mental endurance. Guards is not abt getting men with 6 packs on the stomach and look cool in PIONEER magazine. Many of the training is more of a mental race and physical endurance. If u do it together with the others, it should be bearable.<br><br>Since we leopard crawl frequently, get a  knee-guard and elbow-guard.</div>
