Most of the people can't wait to get out of Tekong and never return there since it makes them homesick, so i guess that's wat ur OC meant. Also. as compared to mainland, a Tekong PC will have more responsibilities. Every few months go range lah, grenade-throwing, field camp etc, and the possibility of u getting injured by f-ed up recruits are much higher.<br><br></div>

He is damm gilat in the way he presented himself as an instructor in 7BTS. There is also another PC at another company whom was trained in some US command school and returned as an instructor.<br><br>Well, "hopeless and CMI" ... not sure nowadays arrangement ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Based on my cohort and people i know from other cohorts, most posted to BMTC either did not fair "well" (relative to others) in OCS (lower ranking in cohort) or because their remaining NSF term is too short e.g. those crossed over from SISPEC or recourse personnel or did not fair well during their major appointments or "talk big and cannot work type".<br><br>The "questionable" cadets do not even get a chance to hold admin or exercise PC or Pl Sgt appointments during their cadet days.<br><br>I tend to agreed that most who did "well" (relative to others) in OCS are posted to combat units as PC, 2IC or staff officer i.e. Dy's S2 or 3.</div>
