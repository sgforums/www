He became rifleman during reservist. He loved it.<br><br>I was in the S2 branch and was posted to rifleman during reservist after 2 in-camps. I'm a corporal but all Int NCO were sergeants and above. But I was given the option to stay by my S2 but I opted to go ahead with the transfer.<br><br>In my PDF unit all riflemen were former storemen, cooks, etc. But my company all very on because they were quite proud to be riflemen. Kena best company 2 years in a row. Very good bunch. Mostly hokkien peng.<br><br>Infantry quite fun lah. But I kena platoon runner, quite siong but still more fun than being stuck in a CP with all the officers around. More fresh air in a trench than a CP.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sure many storemen and cooks are Pes C but no, man, there are a lot of storemen and cooks who are Pes A.

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess they have more storemen than they need. But as I stress, it's not just storemen, it everybody else.<br><br>One QM clerk also from my NSF unit became assistant to the GPMG gunner in the Support Company. Damn suay. Carry ammo and spare barrel or sometimes tripod, hahahaha...<br><br>But I became platoon runner and once or twice section commander when they don't have enough sergeants. I'm hentak-kaki corporal becos kenna problem before... got charged during reservist for AWOL.<br><br>I left country to work after NSF for a short one year but didn't do my exit permit properly even though I did write a letter to my unit. Come back kenna charge. S$400 fine.<br><br>My corporal friends all became sergeants already whereas I hentak-kaki and went from Bn HQ S2 branch to company line in another unit. My S2 offered to overturn my posting but I enjoy company line a lot more than Bn HQ so I became rifleman.<br><br>Platoon runner even more suay than support company becos carry the PRC-77 set. Must be fitter than all the other guys cos I carry more weight than them and expected to run up and down the column during route march to relay mssg between the front where the PC is and the back where the PL Sgt is cos each platoon only one comms set.<br><br>Then during deployment gotta set up telejay comms and dig shellscrape for the officer, PL Sgt and myself.

            <div class='col-md body'>Most modern armies, at any one time, is made up of more non-combatants than combatants. I read in a few places that the US Army during Vietnam War has a ratio of something like 3 (or more) service/support personnel for every one fighting personnel.<br><br>I found this quite hard to believe cos when you're in battalion, the fighting men definitely out-numbers the service/support personnel.<br><br>But since this is a published fact, there must be some truth in it. Maybe if you add up all the HQ staff from Bn to Div to Corps etc. If you add all the mechanics, technicians, logistics at supply and maintenance depots etc, the real figure becomes quite huge.And then maybe there are some instances where reservist aren't required like medical centres, radar operators, air-defence weapons etc cos there's always some regulars or NSF manning those equipment 24/7.<br><br>So if such a case is true of SAF also, then it is no surprise that a lot of former HQ, service personnel end up as battalions of riflemen. Speculation only, don't challenge me.</div>
