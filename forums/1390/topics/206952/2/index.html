            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, regardless if its really 10% of the HE usually used, no ball bearings, etc..<br><br>It is still a grenade with HE in it.  You wouldn't want to be near a firecracker when it exploded do you?  We have all heard about people losing digits, entire hands, eyes, etc when being too close to a firecracker when it goes off.<br><br>Now imagine a grenade with explosive that is a lot more potent packed in a hard plastic casing that will make great fragments to slice into your flesh, eyes, etc.<br><br>Follow procedure and throw the bloody grenade properly and safely for everyone's sake.  It can be fun, but it's up to you to make it so.</div>
