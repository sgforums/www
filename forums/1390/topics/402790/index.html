              <p>Last year, I failed my o level on 2009 and decided to go to army and retake my O as a private candidate before becoming a soldier. (The higher nitec courses available for me was bad due to my E8 math)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I took the medical test on march 30 and here my questions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. I had applied for army and went for medical check up...so can i still go to poly if i prefer to finish my studies?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. How long do i have to wait before i become a nsman? (Took my medical chkup on 30 march and failed my napfa test during secondary.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. How long does poly graduates need to wait before going to army? (link to Q4.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. This question is to know which route will save more time....going army first or poly?</p>

              <p><br>You have posted at the wrong place. This should be at the SAF forum and not speaker's corner. Anyway, just to answer your question..</p>
              <p>1) You can defer NS for your poly education. So, you can choose to complete your poly education first before you enlist.</p>
              <p>2) I think you meant NSF. NSmen refers to those who have ORDed.  For your date of enlistment, it depends on your luck. Some got called up earlier and some later. Typically should be a few months after your medical check up.</p>
              <p>3)Again, it depends on your luck. JC graduates willl enlist early in the year. Poly graduates usually enlist in June/Sept or Dec. </p>
              <p>4) I think you should go poly first. You will most likely end up in the mono-intake group if you were to enlist with your current qualification. </p>

              <p>yeah more pay and ur army status will be shown in...computer.</p>
              <p>but like i said b4..if i go army now..i wun nid to wait for 6-9mth like poly gradua..since I AM waiting for ns now+retaking o. Unless my enlistment date is like next year.(not fixed..still can defer).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so it would be nice if someone can tell me..the date i MIGHT (most possible) enlistment date so i can..."think" more. Is it just like what my parents said? 2011 june? (15mth) from now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>just see no point in rushing. Take my time and choose the best routh.</p>
