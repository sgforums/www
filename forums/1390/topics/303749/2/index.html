Let's those bastards understand the seriousness of your medical situations. They don't care what you feel, in the end you will be the one at loss if you continue to do what they ask you to. Ask your parents to talk to them or find the right person who can really help you. Be in mind in army, once if you have no rank, some cruel superior won't care the fuck who you are and just force you keep doing shits, saikang, outfield and more stuffs to uphold their own performance. And they simply just label people who report sick as chao keng even though people are having real serious medical problems.</p></div>
