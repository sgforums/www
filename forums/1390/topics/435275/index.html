              <p>Basically nothing much, i went in around ghost festival also. The festival should be over by the time you go for your fieldcamp. Anyway, say excuse me when you want to pee in jungle, pork thing i am not sure cause cookhouse serves pork, but just dont bring pork. If you are afraid at night, try to drink less water to avoid going to toilet during midnight</p>

              <p><br>Tree is a common resting place for dieties and ghosts as well. It provides shades them like living beings need shelter over them. If you pee there without politely telling them first, and if the ghosts is not as kind and properly cultivated,,,,for serious cases, you may need to call "sai-kong" to harmonise the spirit that taking over your body....otherwise, you day is numbered...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>This is real story.</p>
              <p>Once, I went for a course.  I do not need to stay-in, but since they said the camp was 'dirty', I 'die die' must stay in, just to see what is there.</p>
              <p>I have heard of old man praying in the dawn, and female singing near the tree, and some trainee possessed etc.  As a young man, I just want to find out.</p>
              <p>So, that night, the Orderly arranged me to stayed in the top most level bunk.  But he did not informed other staff.  I was the only one sleeping in that level.  At about 11pm, I heard a staff coming in to perform his night duty, and was singing as he walk into the room I was assigned to.  </p>
              <p>As a manner of courtesy, I sit up from the bed wanting to greet him, as he switched on the light when he walked in.  Suddenly, he rushed out the room shouting 'hantu, hantu'.  I was shocked, and I jumped down from the bed running after him, not knowing what was wrong.  He just kept running all the way to the ground floor, without looking back.</p>
              <p>By the time we reached the ground floor, I noticed that his face was pale (he is a malay).  He started scolding all kinds of profanity words at me when he found out that the hantu was me. (he was a Sergeant, much lower than my rank, but I took no offence at that moment)  Only than did I realied that I was mistaken as ghost. </p>
              <p>Till this day, whenever I tell relate this incident to my kids, they still laugh over it. </p>
