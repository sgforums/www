            <div class='col-md body'>Minister for Defence, RADM (NS) Teo Chee Hean, officiated at the groundbreaking ceremony for the School of Infantry Specialists (SISPEC) at Pasir Laba Camp this morning.<br><br>The camp facilities, when completed in late 2005, will mark a new beginning for the Warrant Officer and Specialist Corps. <strong>SISPEC will be co-located with the SAF Warrant OfficersÂ’ School, paving the way for the formation of the Specialist and Warrant Officer Institute, an institution dedicated to the development of the Warrant Officer and Specialist Corps to support the 3rd Generation SAF. </strong>A leaner and more capable fighting force, the 3rd Generation SAF will leverage on new concepts and technologies. This institute will form a cornerstone in the transmission of knowledge and experience from the Warrant Officers to the junior commanders, whilst also providing a conducive environment for learning. This will strengthen the SAFÂ’s foundations in basic soldiering skills.<br><br>Chief of Army, MG Desmond Kuek, said that Pasir Laba Camp is the appropriate location for the Home of the Warrant Officer and Specialist Corps as this was the original birthplace of leadership training in the SAF. This would be vital in inspiring greater motivation and commitment by our Warrant Officers and Specialists.<br><br>The new energy-efficient facilities were conceptualised, developed and managed by a team of architects and engineers from Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency. This project will involve retrofitting the existing buildings and constructing additional buildings at Pasir Laba Camp.<br><br><strong>DESIGN CONCEPT FOR SISPEC NEW FACILITIES </strong><br><br>Integration: "Camp within a Camp" concept that aligned new buildings and structures along existing axes and orientation to seamlessly integrate the new development into the existing infrastructure.<br><br>Unique Identity: imparted through an independent entrance (that addressed the potential traffic build-up as well), the multi-purpose Chevron square, and the Symbolic (Pedestrian) Link that functionally connects the different school clusters.<br><br>Logical Planning with the HQ building being the "heart" of the development, flanked by the 2 school clusters. The common facilities (canteen, cookhouse, etc) are also located at the centre of the development, thereby minimising walking distance when soldiers utilise these facilities.<br><br>Heritage Trail: a pedestrian link that begins at the School HQ, and connects the Basic School cluster to the Advance School cluster, and then onwards to the SAF Warrant Officers' School- a functional feature that is also a clever analogy of the career of a SAF specialist.<br><br>Accommodation clusters are planned to the following considerations:<br><br>a. Shared facilities - The orientation of the U-shaped clusters enabled many common facilities to be shared, increasing the building's efficiencies such as staircases, toilets, services as well as gathering areas on the ground floor, which are heavily used daily for assembly.  The U-shape layout also imparts a sense of enclosure to the Companies staying within, thereby fostering a sense of community and interaction. Such interaction are vital elements to building cohesion as our soldiers train to be a united and focussed fighting force.<br><br>b. Standard common spaces - Recreation Rooms located centrally in each block would enable soldiers to interact in a more relaxed environment after training.<br><br>c. Ventilation - The corners of the U-shaped clusters are designed to enable air to flow freely, thus improving the ventilation to the clusters.  The accommodations are designed with single corridors, maximising the window openings on both sides, thereby ensuring maximum air flow through the bunks<br><br>-- iMINDEF<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SPEECH BY MINISTER FOR DEFENCE, RADM(NS) TEO CHEE HEAN, AT THE GROUNDBREAKING CEREMONY FOR SISPEC DEVELOPMENT<br></strong><br>Good morning, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.<br><br>SISPECÂ’s History<br><br>It gives me great pleasure to officiate at this ground-breaking ceremony for the new SISPEC Â– the School of Infantry Specialists. This marks a new chapter in SISPECÂ’s history, which began in 1966 when it was called the School of Section Leaders. Later it was renamed SAFINCOS, that is, the SAF Infantry Non-Commissioned Officers School, before it became SISPEC in 1992 in recognition of the expertise of our junior commanders.<br><br>We now need to expand the capacity of SISPEC to cater for an increase in the number of trainees expected from 2006 onwards. We will then have a surge in the number of Full-time National Servicemen coming in each year and a larger number of Polytechnic graduates in each batch.<br><br>The 3G Specialist<br><br>The SAF has started on a journey of transformation. We are in the process of building the 3rd Generation SAF. The 1st Generation SAF was a rather basic military force which we built from scratch when we became an independent nation. Today, the 2nd Generation SAF has capabilities which make it a strong deterrence. The 3rd Generation SAF will be greatly enhanced by technology to be a leaner and even more potent force.<br><strong><br>There are two key elements that we must develop in each and every one of our soldiers. No matter how much technology may change the way we do things and the way we fight, it is ultimately the soldier who makes the difference.<br></strong><strong><br>The first element is values and attitudes, courage, ingenuity and professionalism. </strong>That is what will determine victory or defeat for the SAF. The leadership, motivation and professionalism of our commanders at all levels will make the difference in battle. So SISPEC has a critical role, for it is here that the SAFÂ’s first-line commanders are moulded and developed.<br><strong><br>The second element is professional and technical competency. </strong>The high-tech nature of the 3rd Generation SAF will place greater demands on the professionalism and technical competency of the 3G Specialist.  He will have to thoroughly understand and make optimal use of the variety of weapons and network systems in the 3rd Generation SAF.<br><br>Our soldiers must be able to exploit technology to give them a sharp edge over their adversaries. The 3G Specialist will have to lead his soldiers in a demanding and complex battlefield. With better situational awareness and reach, the 3G Specialist will have to exercise his leadership and command over a wider expanse of the battlefield. He will also be expected to take on higher levels of responsibility as he is given greater latitude and more training.<br><strong><br>The SWI Â– A New Chapter<br></strong><br>Today also marks a new chapter for our Warrant Officer and Specialist Corps. When SISPEC is fully constructed and rises here next to SAFWOS, we will see the formation of the Specialist and Warrant Officer Institute, or SWI for short.  This cluster in Pasir Laba Camp will become the new Â“Home of the Warrant Officer and Specialist CorpsÂ”. It will also be a spiritual home to which our warrant officers and specialists can return to revisit their values, culture and heritage.<br><br>The SWI will be the place where we groom and develop Warrant Officers and Specialists. It will be the analogue to SAFTI Military Institute next door. This will promote a deeper sense of belonging and motivation for all our warrant officers and specialists to bring out their best qualities.<br><br>The Warrant Officer and Specialist Corps is a key pillar of the SAF. I would like to thank all of you for your contributions to this vital part of the SAF.  Finally, I would like to extend my heartiest congratulations and best wishes to the Warrant Officer and Specialist Corps.<br><br>--iMINDEF<br><br></div>
