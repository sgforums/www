With regards to the SITREP, that was very much what the PDA could do ..send msgs and SITREP to my bosses...and tracking movement...And i don't think using the PDA during night movement is the wisest of ideas with the big touch screen all shimmering in the night ..haha...<br><br>i seen pictures of US troops in Iraq using the HP 5550 series of PDA attached to some  green color housing to make it more durable in terms of withstanding knocks and shocks and battery , and they use it to send data back to their forward operating bases. And during my course of studies, i had seen some prototypes of the HP PDAs being connected to the signal equipment to act as a rebro and repeater sending out signals back to the bases. .Sorry guys it was  printed in The Age newspapers here in Australia, so it kinda of NPNT hehe..</div>
