              <p>Hi all, I'm quite frustrated and can i seek for help out here. I'm currently pes C9L9 cause of a severe annular tear and degenerative disc at L4/L5 region of my back and ive also got mild tears at L2/L3 areas. I've been given excuse stay in also cause of the camp beds. However the camp MO said that he won't give me that excuse and asks me to bring my own bed in to sleep. Now, my situation is alot worse than before, im slightly losing control of my bladder system and according to my specialist, its not a good sign. I know with all my excuses like prolonged standing,sitting, RMJ, i'm in a better position than most combat fit personnels already, but I'm always in pain and the pain is sharper than before</p>
              <p>Hence, my question is, </p>
              <p>1) can i enforce my excuse stay in to the camp MO again?</p>
              <p>2)the only solution now is bring my own bed into camp?</p>

              <p>Bringing in your own bed is ridiculous. Based on your medical outcomes its apparent that you require a special kind of mattress which i believe is not that mobile to bring along. Besides you need to shift away the SAF beds and frames on your own (I doubt anyone would help you without someone in the authority with enough power to order things around). You can consult other MO again to endorse it.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately even though specialists advised you that you are to be excused staying in, the ultimate trigger puller is the MO. If he is kind enough he would help you with this, else anything happens to you SAF also will directly hunt down that specific MO that refused you the grant.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the help. I'm also referred to MMI for my physio sessions. Is it correct for me to tell them the situation also? Would they be able to help me?</p>

              <p>I believe the only one that can help you is your own specialist...</p>
              <p>many of the local specialist still hold military ranks and may even be some panel of expect for Mindef.. Speck to your own specialist, if your specialist dont think is so important and only a recomendation then nthg you can do... But if the specialist think is important, they can do wonders.. let me relate a story, a reservist story...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A fren of mine, had slip disc, from what i know is rather serious... His specialist recommended he be downgraded. He send his recommendation to the reservist unit MO for the down grading. He was call up for review, The MO told him, no down grade only excuse was given... being a reservist, he dont really bother, but during his next visit to his own specialist, the doc ask him about it... he just told the doc what the camp MO said... His specialist was so pissed off.. call the camp MO..</p>
              <p>He identify himself (the doc call right infront of my fren) as LTC xxxxx and ask him why the camp MO doubt his expertise, and inform him that he will be playing golf with Chief MO during the weekend and will discuss about his expertise level...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That same afternoon, the camp MO called my fren that he will be downgraded, and allow a few days for the proper documentation to be down...</p>
