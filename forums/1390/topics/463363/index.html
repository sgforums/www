            <div class='col-md body'><p>National Service Training System (NSTS)<br><br>How does this work?<br>The NS Training Cycle is a continuation of your active unit training cycle. As such, you are expected to still be able to apply your military skills and knowledge when you return for your In-Camp Training (ICT).<br><br>This is a 10-year NS Unit Training Cycle and each stage will last for 3 to 4 NS years. The NS Unit Training Cycle is divided into the following 3 stages:<br><br>    Stage 1: Strengthening Stage<br>    This stage focuses on individual and team proficiencies with the aim to maintain Ops Readiness. It is also termed as the ‘IHL years’ as many will be pursuing IHL studies.<br>    Stage 2: Sharpening Stage<br>    This stage focuses on unit proficiency culminating at each Unit’s ATEC evaluation, in which the entire unit will be evaluated on its war fighting capabilities.<br>    Stage 3: Sustain Stage<br>    In this final stage, it is to continually focus on Ops Readiness and integrated training. The milestone event will be to phase the NS Unit to Army Operational Reserves and the NSmen to MINDEF Reserves (MR). This is usually commemorated during a MR Parade/Ceremony in the presence of the NSmen’s families and employers.<br><br>During each ICT, your Unit Commander will stipulate a set of performance standards to be achieved. You are encouraged therefore, to train yourself up physically and be mentally prepared for the tough training.<br><br>Note that if you fail to meet the required performance standards, you will be subjected to corrective training. That is, your Unit Commander may decide to serve you additional NS call-up for Make-Up Training (MUT).<br><br>What are the Training Institutes?<br>For a more holistic and effective training management for the various arms, the NSmen’s training are now managed by the respective Training Institutes (TIs). You will then report back to your respective TI for your NS training during your ICT:<br><br>    Armour Training Institute (ATI)<br>    Army Logistics Training Institute (ALTI)<br>    Artillery Institute (AI)<br>    Commando Training Institute (CTI)<br>    Engineer Training Institute (ETI)<br>    Infantry Training Institute (ITI)<br>    Signal Institute (SI)<br><br>What happens after I completed my NS Training Cycle?<br>Once you have completed your NS training Cycle, you will be posted to the MINDEF Reserve (MR) List and be presented with a Certificate of Appreciation. You may also be given a watch upon the completion of your 10 years of ORNS or your ORNS training cycle, whichever is earlier.<br><br>While in MR, you may still be activated during operational exigencies. As an Officer, you remain liable for NS up to age 50 and 40, if you are an Army Warrant Officers and Specialist (WOSE). Note that you are to disregard your previous unit’s mobilisation codewords as you are no longer required to report for mobilisation activation for your previous units. A new codeword will be assigned to you accordingly should you be mobilised while you are in MR. If you are travelling overseas for 6 months or more, you are still required to apply for Exit Permit.<br><br>How can I be in contact?<br>You are encouraged to remain your contact with your NS Unit and buddies so that they can be your source of help should you require any queries pertaining to your ORNS matters.<br><br>Alternatively, you may refer to the followings:<br><br>    Through your Unit’s Chain of Command - rifleman contacts Section Commander/Platoon Sergeant &gt; Section Commander/Platoon Sergeant contacts Platoon Commander &gt; Platoon Commander contacts OC, OC contacts CO.<br>    Login to NS Portal (www.ns.sg) to access to your NS Unit’s webpage under MyUnit.<br>    Call 1800-3676767 (eNSNSNS) should you require further assistance to locate MyUnit or your NS Commanders.<br><br>In-Camp Training (ICT)<br><br>As a NSman, you may be called up for various NS activities, one of which is the In-Camp Training (ICT). Every ICT aims to strengthen you in a set of specific skill and there may be slight variations in the conduct of the ICT in different formations.<br><br>What is the nature of ICT Notification?<br>During the first 6 months after you completed full-time NS, you may be called up for NS activities not more than 4 hours.<br><br>Thereafter, every NS work year, you may be called up to a maximum of 40 days of Operationally Ready National Service (ORNS).<br><br>Or in the case where you are called up for more than 40 days in one work year, you are required to seek agreement with your employer for this extended service. Both you and your employer will then have to sign an undertaking to indicate acceptance of the arrangement.<br><br>The duration of your call-up may be as follows:<br><br>    Low Key (LK) Training and Make-Up Training (MUT)<br>    These refer to trainings that are between 2 to 6 days and you will be notified 3 months in advance.<br>    High Key (HK) Training<br>    These trainings are usually 7 days and longer and you will be notified 6 months in advance.<br>    Call-Up Activities<br>    These activities may last 1 day or less and you will be notified 2 months in advance.<br><br>    What are the types of Call-Up?<br>        In-Camp Training (ICT)<br>        Flexi-ICT/Multiple ICT (for Air Force NSmen or doctors)<br>        Upgrading Courses<br>        Mobilisation<br>        Medical Reviews<br>        Seminar/Workplan briefing<br>        Make-Up Training (MUT)<br>        Re-Training <br>        Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT)<br><br>How will I be notified of my training?<br>You are required to update your personal particulars in eSelf-Update on NS Portal (www.ns.sg). MyCall-Up (MCU) will broadcast your NS call-up notifications either through SMS or email to your provided personal details.<br><br>Your NS call-up notifications will be broadcasted over 2 consecutive days at 2115 hours. You are required to acknowledge the call-up on NS Portal (www.ns.sg) or by calling the 6-HINSMEN (6446 7636). Failing to do so after 10 days, a hard copy SAF100 will be sent to your official address via registered mail.<br><br>Upon receipt of the call-up, you have to inform your employer either via a printed copy or forwarding the soft copy of the eSAF100 on NS Portal (www.ns.sg) as official documentation as their reference.<br><br>Sample of the broadcast message:<br><br>You will receive advance notification before every ICT so as to minimise disruption and inconvenience to your work schedules and also allow your employer ample time to make necessary arrangements, if needed.<br><br>Note that if you do not attend your scheduled NS training without official leave, you will be tagged as being “Absent Without Official Leave” (AWOL) from your place of duty. Disciplinary action will be taken against you.<br><br>What happens if I am unable to attend ICT?<br>Every NSman’s role is vital for a cohesive training with other NSmen from your unit and it is therefore important that you refresh your skills to ensure smooth operation as a team.  As such, your absence from ICT will affect the training and operational readiness of your unit. While MINDEF exercises flexibility in granting deferment, every case will be carefully assessed and weigh against the impact on operational readiness.<br><br>Having assessed the genuineness and severity of the case submitted, considered the training requirements, your proficiency level, attendance records and past performances, the unit commanding officer may grant you a deferment.<br><br>What is a deferment and how do I apply?<br>Deferment refers to a postponement of a specific In-Camp Training (ICT).<br><br>You can login to MyDeferment in NS Portal (www.ns.sg) to apply online. You are responsible for your own deferment application and all supporting documents and information by your employers or other sources much be attached together with your application.<br><br>What are the considerations for deferment application?<br><br>    New employment or newly established business<br>    Marriage and Honeymoon<br>    Compassionate grounds (e.g. wife’s delivery, serious illness or death in the family)<br><br>To find out more about your upcoming NS training programme, you can visit MyUnit in the NS Portal (www.ns.sg).<br>Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT)<br><br>As frontline soldiers, it is essential that you maintain physical fitness and undergo regular training.<br><br>The Enhanced NS IPPT system was implemented on 1 Apr 2011. It incorporates principles of fitness training science to enable NSmen to train more effectively, while offering flexibility in planning their fitness training to stay fit. Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) is a standard physical fitness test to gauge the basic physical fitness of an individual. The IPPT is a standard physical fitness test designed to test the basic components of physical fitness and motor skills of an individual soldier. In this service package, NSmen can find out about policies governing IPPT and book their IPPT dates.<br><br>In the IPPT Gazette under the Enlistment Act dated 26 May 06, if an NSman fails to pass, or fails to take, the IPPT within any IPPT year, he will have to attend and complete a remedial training programme at any SAF FCC.<br>    <br>IPPT can be divided into the followings:<br><br>    ICT IPPT<br>    This is a requirement for all NSmen participation as part of the ICT programme, unless exempted due to medical reasons.<br>    Non-ICT IPPT<br>    This is conducted at various IPPT test centres and the NSman can make as many attempts at the Fitness Conditioning Centres (FCCs). Note that only the first 3 IPPT attempts will be considered towards the NSman’s NS liability and be paid service and make-up pay, if applicable.<br><br>SAF Health Screening Programme<br>With effect from 30 May 2011, “IPPT-FFI” was incorporated into the revised SAF Health Screening Programme, which is the compulsory medical examination for all IPPT-eligible NSmen 35 years of age and above. There is no need to do a separate "IPPT-FFI" if you have already completed the SAF Health Screening Programme for that year.The SAF Health Screening Programme review should be initiated by your NS unit administrator once your IPPT window, i.e. your birthday window is open.<br><br>If you are IPPT-eligible, 35 years of age and above, you are required to complete the SAF Health Screening Programme every year before your IPPT attempt. The aim of this medical screening is to detect any medical conditions which may make you unsuitable for the IPPT.Note that if you have not completed your SAF Health Screening Programme requirements for the year, you will not be allowed to take your IPPT. You will be issued with a certificate once you have completed your SAF Health Screening Programme requirements. The certificate is valid for 30 days until your next birthday; i.e. if you are 35 years old, this certificate will be valid until (and including) the 30th day after your 36th birthday.<br><br>Applicability<br>The annual IPPT is applicable to all PES A, B/B1, B2/C1 NSmen and DXO with NS liability, till age 45 and 40 years old for Officers and WOSPEC respectively. The NSman's IPPT annual requirement commences on his birthday immediately after his NSF Operational Ready Date (ORD) and ends when he is posted to MINDEF Reserves (MR), or medically downgraded to PES C2 and below.<br><br>What is the IPPT Window?<br><br>The NSman's IPPT window is based on his birthday. The IPPT window commences on his birthday and ends on the day before his next birthday, both days inclusive. NSman who has just ORDed can take his IPPT immediately. The results will be counted towards his IPPT requirements for the first NS year. The IPPT window is divided into two parts as follows:<br><br>    The first 9 months.<br>    Commences on the NSman's birthday and ends on the day before the 10th month of his birthday window. NSman must attempt at least 1 IPPT within this period.<br>    The last 3 months. Commences on the first day of the 10th month of NSman birthday window and ends on the day before his next birthday. RT must be completed within this period, and will be applied for the following cases:<br>        20 sessions of RT for IPPT failures and defaulters, and IPT defaulters who did not complete the 10-session IPT program.<br>        8 sessions of RT for those who completed the 10-session IPT/E1 PEP program but did not meet the PPT.<br><br>Test Frequency<br>NSmen must attempt at least ONE IPPT within their first 9 months of the IPPT window. They can make as many attempts as they want within their first 9 months of the IPPT window. Regardless of the number of attempts made at the FCC, only the first 3 attempts by the NSman will be considered towards his NS liability and will be paid service and make-up pay, if applicable. Notwithstanding this, the SAF will continue to bear the responsibility for service injuries sustained by the NSmen whilst attempting the IPPT beyond the third attempt. NSmen will not be allowed to make any more attempts within their annual IPPT window at the FCC after attaining the GOLD standard, regardless of the number of attempts.<br><br>IPPT Requirement<br>All eligible NSmen must attempt their IPPT once within the first 9 months of their IPPT window. They may attempt IPPT during their ICT or at any FCC and may make as many attempts as they want to improve their IPPT results, except for NSmen who have attained the IPPT Gold standards for the IPPT year. The best result achieved will be taken as the record for that IPPT year.<br><br>What are the IPPT exemptions?<br>You are exempted from your annual IPPT if you fit into the following conditions:<br><br>All IPPT-liable NSmen will only be exempted on the following conditions.<br><br>    Permanently downgraded to PES C2 and below.<br>    Have continuous medical exemption (from IPPT) for a period of 4 months or more during the first 9 months of the IPPT Birthday Window.<br>    Have accumulated medical exemption (from IPPT) for a period of 7 months or more during the first 9 months of the IPPT Birthday Window.<br>    NSmen who are disrupted from ORNS duties.<br><br>*The onus is on the NSmen to inform their NS units and present their medical documentation as evidence, when called back to answer to the IPPT related charges. Alternatively, they can request for a medical review by a SAF Medical Officer though his NS unit.<br><br>The annual IPPT is designed to test your basic components of physical fitness and motor skills. You will be tested on the followings:<br>Test Items     Fitness Component(s)<br><br>Sit-Up<br>    <br><br>Abdominal muscular strength and endurance<br><br>Standing Broad Jump<br>    <br><br>Lower limbs extensor muscular power<br><br>Chin-Up<br>    <br><br>Upper limbs muscular strength and endurance<br><br>4 x 10m Shuttle Run<br>    <br><br>General speed, agility and co-ordination<br><br>2.4km Run<br>    <br><br>Cardio-respiratory endurance and lower limbs muscular endurance<br><br>*Note that if you are entering Category Z1 for the 1st time on or after 01 April 2003, you will attempt the 3-Station IPPT, which comprises of: Chin-Up, Sit-Up and 2.4km Run.<br><br>#If you are already in Category Z1 before 01 April 2003, you will continue to be tested ONLY in the 2.4km Run.<br><br>What is the IPPT Scoring System?<br><br>The IPPT Standards and Scoring System is based on your age and vocation:<br><br>IPPT Standards For NSmen<br><br>The IPPT Pass Standards and Scoring System are based on the NSmen Age, Vocation and ORD.<br><br>i.    The IPPT age category is based on your birthday and you will remain in the same age category for the duration of your IPPT window. The IPPT age categories use a 5-year median as follows:<br>1.<br>    <br><br>Category X<br>    <br><br>24 years old and below<br>2.<br>    <br><br>Category Y<br>    <br><br>25 years old to 29 years old<br>3.     <br><br>Category Y1<br>    <br><br>30 years old to 34 years old<br>4.     <br><br>Category Z<br>    <br><br>35 years old to 39 years old<br>5.     <br><br>Category Z1<br>    <br><br>40 years old to 44 years old<br>6.     <br><br>Category Z2/V<br>    <br><br>45 years old to 49 years old<br><br>ii.    There are 4 IPPT vocation groupings:<br><br>    Commandos/ Naval Divers<br>    Guardsmen<br>    Combat<br>    Service<br><br>IPPT performance is based on a Scoring System, which award grades and points to the raw scores of each test station. You are required to obtain a minimum grade/point for each test station and accumulate a minimum total point for the complete test.<br><br>There are 2 sets of IPPT Standards:<br><br>    One for NSmen who ORD before 1 Apr 94.<br>    One for those who ORD on or after 1 Apr 94.<br><br>What if I fail one test station?<br><br>NSmen who achieve the required total number of points, but fail only one static station are considered Partial Failures. They will be allowed to make multiple attempts to pass the particular static station within 3 months of their IPPT window after the original test date. Should they fail to pass the particular static station within 3 months duration, they will have to retake the complete IPPT. NSmen attempting single-station retest will not be eligible for monetary awards unless they retake the complete test in one sitting.<br><br>What if I sustain an injury due to Service?<br>MINDEF will continue to bear the responsibility if you sustain an injury whilst attempting your non-ICT IPPT beyond your 3rd attempt. Be sure to pre-book your training programme and register before each training session starts. This is to ensure that your training records can be verified when filing for compensation claims.<br><br>Where can I take my IPPT?<br><br>Non-ICT IPPT Centres<br><br>Non-ICT IPPT is conducted at the following Fitness and Conditioning Centres (FCC) and SAFRA Gyms:<br><br>    Khatib Fitness and Conditioning Centre<br>    Maju Fitness and Conditioning Centre<br>    Bedok Fitness and Conditioning Centre<br>    Kranji Fitness and Conditioning Centre<br>    SAFRA Tampines<br>    SAFRA Jurong<br><br>Khatib, Maju, Bedok and Kranji FCC conduct 5 sessions per week.

On the day of your IPPT, you are required to report in PT kit (short sleeved T-Shirt, shorts and jogging shoes) and arrived at the stated registration time with your Identity Card or SAF11B.<br><br>(A)    SAFRA Gymnasium<br>As part of MINDEF’s continuous effort to provide you with greater accessibility, you can also take your IPPT at either  Jurong or Tampines SAFRA EnergyOne Gyms.<br><br>This option of IPPT in SAFRA gyms will only issue a “pass only” standard as it aims to complement the outdoor IPPT. Those who aspire to achieve monetary awards should continue to take their IPPT at FCCs or during their ICT.<br>The test protocol for the static stations remains unchanged at the SAFRA gyms. The 2.4km Run is conducted on the treadmill, which has been calibrated to negate any advantage from running on the treadmill. Note that this scheme is not applicable for Commandos and Divers.<br><br>The test in SAFRA gyms is available everyday except Mondays, Fridays and public holidays and will be alternated between the 2 clubs. If you are a SAFRA member, the usage of gym equipment and facilities will be free.

NSmen will be paid the incremental difference when they improve on their current standard. To illustrate, an NSman who was paid $100 after achieving the Incentive award, will be paid the difference of $100 if he is able to achieve a Silver Award in his next test.<br><br>Award<br>    <br><br>Monetary Incentive<br>    <br><br>IPPT Badge<br><br>Gold<br>    <br><br>$400<br>    <br><br>Gold IPPT Badge<br><br>Silver<br>    <br><br>$200<br>    <br><br>Silver IPPT Badge<br><br>Incentive<br>    <br><br>$100<br>    <br><br>No Badge<br><br>Since all IPPT, RT and IPT are regarded as SAF training activities, you will also be entitled to Service and Make-Up Pay.

The program build-up is customised to the fitness level of the NSmen, and provides more flexibility for them to schedule their training days.<br><br>Design<br>The enhanced IPT is a voluntary 10-session program with Personal Performance Target (PPT) in the first 9 months of NSmen IPPT birthday window. IPPT will be conducted during the 1st and 10th session of the IPT to determine and measure the standard and performance of the NSmen before and after the IPT program. The annual IPPT requirement will be fulfilled upon successful attainment of the required PPT during non-ICT/ICT IPPT sessions. NSmen whose BMI is 27 and above will, by default, be enrolled into the weight loss IPT program. The PPT will be raised automatically on a yearly basis to motivate NSmen to seek continuous fitness improvement. See Figure 1 for the enhanced IPT program.<br><br>Figure 1 : Summary of Enhanced IPT Program<br><br>Training Schedule<br><br>There is no fixed IPT schedule. NSmen are free to book the days for their training sessions as reflected at the NS Portal Booking System. However, for safety reasons, they must have a break of 1 day in-between training session. The IPT timings are as follows:<br><br>IPT Sessions<br>    <br><br>Time<br><br>Weekdays (everyday except Fri)<br>    <br><br>1900-2200<br><br>Weekend (Sat )<br>    <br><br>1630-1930<br><br>Determination of PPT<br><br>The PPT standard for the NSmen in a typical birthday window will be derived from the first IPPT test result conducted during the 1st session of the IPT. Test results from the 1st session will be compared with the previous year, and the results with the higher IPPT standard will be used. For NSmen who just transited to ORNS, the 1st session IPPT result in IPT will be used instead. The entry level of the lowest performing IPPT station will be used as the starting point to derive the target PPT standard for all stations. NSmen must achieve the next higher level by the 10th session (IPT IPPT) in order to be considered as having met their PPTs.

Any absentees from any IPT session will not be disciplinary dealt with.<br><br>Incentives<br><br>NSmen who passed their IPPT or able to met the PPT during IPT IPPT will be released immediately from the IPT and their result would be recorded as their annual requirement for the current IPPT window. They will also be eligible for IPPT Monetary Awards if they achieved the corresponding standards.<br><br>Exemption from RT upon Completing IPT<br><br>To qualify for this exemption, NSmen must achieve the required PPT during any non-ICT/ICT IPPT. If they failed to meet their PPT, they will attend 8 sessions of RT (for those that completed the 10-session IPT) or 20 sessions of RT (for those that did not complete the 10-session IPT).<br><br>Medical Review of NSmen<br><br>Specific medical certification of fitness for each IPT session is not necessary. However, NSmen who are 35 years old and above must be certified fit. NSmen who do not have valid certification of fitness for IPPT will not be allowed to proceed with the IPT sessions. NSmen certified unfit or temporarily unfit for IPPT will also be deemed unfit for IPT for the same duration.<br><br>How do I book for IPT?<br>You can book your IPT through NS Portal (www.ns.sg), during which you can also book your preferred IPT schedule and location of IPT and IPPT 1st (Categorisation Test) and 10th session together. Note that for safety reasons, you must allow at least a 1-day break in between your training sessions.<br><br>What is IPPT at 10th session for?<br> The IPPT test on the first IPT session is the categorisation test. NSmen are assessed on their Personal Performance Target (PPT) during this test in relation to their past year’s IPPT result, if any. The test on the 10th session evaluates the level of fitness achieved by the NSmen during the IPT program. NSmen who did not manage to clear their PPTs must do an additional 8 sessions of Remedial Training (RT) to prepare them for their next IPPT cycle.<br><br>NS Liability and Pay<br><br>Participation in IPT is strictly voluntary, thus NSmen will not be given service pay or make-up pay, and the attendance will not be counted towards the annual 40 days NS callup. The sessions are recognized for call-up/payment if they contribute towards the first 3 IPPT attempts. SAF will not bear the responsibility for any injuries sustained by the NSmen arising from the training. However, all IPT sessions attended will be recorded in the NSman Training History as a voluntary training activity so that the Nsman's participation in IPT is duly acknowledged.<br><br>SAFRA EnergyOne Physical Enhancement Programme (SAFRA E1 PEP)<br><br>SAFRA E1 Physical Enhancement Program is designed like the IPT program and all the policies governing IPT is applicable to E1 PEP. All E1 PEP sessions are conducted at SAFRA Gyms by SAFRA Gym trainers except for the IPPT which is conducted on the first and last sessions at the FCCs. Participants, however, need to subscribe to the training at a nominal fee ($180 for SAFRA Gym members, $200 for SAFRA members and $250 for the public).<br>Remedial Training (RT)<br><br>The enhanced NS IPPT system requires NSmen to pass their IPPT by the first 9 months of their birthday window so that early assistance in the form of RT can be provided. This allows the NSmen to maintain and sustain their level of fitness.<br><br>Design<br><br>RT training will be conducted for NSmen who (1) failed or defaulted their IPPT during the first 9 months of their birthday window and (2) for those who failed to meet the required PPT. RT must be completed during the last 3 months of their IPPT birthday window. See Figure 1 for illustration. There are two types of RT programs as shown.<br><br>    8 sessions of RT for those who completed the 10-session IPT/E1 PEP program but did not meet the PPT.<br>    20 sessions of RT for IPPT failures and defaulters, and IPT defaulters who did not complete the 10-session IPT/E1 PEP program.<br><br>Figure 1: Overview of RT Program<br><br>Applicability<br><br>All PES A, B/B1 and B2/C1 NSmen (below the age of 45 years for Officers and 40 years for WOSE) will be required to undergo RT during the last 3 months of their IPPT Birthday Window if they default/fail their IPPT or did not meet the PPT (for those who attended IPT).<br><br>When will I be exempted from RT?<br>You will be exempted from RT under the following circumstances:<br><br>    Permanently downgraded to PES C2 and below;<br>    On ROVERS/VOLUNTEERS scheme;c.    Have 4 months continuous or 7 months cumulative medical exemption  within the first 9 months of the IPPT birthday window.  Have achieved the annual IPPT requirement or IPT/E1 PEP PPT during the first 9 months of the IPPT birthday window.<br><br>When will I be released from RT?<br>You will be released from RT under the following conditions:<br><br>    Pass ICT-IPPT, any of the IPPT conducted during the RT program, or non-ICT IPPT.<br>    Complete the full duration of the RT program.<br>    Meet PPT for those who are attending the 8 sessions RT after completing the IPT/E1 PEP.<br><br>Attendance during RT<br><br>RT is an NS call-up activity and attendance for every RT session is compulsory. NSmen who are not able to complete their RT obligations in the last 3 months will be deemed as “RT defaulters” and will be called up by their NS Unit/CDMB for investigation, and those without valid reasons will be disciplinary dealt with.<br><br>RT Training Schedule<br><br>There is no fixed RT schedule. NSmen are free to book the days for their training sessions as reflected at the NS Portal Booking System. The RT timings are as follows:<br><br>IPT Sessions<br>    <br><br>Time<br><br>Weekdays (everyday except Fri)<br>    <br><br>1800 to 2200<br><br>Weekend (Sat)<br>    <br><br>1600 to 2000<br>Weekend (Sun)     0800 to 1200<br>1600 to 2000<br><br>NS Days<br><br>Each RT session will be computed as a ½ day service and will count towards the NSman's annual NS of 40 days. Attendance of ICT has priority over RT and only the balance of the call-up days will be used for RT call-ups.<br><br>Pay<br><br>NSmen will be paid ½ day service pay for each RT session attended. The respective FCC will submit the attendance list via IRIS, within 4 working days of the session, to NS Pay to process the payment. NS Pay will then effect the payment on a weekly basis.<br><br>Medical Review of NSmen<br><br>Specific medical certification of fitness for each RT session is not necessary. However, NSmen who are 35 years old and above must be certified fit. NSmen who do not have valid certification of fitness for IPPT will not be allowed to proceed with the RT sessions. NSmen certified unfit or temporarily unfit for IPPT will also be deemed unfit for RT for the same duration.<br><br>RT Sessions spreading across 2 birthday windows<br>In special circumstances where the NSmen’s RT schedule crosses IPPT windows (i.e. the NSmen's birthday fall in the middle of the RT), re-certification of fitness for IPPT for the new IPPT window is required if the NSmen turns age 35 or above in the new window.<br><br>What are the disciplinary actions?<br>For our common understanding, the meanings of the names are defined as follows:<br><br>i.    IPPT Defaulters<br>These are NSmen who have failed to make any attempt in IPPT throughout the 9 mth IPPT window and did not qualify for any exemptions.<br><br>ii.    RT Defaulters<br>These are NSmen who have failed to complete 20 sessions of RT within the last 3 months of their birthday window.<br>Disciplinary actions will be taken against the defaulters.<br><br>(A)    Graduated Scale of Punishment<br>The appropriate punishment on a graduated scale will be meted out by the Disciplinary Officers (DOs) depending on the NSman’s mitigating pleas, attitude, service records, previous convictions and performance for past IPPTs/RTs.<br><br>For recalcitrant defaulters, it may mean heftier fines, custodial sentences or court martial.  In the event if the NSman is unable to pay the fine, the DO may order detention in default of payment within reasonable time based on prevailing guidelines. The detention may take effect on any date and shall be terminated on payment of fine.<br><br>(B)    Central Defaulters Management Branch (CDMB)<br>CDMB was set up as a tri-service shared services structure within the NSmen Services Centre (NSSC) to manage all IPPT/RT defaulter offenders on behalf of their parent NS units. The NS Commanders maintain the prerogative to summary trial the NSmen if they wish to do so. Under such circumstances, CDMB will provide the use of its premises and facilities to conduct the Summary Trial.<br>MINDEF Notification Centre (MNC)<br><br>In order to maintain operational readiness, it is necessary for MINDEF to regulate NSmen’s overseas travel. As such, it is important that you keep MINDEF informed of your whereabouts by being contactable while you are travel overseas to facilitate recall in times of emergency.<br><br>If you are travelling on overseas trips of more than 24 hours and less than 6 months, you need to notify MINDEF via the MNC.<br><br>MNC was set up in November 1992 to bring forth more convenience and accessibility for NSmen to notify MINDEF when they are travelling on overseas trips.<br><br>MNC operates 24 hours and 7 days a week, including public holidays.
