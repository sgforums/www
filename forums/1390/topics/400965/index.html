              <p>I think the answer is NO. This is actually known as the "scholarship trap". </p>
              <p>Because the vocation he sign on is only a technician, SAF does not need Uni level technician. So "usually" they will NOT allow the boys to disrupt to go Uni. SAF need the manpower they want through scholarship and other means. It care less about your individual needs. </p>

              <p>Nowadays and in the past, any tom, dick or harry can get into NUS. This is why diploma students find it way easier to get in now. They are opening up more places in the three local dumps and taking in almost anyone who applies. The number of places in the three local dumps add up together is a smaller number than the total number of A level and IB students. With the top 5% of A level/IB students creamed off overseas to top universities on scholarships, and another 20% of children of rich in JC and poly who only go overseas to study because its a lifestyle for them and they can well afford to, there is plenty of room left for non A level/IB students.</p>
              <p>Supply larger than demand. What a joke.</p>
