            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, newbie here.<br><br>I have also just reached 40 and given my demob papers. In another sense, I was also lucky, as I disrupted from reservist in 1995 and have been working overseas since.<br><br>My reservist ICT frequency was bad... I faced 3 ICTs (average) per calendar year, plus the odd mobex or so. An example of how frequent I got called in is the fact that after about 3 -4 years of ICT, I received my Good Service Medal !!! Others in my unit, including my signaller received on the same occasion, the other one (the red one signifying 10 yrs of service !!!).<br><br>Anyway, had great memories of NS days and reservists ICT (the camaraderie, even among fellow NCOs and our officers and the men). In fact, during reservists, the junior officers (LTAs and CPTs) and NCOs (2SGs, 3 SGs)  had a lot in common, and we were often booking out together for makans and shopping etc.<br><br></div>
