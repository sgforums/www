            <div class='col-md body'>ANyone read this letter published in the straits times by someone who was called for his first ICT at 36 yrs old, just 4 yrs shy of ROD<br><br>NSman called up for first ICT at age 36<br><br>The Straits Times<br>Sep 6, 2006<br><br>I WAS surprised to receive notice recently of my first In-Camp Training (ICT) at the age of 36.<br><br>How could Mindef expect NSmen to complete the full cycle of their ICT if they start only at 36? Does it mean that NSmen have to go for longer and more frequent ICTs each year in order to do so?<br><br>As most NSmen of this age are at the peak of their careers and many are in senior-management positions, going for ICT would definitely affect business operations.<br><br>More importantly, most of these NSmen would have families with young children. They have to manage both busy work schedules and taking care of the family.<br><br>I have appealed for deferment after the first request was rejected. Until today, I have not heard from Mindef despite numerous calls to the National Servicemen Services Centre (NSSC). I was told by the NSSC staff that they could not transfer my call to the person in-charge, nor could the person in-charge call me or my employer.<br><br>I didn't even know which was my unit until I called the NSSC to find out, and even then the staff do not have the contact number of the unit.<br><br>Tan Thiam Huat<br><br>Okay the point is not that he should not complain at all, after all without any special reasons all have to serve reservist.<br><br>I am just curious how come Mindef waited so long and decided to call him up for reservist. I am sure he has not been called to do any ippt at all which means that he is most likely not very fit at all since he is not pressured to go for IPPT like active NSmen. The thing that i can sympathize with him is he is not mentally prepared at all, therefore you can see what his grievances are.<br><br>Can anyone explain why some people are not even called up for reservist at all? Was this some cockup by some personnel or maybe the computer? I am very curious epscially when it comes to reservist some ppl kenna alot of shit but some of them just get away with it. Of course the fault also lies with mr Tan who instead of being mentally prepared or taking some initiative to find if he has reservist liablities or find some official way to siam he just played russian rolette and assumed mindef forgot about him, well he lost and mindef calls him back at a time when he is at his career peak, mentally unprepared and most likely physically unfit.<br><br>ANyone in here knows why mindef sometimes leave out some ppl? How are the people selected to go for ICT and which units are they selected to be posted to?</div>
