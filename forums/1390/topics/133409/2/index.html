All the more so when what you post are snide remarks.<br><br>I've observed these sort of posts coming from you in numerous other threads, and even when you do have information to contribute to the discussion, it seems you still can't help putting down other people's comments at the same time.<br><br>So what if you have more experience?<br>So what if you think you've "been there, done that" - as you obviously do.<br><br>This is a public forum, and as long as people post with the intention of contributing to the discussion, I don't see a need to put them down. If they are wrong, at most you can say so tactfully.<br><br>Other posters have not made an issue of this, perhaps in deference to your apparent seniority, age-wise and experience-wise. I've kept my peace for quite a long time too, but I feel this has to be said. Age or experience has no bearing on a public forum - there is no reason your age or experience should automatically mean your opinions should be accorded greater weight.<br><br>Take for example the thread discussing payscales for CDO vocationalists a month or two back. Despite your never being a commando - correct me if I'm wrong - and your only source of information being a friend who had served in the 90s, IIRC. I had first-hand knowledge, yet you insisted on arguing and making remarks such as "are you sure you're a CDO and not a driver in CDO camp" and "then go ask your S1 why you aren't paid $x" and so on. Then when i posted proof in the form of my electronic payslip from MIW you went all quiet on that thread. Does such behaviour warrant respect and deference?<br><br>I didn't post this with the intention of starting a flame war with you and i've made an effort to try to remain objective. I do hope you can answer me in a similar manner.</div>
