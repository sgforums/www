            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously.... your pre-enlistment history has very little bearing on your posting post-bmt.<br><br>How your education background will affect is most probably impressing your superiors in BMT and hopefully they think highly of you... and thus recommending you to OCS.<br><br>Really no offence, but there are simply too many degree holders (honours or not) nowadays. If you are talking about 80s and early 90s, your degree as an NSF may help... but now people have differing perceptions due to the commonality.<br><br>Trust me. I'm a degree holder (double major FYI with a high GPA), i'm an NSF.... i'm not an officer.... and best... i'm in BMTC. So i know how things work around here.<br><br>As for getting 9-5 posting (which does not exist, you mean 0730 to 1730?), it's really luck....   your domestic circumstances may help if you appeal to your superiors and show you are under extenuating conditions.
