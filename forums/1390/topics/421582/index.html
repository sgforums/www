              <p>The first 4 weeks on Tekong will be quite rushed because they have to squeeze the original 7 weeks' worth of programmes into 4 weeks (or 3 1/2). Expect to have little to no admin time, depending on your commanders. The training itself is a cakewalk, so not to worry. With your L9 status the already-easy 2D1N field camp will be trivialised, since you are supposed to return to the company line to sleep according to directives (as an L9 recruit I still slept out in the field with no problems though).</p>
              <p>The next 5 weeks will see your Tekong company being split up and posted to STC (Supply and Transport Centre) at Sembawang Camp, AFTC (Air Force Training Centre), or OETI (Ordnance Engineering Training Institute). This phase of your BMT will see a drastic drop in intensity.</p>

              <p>The first 4 weeks on Tekong will be quite rushed because they have to squeeze the original 7 weeks' worth of programmes into 4 weeks (or 3 1/2). Expect to have little to no admin time, depending on your commanders. The training itself is a cakewalk, so not to worry. With your L9 status the already-easy 2D1N field camp will be trivialised, since you are supposed to return to the company line to sleep according to directives (as an L9 recruit I still slept out in the field with no problems though).</p>
              <p>The next 5 weeks will see your Tekong company being split up and posted to STC (Supply and Transport Centre) at Sembawang Camp, AFTC (Air Force Training Centre), or OETI (Ordnance Engineering Training Institute). This phase of your BMT will see a drastic drop in intensity.</p>

              <p>C9L9 and E are essentially the same in my eyes, although the latter wears the No. 3 uniform instead of No. 4, is much less likely to be called up for reservist, and has an even simpler BMT.</p>
              <p>My company went by left when it came to field camp and L9 personnel, not by right.</p>
