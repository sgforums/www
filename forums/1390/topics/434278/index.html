              <p>Armour tech is a lobo vocation. You just need to "repair" the vehicles. You dont need to road march, no need to carry rifles and field pack.. not a rileman.</p>
              <p>How can you have back injury for so long!? I dont see your problem at all.</p>
              <p>If the person is a Pes C9L9, it is up to him to point out to ns.sg. And up to his CO to decide his deployablitiy. In his case, if he is the repairmen, he still can go outfield but stay at HQbase. He can drive to scene when the vehicles is out or he can stay at HQ and repair the vehicles.</p>
