            <div class='col-md body'><br>www.straitstimes.com --&gt; Latest News has pix<br><br>Oct 24, 2007<br>Training instructor's death: NSmen respond to online appeal<br><br>CITIZEN soldiers have rallied to support the family of an army Physical Training Instructor (PTI) who died in an accident last Saturday, minutes away from his home.<br><br>Second Sergeant Lim Chee Wee, 23, did not have insurance coverage.<br><br>An appeal on Internet discussion groups quickly raised more than $1,300 for his family.<br><br>This does not include donations from a steady stream of Operationally Ready National Servicemen who turned up at 2nd Sgt Lim's wake at Jurong West, even though many of them did not know him personally.<br><br>One fund manager could not attend the wake personally but sent his driver with an undisclosed contribution.<br><br>Mr Donald Quek, 22, got the appeal going after he learnt during a Remedial Training session on Sunday that the army regular had died. RT sessions are physical training sessions conducted by the army for unfit soldiers.<br><br>'When I learnt that he had died without insurance and that his family is not well-off, I felt his family would need more help,'' said Mr Quek, an insurance agent.<br><br>Money continued to stream in on Wednesday even as his grief-stricken father, a bus driver, mother, a factory worker mother and 22-year-old brother bade him farewell in an emotionally-charged funeral at the void deck of the Lim's five-room HDB flat in Jurong West.<br><br>There was barely a dry eye among the scores of 2nd Sgt Lim's army mates who turned up for his funeral too.<br><br>Well-built and with a ready smile, the PTI had led RT sessions for hundreds of NSmen at Maju Camp, off Clementi Road.<br><br>NSmen and netizens who responded to the online appeal remember 2nd Sgt Lim's quiet professionalism as he coaxed out-of-shape NSmen back on the road to physical fitness.<br><br>He always had kind and encouraging words for slow runners and taught NSmen strength-building techniques so they could clock better run times during their army physical tests.<br><br>First Warrant Officer Lem Yew Teck, Officer Commanding of Maju Fitness &amp; Conditioning Centre, said: 'I hear that NSmen especially liked him alot because he was willing to go the extra mile and see them through their training programme.'<br><br>2nd Sgt Lim's patience in arranging alternative physical training sessions for NSmen who missed their compulsory 4-hr sessions meant more work for himself.<br><br>Uncomplainingly, he ploughed through mounds of extra paperwork, slogging at his computer to complete documentation that had to be individually approved.<br><br>His extra effort to reschedule NSmen's training saved many of them from being charged by the army for missing their RT sessions.<br><br>His superiors were so impressed with the young PTI's knack for motivating soldiers and his people-management skills that they hand-picked him to be a sports trainer for top officers such as Chief of Defence Force Lieutenant-General Desmond Kuek and Chief of Army Major-General Neo Kian Hong.<br><br>Last Saturday morning, 2nd Sgt Lim was on his way from Jurong West to Kallang for a physical training class. He never made it. At about 7.45am, his scooter collided with another motorbike along the Pan-Island Exrpressway near Jurong West.<br><br>The other rider fell towards the road verge but 2nd Sgt Lim fell on the road and was run over by a lorry. He was rushed unconscious to National University Hospital, and was pronounced dead at about 8.50am.<br><br>Police are investigating the incident.<br><br>Fellow soldiers remember 2nd Sgt Lim as a careful rider who left his Vespa Scooter in the carpark whenever the roads were wet.<br><br>First Warrant Officer Lem added: 'He had a very upright character and was a well-disciplined soldier.'<br><br>'To me he had all the good points a commander would want in his men: he was hardworking, reliable, dependable and able to get on well with his colleagues. We will miss him.'<br><br>- ENDS -</div>

Those whose Mandarin is more power please help refine the draft.<br><br>THURSDAY, OCT 25, 2007<br><br>SHIN MIN DAILY NEWS<br><br>The father of PTI Lim Chee Wee, believed to be devastated by his son's death, terrorised a stall at a wet market for more than 40 minutes this morning.<br><br>According to Mr Chen (Note: hanyu pinyin, no full name given), 60, a helper at a newspaper stall at the market (Blk 505, Jurong West St 51), Mr Lim Jincheng (Note: hanyu pinyin), 54, bus driver, had gone to the market to look for the news vendor.<br><br>When Mr Chen told him that his boss was not around, Mr Lim went berserk and swept the newspapers at the stall onto the floor. He also tried to flip a table at the stall, said Mr Chen.<br><br>Mr Chen was injured when he tried to hold down the wooden table, sustaining scratches on his right arm.<br><br>"I asked him, what do you want. I still have to do business," recalled Mr Chen. He thought that there was perhaps misunderstanding between Mr Lim and his boss.<br><br>Mr Lim did not utter a word and went on to flip another table at the newspaper stall, scattering coins everywhere.<br><br>Mr Chen added that Mr Lim also broke four coffee cups.<br><br>Then, Mr Lim walked towards a fishball stall. The stall owner, who had witnessed the earlier commotion at the newspaper stall, rushed forward with her son to stop him from going near her fishball stall.<br><br>About 100 people watched as the saga unfolded, but nobody dared make a move to stop Mr Lim.<br><br>The fishball stallholder, Madam She (Note: hanyu pinyin, no full name given), said that she did not blame Mr Lim for his actions, as he might have been traumatised by his son's death.<br><br>A dishwasher at the market, Mr Luo Chenfa (Note: hanyu pinyin), 68, told reporters that he had heard Mr Lim say in Teochew "I don't know what I'm doing" several times.<br><br>Mr Lim was arrested by two policemen who arrived at the market. The police did not handcuff him but had to do so when he struggled before getting into the patrol car.<br><br>Mr Lim's wife told reporters later that her husband did not go with her to collect their son's ashes this morning.<br><br>She said that her husband was behaving a little odd the night before. He also did not sleep the whole night and he kept crying.<br><br>"I had just returned with the ashes when the police informed me that my husband was arrested," she said.<br><br>end<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm very surprised by the gratitude shown by the NSmen who have been taught by him in Maju FCC. I may not know him well but as a fellow PTI of his, i certainly missed him a lot. He once chatted with him about vespa stuffs because i'm also riding vespa. A very nice guy with great personality. One of the bright prospect in the PTI family. Have attended his wake and also the sending off, it was a sad atmosphere where everybody cries. Hopefully he will "Endure and Excel" up there and bless us. My vespa friend, RIP.</div>

He did not have personal insurance coverage.<br><br>Second Sgt Lim leaves behind his father, a bus driver, mother, a factory worker and 22-year-old brother who is a university undergraduate. The Lim's family home is a five-room flat in Jurong West.<br><br>Mr Donald Quek, 22, an insurance agent and financial consultant, got the Net appeal going after he found out about 2nd Sgt Lim's death at a Remedial Training (RT) session on Sunday.<br><br>Fitness specialists, commonly referred to as Physical Training Instructors (PTI), conduct RT sessions for NSmen who did not pass the Singapore Armed Forces Individual Physical Proficiency Test or IPPT.<br><br>"I didn't expect contributions to exceed $1,000,'' said Mr Quek."I remember on Sunday evening, I told one of the fellow forum members that my target was $1,000, he asked if that's possible.''<br><br>On top of the $1,700 raised, the Lims have also received help from the steady stream of Operationally Ready National Servicemen who turned up at 2nd Sgt Lim's five-day wake at Jurong West, even though many of them did not know him personally. Second Sgt Lim's funeral was held on Wednesday afternoon.<br><br>The Lims said they are touched by the outpouring of help and thanked the dozens of NSmen and strangers who have helped them tide over their difficult period.<br><br>Second Sgt Lim is a familiar face to some NSmen because he led RT sessions for hundreds of them at Maju Camp, off Clementi Road. Soldiers trained by the 23-year-old described him as a popular instructor who was professional, yet friendly and approachable.<br><br>"I have taken RT under him before and he is a very nice PTI, friendly guy to chat with. I think around August, he was PTI of the month (similar to employee of the month). Gosh, I didn't think something like that would happen,'' said a posting on www.sgforums.com.<br><br>The Straits Times understands that 2nd Sgt Lim was named Maju Fitness &amp; Conditioning Centre "Best Staff" in June and July this year, and earned the Army Fitness Centre's "Best Staff" award in August.<br><br>Mr Quek, an NSman who ended up doing RT because he did not train for his IPPT, said the PTI always had kind and encouraging words for slow runners. Second Sgt Lim also taught NSmen strength-building techniques so they could clock better run times during their army physical tests.<br><br>First Warrant Officer Lem Yew Teck, Officer Commanding of Maju Fitness &amp; Conditioning Centre, said: 'I hear that NSmen especially liked him alot because he was willing to go the extra mile and see them through their training programme.'<br><br>NSmen and netizens who responded to the online appeal remember 2nd Sgt Lim's quiet professionalism as he coaxed out-of-shape NSmen back on the road to physical fitness. Some NSmen were fit and aced their 2.4km run, but were tripped up on test items like chin ups or the standing broad jump.<br><br>Singled out for praise by netizens was 2nd Sgt Lim's patience in arranging alternative physical training sessions for NSmen who missed their compulsory 4-hr sessions, even though this meant more work for himself.<br><br>Uncomplainingly, he ploughed through mounds of extra paperwork, slogging at his computer to complete documentation that had to be individually approved.<br><br>His extra effort to reschedule NSmen's training saved many of them from being charged by the army for missing their RT sessions.<br><br>His superiors were so impressed with the young PTI's knack for motivating soldiers and his people-management skills that they hand-picked him to be a fitness specialist for top officers such as Chief of Defence Force Lieutenant-General Desmond Kuek and Chief of Army Major-General Neo Kian Hong.<br><br>Last Saturday morning, 2nd Sgt Lim was on his way from Jurong West to Kallang for a physical training class. He never made it. At about 7.45am, his Vespa scooter collided with another motorbike along the Pan-Island Expressway near Jurong West.<br><br>The other rider fell towards the road verge but 2nd Sgt Lim tumbled onto the road and was run over by a lorry driven by a Chinese man in his 30s. The motorbike rider and the lorry driver were unhurt in the incident.<br><br>An ambulance rushed the unconscious Second Sgt Lim to National University Hospital, and was pronounced dead at about 8.50am.<br><br>Police are investigating the incident and are appealing for witnesses.<br><br>- ENDS -<br><br></div>
