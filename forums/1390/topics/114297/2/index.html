            <div class='col-md body'>You have to consider the future implications after NS too.<br><br>Kenging for 302, bashing oneself to get PES C/E for just 2 years, is it worth it? I mean you got what? 70, 80 years of road ahead of you.<br><br>It is just not worth risking the consequences for the rest of the life to siam 2 years of NS.<br><br>Have you also thought of what happen if you try to keng and it fails? You will be court martial and sent to DB (Detention Barracks=Army's Jail). And the period in DB is NOT COUNTED as period in National Service. i.e. 2 years DB ontop of 2 years NS= 4 years in SAF. You try to siam NS for 2 years, end up staying in there for 4 years or maybe longer.<br><br>Dude, you got to wake up sia.<br><br></div>
