I used to do admin orderlies duties.. they are like 6-7 a month and I always do them.. I don't go n report sick and get my friends to do for me... but just because I am holding some rank, they promoted me to guard 2 regardless of my excuses.. it not like I want the rank.... and I don't pushed work to others.. others pushed their work to me... and I always do them... because I don't want to be held responsible for work that is not complete.. does not mean I hate NS means that I don't do my work... you all are not in my camp, you have no rights to say I don't do my fair share of work.. when I want to downgrade, it is just because I don't want to take IPPT, don't want to go for range, chemical defence, morning runs and no reservist.... but I do my fair share of work.. in fact more work... Regulars r f up.. what can I do when in the army.. rank is everything... I am utterly sick by the way ARMY works... felt drained everytime... you guys can love the ARMY but you all have no rights to say we gu niangs when u havent see how we work in real life.......<br>I completed my fair share of work.. not with pride but just feel responsible that I must complete it...... but many times, I asked myself why I am doing all these.... no point at all... complete waste of my time...
