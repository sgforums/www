            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ponders:</div><div class="quote_body">Hey look, i am just asking. I don't need you guys to come back with sarcastic or aggresive replies.<br><br>My point is, as an NSF, it is our duty to serve it and yes i do understand there are sacrifices to be made... but the point i am trying to drive is, if there are no guidelines in place to state our book in book out timing, one fine day we can just enlist and see our home 2 years later.<br><br>For some of you who think i am just grumpy, book-out minded guy... i am not... it's just that i have recently moved unit and practices are way different. Our off-in-lieu (and i meant OIL not OFFs) are not compensated and we have irresponsible superiors who simply make us book in for an early briefing on Sunday. When asked why the briefing can;t be done earlier before book out, usually their reply is...... we just finished doing the AI.<br><br>One of you mentioned there are no GOM inplace for off, in fact there is one existent. It states the difference between, Offs, OIL, Offs as rewards, offs in compassionate grounds.<br><br>And if sstaying in meant we can be activated at any point of time, i do not think a non-op unit will make a  difference.<br><br>Most importantly, i am just trying to have an open discussion rather than have you people shooting me back with sarcasm.<br><br>And to the person who said i should lead by example, yes i do draw the line between commanders and men. and commanders should have a certain privileges to set them apart as an incentive. and if you go by this logic, insist your CO, RSM, CSMs to stay in as well.</div></blockquote>hm.. i think you mean to point out a perceived irregularity, but ended up sounding complainy. if im not mistaken, you think that if the current perceived unfair practise in your unit can be taken to the extreme if regulations are not in place.<br><br>i cant say i know the regulations regarding this well. but im sure it is somewhere.<br><br>taken logically, staying in is supposed to ensure that the soldiers have sufficient rest every night. however, married personnel's family life is duely recognised by allowing them to stay out.<br><br>booking in and out timings, however, are really a matter of the management. from your current point of view, you think the timings are ludicrous. but do remember you are not the only one who has to abide by those timings. i agree with you that if the rationale for booking in and out timings are warped, then they should be changed for the better.<br><br>if you fear that the practise could be taken to extreme without proper regulations, again, im sure there are these regulations. even if there isnt, i cant imagine any regular serviceman (of which the management of a unit would be consisted, and this order can only be made at the CO level) would want to kill his career by depriving his unit of booking out without any good reason.<br><br>as for privileges and incentives, i think already, officers (commissioned or not) and even specialists are enjoying different levels of privileges - things that may be taken for granted and hence not recognised as such. but these privileges are never meant to be incentives to attract people to become specialists and officers - that would be putting the cart before the horse. so if one day these privileges are withdrawn then what will happen?<br><br></div>

I AM NOT COMPLAINING!!!<br><br>I am just saying, there is something wrong in the system.

Policy change.<br><br>Want to "act" infront of tua liap, satay their backsai, su ka su ka change this change that. Bend the policy inside out.<br><br>Last time my RSM, nice guy, everyday got nights out.
