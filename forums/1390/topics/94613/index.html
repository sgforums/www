            <div class='col-md body'>So much out of the loop? Better be circumspect on what to reveal to you, in case you're a foreigner. A lot of your questions would've been clarified when you register for enlistment or undergo the CMPB checkup.<br><br>1. Immediate after poly, do i go into NS??<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes.<br><br>2. What if i get a offer to a overseas scholarship?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; In your case, you can only defer if you can commence a new educational course (local U, private school, overseas studies) before you turn 18. The common understanding is that the SAF wants you to do your BMT, leadership course &amp;/or vocational training as young as possible. You can subsequently disrupt your NS, not sure about the appropriate timing but in my time you should've already served 2 years prior.<br><br>3. Do i get a break like say 6 months before enlisting to build up on my physical powers or what??(now a few years no P.E my body is weaker then before &gt;.&lt; even though im in NCC..)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The call-up will be very prompt. The traditional format was quite systematic - 4 Tekong intakes a year; June &amp; September serving the "Poly" batches while December &amp; March the "A Level" one - &amp; hence a 3-month slack is theoretically possible then. Nowadays you've got 5-month BMT's alongside the regular-scheduled versions. I hear the former is very gradual-incremental in its training, so if you can tolerate the regimentation it's probably more effective than any last-minute private exercising.<br><br>4. How much time will i be required to spend on NS?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; They're gonna make 2 years the standard stint.<br><br>5. Can i request for a higher allowance in NS?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; No.<br><br>6. What are the daily routine do we go through?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Reveille, breakfast, draw-arms, area-cleaning, standy-by-area, 1st-parade, training timetable, teabreak, training timetable, lunch, mid-day parade, training timetable, teabreak, training timetable, send-arms, dinner, last-parade, book-out &amp; book-in by 2359. If there's night training, supper will be indented.<br><br>7. Do we stay bald for 2 years or 3 months?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; For BMT only. But still crewcut-short when on-course (inc. at OCS &amp; SISPEC).<br><br>8. If we immigrate to other country, need to do re-service??<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Depends on whether you've surrendered citzenship.<br><br>9. Will i get deployed into combat if i got asthma?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Combat fit - yes (as in no Pes D to F). Combat vocation - maybe not; depends on severity. Overall, likely Pes B, as long as the condition is controllable.<br><br>10. Will i be called up for reservist if i go for a full time course?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes. The ICTs will be timed during the off-semester vacations, if you're with a so-called "IHL unit".<br><br>11. How long of re-service each year? Will i be compensated with allowance?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Up to 40 days a year. Note that the SAF workyear starts from April, meaning you could technically serve 2 ICTs in a calendar year. ICTs are categorized into "high key" &amp; "low key" stints. You can claim make-up pay.<br><br>12. Which one of the army classified "PES" is the safest? least injuries and casualties during training? Which one is the most dangerous?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Irrelevant.<br><br>13. Do we get to train using paintballs?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; No. This ain't NCC, bro.<br><br>14. What kind of facilities are provided at Tekong?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; A hundred times better than what I went through, with the old ITD Camp 1 &amp; 3.<br><br>15. (im currently got fire a few times live round with M-16 and get a marksmanship badge)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; You need to score a lot more hits.<br><br>16. How much lesser do i pay in tax liabilities?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Details are available at MINDEF website.<br><br>17. I live pretty far from tekong....do they provide transport to and fro or what?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Only from Tekong to Changi Coast.<br><br>18. Do all new NS recruits compulsory must go tekong?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; No. Recruits also report to mono-intakes, SCDF &amp; the Police Force.<br><br>19. if during real war that time..Will there be a special army vehicle that pick us up..or do we take bus or mrt or taxi to reach the camp?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Trade secret.<br><br>20. I heard they they will check private parts during NS... (Can i ask them not to check private parts during NS? im a shy guy..)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; They'll stick a finger into your arsehole if you report sick with diarrhoea too often - fact! Army medical centres were also the only places I saw pictorial displays of sexually-transmitted diseases upfront. Quite gross.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Moxie:</div><div class="quote_body">So much out of the loop? Better be circumspect on what to reveal to you, in case you're a foreigner. A lot of your questions would've been clarified when you register for enlistment or undergo the CMPB checkup.<br><br>1. Immediate after poly, do i go into NS??<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes.<br><br>2. What if i get a offer to a overseas scholarship?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; In your case, you can only defer if you can commence a new educational course (local U, private school, overseas studies) before you turn 18. The common understanding is that the SAF wants you to do your BMT, leadership course &amp;/or vocational training as young as possible. You can subsequently disrupt your NS, not sure about the appropriate timing but in my time you should've already served 2 years prior.<br><br>3. Do i get a break like say 6 months before enlisting to build up on my physical powers or what??(now a few years no P.E my body is weaker then before &gt;.&lt; even though im in NCC..)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The call-up will be very prompt. The traditional format was quite systematic - 4 Tekong intakes a year; June &amp; September serving the "Poly" batches while December &amp; March the "A Level" one - &amp; hence a 3-month slack is theoretically possible then. Nowadays you've got 5-month BMT's alongside the regular-scheduled versions. I hear the former is very gradual-incremental in its training, so if you can tolerate the regimentation it's probably more effective than any last-minute private exercising.<br><br>4. How much time will i be required to spend on NS?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; They're gonna make 2 years the standard stint.<br><br>5. Can i request for a higher allowance in NS?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; No.<br><br>6. What are the daily routine do we go through?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Reveille, breakfast, draw-arms, area-cleaning, standy-by-area, 1st-parade, training timetable, teabreak, training timetable, lunch, mid-day parade, training timetable, teabreak, training timetable, send-arms, dinner, last-parade, book-out &amp; book-in by 2359. If there's night training, supper will be indented.<br><br>7. Do we stay bald for 2 years or 3 months?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; For BMT only. But still crewcut-short when on-course (inc. at OCS &amp; SISPEC).<br><br>8. If we immigrate to other country, need to do re-service??<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Depends on whether you've surrendered citzenship.<br><br>9. Will i get deployed into combat if i got asthma?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Combat fit - yes (as in no Pes D to F). Combat vocation - maybe not; depends on severity. Overall, likely Pes B, as long as the condition is controllable.<br><br>10. Will i be called up for reservist if i go for a full time course?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes. The ICTs will be timed during the off-semester vacations, if you're with a so-called "IHL unit".<br><br>11. How long of re-service each year? Will i be compensated with allowance?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Up to 40 days a year. Note that the SAF workyear starts from April, meaning you could technically serve 2 ICTs in a calendar year. ICTs are categorized into "high key" &amp; "low key" stints. You can claim make-up pay.<br><br>12. Which one of the army classified "PES" is the safest? least injuries and casualties during training? Which one is the most dangerous?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Irrelevant.<br><br>13. Do we get to train using paintballs?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; No. This ain't NCC, bro.<br><br>14. What kind of facilities are provided at Tekong?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; A hundred times better than what I went through, with the old ITD Camp 1 &amp; 3.<br><br>15. (im currently got fire a few times live round with M-16 and get a marksmanship badge)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; You need to score a lot more hits.<br><br>16. How much lesser do i pay in tax liabilities?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Details are available at MINDEF website.<br><br>17. I live pretty far from tekong....do they provide transport to and fro or what?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Only from Tekong to Changi Coast.<br><br>18. Do all new NS recruits compulsory must go tekong?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; No. Recruits also report to mono-intakes, SCDF &amp; the Police Force.<br><br>19. if during real war that time..Will there be a special army vehicle that pick us up..or do we take bus or mrt or taxi to reach the camp?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Trade secret.<br><br>20. I heard they they will check private parts during NS... (Can i ask them not to check private parts during NS? im a shy guy..)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; They'll stick a finger into your arsehole if you report sick with diarrhoea too often - fact! Army medical centres were also the only places I saw pictorial displays of sexually-transmitted diseases upfront. Quite gross.<br></div></blockquote>Need to correct sme things here.<br><br>Rec dun get to book in at 2359. E timming 4 bk in is much earlier, n u still need to hve ur field pack check b4 u return to ur bunks. (Usually they check e 1st few times when u bk in, after that e 3tiaos r too lazy to check liao) ) N if u r posted to tekong, good luck, every week bk out n bk in timming is different. Depends on e timming e ferry is allocated to ur company. There r lots of companies in tekong, so must take turn. Ur ferry timming to Tekong can b as early as 1800hrs on Sundays.<br><br>And they do provide free TIBS buses to ferry u to SAF ferry terminal fm Pasir Ris MRT n vice versa. But only on bk in n bk out days. Other days (eg, if u return after ur  Medical Appt) find ur own way 2 e terminal.<br><br>E ferries r very comfortable, air-con somemore n u can even find old SIA seats on board sme of e ferries! Is true, I saw it myself. SIA logo on e seats.</div>
