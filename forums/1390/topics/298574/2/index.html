            <div class='col-md body'>Something to illustrate to you guys..<br><br>*Basically, you're trained by Marines Special Operations chaps in CARAT.<br><br>Marines Test SingaporeÂ’s Sea Soldiers<br>Story Number: NNS070726-11<br>Release Date: 7/26/2007 11:50:00 AM<br><br>By Lance Cpl. Juan D. Alfonso, Commander Task Force 73 Public Affairs<br><br>FIBUA VILLAGE, Singapore (NNS) -- Marines and Sailors with III Marine Expeditionary ForceÂ’s Special Operations Training Group (SOTG) tested the Republic of SingaporeÂ’s Navy sea soldierÂ’s combat skills on July 19 in Fibua Village.<br><br>The exercise was part of Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) 2007, and took place during the practical application portion of a Force Protection Anti-Terrorism package with the NavyÂ’s Mobile Security Squadron (MSS) 7, Coastal Warfare Group 1.<br><br>Â“Training with the sea Changi Defense Squadron (CDS, also known as sea soldiers) was a very unique experience,Â” said Marine Staff Sgt. Freddy Arencibia, the staff noncommissioned officer in charge of the CARAT SOTG Detachment. Â“We were there to probe their defensive posture so weaknesses could be identified. Our training with them resulted in a seamless final exercise with SingaporeÂ’s Navy.Â”<br><br>Before the exercise against the Marines, instructors with MSS-7 led the sea soldiers during a two-week course designed to teach them the basic skills used in a counterterrorism operation, such as counter surveillance, water-side security and handling vehicle control points.<br><br>During the event, the Marines role-played as a terrorist cell attempting to infiltrate the forward operating base by means of rioting, suicide bombers and surprise attacks at every possible angle of their perimeter.<br><br>Â“The whole purpose of this event is to validate the training we gave them,Â” said Chief BoatswainÂ’s Mate Martin L. White, MSS-7. Â“TheyÂ’ve been trained on how to conduct these types of operations by U.S. troops before. WeÂ’re building on that foundation and making sure they use proper techniques when they're attacked by the Marines.Â”<br><br>After the Marines bombarded the sea soldiers with a series of suicide bombers and riots, Marine Sgt. Aaron Smith, noncommissioned officer in charge of the SOTG Detachment, decided to give them what seemed like a break.<br><br>Â“We had hit them three times in a row so we decided to hit them when their guard was down,Â” Smith said. Â“Once we thought they let it down, we attacked and discovered that they were only getting better the more we went at them. They started communicating more and it made them a harder target.Â”<br><br>After an hour of rest, the Marines launched a complicated surprise attack, beginning with a vehicle borne improvised explosive device and ended with several smoke grenades used to simulated actual explosives, thrown at their forward operating baseÂ’s rear and right flank.<br><br>After a half hour of fighting off the Marines, the sea soldiers emerged victorious, completing their two-week training evolution with the U.S. Navy.<br><br>Â“This was exciting training for all my troops,Â” said Singapore Navy Capt. Teo Lawrence, the training officer for CDS. Â“We do a lot of things the same way but there are minor differences. We learned a lot from the Marines and Sailors who participated and hope to use their ground experience to improve our own tactics in the future.Â”<br><br>CARAT 2007, which also involves Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, is designed to build relationships and enhance the operational readiness of the participating forces. CARAT is an annual series of bilateral maritime exercises between the United States and five Southeast Asian nations.<br><br><a href="http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=30790" rel="nofollow">http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=30790</a><br><br></div>
