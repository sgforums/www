            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>These people are not SAFOS/PSC/EDB Scholars.</blockquote>I get your drift. If it's any consolation, it wasn't meant to be a slight at Baey Yam Keng at all. What you're highlighting is the group that's usually associated with PAP politicians, i.e the scholars &amp; the ex-regulars. To my mind, there's now three other such groups, the difference being many of the latter shall serve as "mere" MPs without reaching the Cabinet.<br><br>The main group of this second tier, also usually associated with PAP politicians, tended to be reservist KAHs who held the ranks of MAJs &amp; CPTs. Sometimes you come across them in the papers, when when a reporter was covering a FIBUA exercise or something &amp; the MP/CO happened to be participating in it.<br><br>Another group, which I'm always looking out for, are the MPs who were officers or senior NCOs without being KAHs, usually holding the rank of LTAs at the most. (Unlike in active time, these guys are relatively powerless during reservist. They have important functions in unit ops, but are more or less treated as part of the main body.) But I usually associate the few "outed" PAP men as from the Temasek Green era, that's how infrequent &amp; discreet they are.<br><br>The newest group would comprise the Baey Yam Keng's: "normal" peng who would've served only two years but for their academic qualifications. It'll be historic if he can climb to a Cabinet post someday.<br><br><blockquote>I'm not too sure if I am right, but perhaps, by colonel, they were meaning this rather than this which we are familiar with.</blockquote>Hey, good point, &amp; thanks for the explanation. Still too wayang, Chiang Kai Shek-ish, for me though, whenever I think of the pix. GKS was also the longtime Defence Minister from independence onwards &amp;, back in school, I always thought he got the portfolio for being the only Old Guard leader with  military experience during wartime (corporal in the Voluntary Corps). E.W. Barker was the other one, but he was more the equivalent of a medic (might've been a civilian one too) who helped nurse the stragglers along the Death Railway up in Thailand.<br><br><blockquote>Some of the serving Members of Parliament during that period did volunteered for NS, as I recall reading in someone's biography.</blockquote>To clarify, they didn't. They'd signed up for the newly-created PDF (consisting part-reservist, part-volunteer infantry &amp; artillery units) in the same latter part of 1965 as Independece. Those units, together with the two professional infantry regiments, were our only armed forces until all the Malaysian &amp; British personnel within were phased out &amp; replaced, &amp; a new Singaporean officer corps was produced (SAFTI was establishd in 1966). Within another year, we were ready to introduce NS.</div>
