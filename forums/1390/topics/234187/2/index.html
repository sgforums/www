Why they always target Spore?<br></div></blockquote>Because Singapore always talk about being above board, commercial decision. Don't want to put in the human element.<br><br>Traditional practices cannot be overlooked. When I get an invitation, I bring along a gift. When I am served well in a restaurant, I give an extra tip.<br><br>To relate, I got through the customs with a passport with less than 6 months' validity. The Singapore Immigration did not see it, but the Malaysian Immigration was sharper. I apologise, called him 'Abang' and say 'I will not do it again'. I got in and came out. Sometimes, I find the Malaysians more forgiving and practical. He can see from my passport that I frequented Malaysia, and his practical sense told him that I would return back to Singapore before my passport expires. What would the Singapore Immigration say ? So, what's wrong with tipping him for his good service and senses.<br></div>

IMO, people here are too quick to believe him. It is never OK to just enter a country without getting permission to enter. It is called illegal immigration. Singapore regularly sends illegal immigrants to jail and for caning.<br><br>It is not as if the customs official took his passport and did not stamp it. The situation is that he did not give his passport to any customs official. He is therefore either very naive, very reckless or very guilty. On all counts, he should be punished as a reminder to him. Perhaps the punishment is a little too harsh but it is their country and they are allowed to make their own laws.</div>
