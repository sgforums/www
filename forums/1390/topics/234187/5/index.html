But memories are considerably extended if you keep giving it the oxygen of publicity. Yes, the man got his name in the paper, but it is certainly not true that all publicity is good publicity. On this occasion, he looks like an incompetent fool because he has stated things that everyone who know anything will know is a complete lie. Lying is normal and is to be commended but only if done properly. This is an example of a lie done wrong.<br><br></div>

Let's have some open discussions or not at all. Everyone here can draw on personal experience but to have a meaningful debate, you need to have an agreed set of facts. Obviously, the only one we have to go on is that stated in the newspaper report (which is supposedly what the guilty party himself said).<br><br>If the person involved lied in court as part of some courtroom tactics. then as he reaps the benefits of his lies, so should he shoulder the burden.
