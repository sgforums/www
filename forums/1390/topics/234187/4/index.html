Technically, i believe if you tell them you are government agent from Singapore, they also don't give a damn. Even if you say you are ISD, they also don't blink an eye (though you might have problems with ISD for exposing your status when you return home haha).<br><br>Let's put it this way. Supposing you are governmant servant, and you whipped out your pistol (assuming you have lah) and shot the policeman. You think Singapore government will rescue you?<br><br>Contrast that to the time when a certain sultan from johor came to singapore, got stopped by a TP, and shot the TP. apparently he got away scot-free.<br><br>So basically, SG government servant in MY no big deal.</div>
