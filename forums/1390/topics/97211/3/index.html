Outgoing Army RSM, SWO Gungadaran, handed over his duties to the new Army RSM, SWO Francis Ng, to take on his new appointment as SAF RSM. Chief of Army (COA), MG Desmond Kuek and other senior commanders joined over 350 Warrant Officers to witness the event.<br><br>SWO Gungadaran was appointed the first-ever Army RSM in 2000. He oversaw the implementation of many programmes and initiatives, like the annual Army RSM Retreat, the Warrant OfficersÂ’ and SpecialistsÂ’ (WOSE) Symposium, Training Days for RSMs in the Army, the Army Guide and Ward Scheme set up in all Army Formations to groom future leaders, and the Communities of Practice in the WOSE Corps. SWO Gungadaran said, Â“It has been a meaningful four years as Army RSM, which has opened up a host of opportunities to galvanise the Army WOSE efforts towards key Army drivers.Â”<br><br>As the new Army RSM, SWO Ng now has the responsibility to drive the WOSE Corps onwards. Before his appointment, he was an active member of the Directing Staff in the Singapore Armed Forces Warrant OfficersÂ’ School (SAFWOS) since 2001. SWO Gungadaran reserved praise for SWO Ng, saying, Â“SWO Ng is a pillar for SAFWOS. I am confident that with his ability, he can bring the Army WOSE Corps to greater heights.Â”<br><br>With dedicated leaders like SWO Gungadaran and SWO Ng, the WOSE Corps is indeed in good hands!<br></div>
