[/b]</blockquote>Pegasus CSM is one good guy... he volunteered his services to help out in the merger parade, sacrificed his nights and free time doing carpentry so that he could save some money for BMTC.<br><br>Yet soon after the parade, he did some mistakes during a muster just beacuse it was his first time doing it and BMTC does things differently. Instead of letting him off in view of his past volunteerism and that he may be new to BMT, the RSM just handed out 14 extras to him, doing 24-hr duties every alternate days.<br><br>despite this, he took the extras like a man and never bad-mouthed the RSM.<br>This I respect.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I usually have good memories of CSM/BSM's. Sure, they wear the disciplinarian hat at times but, for the most part, there's more important matters at hand guiding an active or reservist unit. I also think the "men" generally bonded with him better (compared to the other KAHs) as they regularly trained together out in the field.<br><br>IMO RSMs tend to have an ego to match their rank, esp. those in training schools. My training-cadre RSM even tried to sell me insurance, post-SAF mandatory retirement, claiming he "must protect my boys". I told him to go fly kite (okay, something ruder) if he's gonna take that paternalistic attitude.<br><br>My active RSM was quite erratic &amp; a bit of a buffon, calling everyone "Ah Tong San"; he fell from grace later, as the story went, from trying to rape a guardroom sentry (or commander) while drunk. My reservist stint lacked a permanent RSM for ages, with my RQ &amp; sometimes a BSM filling in temporarily. The one who finally settled in was quite a pushover - you don't really meet a RSM in camp a lot during ICT except for muster parades, etc., plus he has his own field-training duties. With the latter, he was professionally led "astray" by my recce group a lot, as we taught him all the "welfare" tricks of the trade.</div>
