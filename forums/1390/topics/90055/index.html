            <div class='col-md body'>rightful killing is not wrong in any religion.. if a person force fully tries to break into your home, of course you would use force or lethal force if the first option doesnt work. even in Islam you are permitted do defend yourself if not compulsory againt your enemies even if your enemy is your fellow Muslim cause he is threatening you and you way of life.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>That's the only reason I can think of why Armour has no Malays... comments?  </blockquote>Yours is but a brief summary of our supposed "pre-emptive offensive" - i.e. electronic warfare (ADSD), air superiority (RSAF), amphibious/heliborne inserstions to secure bridgeheads (CDO, RDF, RSN), then rapid ground advance (SAB, RDF, SIB) - to a theoretical "Mersing Line", thereby safeguarding the water-pumping stations as well as buffering the island from arty range, prominent communalist agitation &amp; economic leverage.<br><br>The idea is to starve off another Jap-style operation in reverse, but the whole blueprint is so common sense that generations of staff officers must've gotten promotions from such campaign designing ~lol~<br><br>More soberly, the SAF - even LKY himself - seriously wondered within context about the commitment of local Malay &amp;, let's face it, also other Muslim &amp; perm resident servicemen. Hence the traditional reluctance to post them with such vanguard forces &amp;, to some extent, ditto the ongoing institutional distrust. The stakes are just too high.<br><br>That said, it's by no means the whole story; IMO the relationship also involved other serious, complicated variables:<br><br>1stly, the SAF faced bigger grassroots problems with initial conscription. In particular, banishing the Chinese culture prejudice about soldiering (vital cuz they formed the bulk of NS intake) &amp; professionalizing training/safety standards to assuage familial concerns. I don't think either achievement was truly realized until the early '80s.<br><br>2ndly, the SAF's early marginization of Malays - from "declawing" regulars to shelving conscripts ('69-73) to restricted combat postings (post'73) - was retrospectively controversial, but quite unavoidable. There was a need to remix the ethnic balance militarily, amid deep suspicion about local loyalties from the Malay communalist threat. Yet I don't think this was a longstanding difficulty - as often made out to be - compared to another inadvertent development: the economic dislocation &amp; general alienation of an entire community.<br><br>The Government's chosen remedy is to initially stem the societal problems (like drug-taking), then attempt to reintegrate the Malays back into the civilian mainstream (via affirmation programs), while <span style="font-style: italic;">concurrently</span> opening up the military to them again. In other words, the latter-duo approach is mutually inclusive of each other, rather than relate on a causal basis. IMO It's gonna take at least another decade, except I think a new variable could perplex things (more on that later).<br><br>3rdly, the SAF also serves a nation-building platform, not just defence. Propaganda, physical fitness, academic &amp; skills courses, common bonding et al. were/are daily experiences of positive reinforcement. Yet its internal social mores are very resistant to social engineering, which meant that Malays - already in perpetual catch-up mode with full-scale enlisting from '85 - had to assimilate into a core culture that doesn't "wait" for them. A highlight would be the Hokkien-Singlish lingo, which has survived bilingual education ("proper" English; Mandarin vs. dialects).<br><br>4thly, the lower national birthrate (post-'80s) forced a SAF rethink of manpower resources, regardless of race. Yet, throughout last decade, it has exponentially "technologicize" the soldier profile as well as the weapon systems, both for a force-muliplier edge &amp; also an end in itself. This has its plus points but also created new conflict perceptions: scholars vs. farmers; managers vs. leaders; ops needs vs. training realities; confidence vs. British/WWII-style overestimation, etc.<br><br>With the Malays, even as they close the gap on the educational front, I wonder if they'll find the military-technocrat mindset a new barrier.<br><br>5thly, I don't foresee eventual combat postings as potentially delicate. Some postings will be off-limits - necessary evil for living in SE Asia - &amp; special forces like the CDO has their own enlistment criteria. But the general mono-intakes (as base for combat main body) for SAR, SA, SCE &amp; some GDS elements won't deviate from a blanket-encompassing nature, esp. since their units form conventional brigades that come under a combined-arms DIV.<br><br>The more intriguing question, I think, is who'll take the transplanted Malays' places in the Police &amp; SCDF paramilitary forces. Women? Newer/older/1st-generation perm residents?</div>
