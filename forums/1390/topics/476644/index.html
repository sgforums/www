So unless you intend to leave Singapore for good, you have to bring your kit back in for ICTs. Otherwise, you can try to bring it out of Singapore, and either the customs on this side stops your baggage going thru, or on the other side, then that's really your problem trying to bring one country's controlled items to another.</p></div>

                              completed their NS training cycle but have yet to reach the statutory 
                              age. They are no longer called back for In-Camp Training (ICT) but are 
                              still liable for NS.</p>
              <p><strong><em>What happens after I completed my NS Training Cycle?</em></strong><br> The minimum requirement for completion of NS Training Cycle is 7 HK and 
                              10 ORNS years (8 HK and 13 ORNS years for Key Appointment Holders). 
                              However, you may be asked to continue your service as a Reservist On 
                              Voluntary Extended Reserve Service (ROVERS) to ensure fulfillment of 
                              operational requirements. Some ROVERS may even continue to serve beyond 
                              the statutory age of 50 and 40 for Officers and WOSE respectively as 
                              VOLUNTEERS in higher operational appointments.</p>
              <p><br> Once you have completed your NS training cycle and/or standdown as 
                              ROVERS/VOUNTEER, you will be posted to the MINDEF Reserve (MR) List at 
                              the end of the work year. However, you may still be activated during 
                              operational exigencies and remain liable for NS up to the respective 
                              statutory ages.</p>
              <p>Note that you are to disregard your previous unit’s 
                              mobilisation codewords as you are no longer required to report for 
                              mobilisation activation for your previous units. A new codeword will be 
                              assigned to you accordingly should you be mobilised while you are in MR.
                               If you are travelling overseas for 6 months or more, you are still 
                              required to apply for Exit Permit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> <strong>1. What is meant by no longer liable for National Service? </strong><br> Under the Enlistment Act, Chapter 93, NSmen will not be liable for NS 
                      call-ups when they reach the statutory age limit of 40 for Warrant 
                      Officers, Specialists and Enlistees (WOSEs) and 50 for Officers. In 
                      other words, personnel reaching the stated statutory age limit will no 
                      longer be liable to be called up for any NS activities such as ICT, 
                      IPPT, mobilisation etc.<br> <br> <strong>2. What should I do to my SAF personal equipment now that I have completed my NS liability? </strong><br> You may dispose the items in the normal ways as long as the items do not
                       end up in an unauthorised usage.</p>

              <p><strong>Q3. Why has MINDEF decided to shift the starting age for exit controls from age 11 to 13?<br><br></strong>Currently,
               the starting age of exit controls is pegged at age 11, the age where 
              Singaporeans used to be issued with NRICs.  With Singaporeans now being 
              issued NRICs at age 15, there is no longer a special reason to retain 
              age 11 as the starting age for exit controls.  MINDEF has therefore 
              decided to set it at age 13, which is when students would have just 
              started their secondary school education.</p>

              <p><strong>Q4. Why is MINDEF removing passport controls?<br><br></strong>With
               the introduction of the non-extendable Singapore Biometric passport, a 
              continuation of passport controls for young males would mean that they 
              will have to pay for a new biometric passport upon expiry each time. 
              This will result in greater inconvenience and higher cost for young 
              males and their families. MINDEF has therefore decided to remove 
              passport controls.</p>

              <p><strong>Q5. Will young males holding non-biometric Singapore passport be given full validity?<br><br></strong>Those

              passports extended for the full duration of 5 or 10 years. This is

              <p><strong>Q6. Why does MINDEF require young males to apply for an exit permit?<br><br></strong>With
               the removal of passport controls, it is necessary for MINDEF to extend 
              exit permit requirements (which currently affect only NS-liable males 
              aged 16½ and above) to males aged 13 and above in order to ensure that 
              young males who go overseas return to serve NS. However, to avoid 
              inconveniencing those who make short overseas trips during vacations, 
              exit permits will only be required for overseas trips of 3 months or 
              more.</p>

              <p><strong>Q7. Will young males who require exit permits be required to furnish a bond?<br><br></strong>Young
               males aged 13 to 16½ will only be required to furnish a bond if they 
              require an exit permit of 2 years or more.  This arrangement is similar 
              to the current practice where only young males who require a passport 
              validity of more than 2 years are required to furnish a bond. <br><br>Males
               aged 16½ to enlistment are approaching the age of enlistment. They are 
              therefore subject to more stringent exit controls to deter potential NS 
              defaulters.  The current practice of requiring such males to furnish a 
              bond if they require an exit permit of 3 months or more will continue.</p>

              <p><strong>Q8. Will young males aged 13 to 16½ who fail to apply for an exit permit be sentenced to imprisonment?<br><br></strong>The
               penalty regime for exit permit offences of young males aged 13 to 16½ 
              will be a fine of up to $2,000, with no custodial sentences.  They will 
              however be subject to harsher penalties should they continue to be in 
              breach of the Enlistment Act after that age 16½.<br><br>Males above 16½ 
              years who travel and remain overseas without applying for an exit permit
               will be prosecuted under the Enlistment Act. They will be liable upon

              <p><strong>Q9. How will MINDEF deal with young males who do not 
              understand their obligations under the Enlistment Act or those who have 
              parents/guardians who deliberately encourage them to be in breach of the
               Enlistment Act?<br><br></strong>MINDEF recognises that some young males may 
              not be sufficiently mature to understand their obligations under the 
              Enlistment Act.  Their parents or guardians may also have been 
              instrumental in decisions, which are in contravention of the Enlistment 
              Act.  Parents and guardians would therefore also be liable for the exit 
              permit offences of their children or wards of ages 13 to 16½, so that 
              the penalty can be imposed on their parents or guardians when the 
              circumstances warrant it.  The penalty regime for the offence will also 
              be a fine of up to $2,000. MINDEF will consider the circumstances of the
               case carefully before deciding whether to issue warnings, composition 
              fines or to charge the parent or guardian in court.</p>

              the arrangement for young males who have furnished bonds for extended 
              passport validity under the Immigration Bonding Scheme?<br><br></strong>As 
              males below the age of 13 will no longer come under the ambit of 
              passport or exit control, those who had furnished a bond to the 
              Immigration and Checkpoints Authority under the Immigration Bonding 
              Scheme will have their bonds released.  <br><br>Males aged 13 to 16½ 
              currently bonded in order to be issued with passports of extended 
              validity will be required to apply for an exit permit for overseas trips
               of 3 months or more.  Those who require an exit permit of 2 years or 
              more will continue to be bonded.  Those who require an exit permit of

              pre-enlistees would be inconvenienced by having to apply for a new 
              biometric passport every year?<br><br></strong>According to the Immigration 
              and Checkpoints Authority, there are approximately 120,000 
              pre-registrants (males aged 11 to 16½) and 100,000 registrants (males 
              aged 16½ to enlistment) passport holders.  With the passport validity of
               pre-registrants and registrants capped at 2 years and 1 year 
              respectively, we would expect a pre-registrant to have to apply for a 
              new passport once in 2 years and a registrant once a year.  On average, 
              100,000 have their passports extended annually.</p>
