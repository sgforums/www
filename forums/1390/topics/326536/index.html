              <h1 class="clr">SAF a much stronger organisation today due largely to talent</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE : Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said the
              Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is a much stronger organisation today due
              largely to the talented people in service.</p>
              <p>He said that is why it is important to continue to attract bright young Singaporeans to serve in the SAF.</p>
              <p>He was speaking at the SAF Overseas Scholarship Award Presentation Ceremony at the Istana on Wednesday evening.</p>
              <p>When the tsunami struck Aceh in 2004, the SAF was there to help with relief supplies.</p>
              <p>When Singapore suffered the SARS outbreak in 2003, the SAF again helped in executing home quarantine orders .</p>
              <p>Mr
              Lee said the SAF has established a reputation for itself as a highly
              professional and capable force through such operations. But it now
              faces new challenges like terrorism and evolving military technology.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Lee said: "The SAF has reached a level of maturity where often it
              cannot find ready—made solutions elsewhere, but must do its own
              thinking and develop its own to stay ahead. This makes talent even more
              critical to the SAF.</p>
              <p>"More than ever, the SAF needs leaders of
              the highest quality throughout the organisation, who can think ahead,
              conceive new ways of operating, (and) implement bold and creative plans
              and bring the SAF to the next level."</p>
              <p>Mr Lee noted that the servicemen are well educated and know whether they are competently trained and led.</p>
              <p>He
              said: "They are prepared to take tough training, but they have a low
              tolerance for army bull or for superiors who pull rank instead of
              commanding respect through their competence and personal example.</p>
              <p>"Servicemen
              and their parents must have every confidence that should they ever be
              ordered into battle, the general and admirals commanding them count
              among the most able that Singapore has to offer."</p>
              <p>And being part of the able team in the SAF are the four new SAF Overseas scholars.</p>
              <p>All aged 19, they will pursue their studies in the UK or the US.</p>
              <p>The
              scholars are Wayne Ho from the Army who will read Economics at the
              University of Warwick, UK; the Air Force’s Conran Chia, who will read
              Economics at the University College London, UK; Pilot Trainee Jason
              Lau, who will read sociology at the University of Warwick, UK; and the
              Navy’s Alex Ang, who will head to Cornell University, USA to read
              physics.</p>
              <p>That brings the total number to 265 of such scholars, the second most prestigious to the President’s Scholarship.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee himself was a pioneer recipient of the SAF Overseas Scholarship in 1971.</p>
              <p>Opportunities are aplenty in this globalised world.</p>
              <p>So
              Mr Lee said Singapore must impress upon the young the importance of the
              SAF. And he hopes that young Singaporeans will then respond to maintain
              and enhance the security of this nation. — CNA/ms</p>
