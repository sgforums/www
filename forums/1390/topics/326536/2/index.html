              <p>I dun understand why everyone is complaining about the SAF and on its whole as an organisation. Comparing SAF on the whole from last time with now, SAF did improve alot. Singaporeans only know how to complaint about matters which do not benefit them or which gave them a negative experience. If this is so easy, try sitting up there to manage.</p>
              <p>Even in our daily lives, when we do meeting and stuff, we probably do come across decision making and it aint easy. As you know, your decision will definitely affect someone directly whether is it in a good or a bad way. Logically, you will choose the optimum decision which creates a lesser 'damage'. How does a person knows which is the decision he had to make, he has to first understand the big picture.</p>
              <p>People at the bottom of the work force do not understand the the big picture. There is no point for the upper management to explain the big picture to us too. They ensure that the department heads of the main management team to understand the big picture, and they just had to run their department in favour or towards the big picture.</p>
              <p>So you may say, 'hey, they tell us the big picture then'. Think of it very very carefully, even after you know the big picture, will you know? No you wont.</p>
              <p>SAF does not need go to a real war to discover how efficient is she. If we does that, you and me probably wont be sitting down infront of the computer typing our ass off. Either we will be in camp, trying to do what we should be doing or you will be running. ATEC is design to access the effectiveness of the NS battalions. They want to see how efficient is the NSF commanders and how the man underneath him follows instructions and fight as a platoon, companies and battalions and therefore certify operational ready and you guys can ORD. this is happening for all conventional units with NS estab.</p>
              <p>SAF contains a very powerful weapon which is us, the will to fight. A armed forces is not gauge by equipment or the capabilities they had, but the will of the soldier to fight and the professionalism of a soldier, beyond the call of duty. It is sad to see how negative a person can get about his army experience.</p>
              <p>if we are the one who do the dirty work and so be it. If you understand and know more about the leaders like DIV Commander who are spearheading the SAF. You may think they 'zhuo bo'. Maybe their work just aint hectic. Do you know that some of the malaysia's Military leader are afraid of some of our BGs for the ability to move and command troops. As SAF fighting style is based on doctrine, some of the DIV commanders do not follow the doctrine and they are able to command troops well based on their efficient combat knowledge and this had been proven in very large scale exercise. Therefore comparing to ATEC, ATEC is just the more simple and basic form.</p>
              <p>Blame it on your unit, blame it on your manpwer officer, blame it on your direct commanders who failed to show you the big picture and the need to defend singapore.</p>
              <p>I'm not a regular and I'm an NSF. There are 3 kind of people who enlist, the first category, people who are super positive about enlistment. the 2nd category, ppl who had no issue, neither positive nor negative. The 3rd group who are negative about it.</p>
              <p>People who falls into the first and second group probably will have a very positive army experience. We all had to serve so lets serve it like a man. Why sulk and complaint like a girl over some issue we cant change. Why not look positive towards it and there is always something to learn from it. Even there is nothing to look forward, the experience you get is once in a life time. No chance you will get to push to your limit, hurled by vulgarities by a commander and you cant even get back to him except for cursing him in your bunk, the brotherhood which was formed between you and peers. Outfield is the time when you know who is a true friend and you will never get that kind of opportunity in real life. Technically wise, you are able to run beside an IFV, sailed on a navy ship, participated in a artillery live firing and even just to set off an I chain or a simple demolition circuit.</p>
              <p>Once you are negative, life just sucks for you and i pity you. I dunnoe what kind of environment groom you to be so negative about NS. Maybe your parents? So you end up going to enlistment with that sulky face and you didnt perform well enough. You do not want responsibility and you opt not to be a commander. End up as a trooper in some infantry bn. Worst, you might be posted as a supply assistant or a clerk and there lead to a dreadful army experience.</p>
              <p>No one explain or let you understand that support is one of the more crucial thing in an armed forces and when you are talking about real war, support must be operational ready and efficient as the front troop cant win the war without combat support.</p>
              <p>When you find that your army experience sucks, you will end up convincing your sons that NS is a waste of time. Those people who had a positive experience will tell their son that NS is a positive for all singaporeans sons. This people will probably take up roles of NSF specialists and officers and the cycle continues.</p>
              <p>All i had mentioned above is just based on a simple theory and fact. you can choose to be happy or sad. its your choice as life still goes on. Just don sulk like a child and complaint. DO SOMETHING&gt;</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I dun understand why everyone is complaining about the SAF and on its whole as an organisation. Comparing SAF on the whole from last time with now, SAF did improve alot. Singaporeans only know how to complaint about matters which do not benefit them or which gave them a negative experience. If this is so easy, try sitting up there to manage.</p>
              <p>Even in our daily lives, when we do meeting and stuff, we probably do come across decision making and it aint easy. As you know, your decision will definitely affect someone directly whether is it in a good or a bad way. Logically, you will choose the optimum decision which creates a lesser 'damage'. How does a person knows which is the decision he had to make, he has to first understand the big picture.</p>
              <p>People at the bottom of the work force do not understand the the big picture. There is no point for the upper management to explain the big picture to us too. They ensure that the department heads of the main management team to understand the big picture, and they just had to run their department in favour or towards the big picture.</p>
              <p>So you may say, 'hey, they tell us the big picture then'. Think of it very very carefully, even after you know the big picture, will you know? No you wont.</p>
              <p>SAF does not need go to a real war to discover how efficient is she. If we does that, you and me probably wont be sitting down infront of the computer typing our ass off. Either we will be in camp, trying to do what we should be doing or you will be running. ATEC is design to access the effectiveness of the NS battalions. They want to see how efficient is the NSF commanders and how the man underneath him follows instructions and fight as a platoon, companies and battalions and therefore certify operational ready and you guys can ORD. this is happening for all conventional units with NS estab.</p>
              <p>SAF contains a very powerful weapon which is us, the will to fight. A armed forces is not gauge by equipment or the capabilities they had, but the will of the soldier to fight and the professionalism of a soldier, beyond the call of duty. It is sad to see how negative a person can get about his army experience.</p>
              <p>if we are the one who do the dirty work and so be it. If you understand and know more about the leaders like DIV Commander who are spearheading the SAF. You may think they 'zhuo bo'. Maybe their work just aint hectic. Do you know that some of the malaysia's Military leader are afraid of some of our BGs for the ability to move and command troops. As SAF fighting style is based on doctrine, some of the DIV commanders do not follow the doctrine and they are able to command troops well based on their efficient combat knowledge and this had been proven in very large scale exercise. Therefore comparing to ATEC, ATEC is just the more simple and basic form.</p>
              <p>Blame it on your unit, blame it on your manpwer officer, blame it on your direct commanders who failed to show you the big picture and the need to defend singapore.</p>
              <p>I'm not a regular and I'm an NSF. There are 3 kind of people who enlist, the first category, people who are super positive about enlistment. the 2nd category, ppl who had no issue, neither positive nor negative. The 3rd group who are negative about it.</p>
              <p>People who falls into the first and second group probably will have a very positive army experience. We all had to serve so lets serve it like a man. Why sulk and complaint like a girl over some issue we cant change. Why not look positive towards it and there is always something to learn from it. Even there is nothing to look forward, the experience you get is once in a life time. No chance you will get to push to your limit, hurled by vulgarities by a commander and you cant even get back to him except for cursing him in your bunk, the brotherhood which was formed between you and peers. Outfield is the time when you know who is a true friend and you will never get that kind of opportunity in real life. Technically wise, you are able to run beside an IFV, sailed on a navy ship, participated in a artillery live firing and even just to set off an I chain or a simple demolition circuit.</p>
              <p>Once you are negative, life just sucks for you and i pity you. I dunnoe what kind of environment groom you to be so negative about NS. Maybe your parents? So you end up going to enlistment with that sulky face and you didnt perform well enough. You do not want responsibility and you opt not to be a commander. End up as a trooper in some infantry bn. Worst, you might be posted as a supply assistant or a clerk and there lead to a dreadful army experience.</p>
              <p>No one explain or let you understand that support is one of the more crucial thing in an armed forces and when you are talking about real war, support must be operational ready and efficient as the front troop cant win the war without combat support.</p>
              <p>When you find that your army experience sucks, you will end up convincing your sons that NS is a waste of time. Those people who had a positive experience will tell their son that NS is a positive for all singaporeans sons. This people will probably take up roles of NSF specialists and officers and the cycle continues.</p>
              <p>All i had mentioned above is just based on a simple theory and fact. you can choose to be happy or sad. its your choice as life still goes on. Just don sulk like a child and complaint. DO SOMETHING&gt;</p>
