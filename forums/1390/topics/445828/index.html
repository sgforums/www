              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>I am an A level grad, enlisting on 2nd Feb 2012.</p>
              <p>Previously in 2010 when I was J2, I had depression and had to retake J2 in 2011. I still had a medical checkup by SAF in 2010, and the SAF MO and psychiathrist told me that I would be called back for a review again in 2011, but they did not call me back and instead graded me tempo C9L3 for 6 months a few months back (in 2011).<br><br>Retaking the year has not been smooth due to different social circles and lack of support from peers in my batch since they all headed towards their army lives and uni lives and you know the contact just weakens. I still have some close friends but these are few and there is only 2 on a frequent basis. Honestly if not for these 2 friends I wouldn't have made it through my J2. I have been seeing my psychiathrist at Mount E every few months to collect anti-depressants for my condition as well as keep a record there. During my A level period, my condition worsened due to stress, and I started doing alot of things to hurt myself, stupid I know, such as hitting my head on the wall, cutting my forearms with a pair of scissors or razorblade. The cuts are about 5-6cm long on hands. On 2-3 occasions I scared my family members by breaking down and really shouting and screaming in the house.</p>
              <p>Moreover I have been gaining weight due to improper sleep caused by my condition. Sometimes I can sleep the whole day literally. I googled this and found that it is called hypersomnia, like I can wake up and still feel very tired. At other times I can hardly sleep, like I can lie there in bed and just feel very restless. It is affecting my metabolism and as a result I am slightly overweight now. (BMI around 25.5) Although I have been trying to keep a proper diet and jog frequently (everyday at least 2km no matter how tired I feel), it is just difficult when the body doesn't have a proper metabolism. Also, I am worried that my NS uniform assigned to me cannot fit, as the 
              information I submitted 2 years ago are when I was in tip-top shape, 
              able to do 25 pullups that type. I think BMI at that period is around 
              22.</p>
              <p>My parents arranged for me to see the Mount E psychiathrist that I have been seeing and I collected a memo today which recommended that I am excused from firearms.<br><br>As my enlistment date is so near (barely 2 weeks later), should I still call CMPB for another medical review so I can submit the memo and update my weight etc? Will it affect my PES status? I read that for my case it is likely I will be PES C-E depending on how severe my depression is. My exclassmates told me that handling firearms is fun in NS life, but I really don't want to end up in a situation whereby I do something stupid and people get hurt or I get a record for life. I also read that PES E people are generally despised and I don't want that to happen. Honestly I want to serve my NS as properly as I can, I think the discipline will be good for me to have a healthier life as compared to now. Now I don't know if I will get PES E for sure, but from what I read it is like since PES E people are generally despised by the superiors then they will always get stay-in, but I am worried that it will affect my already bad relations with my family if I cannot spend enough time with them. Already I can't be bothered with my social circle as I just want to repair my relations with my family.</p>
              <p>I am really unsure of what to do, any advice will really be sincerely appreciated.</p>
