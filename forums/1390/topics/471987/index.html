              <p>Though Singapore only gained her current version of armed forces
                                 in 1967, the history of her defence started long before then. Under <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/the_early_years/v01n02b_history.html">colonial rule that started in 1819</a>, Singapore relied on British forces to protect her from all threats. A turning point occurred in 1854 with the creation of the <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/the_early_years/v11n07_history.html">Singapore Volunteer Rifle Corps (SVRC)</a>, a volunteer organisation to maintain internal security.</p>
              <p>In 1888, the SVRC became the <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/the_early_years/v09n02_history.html">Singapore Volunteer Artillery (SVA)</a>,
                                 and its success prompted formation of other volunteer corps.  In 1901, 
                                these were all consolidated into the Singapore Volunteer Corps (SVC). In
                                 1922, the SVC was renamed the Straits Settlements Volunteer Force 
                                (SSVF) to include volunteer forces from Malacca and Penang.</p>
              <div>
              <p>In December 1941, the <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v01n12_history.html">Japanese campaign into South East Asia</a> had begun. The British commanders had thought that Singapore was an 
                                "impregnable fortress", but troops stationed here were inexperienced 
                                compared to the Japanese forces.. On 10 Dec 1941, disaster struck when 
                                two British battleships, <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v08n12_history.html">Repulse and Prince of Wales</a>, were sunk by <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v10n12_history.html">Japanese planes</a>.
                                 On 8 February, the Japanese crossed the narrow Straits of Johore into 
                                Kranji and Sarimbun, beginning their invasion of Singapore. For the next
                                 seven days, the British put up stiff resistance but were no match for 
                                the Japanese. Volunteer forces also fought alongside regular forces in 
                                the <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v02n02_history.html">Battles of Bukit Timah and Pasir Panjang</a> to fend off the Japanese. Despite all their efforts, on 15th February 1942, <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v01n02a_history.html">Singapore was surrendered</a>.</p>
              <p>During the Japanese occupation, the Straits Settlements Volunteer 
                                Force (SSVF) and local forces were indispensable to the war effort. SSVF
                                 corpswoman <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v07n10_history.html">Elizabeth Choy</a> was detained and interrogated by the Kempeitai alongside other locals following the <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v03n10_history.html">Double Tenth Massacre</a>. Men and women such as <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v02n06_history.html">Lim Bo Seng</a> joined special operations forces, gathered intelligence and fought 
                                where they could. The Chinese in Singapore's volunteer armies were 
                                targeted during the Sook Ching Massacre, or sent with other prisoners of
                                 war to build the Death Railway.</p>
              <p>In May 1945, the war in Europe ended with <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v09n05_history.html">Germany's surrender</a>.
                                 Soon after, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August 
                                1945 respectively signalled the end of Japan's war efforts. On 15 August
                                 1945, the Japanese invaders in Singapore <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v09n05_history.html">laid down their arms</a> and the Japanese occupation was over.</p>
              <div>
              <p>The perceived failure of the British to defend Singapore against
                                 the Japanese during WWII caused Singaporeans to desire greater autonomy
                                 from the British and precipitated the formation of the Singapore Armed 
                                Forces (SAF). The Straits Settlements Volunteer Force (SSVF), which had 
                                been dissolved, was reinstated in 1949 as the SVC to keep peace 
                                domestically.</p>
              <p>The year 1957 saw the establishment of the first battalion of regular soldiers, the <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v02n11_history.html">First Singapore Infantry Regiment</a> (1 SIR). <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v03n04_history.html">2 SIR</a> joined 1 SIR in 1962. Their first real test came in 1963 in the form of <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v03n04_history.html">Konfrantasi</a>.
                                 1 SIR, 2 SIR, the Singapore Volunteer Corps (SVC) and the Vigilante 
                                Corps (VC) were all deployed to protect strategically important sites. 
                                The VC found incredible support from citizens, with 91.4% of eligible 
                                men volunteering.</p>
              <p>On 9 August 1965, after more than 100 years of British colonial rule 
                                and two tumultuous years under the Malaysian Federation, Singapore was 
                                declared a sovereign and independent nation. It was a time of great 
                                uncertainty as the leaders were faced with the enormous task of charting
                                 the path of our national destiny. Nevertheless, Singapore was 
                                determined to not only survive on its own but to succeed.</p>
              <p>An urgent priority after independence was to build up Singapore's own
                                 defence capability. Singapore then had only two infantry battalions of 
                                50 officers and some 1,000 men and two ships. There was no airforce. 
                                Singapore's armed forces had to be created virtually from scratch.</p>
              <p>In August 1965, the <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v07n11_history.html">Ministry of the Interior and Defence</a> (MID) was established with Dr. Goh Keng Swee as its first Minister. The
                                 key priority then was to build up the Army into a credible force as 
                                soon as possible. With its small population and the need to channel 
                                resources to economic development, it was decided that Singapore's 
                                defence would be based on citizen armed forces. However, there was no 
                                military tradition in Singapore. The bulk of the population had 
                                traditionally held military service in low esteem. An intense 
                                educational effort was required to overcome such attitudes. Ministers, 
                                Members of Parliament, senior civil servants and community leaders 
                                volunteered to serve in the People's Defence Force. In this way, they 
                                set an example and drove home the message that it was the responsibility
                                 of every citizen to defend their nation.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v06n02_history.html">National Service</a> started two years later in 1967. The NS (Amendment) Bill, 1967 was 
                                first read in Parliament on 27 Feb 1967. After a spirited debate in 
                                Parliament, the Act was finally passed on 14 Mar 1967.</p>
              <p>The passing of the NS (Amendment) Act in mid-Mar 1967 was a turning 
                                point in the lives of Singaporean males. Between 28 Mar and 18 Apr 1967,
                                 registration began in earnest at the Central Manpower Base (CMPB) and 
                                its district offices in Katong, Serangoon and Bukit Panjang. Pink 
                                reminder cards were sent by post to the first batch of citizens who were
                                 born between 1 Jan 1949 and 30 Jun 1949 - some 9,000 of them. This 
                                marked the beginning of the citizen army and also the start of NS as a 
                                way of life for the male citizens of Singapore.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v13n07_history.html">Republic of Singapore Navy</a> (RSN) began as the <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v10n01_history.html">Singapore Naval Volunteer Force</a> (SNVF) in 1966 with just three ships, RSS Panglima, RSS Bedok and RSS 
                                Singapura. RSS Singapura, moored at Telok Ayer Basin, served as the 
                                SNVF's first headquarters. Thus, the newly formed naval force had only 
                                two seaworthy ships to form its sea defences.</p>
              <p>What the SNVF lacked in resources was made up for in determination 
                                and hard work. Though a small force to begin with, the SNVF underwent a 
                                period of rapid growth and development. It had started off with former 
                                members of the Royal Malaysian Navy, who were mobilised to form the 
                                nucleus of the fledgling force. The following year saw the SNVF boost 
                                its numbers to 89 mobilised personnel and 278 volunteer officers and 
                                men. Some were women from the Singapore Women's Auxiliary Naval Service 
                                (or SWANS), which had been formed in 1957. On 5 May 1967, the Singapore 
                                Naval White Ensign was hoisted with pride, signalling that Singapore 
                                finally had a navy to call its own. There was no looking back from then 
                                on, as it embarked on a gradual upgrading of its equipment, personnel 
                                and facilities. From the two ships in 1966, it subsequently grew into a 
                                modern force, and officially was renamed the “Republic of Singapore 
                                Navy” in April 1975.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v02n09_history.html">Republic of Singapore Air Force</a> also has very modest beginnings. In 1968, the Singapore Air Defence Command (SADC) was formed. It started with eight <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v08n05_history.html">Cessna 172-H</a> aircraft to train its pilots, and by 1970 <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v12n12_history.html">Hawker Hunter</a> fighter aircraft had been added to the fleet. When the British forces 
                                were withdrawn in 1971, Tengah, Seletar, Sembawang and Changi airbases 
                                were entrusted to the SADC. SADC became the Republic of Singapore Air 
                                Force (RSAF) in 1975.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of the Interior and Defence (MID) initially oversaw both
                                 internal and external defence, but as the defence structure grew and 
                                the work became more defined, it separated into two specialised 
                                ministries. Thus, the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and the <a href="http://www.mha.gov.sg">Ministry of Home Affairs</a> (MHA) were formed in 1970.</p>
              <p>When the SAF first started in the 1960s, the most urgent focus for 
                                what we now call the 1st Generation SAF was to provide for Singapore's 
                                basic defence. The 2nd Generation SAF, from the early 80s to late 90s, 
                                saw the upgrading and modernising of our Army, Navy and Air Force. 
                                Post-9/11, there was a shift in the security landscape, which widened to
                                 include non-conventional threats such as terrorism and piracy.</p>
              <p>Resource constraints and the emergence of advanced warfighting 
                                technologies also drove the SAF to rethink our development trajectory. 
                                To meet new security challenges effectively, the SAF embarked on a 3rd 
                                Generation transformation journey in 2004 and continues today to upgrade
                                 its capabilities into an advanced networked force.</p>
              Today, the SAF is respected as a strong and professional armed 
                                forces. The SAF has developed leading-edge capabilities, networked 
                                together as an integrated fighting system.</div>

              <p>Though Singapore only gained her current version of armed forces
              in 1967, the history of her defence started long before then. Under
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/the_early_years/v01n02b_history.html">colonial rule that started in 1819</a>, Singapore
              relied on British forces to protect her from all threats. A turning
              point occurred in 1854 with the creation of the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/the_early_years/v11n07_history.html">Singapore Volunteer Rifle Corps (SVRC)</a>, a
              volunteer organisation to maintain internal security.</p>
              <p>In 1888, the SVRC became the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/the_early_years/v09n02_history.html">Singapore Volunteer Artillery (SVA)</a>, and its
              success prompted formation of other volunteer corps.  In 1901,
              these were all consolidated into the Singapore Volunteer Corps
              (SVC). In 1922, the SVC was renamed the Straits Settlements
              Volunteer Force (SSVF) to include volunteer forces from Malacca and
              Penang.</p>
              <div>
              <p>In December 1941, the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v01n12_history.html">Japanese campaign into South East Asia</a> had
              begun. The British commanders had thought that Singapore was an
              "impregnable fortress", but troops stationed here were
              inexperienced compared to the Japanese forces.. On 10 Dec 1941,
              disaster struck when two British battleships, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v08n12_history.html">Repulse and Prince of Wales</a>, were sunk by
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v10n12_history.html">Japanese planes</a>. On 8 February, the Japanese
              crossed the narrow Straits of Johore into Kranji and Sarimbun,
              beginning their invasion of Singapore. For the next seven days, the
              British put up stiff resistance but were no match for the Japanese.
              Volunteer forces also fought alongside regular forces in the
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v02n02_history.html">Battles of Bukit Timah and Pasir Panjang</a> to fend
              off the Japanese. Despite all their efforts, on 15th February 1942,
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v01n02a_history.html">Singapore was surrendered</a>.</p>
              <p>During the Japanese occupation, the Straits Settlements
              Volunteer Force (SSVF) and local forces were indispensable to the
              war effort. SSVF corpswoman <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v07n10_history.html">Elizabeth Choy</a> was detained and interrogated by
              the Kempeitai alongside other locals following the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v03n10_history.html">Double Tenth Massacre</a>. Men and women such as
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v02n06_history.html">Lim Bo Seng</a> joined special operations forces,
              gathered intelligence and fought where they could. The Chinese in
              Singapore's volunteer armies were targeted during the Sook Ching
              Massacre, or sent with other prisoners of war to build the Death
              Railway.</p>
              <p>In May 1945, the war in Europe ended with <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v09n05_history.html">Germany's surrender</a>. Soon after, the bombing of
              Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August 1945 respectively
              signalled the end of Japan's war efforts. On 15 August 1945, the
              Japanese invaders in Singapore <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v09n05_history.html">laid down their arms</a> and the Japanese occupation
              was over.</p>
              <div>
              <p>The perceived failure of the British to defend Singapore against
              the Japanese during WWII caused Singaporeans to desire greater
              autonomy from the British and precipitated the formation of the
              Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). The Straits Settlements Volunteer
              Force (SSVF), which had been dissolved, was reinstated in 1949 as
              the SVC to keep peace domestically.</p>
              <p>The year 1957 saw the establishment of the first battalion of
              regular soldiers, the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v02n11_history.html">First Singapore Infantry Regiment</a> (1 SIR).
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v03n04_history.html">2 SIR</a> joined 1 SIR in 1962. Their first real
              test came in 1963 in the form of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v03n04_history.html">Konfrantasi</a>. 1 SIR, 2 SIR, the Singapore
              Volunteer Corps (SVC) and the Vigilante Corps (VC) were all
              deployed to protect strategically important sites. The VC found
              incredible support from citizens, with 91.4% of eligible men
              volunteering.</p>
              <p>On 9 August 1965, after more than 100 years of British colonial
              rule and two tumultuous years under the Malaysian Federation,
              Singapore was declared a sovereign and independent nation. It was a
              time of great uncertainty as the leaders were faced with the
              enormous task of charting the path of our national destiny.
              Nevertheless, Singapore was determined to not only survive on its
              own but to succeed.</p>
              <p>An urgent priority after independence was to build up
              Singapore's own defence capability. Singapore then had only two
              infantry battalions of 50 officers and some 1,000 men and two
              ships. There was no airforce. Singapore's armed forces had to be
              created virtually from scratch.</p>
              <p>In August 1965, the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v07n11_history.html">Ministry of the Interior and Defence</a> (MID) was
              established with Dr. Goh Keng Swee as its first Minister. The key
              priority then was to build up the Army into a credible force as
              soon as possible. With its small population and the need to channel
              resources to economic development, it was decided that Singapore's
              defence would be based on citizen armed forces. However, there was
              no military tradition in Singapore. The bulk of the population had
              traditionally held military service in low esteem. An intense
              educational effort was required to overcome such attitudes.
              Ministers, Members of Parliament, senior civil servants and
              community leaders volunteered to serve in the People's Defence
              Force. In this way, they set an example and drove home the message
              that it was the responsibility of every citizen to defend their
              nation.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v06n02_history.html">National Service</a> started two years later in
              1967. The NS (Amendment) Bill, 1967 was first read in Parliament on
              27 Feb 1967. After a spirited debate in Parliament, the Act was
              finally passed on 14 Mar 1967.</p>
              <p>The passing of the NS (Amendment) Act in mid-Mar 1967 was a
              turning point in the lives of Singaporean males. Between 28 Mar and
              18 Apr 1967, registration began in earnest at the Central Manpower
              Base (CMPB) and its district offices in Katong, Serangoon and Bukit
              Panjang. Pink reminder cards were sent by post to the first batch
              of citizens who were born between 1 Jan 1949 and 30 Jun 1949 - some
              9,000 of them. This marked the beginning of the citizen army and
              also the start of NS as a way of life for the male citizens of
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v13n07_history.html">Republic of Singapore Navy</a> (RSN) began as the
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v10n01_history.html">Singapore Naval Volunteer Force</a> (SNVF) in 1966
              with just three ships, RSS Panglima, RSS Bedok and RSS Singapura.
              RSS Singapura, moored at Telok Ayer Basin, served as the SNVF's
              first headquarters. Thus, the newly formed naval force had only two
              seaworthy ships to form its sea defences.</p>
              <p>What the SNVF lacked in resources was made up for in
              determination and hard work. Though a small force to begin with,
              the SNVF underwent a period of rapid growth and development. It had
              started off with former members of the Royal Malaysian Navy, who
              were mobilised to form the nucleus of the fledgling force. The
              following year saw the SNVF boost its numbers to 89 mobilised
              personnel and 278 volunteer officers and men. Some were women from
              the Singapore Women's Auxiliary Naval Service (or SWANS), which had
              been formed in 1957. On 5 May 1967, the Singapore Naval White
              Ensign was hoisted with pride, signalling that Singapore finally
              had a navy to call its own. There was no looking back from then on,
              as it embarked on a gradual upgrading of its equipment, personnel
              and facilities. From the two ships in 1966, it subsequently grew
              into a modern force, and officially was renamed the “Republic of
              Singapore Navy” in April 1975.</p>
              <p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v02n09_history.html">Republic of Singapore Air Force</a> also has very
              modest beginnings. In 1968, the Singapore Air Defence Command
              (SADC) was formed. It started with eight <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v08n05_history.html">Cessna 172-H</a> aircraft to train its pilots, and
              by 1970 <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v12n12_history.html">Hawker Hunter</a> fighter aircraft had been added to
              the fleet. When the British forces were withdrawn in 1971, Tengah,
              Seletar, Sembawang and Changi airbases were entrusted to the SADC.
              SADC became the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) in 1975.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of the Interior and Defence (MID) initially oversaw
              both internal and external defence, but as the defence structure
              grew and the work became more defined, it separated into two
              specialised ministries. Thus, the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and
              the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mha.gov.sg">Ministry of Home
              Affairs</a> (MHA) were formed in 1970.</p>
              <p>When the SAF first started in the 1960s, the most urgent focus
              for what we now call the 1st Generation SAF was to provide for
              Singapore's basic defence. The 2nd Generation SAF, from the early
              80s to late 90s, saw the upgrading and modernising of our Army,
              Navy and Air Force. Post-9/11, there was a shift in the security
              landscape, which widened to include non-conventional threats such
              as terrorism and piracy.</p>
              <p>Resource constraints and the emergence of advanced warfighting
              technologies also drove the SAF to rethink our development
              trajectory. To meet new security challenges effectively, the SAF
              embarked on a 3rd Generation transformation journey in 2004 and
              continues today to upgrade its capabilities into an advanced
              networked force.</p>
              Today, the SAF is respected as a strong and professional armed
              forces. The SAF has developed leading-edge capabilities, networked
              together as an integrated fighting system.</div>
