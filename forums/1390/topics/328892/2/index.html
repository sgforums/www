              <p>The thing about them is that they are the only aerobatics team in the country. Of course they cannot compete with stunt pilots cos they are not! They perform to entertain only wat. Plus, they are not full-time aerobatic pilots so u cant really expect them to be top-notch. But if u look past all these they are actually not bad.</p>

              <p>wa couldnt agree more on this. i mean this concerns our our national security, although its an open house. cant they limit it to jus singaporeans?? really disappointing.</p>
              <p>it was a really eye opener for my fiancee and me at the open hse until we saw an incident at one of the transport planes that truely disgusted us to the guts and spoiled what was a wonderful "pak tor" day for us. check this out.</p>
              <p>there was this ah tiong lady sitting down inside the plane with one of the Captains, which i reckon is a pilot. she aint the prettiest, she definitely aint the sexiest at the open house, and i m damn sure she aint the most attractive even though her make up is thicker then "kopi gao". its was so damn bloddy obvious to the core that she was trying her freaking best to impress the captain, talking to him, doin all the sickening smiles. basically blatant hooking up. and that captain was so smitten wif her. his eyes like dunno he had a duty on that day n he is in uniform god damn it! my fiancee was so disgusted by the sight she said very loudly "is he suppose to woo girls while on duty" the captain was oblivious to her comments. but i can tell u quite a number of visitors was looking at him, giving a "wat the F is this" face. worst thing is a LTA who was at the exit all along, supposedly with a duty to guide the visitors down the plane safely, saw this ah tiong and he approached her to intro himself! wa so fuking desperate! i cant believe my eyes, neither can my fiancee. aft that she was so pissed and disappointed and disgusted and so m i. our day was surely affected. seriously, we wanted to confront him and ask him wat the hell he doin, wooing girls while on duty?!?! i used to really respect the airforce and think they r the elites of our defence. but aft wat that captain displayed yesterday, i have my reservations abt them. he was an embarassement to the air force, on an open house somemore.</p>
              <p>all in all, a gd experience for my fiancee n me, but that captain truely made us sick. very sick. plz allow jus locals into such open houses in future. it is a window to show the advance technology our defence incorporates, y show foreigners wat we r doin?? we dont give a damn wat they think!??!</p>

Further more, we FDS are patrolling the fairground consistently. U are right abt the pilots, but thats their job at the open house. Is to minger with the public. </span></p>
