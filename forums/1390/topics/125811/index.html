Wait till u try out SAF Day parade. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>Trooping of colours takes about 10 mins, all the while in hormat position. Then its another 20 minutes in senang diri position while the awards are being handed out.<br><br>NDP was the most relaxing of all the parades i've done. Good food (kfc, pizza hut, ice cream, free-flow milo), good accomodation (holding area at SIS, got aircon), and parade takes place after sundown, weather so cool. The atmosphere was more fun and relaxed since spectators were mostly civilians.<br>But the casing of colours after the parade took quite long.<br><br>SAF Day was the worst. Fried to a crisp on SAFTI parade square, plus the parade was long and boring.<br><br>CDF COC for Ng Yat Chung was nothing special, rained a bit i think.<br><br>RSAF Day was soooo noisy, with fighter jets taking off about 50m behind the parade ground. Plus it was done in the morning, facing the rising sun, damn glaring.</div>
