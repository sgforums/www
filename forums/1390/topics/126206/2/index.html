Armour , gurads and infantry reservist units... They are good... as for the performance difference betw the NSF and reservist units, I think its abit sensitive to discuss here.. all I can say is..

I think in ATEC there are two core groups of people<br><br>one is the core umpires group consisting mainly senior rank personnel (senior specialists, warrant, officers) who goes to every ATEC evluation as umpires. i wonder how long their posting is, coz if they are posted there 2 years then i think they will go overseas about 20-30 times man.<br><br>the other is commonly known as AGGRESSOR coy or OPFOR coy (stands for OPpoisng FORce). this is a full company of soldiers from OC, 2IC all the way down to each individual private soldier, much like our rifle company but they are structured exactly to the northern red force's hiraechy so as to provide realistic enemy simulation during ATEC evaluations. for your info they possess much better weapons and firepower than our standard rifle company, maybe thats why its SAF policy for a battalion to take out one OPFOR coy. (3:1 ratio)<br><br>being in the OPFOR coy also means you'll travel hell a lot of times throughout your NSF stint, which is not bad at all!<br><br>other active units/battalions send out supporting personnel mainly to support the core umpires during the evaluation. </div></blockquote>You are right and you are wrong .<br>You are spot on for the 2 groups in ATEC.<br><br>You are half right on the weapons/fire power. We use SAF SOP weapons/ vehicles . Nothing special about our hardware apart the the "simulation armour Vehicle" and  some wooden RPGs. On paper, aggressors had exact configurations of  " potential red forces " weapons systems,sections/platoons/ company  fighting strength .</div>
