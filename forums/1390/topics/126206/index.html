            <div class='col-md body'>atec stands for army training evaluation center and the exercise they conduct for units (at battalion levels only) is actually the battalion proficiency test (btp) but for short everyone just calls it atec. only infantry, guards, cdos, and armor units will go thru atec. arty have their FATEP<br><br>atec now has 2 stages, not just one times atec like a few years ago.<br><br>atec stage 1:<br>it is a collection of tests that atec will conduct on your unit. this is always based locally and often involves the atec coming down to your unit to test you things like how to set claymore mines, how to operate law etc. this is when all the theory and the things you have learnt will come in handy. remember all the IA drills of weapons and all that? you got to show the umpires you know all that. basically it is a wayang show (atec also knows it is wayang) and they want to see how good you are at wayang. only a few will be selected to do each test but almost everyone in the unit participates in one test at least.<br>now this stage 1 carrys a minor weightage on the overall atec score (about 30-45% can't remember) but it is still very important to score well here. why? because your unit will confirm perform worse in stage 2 so stage 1 is for you to pull up your score. in fact most units get 80%+ (a damn high redcon 1) for this stage. think of it as like the MCQ part of exam papers. kio sai.<br><br>some of the things they test in stage 1:<br>weapon handling + knowledge<br>grenade throwing (a lot fail)<br>section battle drills (go outfield)<br>buddy aid<br>support elements got all sorts of tests<br><br>stage 2:<br>normally this is conducted in one of 3 countries : singapore, thailand and taiwan. there is actually an equal chance of each country, so there is 66% it will be overseas. stage 2 is essentially one whole exercise. Your battlation against an enemy company of OPFOR (opposition force). opfor is a special company of soldiers (also nsf) trained by atec to be the agressors in such battles. they follow the template of the saf agressor (northern neighbour) and because they constantly fight with battalions, they are extremely competent. they also are not really bound to saf's "strict template on war" so they can do all sorts of unconventional tactics. never underestimate the OPFOR. i would say they are better than 80% of the units in singapore<br>the exercise lasts a total of 4day 4night. but is normally cut short depending on how your unit has fared. an average 3 missions is usually carried out. usually a Deliberate Attack (about 36hours), Hasty Defence (18h) and Quick Attack (18h) so by the end of it is about 4days 3nights. There is an optional 4th mission usually on 2 circumstances.<br>-your unit quite screw up, so far redcon 3 to 2b, they wan a 4th to push you up to 2b to 2a.<br>-your unit quite good, at high 2a, they wan to push you to 1 (very unlikely)<br><br>so you take stage one % plus stage 2 % add up your total atec score. if i'm not wrong redcon 1 is 80% and most units never make it. most get a 2A and 2B</div>

According to the unit, they acheived RECON 1 during their NSF days under MAJ Wong Ann Chai (now COL, ACGS), another president and SAFO scholar. Thus they are ambitious to scored another RECON 1 this time. They already scored RECON 1 in ATEC part 1. Deferment is now one of their setback as most of them are either going for post graduate studies or getting married as the reason.</div>
