Armour did their ATEC either in Aussie or LCK. during my 38 days stay in SWBTA in 2001, fought a NSF armour unit, a NSF infantry unit, a reservist infantry unit and a Division . Yes infantry ATEC in Aussie.<br><br>My seniors are Guardsmen. Before I was posted to my unit, Opforce was mono intake guardsmen. Then before my posting they no longer " aggressors " to be guardsmen trained. Once in a while, the aggressors will be given a break, and other units are used as the Red Force.<br><br>The worst case I had seen, is the unit with the Sting Ray as the unit mascot. ( 5 SIR ?? ) They did their ATEC in ROC in 2001 i think. The red berets were the unit playing the aggressor role. My sympathy to the Sting Rays. They were literally turned into BBQ sting rays by the Aggressors. Cannot reveal too much info here, but among the countless ATECs i fought, I was abit shocked at the performance of the sting rays. They were unlucky to have red berets as aggressors.<br><br>Aggressors cannot do all sorts of unconventional tactics. At least not during my time. If only we are allowed to fight the exercise the way we wanted to, then I can be confident to say that the unit will be late to arrive at the fighting ground, and sustaining casualties before any fire fight. Or worse, we can even divert them to our killing zone, messing up their plans.  But we are not allowed to haress them too much. And we aggressor do give chance, or rather, being forced to. At times, the aggressor company wanted to fight unconventional ways... but being diected to give chances... politics...</div></blockquote>"Aggressors cannot do all sorts of unconventional tactics."

Altho they r just normal people, its their training that separates them from the rest. Try being in a cdo and feel the difference.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>I disagree with you. Based on my experience fighting with Infantry, Guards , Armour and Cdo, all of them are different in their own sense. Throw in the Arti, signals, engineers. All of them are trained for a specific role.  I think cannot compare 1 formation with another and say who is better than who. All have different training. Its like comparing an apple with an orange. Maybe comparing NSF infantry with reservist unit might be more balanced. I do see a difference btw NSF and reservist units. I can really see the fighting spirits and experience in the reservist units.<br><br>I agree with you that Cdo  training is tough. But they really think that they are bullet proof, and simply charge at  entrenched enemy firing directly at them. I respect their courage for doing so.While they are physically and mentally fitter than infantry, they are just as vunerrable to bullets and grenades as any human soldiers.    The style of Cdo Atec is flawed. Special ops are very difficult to assess.<br><br>I have nothing agst any formation, I respect each and every of them for their tough training. But i feel the style of Atec for Cdo still have room for improvement. Maybe shld be like the Artillery assessment.Its own separate type of assessment</div>
