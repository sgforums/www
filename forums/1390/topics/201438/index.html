            <div class='col-md body'>During your BMT fieldcamp you will learn all sorts of individual field crafts like how to setup your arc of fire using the arc of fire sticks, how to apply camo cream the correct way, how to judge distances, leopard crawl, light and noise dicipline etc.. the whole concept of BMT fieldcamp is to let you get use to the wild. Many people used to complain about their skin problems before going for their first fieldcamp but in the end most of them pass their BMT fieldcamp without much problem. Skin irritation is just a minor problem and should be easily over come. Don't be afraid of getting dirty cause alot more worst thing is going to happen when you go fieldcamp with your unit.</div>

Be aware of things like not to trip over comscord lines used to fix the basha, be careful of where u prone and things like dat. Just dun be afraid of the dirty, and the demoralising wet weather.

The night poured soo heavily,but i was all warm and cuddly in the hammock .. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But i think BMT field camp is the worst i would say ...sleep in the basha , need to maintain field discipline, rocky ground, scared of instructors stealing weapons, dame</div>
