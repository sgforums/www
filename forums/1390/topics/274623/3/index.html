"Mortal Combat" was rained out when I was there. Instead of a "2-sided battle with the Tactical Engagement Systems", everyone was talking cover inside the training shed ~lol~ From what I surveyed, I'd mistakenly thought this was the paintball arena.<br><br>1d. "Rambo 07" was small-weapons (SAR-21, M16 etc.) firing but wayang cuz it's all with blanks while aiming at tactical targets.<br><br>1e. "Virtual Land" was a bit like Singapore Science Center, but with combat simulations (3D viewpoint of sniper, recee trooper, combat engineer, etc). Surprisingly no visitors when I was there, maybe it's located a bit out of the way.<br><br>1f. "The Hitman" was live-firing with the SAR-21, but I missed it. Must take bus to the range, anyway.<br><br>2. "ACTION WORLD"<br><br>The daily schedule lists "Urban Operations Show" at 1pm, "Heroes On Parade" (marchpast?) &amp; "Red Lion Freefall Display" at 3pm, "Homeland Security Show" at 7pm, plus fireworks at 7:30 during the weekends.

I think this is supposed to be a movie or something of what the future SAF &amp; battlefields will look like. All I saw were flickering images standing outside (they were hosting it for the big shots) before I lost interest.<br><br>4. "DOWNTOWN WEST"<br><br>4a. "Yummy Land" got free samples of combat rats but, get this, they are also selling regular army meals (Vegetarian Set, Muslim Set, etc.) at $5 each!<br><br>4b. "Family Land" was a playground for the kids, plus also introductory booths for SAF Yacht Club &amp; the like.<br><br>5. "MISSION WORLD"<br><br>I confused this one with another &amp;, together with the stop-star rain, ended up missing it altogether. My priority rtoo, after first scouting it on the AOH wensite. Damn!

Damn! Damn! Damn!<br><br>6. "BATTLE RIDE WORLD"<br><br>The one I confused the above with, but at least this was satisfactory.
