            <div class='col-md body'>Based on the "complain" bt the 36 year old below... I kinda know what COL Benedict (SAF Spokesperson) is going to reply...<br><br>He will first defend SAF saying there is some confusion by Mr Tan that Mr Tan overlooked the unit he was supposed to report. This issue is resolved by SAF and Mr Tan.<br><br>Then he will say, Reservist is for the defence of the nation and nothing comes before this. SAF is flexible with reservist training but certain arrangement cannot be considered...  bla bla bla..<br><br>let us look out for his reply.<br><br><blockquote>NSman called up for first ICT at age 36<br><br>I WAS surprised to receive notice recently of my first In-Camp Training (ICT) at the age of 36.<br><br>How could Mindef expect NSmen to complete the full cycle of their ICT if they start only at 36? Does it mean that NSmen have to go for longer and more frequent ICTs each year in order to do so?<br><br>As most NSmen of this age are at the peak of their careers and many are in senior-management positions, going for ICT would definitely affect business operations.<br><br>More importantly, most of these NSmen would have families with young children. They have to manage both busy work schedules and taking care of the family.<br><br>I have appealed for deferment after the first request was rejected. Until today, I have not heard from Mindef despite numerous calls to the National Servicemen Services Centre (NSSC). I was told by the NSSC staff that they could not transfer my call to the person in-charge, nor could the person in-charge call me or my employer.<br><br>I didn't even know which was my unit until I called the NSSC to find out, and even then the staff do not have the contact number of the unit.<br><br>Tan Thiam Huat</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am surprised at this complaint.<br><br>Why can't MINDEF serve notice of ICT at age 36 ? The law allows up to age 40 or 50, whichever is relevant.<br><br>Most will get the full cycle so that the unit is operationally ready. There will be some that cannot go through the full cycle for some reasons. Is Mr Tan suggesting that once you reach the age of 31, and cannot complete the 10 years cycle, you are out ?<br><br>Different people peak at the careers at different age. Is Mr Tan going downhill immediately after this since he is now at his peak ? All NSF says that at age 18-22 is their peak, and they should be going to Uni. Then at age 25-30, it is their peak again to climb the corporate ladder, then now 36 is still the peak of one's career !!!<br><br>Mr Tan is probably non-multi-tasking. There is a new peak ahead, and he probably cannot see it.<br><br>What is there to appeal ? He should just go ahead to report and serve like everyone else. I think we can all recognise the lapse. I hope SAF gives a firm answer. When told to serve, do it.<br></div>

At least that is the perception. heck, ask around and you would likely know someone who ought to have been called back already but haven't.<br><br>Otoh, if I book an air ticket, and the flight is imminent, it is beyond the realms of possiblity that I can get on the plane without a ticket or an E-ticket. Hence, I would call the company can give them a bollocking they won't forget.<br><br>Anyway, there are people in the Army paid to make sure there are no admin cock ups. As such, the onus is on the Army to make sure that their employees earn their keep.<br><br>Of course, an argument could be made that he should have been prepared to come back anytime before he is 40 since those are the terms. However, I think point of contention here is that the Army could probably have called him back earlier avoiding the current situation. Why did they not? Was if avoidable? If so, why wasn't it avoided? After all, it is not inconceivable that a 36 year old man would have trouble playing soldier...</div>

NSman callups are determined primarily by the manpower needs of the NSman's unit. As such, Mindef is not able to guarantee that all NSmen will complete their 13 year cycle well before they reach forty years old.<br><br>Of course, we try to minimise the inconvenience caused to NSmen. Yet operational needs are such that some NSmen, such as yourself, will only be called up years after they ORD.<br><br>We ask Mr Tan to be more understanding.
