            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously i am always thinking about this question:<br><br>If NSmen and NSFs are going to do the fighting? What the regulars going to do? If we pay tax and still have to suffer with this type of crap must as well we become some foreign talent. Foreign talents come here with no liability while we work like a dog during NS life. In the end? do we get better pay? or better respect outside? No!!! we just treated like a fool. So we work hard pay tax and serve NS to allow the government to take in more foreign talent so that we can protect them. Seriously, What is WRONG with the government. The concept doesn't make sense at all. They just copy from whoever country who is using it and just copy whole sale without using their puny little brain. I think must be the SFI food causing them not to think. Follow Management of the SAF forces. Please work at least to your pay scope. Don't throw all the bloody work to the NSFs, We get 350 to 770, I think we deserve some appreciation instead of treating us like a dog. I know Foreign talent can replace us, then make them serve NS then You no need Singaporean who grow up here. You can always employ mecernaries next time. Everything also Foreign one. that day will come.......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it's equivalent to no answer at all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Still, his "until they have completed their National Service training cycle or reached the statutory age limit, whichever is earlier." is encouraging.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>That means if you reached 40 as a man, you more or less have to go into the reserve list liao, right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>administrative oversight</strong>Haha very lame and predictable and i am wondering whether will the person whom is responsible for the oversight get something,will the mistake be repeated again? hhahahahahaaa (confirm cover up <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">) But anyway i think Mr Tan also trying to find fault in this situation cause he should have known that someday they will send him for reservist As an old NSman,he should know that in the SAF no matter how you complain,when the time has come for u to serve,whether as an NSF or NSMan,you still have to serve one loh,complain no use one who know maybe he will get something worse(Unit,etc,etc) since he make such a big issue in the straits times.Hence i think it is best to keep a low profile lah.</div>
