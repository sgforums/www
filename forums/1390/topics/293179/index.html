            <div class='col-md body'>See the great similarites between how the Qing dynasty and the SAF works<br><br>1. In the Qing dynasty there is only 1 person the Emperor making all decisions. His decision is always right as he is the Emperor. You are expected to listen to him whether you agree or don't agree. He will punish you if you don't listen to him.<br><br>There is only 1 person in the SAF making all decisions. He is ah Teo<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  When he makes a decision, you are expected to listen to him whether you agree or don't agree.<br><br>2. In the Qing dynasty you will always be bullied by your superiors and there is nothing you can do. Of course you can try to complain to a higher ranking person but these officals are good friends. You complain to a higher ranking offical and he will tell your superior and they will tortue you even more and you will die 1 day without even knowing why.<br><br>In the SAF you will always be bullied by your superiors and there is nothing you can do.

In the Qing dynasty you can try complaining to the Emperor when you suffer an injustice but your petition will probably never reach him as it is thrown into the rubish bin before the Emperor can see it because it is regarded as junk mail.<br><br>In the SAF you can try complaing to ah Teo but your complain will never reach him.

The Qing dynasty is incompetent. Same goes to the SAF<br><br>5.
