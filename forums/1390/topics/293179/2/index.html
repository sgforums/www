Higher level can plan alot of stuff, they plan big but very often they plan and implement alot of things that are illogical are just not practical and its the bottom people that suffers.<br><br>Alot of plans made by the higher levle people just takes into account what they want to achieve. Once implemented, we have to follow their plans and how often does it make our work even more difficult than before, wasting even more resources than the old system does? Many loopholes in the system are not really rectified well and very often we work like shit to get things right and just because things look right when it reach higher level, they feel their plan was great...<br><br>If you want say people are frogs in the well then i would say the entire place is covered by wells with frogs in them and higher management see everything but what the frogs can see which when added together will be a larger picture because we know how things work on the ground better than they do.</div>
