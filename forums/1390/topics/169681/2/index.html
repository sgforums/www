            <div class='col-md body'>well for one,i know that maju camp pti are actually really slack already in their training.How do i know? i went for RT twice there already and both time the training is really relax,i have friends who went there too for RT and they tell me if they wonder it is any form of RT at all as the exercise done are so light.<br><br>So i doubt we can blame the PTIs.What is to blame is the stressful working life in singapore and too much good food around leaving some finding it hard to keep up their fitness and be more healty.Most servicemen do not know their real limits and since RT is a hog of servicemen's time,some of these servicemen push themselves way too hard to try to pass the test so they will get out after phase 1(esp 2.4 km run),result when they push themselves too hard thinking they can do it when they actually can't will result in such cases.<br><br>I can understand it cos i am doing that now too,everytime i run 2.4km,i am not feeling good but try to push myself to finish it to get it over with and after finishing it,i will almost totally collapse from the heat and physical exhaustion....haiz a far comparision to those easily attained below 9.00 timing during my peak years in full time NS.<br><br>So it will be good if they actually adjust the 2.4km requirement,it is a killer for people who can't get themselves even partially fit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly - my condolences, RIP to a fellow revervist.<br><br>I'm also past 35 years old. Although I don't have any known problems - I do get worried sometimes. Mindef better take a good look at its medical procedures. The expect high standards from our servicemen, as if we are fulltime professional soldiers, but how many have died this year to causes undetected during medical checkups??<br><br>The last time I went for my FFI at 35 - I didn't even receive any results.<br><br>Anyone now if this is the first such case of death during RT?</div>
