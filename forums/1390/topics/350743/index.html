              <p>When transport charge their drivers, they don't really care whether it was the driver's fault or the civilian fault. The driver will still have all the accumulated millage reset as well as made to pay for the damage to the vehicle on most occasions. He would be consider lucky if he was not charged already. Not fair but thats generally what happens to drivers involved in any accident.</p>

              <p>I have had drivers having civilian cars banging a MID vehicles rear when the MID vehicle is stationary at the traffic light and the driver was still stripped of all his millage so how fair do you think MINDEF treats their drivers?</p>

              <p>Regardless whether its the driver's fault, millage is immediately reset due to accident records. This is what the transport supervisor told me when i was inspecting the vehicle and base on the statement submitted to me, the driver was not at fault.</p>

              <p>MID vehicles are really hardy thats for sure. Out of 10 accidents report i have to write, i think more than half the vehicle was not damage and i had to just charge the driver the minimal inspection charge with paintwork since i cannot submit an accident report saying no damage was found and no repairs were done.</p>
