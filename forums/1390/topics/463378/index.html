              <p>This website serves to inform employers and NSmen on NS matters pertinent to them.<br> <br> As an NSman, you have certain rights, responsibilities and privileges. 
                                During your 2 years of service as an NSF, you have been trained as a 
                                fighting soldier. Now, you will be joining the rest of the NSmen, as 
                                part of our frontline soldiers and the main fighting force that defends 
                                our nation.<br> <br> You will find information on your responsibilities as an NSman in this 
                                website. It also outlines the various NS initiatives and subject matter 
                                which you will need to be familiar with as an NSman. For instance, the 
                                NS Training System (NSTS), NS call-up, deferment, disruption, Individual
                                 Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT), NS pay, medical services as well as 
                                the recognition and benefits for NSmen.<br> <br> As an employer, you will naturally have employees who have a dual role 
                                as a citizen soldier. This website will equip you with the necessary 
                                information on Make-Up Pay (MUP),  the NS requirements of your NSmen 
                                employees, as well as how you are able to support Total Defence through 
                                the Total Defence Awards (TDA).</p>

              <p><strong><a title="Conscription" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription">Conscription</a></strong> in <a title="Singapore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a>, called <a title="National service" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_service">National Service</a> (NS), requires all male Singaporean citizens and second-generation 
              permanent residents who have reached the age of 18 to enroll for 
              national service. They serve a 22- or 24-month period as Full Time 
              National Servicemen (NSFs), either in the <a title="Singapore Armed Forces" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces">Singapore Armed Forces</a> (SAF), <a title="Singapore Police Force" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Police_Force">Singapore Police Force</a> (SPF), or the <a title="Singapore Civil Defence Force" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Civil_Defence_Force">Singapore Civil Defence Force</a> (SCDF).</p>
              <p>When a conscript completes his full-time service, he is considered to
               be "operationally ready", and is thereafter known as an 
              Operationally-Ready National Serviceman (NSman). NSmen are the 
              equivalent of other countries' <a title="Reservist" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservist">reservists</a>.</p>
              <p>The overwhelming majority of the conscripts serve in the <a title="Singapore Army" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Army">Army</a>,
               as part of the SAF. The reasons for this include the relative manpower 
              needs of the Army compared with the other armed services, the SPF, and 
              SCDF. In addition, as compared to the Army, the <a title="Republic of Singapore Air Force" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Singapore_Air_Force">Air Force</a> (RSAF) and <a title="Republic of Singapore Navy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Singapore_Navy">Navy</a> (RSN) are smaller services composed primarily of regular servicemen. As
               the RSAF and RSN's manpower needs tend to be more specialized, a 
              constant turnover of staff is considered to be very disruptive.</p>
              <p>Singapore is among the list of countries with a national service 
              exceeding 18 months and a reservist obligation lasting up to age 40 for 
              enlisted men and 50 for officers.<sup id="cite_ref-CIA_.3D_The_World_Factbook_1-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conscription_in_Singapore&amp;printable=yes#cite_note-CIA_.3D_The_World_Factbook-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Until June 2004 it had a mandatory national service periods of 30 months.</p>
              <h2><span id="History" class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
              <p>The NS (Amendment) act was passed on 14 March 1967, as the <a title="Government of Singapore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Singapore">Singapore government</a> felt that it was necessary to build a substantial military force. The 
              country had only about 1,000 soldiers at independence. In the late 
              1960s, the <a title="Government of the United Kingdom" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom">British government</a> had decided to withdraw its troops and bases <a title="East of Suez" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_of_Suez">East of Suez</a>,
               including troops stationed in Singapore. That prompted the government 
              to implement a conscription program for the country's defence. It 
              adopted a <a title="Conscription" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription">conscription</a> model drawing on elements of the <a title="Conscription in Switzerland" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Switzerland">Swiss</a> and <a title="Conscription in Israel" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Israel">Israeli</a> national conscription schemes. This was done with the help of Israeli 
              military advisers, who were closely involved in the establishment of the
               Singapore armed forces.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conscription_in_Singapore&amp;printable=yes#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The stated rationale behind conscription is twofold. Firstly, because
               Singapore has a population of about four million (as of 2004), an army 
              solely of <a title="Regular army" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_army">regulars</a> would be too small to defend the country. Secondly, national service is supposed to support racial harmony among the <a title="Chinese Singaporean" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Singaporean">Chinese</a>, <a title="Malays in Singapore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malays_in_Singapore">Malay</a> and <a title="Indians in Singapore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indians_in_Singapore">Indian</a> communities. Malays were virtually excluded from conscription from the beginning of the draft in 1967 until 1977<sup id="cite_ref-alon_3-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conscription_in_Singapore&amp;printable=yes#cite_note-alon-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> and, after the policy was eased, were assigned mainly to serve in the 
              police and civil defence (fire brigade), not in active combat roles.<sup id="cite_ref-alon_3-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conscription_in_Singapore&amp;printable=yes#cite_note-alon-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> In 1987, <a title="Lee Hsien Loong" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong">Lee Hsien Loong</a> (then Second Minister for Defence) stated that "If there is a conflict,
               if the SAF is called to defend the homeland, we do not want to put any 
              of our soldiers in a difficult position where his emotions for the 
              nation may be in conflict with his religion"<sup id="cite_ref-lee_4-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conscription_in_Singapore&amp;printable=yes#cite_note-lee-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> and in <em>The Roar of the Lion City</em> (2007), military analyst Sean Walsh claimed that "official discrimination against the Malay population remains an open secret".<sup id="cite_ref-walsh_5-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conscription_in_Singapore&amp;printable=yes#cite_note-walsh-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The Ministry of Defence contests the charge, noting that there are "Malay pilots, <a title="Singapore Armed Forces Commando Formation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces_Commando_Formation">commandos</a> and air defence personnel" and stating that "the proportion of eligible Malays selected for <a title="Specialist (Singapore)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialist_%28Singapore%29">specialist</a> and <a title="Officer (armed forces)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_%28armed_forces%29">officer</a> training is similar to the proportion for eligible non-Malays."<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conscription_in_Singapore&amp;printable=yes#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <h2><span id="Enlistment" class="mw-headline">Enlistment</span></h2>
              <p>According to the Enlistment Act, conscription is mandatory for all 
              "persons subject to [the] act", defined as those who are not less than 
              16 years and 6 months of age and not more than 40 years of age, with 
              some exemptions and with no specific bias to gender (not limited to 
              males).<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conscription_in_Singapore&amp;printable=yes#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In practice however, male Singaporean citizens and second-generation permanent residents who registered <a title="National Registration Identity Card" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Registration_Identity_Card">NRIC</a> at 15 years are required to register for National Service upon reaching
               the age of 16 years and six months, during which they would also be 
              required to undergo a mandatory medical examination (<a title="PULHHEEMS" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PULHHEEMS">PULHHEEMS</a>)
               to determine their medical status, known as Physical Employment Status 
              (PES), which is used as a guideline as to which vocation the person is 
              placed in.</p>
              <p>Male children who take up permanent residency status through their 
              permanent resident parent's sponsorship will be required to serve 
              National Service like other Singaporean males.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conscription_in_Singapore&amp;printable=yes#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> However, most male citizens enlist in <a title="Recruit training" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruit_training">Basic Military Training</a> (BMT) at the age of 19 for <a title="Junior college" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_college">junior college</a> graduates or 20 for <a title="Institute of technology" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_technology">polytechnic</a> graduates.</p>
              <p>Exemptions are rare and are usually due to disability or serious 
              medical conditions certified by the SAF Medical Board. One instance of 
              rare cases of exemption would be if the enlistment would cause hardship 
              to the enlistee's family, financially or otherwise, although this 
              exemption is rarely granted.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<em><a title="Wikipedia:Citation needed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from June 2010">citation needed</span></a></em>]</sup></p>
              <p>They are then called up for enlistment at the age of 18, but most 
              Singaporean males would usually choose to complete their tertiary 
              education in the respective polytechnics, high schools, junior colleges,
               pre-university courses or other institutions before starting the 
              mandatory duration which they are required to serve. Those who 
              voluntarily opt for early enlistment with the consent of their parents 
              are allowed to begin full-time national service at the age of 16 years 
              and six months.</p>
              <p>In the past, the duration of the conscription for a typical 
              Singaporean male spanned over a period of either 2 or 2 years and six 
              months depending on his educational qualifications. In 2004, the 
              duration was reduced to 2 years, driven by the transformation into the 
              3rd Generation SAF and enabled by the surge in NS intake for the next 10
               years.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conscription_in_Singapore&amp;printable=yes#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> As a further incentive, the NS duration may be cut by a further two 
              months, if potential enlistees are able to obtain a silver or gold for 
              their physical fitness test (<a title="National Physical Fitness Award" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Physical_Fitness_Award">NAPFA</a>) prior to enlistment.</p>
              <h3><span id="Refusal_to_serve_and_conscientious_objection" class="mw-headline">Refusal to serve and conscientious objection</span></h3>
              <p>Those who are liable to serve national service but refuse are charged under the Enlistment Act.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conscription_in_Singapore&amp;printable=yes#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> If convicted, they face three years' imprisonment and a fine of 
              S$10,000. Controversy arose when the penalties were increased in January
               2006 after <a title="Melvyn Tan" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvyn_Tan">Melvyn Tan</a>, who was born in Singapore, received a fine for defaulting on his National Service obligations. Tan left for <a title="London" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London">London</a> to study music during his enlistment age and later acquired British nationality. In <a title="Parliament of Singapore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore">parliament</a>, Defence Minister <a title="Teo Chee Hean" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teo_Chee_Hean">Teo Chee Hean</a> provided some illustration of the punishments defaulters would face:<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conscription_in_Singapore&amp;printable=yes#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the default period exceeds two years but the defaulter is 
              young enough to serve his full-time and operationally ready NS duties in
               full, MINDEF will press for a short jail sentence.</li>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot serve his 
              full-time NS in a combat vocation or fulfil his operationally ready NS 
              obligations in full, a longer jail sentence to reflect the period of NS 
              he has evaded may be appropriate.</li>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot be called up 
              for NS at all, a jail sentence up to the maximum of three years may be 
              appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Each year, a small number of people are convicted for their failure to enlist or refusal to be conscripted.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conscription_in_Singapore&amp;printable=yes#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> Most of them were <a title="Jehovah's Witnesses" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>,
               who are usually court-martialled and sentenced to three years' 
              imprisonment, but they are usually held in a low-security detention 
              facility and separated from other conscription offenders. The government
               does not consider <a title="Conscientious objector" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector">conscientious objection</a> to be a legal reason for refusal to serve NS. Since 1972, the 
              publications of Jehovah's Witnesses have been outlawed in Singapore.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conscription_in_Singapore&amp;printable=yes#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> This is commonly misinterpreted to mean that Jehovah's Witnesses themselves are outlawed in Singapore.</p>

               NSFs undergo a 9-week Enhanced BMT program. Those from lower 
              educational backgrounds and mono-intake recruits undergo a similar 
              program (standard BMT program), but without a Situational Test (Sit

              This usually applies to non-obese, low-education level conscripts. The

              become commanders, i.e. have an education level of polytechnic or 
              A-level or equivalent. Lowly educated obese recruits also go to Pulau

              <p>Though a majority will serve in the army for their National Service, a number of enlistees will serve their NS years in the <a title="Singapore Police Force" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Police_Force">Singapore Police Force</a> (SPF). Those who have been chosen to serve in the SPF undergo training at the <a title="Home Team Academy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Team_Academy">Home Team Academy</a> where they study the <a title="Penal Code (Singapore)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_Code_%28Singapore%29">Penal Code</a> and standard police protocol. After training at the Academy, they will be posted to various departments of the SPF, such as <a title="Special Operations Command (Singapore)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Operations_Command_%28Singapore%29">Special Operations Command</a> (SOC), Logistics, Land divisions, Airport Police. Those posted to the <a title="Police Coast Guard" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Coast_Guard">Police Coast Guard</a> (PCG) or Police KINS will undergo further training. Selection of <a title="Officer cadet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_cadet#Singapore">Officer Cadets</a> (OCTs) to undergo the NS Police Inspector Course (NSPI) is a stringent 
              process for Police National Servicemen (Full-time). Usually, a very 
              small number, about three, from each cohort will be selected, with the 
              majority of the OCTs being the Singapore Armed Forces' National 
              Servicemen (Full-time) who have completed their Basic Military Training 
              (BMT).</p>
              <h3><span id="Civil_defence_service" class="mw-headline">Civil defence service</span></h3>
              <p>The <a title="Singapore Civil Defence Force" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Civil_Defence_Force">Singapore Civil Defence Force</a> (SCDF) is the emergency rescue force of Singapore and they provide <a title="Firefighting" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighting">firefighting</a>, <a title="Rescue" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue">rescue</a> and <a title="Ambulance" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance">ambulance</a> services, and has been one of the three National Service postings since
               1972. Those enlisted into the SCDF typically undergo seven weeks of 
              training at the Basic Rescue Training Centre (BRTC), where they are 
              given basic rescue training (BRT), exposed to regimental discipline, and
               trained to maintain a level of fitness required of all NSFs in 
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>Much like the SAF's SISPEC course, selected NSFs are also posted to 
              the Civil Defence Academy (CDA) to undergo the Firefighter Course (FFC) 
              or the Emergency Response Specialist Course (ERSC) within the first two 
              weeks of their BRT stage, passing out as Firefighters for FFC trainees, 
              and as Fire &amp; Rescue Specialists for ERS trainees who would also 
              simultaneously be conferred with the Sergeant rank (Firefighters mostly 
              pass out as Privates prior to station posting). Firefighters would 
              typically be posted out to the various fire stations island-wide after 
              passing out, while Fire &amp; Rescue Specialists would be posted as 
              Section Commanders at territorial division, fire stations or at the 
              Special Rescue Battalion; based largely on rankings at the time of 
              course completion, a small number may also be posted as Instructors back
               in the CDA to staff the Command and Staff Training Center (CSTC), 
              Specialist Training Center (STC), or Firefighting Training Center 
              (FFTC).</p>
              <p>While a certain level of health and fitness pre-requisites are 
              expected by both the FFC and ERSC administrators before one can be 
              selected for these courses, admission into the ERS course typically 
              requires a certain set of additional qualifications, namely either a 
              minimum of a <a title="GCE Advanced Level" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCE_Advanced_Level">GCE Advanced Level</a> certificate, a <a title="Diploma" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diploma">Diploma</a> or a Higher Nitec Certificate. These added pre-requisites are viewed as
               necessary in the light of a Section Commander's operational and 
              administrative role when posted out. One marked difference between the 
              FFC and ERSC is the added rescue and emergency training received by ERS 
              Specialist Cadet Trainees (SCTs), as well as the General Command &amp; 
              Control Term, which includes the Basic Home Team Course held at the Home
               Team Academy and an outward-bound <a title="Brunei" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunei">Brunei</a> trip which serves to equip and develop the necessary leadership skills 
              required of a specialist junior officer. In terms of administration and 
              duration, the FFC is under the charge of the FFTC and lasts three 
              months, while the ERSC is under the purview of the CSTC and lasts six 
              months.</p>
              <p>In addition, there is also the Basic Officer Course under the charge 
              of the CSTW, designed to train NSFs and regulars as Senior Officers of 
              the SCDF, with NSFs graduating as <a title="Lieutenant" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant">Lieutenants</a> (LTA). While the BOC is traditionally largely made up of NSFs from the 
              SAF who had just completed their Basic Military Training (BMT) at <a title="Pulau Tekong" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulau_Tekong">Pulau Tekong</a>,
               the top 5-10% of the ERSC will also be offered to cross over to the 
              Basic Officer Course (BOC) to be trained and commissioned as Senior 
              Officers after passing out, spending the last three months of the BOC 
              together with Officer Cadet Trainees (OCTs).</p>
              <p>NSFs who undergo the full 7-week basic rescue training at the BRTC are subsequently posted and trained to become medical <a title="Orderly" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orderly">orderlies</a> (medics), <a title="Police dog" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog">dog handlers</a>, <a title="Military police" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_police">provosts</a>,
               information and communications and logistics specialists or instructors
               (such as Physical Training Instructors) among many other vocations upon
               passing out from the BRTC.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conscription_in_Singapore&amp;printable=yes#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
