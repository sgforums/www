              <p>For your 1st question, I cannot answer you since I am not from the Navy, but I can answer some of your other questions.</p>
              <p>For Pes E people, regardless of where you are sent, you will most likely either be a clerk or a storeman.</p>
              <p>They should have told you what extra things you needed to bring to CMPB via your letter, otherwise, all you need to bring is yourself and your identification.</p>
              <p>And staying in wise, odds are you will need not stay in given your PES, but then again, it is also dependent on what vocation you are posted to. Sometimes storemen need to stay in as they need to prepare equipments needed for exercises at as early as 3 in the morning, so it is hard to say.</p>

              <p>why are you shouting, I been through log PT as well.....i understand what happen if the height difference in the team may cause someone to like he's carrying the whole log...I know there was a time when BMT removed log PT, I don't know is it to certain coy or to the whole BMT. During my times, we were even required to carry the log throughout the field, surely u can imagine what happened if everyone pace is different.</p>

              <p>1.where is the navy headquarters?</p>
              <p>2.what is life like over there for a pes e fella?</p>
              <p>3.what do i have to bring when i report to cmpb for enlistment ( have to go there first,wld be sent to hq later from there )</p>
              <p>4.wld i have to stay in?</p>
              <p>i called mindef hotline and i swear to u the guy didnt know anything.</p>
              </div>

              <p>I'm currently in the RSN. Since your pes status is E and your reporting venue is CMPB, you will go to your unit directly on your day of enlistment. Someone will pick you up and bring you to your unit.</p>
              <p>After CMPB that line is HQ RSN means you will be posted to any units under HQ RSN. Most of them are in Gombak, with one each at Maju and CMPB itself, and a couple each in Changi and Tuas. You are likely going to Gombak.</p>
              <p>Life is basically clerk job with essential office duties (open and close office aka duty clerk) and necessary camp duties (depending on which camp and whether you are called up or not)</p>
              <p>You just bring your beloved NRIC and your enlistment letter on your enlistment day. You will be given a bag, a notepad, a pair of dogtags and your 2 year companion called the 11B. You will sing the National Anthem and take the Oath at the enlistment venue.</p>
              <p>I have never heard navy clerks staying on their first day of work. You will get to go home on the first day so dont worry.</p>
              <p>MINDEF hotline is crap. You made the wise choice of asking in the forum.</p>
              <p>Where you stay? Need directions on how to get camp?</p>

              <p><br>Take off from work very not worth especially if its half day. It costs you 16min to get from the Pass Office to Tanah Merah, not forgetting your route home. The farther you live, the more your off will be eaten by your journey home.</p>
