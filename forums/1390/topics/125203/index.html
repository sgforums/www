            <div class='col-md body'>As a Licencing Clerk last time in army, i believe I can answer your questions hehehe....<br><br>1) Yes if you hit 7000Km during your service period. If your vocation is a driver, then no worries, you are likely to hit that mileage and above. When you hit that mileage, you can apply to convert your military licence to a civilian one at the end or near the end of your 2 or 2.5 yrs of service.<br><br>2) Nope everyone can be sent to us for driving courses. But of cos DRIVER vocation is only for MAN lah not officers. Officers normally come to us because they need a licence to drive maybe for admin details or for some other misc purposes. Or if their vocation is like Recce Trooper etc.... as when their vocation needs but their driving will not be as much as DRIVERs.<br><br>3) During my time, its mostly manual... maybe now got automatic... not so sure..</div>
