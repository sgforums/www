The mobilisation of large numbers of army people probably attracted the news reports more, which is probably part of the plan, since if any first strike were to be made, it certainly wouldn't be the army doing it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I don't care to scold my employees, in fact why should I lose my temper over incompetencies. I give a warning, then another with my HR, and the next time, he is fired. In the SAF, you may get all the scoldings, be put off for promotion, but you don't lose your job overnight.<br><br>I want to correct the notion : surviving the SAF means you can survive anywhere - WRONG !<br><br>Its the personality and work attitude that counts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the SAF : Good attitude does not gaurantee survival because it is crowded with bad attitude people. Street smarts will probably survive because you say what your Bosses wants to hear. You help your Bosses cook up reasons, excuses, manipulate figures and make nice presentations. You basically draw your salary from the same 'grandfather', with little pinch to anyone.<br><br>In the commercial market : Street smart people who does little work will be found out very soon. Bosses are paying $$$ for results, not reasons, excuses, or manipulating with language and numbers, pen and paper play. They want more $$$ back, physically. Your Boss give you $ and wants you to earn him $$$$$$$$$.</div>
