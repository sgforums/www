I took it to my BMT and my PS confiscated from me and did not give me back. I thinking of complaining but afraid that he may say I took pics of armstoke or others secret photos and such. It's been quite a while since it happened. I do not want to get charge or anything.</div></blockquote>yes it is..<br>u already know the reason y your PS confiscate your camera hp..<br>it is a offence to bring in camera hp after a warning..<br>y bring in a camera hp when u know its gona cos all this trouble..<br>n y complain? u are in the wrong the 1st place n still wana cry foul?<br>your PS is kind enough just to confiscate your hp..he can just bring it up straight to your PC..n its no turning back..<br>the only thing u can do is ask for the return of ur hp after u POP..<br>n pls dun bring it into any SAF camp...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My pc knows about it and he say serves me right. Maybe I should write in to say that they stole my fone. I got my section mates who are willing to be my witness that I never bring the fone out of my bunk so no chance to take armstoke pics. But bad thing is I have to go court, but let's die together.</div>
