            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Second Sergeant Rajagopal Thirukumaran, one of 3 soldiers who died recently during training, may have pushed himself beyond his limit during the Ranger Course selection test, says his father.<br><br>This could have caused his son's death, said the father, adding that he hopes the military will tighten medical checks to better gauge the fitness of soldiers.<br><br>Rajagopal Thirukumaran's family and friends call him Kumaran.<br><br>After 6 weeks of grieving, Kumaran's family is still shocked by his sudden departure.<br><br>They were emotional and tearful when they talked about how they're coping without their beloved Kumaran.<br><br>Madam Vijayalakshmi, Kumaran's mother, said: "I'm still thinking he's still somewhere, never think he's dead because it is unbelievable. I miss him so much. I'm keeping my heart strong and hoping he'll reborn to one of my family and come back again."<br><br>Kumaran's father Rajagopal said: "At times, when I go to sleep, I used to think a lot. That's why I go back to work and keep my mind free a bit. If I'm alone, I'll think about him."<br><br>Kumaran's younger brother Kannan said: "Very emotional, if I think too deeply. So I just think that he's still around, just brave myself up and be there for my parents."<br><br>Kumaran had always wanted to be a commando just like his father.<br><br>He even wanted to bring glory to his father by making it to the Rangers Course.<br><br>His father, a first warrant officer commando, had tried for the course when he was young but failed the selection test.<br><br>Rajagopal said: "Maybe because of that - 'my father couldn't make it to the Ranger, I want to make it'. He told his CO he's doing it for his father. He went beyond the limit, he wanted to push for the best timing."<br><br>Rajagopal isn't looking forward to the forensic results of his son's death.<br><br>He hopes the authorities can tighten their medical screening and prevent such unfortunate incidents. - CNA<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/52932/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/52932/1/.html</a></div>
