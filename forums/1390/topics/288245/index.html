You will still be required to take annual IPPT if you do not have excuses for it. Mob manning you can still be called up to be on standby and they won't bother whether you student or not since their answer will be recall will be weekend and you don't study (my friend kanna so i know). ICT unlikely unless they choose to have it during your long holiday then i don't know can excuse or not.<br><br>2. All workplace in s'pore have to support NSman going back for reservist. Regardless what sort of work you do, there is no excuse from reservist since its only 1-2 weeks anyway and won't affect your work too much.<br><br>3. As long as you are overseas, you won't be called back for reservist i think. You should be able to defer your mob manning and reservist especially if you have proof that you are working/studying overseas on long term basis.<br><br>Just a side note, if you get posted to 1TPT at Semb camp, i'm interested to know which coy you posted to since i know many of the sect comms and regulars there since they cause me quite abit of problem while i was working with them :p</div>

From their CSM down to their section comms most know me quite well i guess since i call them ALOT for all the problems they often give me...<br><br>I won't say its very bad or anything but alot of work procedures can be greatly improved and their ES skills need ALOT of improvement.

There are many ways to cover those.<br><br>Seeing that you're in 1 TPT BN, it's possible that you won't be touched. The likelihood may depend on your PES.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>1) I am going to NUS for undergrad studies after this. Will i get called back for reservist? </blockquote>Depends on which outfit you're posted to. If it's a combat one (i.e. becomes ops-ready after NS), then you'll almost certainly obliged to do reservist during your semester vacations. Either with this unit or, if not, probably with the next-ORDing one. My old experience in Arty was such that every other batch is designated an "IHL" unit (Institute of Higher Learning), meaning a number of its commanders &amp; men are full-time varsity students &amp; as such the CO must plan his first few ICTs around their off-term breaks. The troops will do the IPPT during these ICTs, but can tio RTs &amp; mob-manning/recall-IC duties all year around.<br><br>In turn, the ex-Poly grads join/stay with the non-IHL unit, though it must be said that this overall tertiary "segregation" isn't a blanket practice either.<br><br>If you don't end up thus frontline, then it'll depend on your appointment in the rear outfit. A MT-line posting, for example, is quite hands-on &amp; can get you redeployed anywhere they need you. That said .....<br><br><blockquote>2) Also, after i graduate from NUS Faculty of Dentistry, i have a 4-year bond with the Ministry of Health that i have to serve. Will SAF call me back for reservist if I have to serve a government bond? </blockquote>....I agree with the others that you'll likely be converted. It's a highly-trained profession you're studying for, &amp; the SAF will likely take advantage of this. (Yes, bonders must liable for reservist.)<br><br><blockquote>3) After i finish serving my bond, i plan to move overseas and work overseas. Will the SAF call me back for reservist? And if SAF does call me back, and i cannot come back due to work, what happens? </blockquote>Once your exit permit application is approved, you'll be basically disrupted from reservist &amp; repost-able back to the holding list (more so the longer you're away). But bear in mind that your NS liability won't end until you turn 40 or 50 -- not sure the age limit for dental officers -- &amp; you may be called up again upon your return (even if at an age when your peers have already finished their cycle &amp; have stood down).</div>

It's no use worrying about it now.<br><br>As to whether you can keep your vocation, it really depends on many things out of our control. If your PES status is favorable, i.e combat fit, you may end up in a PDF unit as a support coy sect comd or  2IC given that you will be a 3SG, though that's just one example.</div>

If so on both, then it's likely everyone will stay together for reservist. If not, then anything can happen. Yes, you'll retain your vocation if you don't convert.<br><br><blockquote>Also, as far as i know, the faculty of dentistry at NUS has different vacation terms compared to the rest of the university.

When you're nearing ORD, you'll do a FFI, for starter's -- so let's that it from there.<br></div>
