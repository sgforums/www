            <div class='col-md body'>That's why we have all those alert mannings, brother. Then if we do come under attack, whichever unit is on standby can be deployed as a holding force. I suppose they'll engage the enemy forces in a holding action until the rest of the SAF can be mobilised and deployed.<br><br>This was what happened during the Yom Kippur War. Egypt and Syria launched a combined attack on Israel, thinking that since it was a public holiday, operational readiness would be low. They thought it would take 24 hours for the Israeli reserve to reach the front lines, but they did so in just 15 hours.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually it would take all of the military and government to be sleeping for any country to launch a surprise attack on us.<br><br>Unless the launch 1 or 2 battalions only, which will be a pretty futile effort, otherwise mobilizing multiple units - draw arms and ammo, have transport unit start moving in our direction, have ships manourvering to take better blockade or attack positions, numerous aircraft loading and taking off, will definitely draw attention from various monitoring units.<br><br>Radar, humit, signals, satellite and other assets would pick up such movements pretty darn quick.</div>
