              <p>Hi, I went for the CMPB medical checkup today. Everything was okay. However, when the medical doctor reviewed me, he asked me whether I've any heart/ chest pain during physical exercises, only then I recalled almost every jog/ run about 1.4km, I would panting profusely due to my chest area hurts. So MO gave me a referral letter for further reporting order to double check at National Heart Centre for any heart problem for safety and care for soldiers.</p>
              <p>The problem is, I've just applied to sign on as a career SPF regular Police Officer (PO), though subject to PES A/ B1 combat-fit status. I'm thinking if I can unilaterally cancel the further reporting order (FRO) referral on my own via calling CMPB as the mandatory further follow-up is kinda affecting my job application to SPF since it's compulsory for at least one parent to accompany. Is SPF going to send me again for CMPB medical checkup one more time to assess my PES? Does SPF receive the PES information from CMPB, the Central Manpower Base? By the way, the minimum entry requirement of SPF is a PES A/ B1 for male applicants.</p>
              <p>Please advise. Thank you.</p>

              within the Central Manpower Base (CMPB). This examination allows
              the medical fitness of a pre-enlistee to be assessed and this
              subsequently determines his Physical Employment Status (PES).<br> <br> <strong style="font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit;">Medical
