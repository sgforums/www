              <p>more on history, i got injured because i was sect com for a attack mission.</p>
              <p>had to carry my field pack plus sect com bag plus along the way i carried mathodor. march 6 km to the objective. my problem was i didnt strap properly therefore the blood flow to my arm was cut. after attack mission, went to defense mission. i didnt fall out as my friends depend on each other. we need to dig fire trench and own self-scrape. i completed the field camp with my arm still numb.</p>
              <p>went to MO at sispec.... OOC.. sian...one more month to gradurate...</p>

              <p>Most of the sign on specs who convert to officer that I know of are those that got golden bayonet that kind during sispec,best in PT etc...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reality is that very few specs manage to convert to officer even if it is to sign on,unless it is for Air Force or those kind of specialized engineering officer post.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you did not get selected for OCS crossover after your BSLC,then the chance is already quite low.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nevertheless,you STILL have a chance.You might want to talk to your S1 or OC about your chances to convert to officer first.They will be the in the best position to advise you.In fact,talk to them about life as an infantry officer in the army and what is your potential CEP(Career End Point).They will give you the reality of what working in the army is like and whether they think you will be suited for it.The more direct route would be to contact ARC(Army Recruitment Centre) directly but they tend to pose a very "flowery" picture.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If your OC/S1/CO all say that you are not suited for life as a regular or your chances are low,then you will have a hard time because you need strong testimonials from them to convince ARC to convert you.A strong recommendation from a LTC always helps.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the mean time,upgrade your PES first and clear your IPPT as that is a must before they will even consider you.If you do manage to convert,you might want to try out a short term contract of about 3 years first to see if you like that kind of life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What I said is based on my observation of fellow NSF specs who tried to sign on as officer before I orded.</p>

              <p>You are weird. Others cannot wait to get out and you are dying to get in.</p>
              <p>Pardon me, but I don't think signing on is a good choice unless you don't see yourself in any other fields. You should think over other alternatives first. If you sign on, you are bonded. What if you don't like the regular army life after your contract, what are you going to do then, with the time spent inside while others in ur batch is already way ahead...</p>

              <p>Yes,try to clear your IPPT soon.Make sure you get at least silver as the ruling is that regulars must get at least silver each work year or it will affect their career prospects.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why I say the testimonials are important is because the moment you indicate interest in converting to officer for signing on at ARC,they will most likely send an email down to your unit asking for character and work references from your bosses. If they all give favourable reviews, you will have that extra backing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think of it this way...if a LTC/COL can fork out the time to write you a testimonial even if it is a short one,it does say alot about you. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Maybe what you're looking for is a career in the outdooor adventure field, maybe a camping instructor, expedition leader, etc. Maybe the army may not be for you.
