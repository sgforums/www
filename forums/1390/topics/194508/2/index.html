It is comparing apples and fruits. Commando, Fruits. Scouts, Apples.<br><br>Commandos, apples and oranges.<br><br>Everything a scout platoon learns; commandos would have learnt it and more.</div></blockquote>If comparing Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol (LRRP) with scout, maybe the LRRPs could be better trained. However, if comparing a strike company (coy) commando (cdo) with scout (assuming that this is the group you are referring to), I would say that both are entirely different.<br><br>Strike coy cdo are better trained on assault, infantry manoeuver then on reconnaissance techniques, while scouts are better trained in the latter to provide human intelligence (HUMINT) to their parent unit. In addition, scouts are also trained in various optical and signal equipments which probably a strike cdo have never even thought that it exists. Based on these reasons, it can be said that scouts are fundamentally different to a strike coy cdo and as such it may not be necessary that a cdo would have learnt it and more.<br><br>One good example would be a scout is generally trained to drive a jeep or ride a bike but not all strike cdo are trained in these aspects.</div>

I think I have been cheated....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>We did it with carbine once "for fun" (which the Bgd Comdr saw, which...), there was a difference, the shorter length made it less cumbersome.  And the psycological thought that the carbine is lighter (barely) made it seem so muh more easier.<br><br>Didn't do ATP since as recce we weren't supposed to be assaulting pple.  We did DTP.  At 100m hard to miss, even with carbines.  The SAW guys had a good time.</div>
