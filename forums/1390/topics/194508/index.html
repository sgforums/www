            <div class='col-md body'>Scout platoon acts as the principle humint branch of the battalion. They go out before the battalion to gather information for the Bn S2. Thats as far as I'm willing to go, the rest is still restricted stuff so you gotta find out yourself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This should go for other units as well, scouts typically get around on bikes, so it can be a lot of fun. Yes, your platoon will directly be under S2's command and overall can be a better life compared to a normal trooper.</div>
