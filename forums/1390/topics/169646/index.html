            <div class='col-md body'>I also need advise, cause i also got a friend kena 1SIR rifleman and knowing him very well, his not the type that would find any form of joy and motivation being there. His been super low ever since he read his posting. I too have been through this kinda mental torture whereby you wake up every morning feeling super shitty and low and it last throughout the rest of your day. Looking ahead you don't see any light because this lifestyle is gonna stay for a long time to come. I was lucky I only surfered for a couple of months before finding a way out, any longer I would have gone mental. But for him, his gonna be there for 1 year+ and I don't think there will be anyway out for him. His body is pretty perfect, no past injuries.<br><br>Not saying I want him to downgrade and get out, I know in the long run his gonna look back and say it has been a good experience, but I just wanna help motivate him to get through the initial stage of coping and adapting, not wanting him to suffer this mental torture for too long. yet I don't know what to say or do, it pains me to stand there helplessly watching him suffer, any advice to both of us?</div>

Over-rated the siongness) + your fear that you might not physically able to take it. My advice is all those thinking are uncalled for.<br><br>If what you are thinking is what I mentioned above, just follow these (Dun think of other things):<br><br>1. Dun think so much. Time to eat, eat. Time to play, play. Time to train, train, etc. Think day by day (Do not think/plan for wks/mths/yrs like in sch). Think positive and have fun with platoon mates.<br><br>2. Make more friends.<br><br>3. Enjoy your adventure.<br><br>The unit will train you to be fit, and assign each a weapon (training provided too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ). There will be a lot of outfield camps - Group, Session, Platoon, Company, etc Levels outfield training (You may not like or used to outfield, but you will get season - Dun worry).<br><br>What I can say after going thru' is: WORRY IS UNNECESSARY (Dun waste brain cells or energy to think so much). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
