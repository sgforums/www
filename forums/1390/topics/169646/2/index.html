            <div class='col-md body'>my advise to u, which is basically the same as everyone here, is to take it easy, don't think too much.<br><br>yes i understand the feeling the uncertainty whenever u are doing something new in a new environment. but once u get used to it, u won't feel so bad. learn to adapt, don't always think of the negative, look on the bright side.<br><br>being a rifleman is siong yes i agree, but at least u get to learn more things, see more stuffs that other poeple don't. and trust me, these are the very things that make up the memories.<br><br>when u meet up with friends in future, u will has tons of topics to talk about. and as what i'll tell the juniors, since u are in this for 2 years already, why further waste it by complaining, worrying about this and that or worst chao keng. may as well make full use out of it right? don't leave behind regrets.<br><br>good luck in your new vocation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mate...I know the feeling when things are not within your control. It sucks and blows. But lots of people feel the same way. Lots of people who serve NS the world over hate it with a passion...you'll find at least a few other NSFs who think the same too tomorrow. Try to befriend them, confide in them, and grow together - they will support you when you need it most. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Errmmm........ I am not sure whether u r in time to see this but I am going to say this to make u more at ease and more assured of ur well-being in the infantry vocations.<br><br>I ORD for abt 6 mths liao and last time I am from the Guards vocation which is also an infantry like vocation, but we just do more like heli-ops and naval-insertion ops.<br>When I first receive my posting, I was also like u worried, sian and feel totally depressed. This is due to the popular myths of guards veri siong, the welfare sucks, and many ppls dying in Brunei forest, etc........ Furthermore, most of my company mates got into service side vocations or commander sch vocations like OCS, thus it makes me feel veri left out. In fact only me and my other two friends got into this vocations,........ all the way from SFT to Pasir Ris inter-change, ppls were mocking at us getting into a vei siong vocations.<br>BUT, I kept an open mind despite all this disappointment and look forward to my challenges lying ahead of me in the new vocation.<br>Upon entering unit, I felt there was a geat change in environment, also there was a great culture shock. Unit usually emphasis more on field training and lesser on discipline. In the first year usually they train u in ur personal equipments and field movement and tactics. They also train u to fight in small units like a section, then progress to platoon level, then eventually company level. Usually second yr is more action packed with lots of life-firing and battalion exercises. If u are 'lucky' u might even get a brigade ex or something else. Just try to make frens and be more on the ball when u do things. Also personally, I can't see well in the nite too......... this is due to vapour on my glasses, but as time go by, u will get used to it.</div>
