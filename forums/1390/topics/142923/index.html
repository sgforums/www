Look at the JAM back than and now... now is so much smaller ie lesser.</span><br><br>They have been called Operations Rations;Combat Rations; or Field Rations;, but all three terms would conjure up the same image to our veterans of the past - green packets of hard biscuits, stout cans of beans and a brown box plainly labelled jam;. These were the food supplies for soldiers when they went for outfield training, food that could be eaten quickly while still providing the energy needed for a soldier hungry after a gruelling days work.<br><br>1968: WHEN RATIONING BEGAN<br><br>Rations were first introduced into the Army in 1968, consisting of dehydrated meals and enough to last a soldier a day. It is not documented what exactly the rations were at that time, but reports showed that the soldiers did not generally find the food palatable. Improvements were steadily made and when the revised rations were introduced in 1970, they were reported to receive better acceptance.<br><br>1975: THE WEALTH OF RATIONS<br><br>Rations had to be eaten fast while soldiers were on the move, and they soon earned the nickname of fast food. There were two different types of rations: conventional type rations and lightweight type rations meant to be eaten on the go. Furthermore, there were different menus to cater to Muslim and vegetarian diets.<br><br>For all the ration types, the staple was twelve packs of hardtack biscuits that provided 65% of the total energy yield for a soldier. Soldiers found various ways to eat the biscuits - with pineapple jam, or broken into pieces, soaked in lemonade and eaten as porridge. Canned food was the main source of protein, with baked beans, sardines, pork cubes, braised chicken and vegetarian food on the menu. The meals were supplemented by chocolate, sweets and vitamin tablets to round off the nutrition a soldier needed for a day.<br><br>1994: ACQUIRING A LOCAL FLAVOUR<br><br>1993 saw more research and studies done for a review of combat rations with the rapid advancement in technology and the changing needs of soldiers on the modern battlefield. Feedback from soldiers was also taken into consideration.<br><br>The main issue was having hardtack biscuits as the staple food, with complaints about the dryness of the biscuits as well as the need to consume a large quantity of biscuits to meet a soldiers dietary requirement. With the food mostly having to be eaten cold, food items like sardines and baked beans proved unpopular. Added to this was the need to provide a greater quantity and variety of food, based on feedback from soldiers that the daily food supply was insufficient and the menus repetitive.<br><br>The new rations were thus adjusted, and while still small, light and portable, they offered improved nutrition, variety and taste to satisfy soldiers. The menus now catered to an Asian palate with rice as the staple, and also included drinks and a dessert to round off the meal. There was even a supply of solid fuel, matches and tissue paper.<br><br>Today, soldiers can enjoy dishes such as Nonya curry rice and seafood pasta, with red bean or soya peanut dessert, supplemented by energy food bars and instant drink mixes. To continually improve the variety, Singapore Food Industries and HQ Supply &amp; Technology are coming up with new dishes every year while still ensuring adequate taste and nutritional value of the food. Currently, in the works are dhal rice with chicken, oriental seafood noodles and chilli flake glutinous rice.<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/armynews/image/issuePic/2_153.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So was there any variety in the rations ? Especially for the canned food ? like 2 cans of braised chicken, 2 cans of pork cubes, 1 can of curry chicken for 6 days outfield etc ??? or u get 6 cans of pork cubes ?<br><br>Not too sure which JAM packets you are refering to..but the current rations i ate back in 2001 didn't have any Jam packets even..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Woah - not seen this for some time. I liked the chocolates, jam, lemonade and the hardtacks. Sometimes we give them out to kids during overseas training in Thailand and Taiwan. (The kids really like them)<br><br>Normally - I would bring my own rations - bread for the first days, than small canned hotdogs, a cocktail fruits, etc. My buddy just loved the canned fruits I bring on exercises. Also, had instant noodles with me.<br><br>I remembered some guys on exercise in Thailand were too lazy to open the can of pork cubes - they just threw the can into a fire they built. Minutes later, the whole can exploded - pork cubes everywhere.<br></div>

Pour water from water bottle (Its been noted that water directly tap destroys the taste. Must be direct from water bottle.) Use spoon to crush the softened hard tack and finally add Pineapple Jam.

Step 3 mix chilli padi into sardine can. Va Va Voooooom! Add lemonade powder-mix to taste.<br><br><strong>4. Chocolate Bar</strong><br>No recipe here.
