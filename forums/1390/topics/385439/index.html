              <p><span id="intelliTXT"> hi, i have a few questions i wish
              to ask. after bmt (i pop'ed recently, posted to rp, bking in on mon, 21
              dec, tmr) i went to a psychiatrist and i was diagnosed with adjustment
              disorder with anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (with magical
              thinking). i got a report from the psychiatrist since its a private 1.
              i think also that i may have missed out some things i hesitated/felt
              uncomfortable to say. i think i have depression also, partially because
              when ppl notice my strange behavior, washing hands excessively etc,
              they start to talk or even make fun of it (i find stay in gives more
              time for others to notice my problems). i am not too good at
              socializing also, i dont have many friends even outside ns, so at
              night, i only call home, sometimes i nv even tell my parents my
              problems ... i feel that maybe i am containing all my problems making
              me feel worse etc. in the 2nd half of my bmt, i nv even talk much
              anymore ... <br> <br> oh and i also mentioned that arms and stores are things that make me
              wash even more, it was stated in the report, that i fear arms. not the
              stores part tho. <br> <br> the report also recommends that i be downgraded to a non combat vocation because of my problems. <br> <br> i am posted to rp, and i wonder on my 1st day, will i get a chance to
              see MO? i guess i will try and declare whatever i didnt tell the
              private psychiatrist, even if i feel uncomfortable ... <br> <br> what actions do you think the MO will take? can i request i see a SAF psychiatrist ASAP? advice welcomed </span></p>

              <p>Hi iceangel89,</p>
              <p>I don't think you will get a chance to see the MO on the first day at your new unit unless you sound out your problem. It is important for you to show your report to your superiors, though there is no guarantee that they will allow you to see the MO.</p>
              <p>It will be better for you not to request to see a SAF Psychiatrist, as the MO may straight away assume that you are attempting to malinger. Instead, show him the report, and he will likely sound out to your superiors and give you some medicine to aid your condition. After a few weeks, if your superiors feel that there is no improvement, they may sound this out to the MO, who in turn will send you to see a SAF Psychiatrist.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>wow. How do you manage to POP for BMT then?</p>
              <p>Anxiety is just fear and nervous. I bet you cannot sleep well recently, because you are exposed a new environment. Tomolo is a new day, new environment.Â </p>
              <p>Do relaxationÂ exercise. RP is a slack vocation you can relax.Â </p>
              <p>If you wan to downgrade then consult the mo after a few days.</p>

              <p>Hi iceangel89,</p>
              <p>I don't think you will get a chance to see the MO on the first
              day at your new unit unless you sound out your problem. It is
              important for you to show your report to your superiors, though
              there is no guarantee that they will allow you to see the MO.</p>
              <p>It will be better for you not to request to see a SAF
              Psychiatrist, as the MO may straight away assume that you are
              attempting to malinger. Instead, show him the report, and he will
              likely sound out to your superiors and give you some medicine to
              aid your condition. After a few weeks, if your superiors feel that
              there is no improvement, they may sound this out to the MO, who in
              turn will send you to see a SAF Psychiatrist.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
