            <div class='col-md body'>3 more weeks to my POP date supposedly. But because of a leg injury, i have been away for close to 2 months. My MC ends and i am returning. I am still not declared as OOC because i have not seen the MO. I have a couple of questions though, hope the knowledgeable people can take their time to answer. Thanks in advance.<br><br>1. Since there is no way i can get myself back into training and pop, it goes without saying that i am gone case. Confirm OOC and temporary downgrade am i right? How do i go about doing it though? Do i actually report sick, approach the MO and then ask him "can i OOC?" Sounds inplausible and stupid. Yet there seems to be no other choices! I cannot possibly go back and walk 24km road march after <strong>not</strong> attending any road marches. Also, i missed range and field camp. The annoying thing is, seeing how things work in tekong, if i dont find a solution myself, they will probably just put me back into training when my MC ends without me knowing a thing about what's going on. Gun drills, outfield, combat training, i dont know a damn thing!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br>So can someone tell me, how am i supposed to go about getting myself OOC and come back for a recourse in future. I dont mind a recourse, but i mind attending lessons with no basic knowledge at all. What should i do now?!<br><br>2. Is there a posibility while people go on their 1 week block leave, i am the only guy staying behind in company line to do odd jobs and to face all the instructors and officers since i cannot pop. This is a very scary thought heheh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> . Or will i more likely be posted out first to a unit then come back in future for recourse (is this a norm?).<br><br>3. Any posiblity of OOC people being posted to combat? with us not knowing any basics and all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For Artemis, I guess you are in either E, G or K company if i am not wrong.<br><br>Anyway, towards the end of the BMT, your PC will bring up such cases to your OC and maybe to CO (if need be) to see if you qualify for "attended" BMT status.<br><br>Attended BMT means you did go thru BMT but did not pass any test criteria. But you need not recourse BMT. To qualify, you will be accessed on attendance and personal discretion of PC/OC/CO. What matters is they will decide if you are ready for "next phase" of training. For the attendance portion, they have a formula to calculate your attendance. It's not simple Secondary school (50/50 days) but rather a weightage.<br><br>Anyway, for your case, you might be a "re-bmt" case. Since you really miss too much.<br><br>Your recourse might be the next intake since PES BP personnel can only go PES BP companies.<br><br>For Ah-soh. Recourse is not always towards ORD date. It's really lots of factors.</div>
