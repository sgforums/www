              <p><br>Someone who was an officer in NS, "does not implies he have good EQ to lead people" blah blah..bad english duly quoted. So does it mean that someone who is proven to be of zero leadership calibre in NS, always has leadership qualities outside of NS? Clearly not.</p>
              <p>For every one example of an NS officer who do not have good leadership qualities after ORD, I can pull out 10,000 examples of the same among the non officers. In fact, among the pool of officers, there is a far higher % who are holding leadership positions in the civilian world compared to the % among non commanders.</p>
              <p>In other words you can talk out of your ass until the world ends, but the fact remains that you cannot prove that being either poorly educated or a non-officer in NS makes you any more qualified as a civilian leader, even if it's not always 100% that all NS officers turn out to be good civilian leaders. As I write on, I doubt you have the necessary intelligence needed to understand, which is just sad, however at least I can benefit the others. There's also a big diff between absolute numbers and %, and the concept of statistical outliers, all of which I don't think you can understand.</p>
              <p>Your attitude is so bad, the things you said so atrociously self-congratulatory (for nothing, no achievement whatsoever) and self-justified, that you don't even have the basic good attitude needed to be a productive workhorse/worker bee in society, let alone the higher calibre needed for leadership positions.</p>
              <p>You're so so so far off the basic criteria needed for decency in my world,..and you're the kind of losers who rile and badmouth elites in jealousy? When i put you beside any of them that I know, you can't even compare to their shit honestly. For people who know both sides, its just simply amazing to the mind.</p>

              <p>As for TS's query, just use your brains. No need to solicit for opinion in an open forum where the chance of getting a rubbish reply like the first one you got is high. Lots of losers justifying themselves on the internet, or using the net to soothe their broken egos. If there is no currency in officership in NS, no one would be putting it in their CVs. Do people put it? Yes. Period.</p>
              <p>When I see a CV from someone who ORD as a REC, my 1st instinct is that he's a lazy fucker with bad attitude. Period. When I field such applications in future, I will definitely throw the CVs into the dustbin. If he ORD as a REC and went to local uni, I will put it in the shredder.</p>
              <p>My brother looks through applications almost every month for the family business, and he says those with highly suspicious bits in their CVs which jump out, like if the guy ORD as a REC, or his "diploma" was finished in 6 months or his "degree" is one-yr only but calls himself an "overseas grad" but actually studied in a private school in Beach Rd, these will be chucked into the trash immediately, given that these days there are so many applications for a single position, its necessary to eradicate the first 90% for any manner of reason so that you can shortlist the ones you call up for interview.</p>

              <p>While it may be true that being an officer in NS may prove that that person has a certain level of mental fortitude and leadership that may help one succeed in the working world, it does not show that ORDing as a recruit necessarily shows that you are a "a lazy fucker with bad attitude".</p>
              <p>If all employers look at applicants the way insidestory and gang does, it is no surprise that foreign talent are getting employed over locals.</p>

              <p><br>Getting promotion or never get any promotion during full-time NS is not something important but if a serviceman never get promoted during NS n remain as a Private, it certainly said something of the character. If someone finished service as a Liutenant, it is an accomplishment n for entry into local MBA programme, one of the criteria is getting rank of LTA during NS. There is a downside to it as Spec n Officer got to serve longer reservist period.</p>

              <p>It is rare. SAF encourage every one to go through BMT. So they send people down for the course. If you are injured, you will undergo modified BMT.</p>

              <p>Those who are able to keng the max and be a rec even after ORD
                                      is the smartest</p>
              <p>From my experiences, those who are recruit or private, are
                                      usually the big bosses outside. When I ask them, why?/what happen?
                                      Their replies are, WHAT SAF HAVE GIVEN you to make you work so hard
                                      for them? Why should you listen to some1 who is just one year older
                                      and have a bar on his shoulder? The diver/commando chong so hard at
                                      the end, only ended up with injuries that companied them for
                                      life.</p>
              <p>Think about this, people who have not passed out from BMT, are
                                      not vocational-trained, in another words, they normally ended up as
                                      clerk or storemen = non-combat vocation. They book out everyday, no
                                      guards duties, the free time that they have after office hours can
                                      be used for enjoyment, doing part-time....Even after they ORD, they
                                      are "useless" in the SAF, therefore their reservists are also not
                                      so siong.</p>
              <p>If you are able think or long term and have foresight you know
                                      that how you act will today will affect the future.</p>
              <p>Besides, employer dont look at military rank when they employed
                                      people. So what if he is a officer in the army, it does not implies
                                      he have good EQ to lead people in the outside world. Besides, for
                                      people who have completed Bachelor, Master, Phd, NS is an jail term
                                      that they have done 5 to 10 years ago.</p>

              <p>3. A computer engineer - Storefront guy at Funan</p>
              <p>4. A restaurant owner - Hawker</p>
              <p>5. Violinist!!?? - Guy who has a violin</p>
              <p>By the way, since when was playing a violin big business?  There's clutching at straws, and then there's laughably pathetic.</p>

              <p>I've never had such a pitiful applicant cross my path before, but if I had I wouldn't even waste my time pointing him towards the door.  Let's face it - how difficult is it to pass BMT?  If a guy doesn't have the capability to do something so basic, he's useless to me.  If he does have the capability and has simply not done it because he's too childish to deal with something he doesn't like for a mere three months, he's worse than useless.</p>

              <p> and more... </p>
              <p>Rec/Private are the extremist  they are rare breed now. But
              usually they are injured and yet not
              downgraded permanently.</p>
              <p>When a personnel is trained, he will be given a vocational rank
              which is at less a LCP. </p>
              <p>But the Rec/Private case, can only happen when he is injured
              during BMT, get a temp status, but upgrades later on, but still
              OOC. In  that case, at the end still he does not have a
              vocation, working as a TSS. </p>

              <p>how does a computer engineer or a violinist translate to big bosses ?</p>
              <p>But nevermind, that aside, you claimed that these people keng'ed and therefore, they are successful, that they are "smartest" (sic)</p>
              <p>fine .... my question is still ... especially now that you've reveiled yourself to be a C9L2 corporal, did you follow their example and made something out of your life ? After all, you claimed that they keng'ed and got slack vocations and 8-5 jobs during NS with a lot of time for themselves and therefore, they were successful.</p>
              <p>Hey  ! you had exactly all that too ! Slack 8-5 vocation at HQ and all ......  all that without having to keng !</p>
              <p>Were you then, smart enough to follow their example and make something out of you own life ? Or is kenging a neccessary ingredient, and you were too stupid to do that ?</p>

              <p>Those who are able to keng the max and be a rec even after ORD
              is the smartest</p>
              <p>From my experiences, those who are recruit or private, are
              usually the big bosses outside. When I ask them, why?/what happen?
              Their replies are, WHAT SAF HAVE GIVEN you to make you work so hard
              for them? Why should you listen to some1 who is just one year older
              and have a bar on his shoulder? The diver/commando chong so hard at
              the end, only ended up with injuries that companied them for
              life.</p>
              <p>Think about this, people who have not passed out from BMT, are
              not vocational-trained, in another words, they normally ended up as
              clerk or storemen = non-combat vocation. They book out everyday, no
              guards duties, the free time that they have after office hours can
              be used for enjoyment, doing part-time....Even after they ORD, they
              are "useless" in the SAF, therefore their reservists are also not
              so siong.</p>
              <p>If you are able think or long term and have foresight you know
              that how you act will today will affect the future.</p>
              <p>Besides, employer dont look at military rank when they employed
              people. So what if he is a officer in the army, it does not implies
              he have good EQ to lead people in the outside world. Besides, for
              people who have completed Bachelor, Master, Phd, NS is an jail term
              that they have done 5 to 10 years ago.</p>
              <p>haha....</p>
