              <p>LOL. I understand it gets irriating. But  it clearly shown that he is bored in SAF. That is the problem, he is bored and have nothing to do. So he seek recognition for what he is. He may not know that he is actually irritating you. Talk to him. Tell him, "Hello, you are flooding my text message box!"</p>
              <p>Sometimes, my friend on ICT also flooded my sms box.Because they are so bored in the bunk. When it gets overwhelming, it is better to tell him.</p>

              Hi TS, just live and let live. With that kind of attitude, he won't last long in the SAF. He'll be getting a lousy ranking year after year and eventually be asked to leave the service.
              
              The biggest joke is him saying:
              "My career in SAF surpasses u NSF,i have been to istana."
              
              So what if he has been to Istana? Any one of us can go to Istana during an open house. It's not that difficult to:
              
              1. Take MRT to Dhoby Ghaut Station
              2. Exit the MRT near Plaza Singapura
              3. Walk the short distance to the Istana main gate
              
              Unless he's been to Istana to receive a medal from our President, which given his attitude is highly unlikely, otherwise, tell him to just STFU.

              <p>Hi Prince, hope you can answer my qns as a regular:</p>
              <p>Is it true that if assigned to the Istana, your career in the SAF will suck? The reason being that you are doing guard duty and helping out at the presidents' ceremonies, and not advanding professionally like others.</p>
              <p>In the first place is it even possible to complain about this regular to the SAF?</p>
              <p>Have you attended the warfighter course?</p>

              Hi alize,
              
              1. The officers 'helping out at the presidents' ceremonies' are the Aide-de-Camps. There are three full-time ADCs and a corps of honorary ADCs (these are drawn from the ranks of SAF, SPF and SCDF officers).
              
              http://www.istana.gov.sg/content/istana/presidentsoffice/aidesdecamp.html
              
              Honorary ADCs have their own posting, but get called in to assist in ceremonies as and when needed. Some are even NSmen.
              
              As for the full-time ADCs, it's just like any other posting. They would eventually be posted to other postings where they will continue advancing professionally. In fact, a few former ADCs have went on to distinguish themselves in the SAF. They include our former CDFs LG(Ret) Winston Choo and LG(NS) Desmond Kuek.
              
              http://www.mindef.gov.sg/content/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/army/army_news/News_Archive/2011/Apr2011/ADC_2011.print.html?Status=1
              
              Those doing 'guard duty' are from the Provost Unit, most (if not all) NSF.

              2. TS can write in by all means but whether any action would be taken in the end is anyone's guess.
              
              3. No. Have not attended warfighter course.

              <p>Thanks.</p>
              <p>Cos I was reading Army News. One MAJ served as an ADC for 8 years and one ME7 (which is a high rank) served for 13 years!</p>
              <p>I was asking about warfighter course, for which someone showed me the reading list (quite interesting and can be downloaded by public). One of the essays is critical of the army becoming more and more like the civil service (like when there are such professional ADCs). Another essay or speech talked about some careerist and unpleasant officers doing very well in the SAF because the ranking system does not filter them out effectively. The writer was very angry with such officers but he had no way of "removing" them.</p>
