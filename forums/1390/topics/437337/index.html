              <p>RSAF pilots and those who have been through the application please come in!</p>
              <p>I am currently JC 1 student, and it may be too early for me to ask this, but nevertheless i hope my doubts can be cleared.</p>
              <p>Like many teenagers who yearn to be an airforce pilot, i applied and joined the Singapore Youth Flying Club (SYFC) to learn flying. I have read widely that getting a PPL can skip the airgrading course in RSAF and boost the chances of getting in. I know it is extremely strict and difficult to make it to the PPL phase. Due to study committments (as i am in JC not poly, since the poly students get more flexible timing and more time to fly), i was behind time in phase 1 and was unfortunately phased out after completing sortie 6. The instructor told me that i had potential but due to their timeframe, SYFC won't let me continue as i was 5 sorties behind my batchmates who made it into phase 2. By that time, the next batch are already overtaking my batch. Thus, i was very disheartened and i fear that it may affect my chances of becoming an RSAF pilot. My instructor told me to tell the interviewers that i was stopped from flying due to time and he will tick the box which says i have the potential to be a pilot.</p>
              <p>Anyone that only completed phase 1 of BFC, successfully become a pilot? I really hope that my experience in SYFC would not backfire and in turn led to me not getting selected as i only managed to complete phase 1. I really wants to be a RSAF pilot.</p>

              <p>Hey! I was also in the exact same situation as you. I applied for 
              syfc and joined it a few years back. However, I only managed to complete
               phase 1 due to their strict timeframe, I was too slow haha. I was very 
              disappointed and demoralised when i got phased out but my instructor 
              still gave me a good testimonial and tick the potential to be a pilot 
              box. Like you, i wanted to be an airforce pilot so during my last 
              semester in poly i applied for the pilot voccation and i have thankfully
               managed to clear my compass,interview and medical.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the point is you don't have to worry so much. Completing only
               phase 1 in syfc does not ruin your chances of getting selected. However
               during the pilot interivew they are definately going to ask you why you
               only completed phase 1 in syfc. They key is to be humble and admit your
               mistakes. So all the best and good luck!</p>

              <p>Let's just say that compared to the man on the street, you do have a slight advantage during the interview as the fact that you did apply and manage to fly a few sorties with SYFC shows you have interest in aviation. However it more or less ends there, and its a level playing field once again.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Those with PPLs from SYFC do get to skip airgrading, but asides from that, once you get to BWC its more or less equal already. There are those without any aviation background doing very well in flight training, and conversely, there are those with SYFC PPLs who end up getting chopped in the early phases of BWC. It all boils down to your attitude and aptitude.</p>
