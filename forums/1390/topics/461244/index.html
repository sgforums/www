              <p><strong>Total Defence</strong> (or <strong>TD</strong>) is the
              name of <strong><a title="Singapore" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a>'s comprehensive
              defence strategy, adapted from countries like <a title="Denmark" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a title="Sweden" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden">Sweden</a>, <a title="Switzerland" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland">Switzerland</a> and <a title="Austria" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria">Austria</a>.</strong></p>
              <p><em><strong>It is based on the understanding that besides
              military action, aggressors can also defeat the country by wrecking
              its <a title="Economy" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy">economic systems</a>, tearing its <a title="Social fabric" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_fabric">social fabric</a> apart, targeting Singaporeans'
              beliefs and commitment to defence, and its ability to recover from
              disasters, both natural and man-made.</strong></em></p>
              <p>The Total Defence concept encompasses five key aspects –
              military, civil, economic, social and psychological defence – and
              focuses on the need for each Singaporean to play his or her part to
              defend the nation. These five aspects are very similar to the "4
              Defences" of the Austrian "Comprehensive National Defense"
              (<a title="de:Umfassende Landesverteidigung" rel="nofollow" href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umfassende_Landesverteidigung">Umfassende
              Landesverteidigung</a>) strategy of 1975.</p>
              <h2><span>The Five Aspects</span></h2>
              <p>"<strong>Military Defence</strong>" consists of the Singapore
              Armed Forces (SAF), including its citizen soldiers.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Defence_%28Singapore%29#cite_note-totaldefence-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Their
              mission is to "enhance Singapore's peace and security through
              deterrence and diplomacy, and should these fail, to secure a swift
              and decisive victory over the aggressor". As part of the mission,
              the SAF strives to maintain a high state of operational readiness
              24/7.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Civil Defence</strong>" is about ensuring Singaporeans
              know what to do in times of an emergency. The Singapore Civil
              Defence Force (SCDF) supports this aspect of Total Defence.
              However, if Singapore encounters a nation-wide emergency (e.g.:
              terrorism act or war), the SCDF will not be able to cope with the
              demands of the situation. Hence, it is crucial to rope in
              Singaporeans to help their fellow Singaporeans. To facilitate this,
              the SCDF recruits and trains civil defence volunteers in first aid,
              rescue and evacuation procedures, and shelter management.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Economic Defence</strong>" is defined as maintaining
              the economy of the country and its ability to compete in the world,
              as well as environmental protection.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Defence_%28Singapore%29#cite_note-totaldefence-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> It also
              involves helping Singapore (and Singaporeans) stay relevant in the
              global economy and putting in place economic systems to ensure that
              the Singapore economy does not collapse in times of crisis.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Social Defence</strong>" is about keeping the social
              fabric strong and ensuring that Singaporeans live in harmony
              regardless of race or religion.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Defence_%28Singapore%29#cite_note-totaldefence-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> This is
              especially important because Singapore is a multi-racial and
              multi-religious society.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Psychological Defence</strong>" is about loyalty,
              commitment to Singapore, and having the will power and resilience
              to overcome challenges.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Defence_%28Singapore%29#cite_note-totaldefence-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> This is the
              component that would determine if Singaporeans will stay to fight
              or abandon the country when it is in trouble.</p>

              <div><span><strong>Protecting our way of life</strong><br> <br> Introduced in 1984, the concept of Total Defence (TD) was adapted
              from the experiences of countries like Switzerland and Sweden. As a
              young nation with a small population and a conscript armed forces,
              we needed to draw on the different strengths and abilities of our
              community to augment our defence capability.<br> <br> Conflicts between countries are no longer just military in nature.
              Potential aggressors and threats can appear in less obvious and
              non-conventional ways (e.g., destroying social cohesion by
              exploiting differences in race, language, religion, culture, social
              or economic class; weakening national resilience by using
              psychological warfare to play on the people’s fears and
              apprehensions; or waging economic warfare through economic
              boycotts, trade sanctions or acts of sabotage to bring down the
              economy). Total Defence provides the framework for a comprehensive
              and integrated response to deal with all kinds of threats and
              challenges. Whether it is a security threat such as global
              terrorism, or a national crisis like SARS, Total Defence brings
              together all relevant government agencies, private sector
              organisations and all Singaporeans in a coordinated effort to deal
              effectively with these threats and challenges. When Singaporeans
              take personal responsibility for and get involved in the defence of
              Singapore, they are playing their part to help keep Singapore safe
              and secure.<br> <br> Total Defence has five aspects - Military Defence, Civil Defence,
              Economic Defence, Social Defence and Psychological Defence. These
              five aspects represent the key sectors of society. They also help
              Singaporeans understand how they can be involved. When we take
              National Service seriously, volunteer in civil defence exercises,
              help build a strong economy, strengthen community ties with one
              another regardless of race and religion, and stay committed to
              defend the country, we are doing something in every sector of our
              society to strengthen Singapore's resilience as a
              nation.</span></div>

              Total Defence: Military, Civil, Economic, Social and Psychological
              Defence.<br> <br> The arrows point in the same upward direction. This signifies
              concerted effort towards a common objective of safeguarding the
              progress and future of Singapore.<br> <br> The logo's outline is significant because:<br> <br> It is, firstly, the outline of a hand, symbolising action and
              representing unity and completeness. Total Defence is deficient if
              any of the five "fingers" is missing.<br> <br> Secondly, the logo is in the shape of a house, and symbolises
              Singapore as our homeland. With Total Defence, the security of our
              homeland is therefore safeguarded.<br> <br> The tagline "It's personal. Play your part." in its handwritten
              format emphasises the personal nature of and involvement in Total
              Defence, reminding Singaporeans that they have a part to play in
              the defence of Singapore. The rounder edges of the logo give it a
              softer feel, reflecting the personal stake in Total Defence and
              encouraging Singaporeans to embrace Total Defence in their daily
              lives.<br> <br> The crescent and five stars, and the colours of red and white, are
              elements from the National Flag. They represent nationhood. Total
              Defence brings Singaporeans together as one people.<br> <br> Taken as a whole, the logo symbolises all Singaporeans doing what
              they can in Total Defence to ensure peace and security for the
              future.</span></div>

              <h2>Why NS?</h2>
              <p>NS was introduced in 1967, just 2 years after Singapore’s
              independence to ensure the peace and stability of our nation.</p>
              <strong>We are a 'little red dot'.</strong>
              <p>With a population of 4.4 million and a land of 699 square km,
              Singapore is amongst the 20 smallest countries in the world.
              Singapore is too small to change the world. Instead, we must adapt
              as the world changes around us.</p>
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/asiamap.jpg"><img src="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/asiamap.jpg" alt="Storming the hideout" width="288" height="216"></a>
              <h3>Importance of NS</h3>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">We must be able to defend
              Singapore ourselves. No one else is responsible for our security
              and we cannot depend on others to come to our
              defence.</span></strong></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #008000;">Our defence is predicated on
              deterrence. That is why we invest heavily and consistently in
              building up a strong defence force to provide that
              deterrence.</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">At the same time, we seek to be
              friends with as many countries as possible in the region and
              beyond. By having friends who can help us in our times of need, we
              enhance our security.</span></p>
              <h3>Need for NS</h3>
              <p>NS is our only viable option to building up a credible defence
              force to ensure our survival. A conscription force by law which
              obliges all eligible people to enlist would create a sizeable
              standing force ready to guarantee our security.</p>
              <p>The <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr> maintains
              itself in a high state of operational readiness at all times so
              that it is able to react swiftly to any threat.</p>
              <p>To meet the defence challenges in the 21st century, the
              <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr> is upgrading and
              transforming itself into a highly sophisticated, well-integrated
              fighting force.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/storming.jpg"><img src="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/storming.jpg" alt="Third Generation SAF" width="288" height="216"></a></p>
              <p>The Third Generation <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr> will be a network-centric
              organisation. Our forces will be interconnected, equipped with
              electronic information systems, and be able to fight cooperatively,
              and in an integrated manner, on land, in the air and on the
              sea.</p>
              <p>Within the nation itself, the <abbr title="Singapore Police Force">SPF</abbr> upholds the law and maintains
              order, keeping the streets safe for family and friends.</p>
              <p>And in case of any crisis or emergency, such as a major accident
              or a terrorist attack, the <abbr title="Singapore Civil Defence Force">SCDF</abbr> will be there to rescue
              and save the lives of fellow citizens.</p>
              <p>All together, the <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr>, <abbr title="Singapore Police Force">SPF</abbr> and <abbr title="Singapore Civil Defence Force">SCDF</abbr> play a key role in
              Singapore’s Total Defence—Military Defence, Civil Defence, Economic
              Defence, Social Defence and Psychological Defence.</p>
