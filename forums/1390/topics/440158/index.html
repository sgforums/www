              <p>Dear all,</p>
              <p>Please understand that I am NOT planning to Kao Geng or to 'escape from NS' but am writing here to ask for your advice/suggestions<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> because this will affect my future.</span></p>
              <p>I was depressed when I was in Secondary 3. Drank school chemical / slashed myself in class and hurt myself when I was at home etc. This went on for the past 1 year.</p>
              <p>I was warded to IMH/NUH, a couple of times, and went to see private psychatrists. </p>
              <p>I believe NUH/IMH/phychatrists and even the police have records of my doings.</p>
              <p>However, after all these incidents .. I  relocated to Canada to continue with my studies and subsequently, I moved to Australia. (Nothing happened, just that the exit permit requires me to fly back every 3 months, Oz is closer.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am doing very well now but I'm not confident. I am worried that I might get stressed/depressed and do silly things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I understand that I have to go for a medical screening in CMPB. And my questions are as follow:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1.  Do you guys SUGGEST that I inform the MO about all these?</p>
              <p>2.  What PES will I be given? (I wear specs / slightly overweight but will trim off my fats once I return back to SG after graduation)</p>
              <p>3.  Will it AFFECT my future (jobs) ? I am aiming to be a lawyer/foreign service officer with MFA / psychologist (how ironic!) / social worker    </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am okay with doing BMT and stuff because it's my responsibility as a Singaporean and it will be beneficial for me , overall. NS is once-in-a-lifetime experience that many people around the world might not get to feel/enjoy it.  I do not have the intention to gao keng because I miss home, a mummy's boy.. or whatever (I am already used to 'being away from home' for the past 2 years.) </p>
              <p>What do you guys suggest? </p>
              <p>Many thanks in advance! </p>
              <p>Kind Regards,</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>In fact depression is not a good way to keng. Non-combat vocations are more likely to work without supervision than combat vocations.</p>
              <p>It only means you won't have access to weapons AND ammo (either alone is ok), which does not mean you won't be outfield.</p>

              <p>Hi! </p>
              <p>Thanks for your prompt reply.</p>
              <p>What does kao geng means? From my understanding, it means don't need to serve NS?</p>
              <p>Do you mean that I will most likely be situated in those office-clerk type of work? I don't know, I am actually fine with being a clerk or a NS-ready man that do those 'cheong sua' activities etc. </p>
              <p>Those things happened in 2009 and I should be alright now, I guess?</p>
              <p>I am finishing school on 31/May/2012. When should I start 'exercising' to prepare for NS? I have the option to go for checkup in Janaury 2012 and go NS the moment I am done with school or else I can wait till I'm done with school and go for checkup and WAIT till enlistment. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Apart from wasting time (will fully utilise the time for exercising/learning new stuff), I might miss out my 'university start date' if I ORD at the 'not right time'.</p>
              <p>What do you recommend? Being overseas for a couple of years, I've grown in weight and have NEVER exercise for ages. </p>

              <p>Hi ! </p>
              <p>Yup, did a lot of research on depression &amp; NS before I ask these questions.</p>
              <p>Still remember a thread where this guy was married and have got depression .. he just wanted to kao geng but there's no update as to which PES he got into also.</p>
              <p>Another thread was by a NSMan GF where she complained about his bf is falling into depression. Not much information from there also. Wanted to request for 8-5 job.</p>
              <p>Most of the threads talked about depression when they're in NS .. complaining about depression etc.</p>
              <p>Most of them seems to end up in PES E? No one mentioned about having depression/suicidal history before NS and what kind of PES/task they have. </p>
              <p>There's this MYTH that depression history will be noted down and it's hard to find jobs in future. Can anyone confirm if it's true?</p>

              <p>Nope. You'll have to pay a bond of $75 000 or half my parents' income if their annual income is &gt;$75 000 in which my case is the latter and it's very costly! </p>
              <p>So the alternative is to fly back every 3 months to SG. It's an unwritten rule.. many thought that they've got to give bonds if they send their sons overseas.</p>

              <p>Nope. You'll have to pay a bond of $75 000 or half my parents'

              <p>False. You can either pay the $75,000 bond, or get two Guarantors, both singapore citizens, to vouch for you via a deed. It's a secret way out of the money bond we discovered when we moved to Canada. CMPB then issues you exit permits that last a year each, up to the time your couse finishes. I know this because I experienced it.</p>

              <p>Please understand that I am NOT planning to Kao Geng or to

              advice/suggestions <span style="text-decoration: underline;">because this will affect my
              future.</span></p>
              <p>I was depressed when I was in Secondary 3. Drank school chemical
              / slashed myself in class and hurt myself when I was at home etc.
              This went on for the past 1 year.</p>
              <p>I was warded to IMH/NUH, a couple of times, and went to see
              private psychatrists. </p>
              <p>I believe NUH/IMH/phychatrists and even the police have records
              of my doings.</p>
              <p>However, after all these incidents .. I  relocated to
              Canada to continue with my studies and subsequently, I moved to
              Australia. (Nothing happened, just that the exit permit requires me
              to fly back every 3 months, Oz is closer.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am doing very well now but I'm not confident. I am worried
              that I might get stressed/depressed and do silly things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I understand that I have to go for a medical screening in CMPB.
              And my questions are as follow:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1.  Do you guys SUGGEST that I inform the MO about all
              these?</p>
              <p>2.  What PES will I be given? (I wear specs / slightly
              overweight but will trim off my fats once I return back to SG after
              graduation)</p>
              <p>3.  Will it AFFECT my future (jobs) ? I am aiming to be a
              lawyer/foreign service officer with MFA / psychologist (how
              ironic!) / social worker    </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am okay with doing BMT and stuff because it's my
              responsibility as a Singaporean and it will be beneficial for me ,
              overall. NS is once-in-a-lifetime experience that many people
              around the world might not get to feel/enjoy it.  I do not
              have the intention to gao keng because I miss home, a mummy's boy..
              or whatever (I am already used to 'being away from home' for the
              past 2 years.) </p>
              <p>What do you guys suggest? </p>

              <p>Whatever, your story is. You must report to the CMPB MO truthfully, then it is up to them who decide your Pes status. </p>
              <p>Since you have a home here, then do the NS here. It serve as a backup when things goes wrong overseas.</p>
              <p>Most doctors, lawyers, managers and more suffer from depression in SG. So I dont think it will have impact in the future job, besides it is very common for teens to have depression. This is called Teen depression.</p>

              <p>Whatever, your story is. You must report to the CMPB MO
              truthfully, then it is up to them who decide your Pes
              status. </p>
              <p>Since you have a home here, then do the NS here. It serve as a
              backup when things goes wrong overseas.</p>
              <p>Most doctors, lawyers, managers and more suffer from depression
              in SG. So I dont think it will have impact in the future job,
              besides it is very common for teens to have depression. This is
              called Teen depression.</p>

              <p>Nice one Lokey! True.. doctors/lawyers/managers might have history of depression too :S      Just that it seems like the workforce in SG is discriminating those who have/had mental illnesses .. </p>
