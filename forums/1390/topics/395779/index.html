              <p>I have no intention to sign on, if my vocational test is screwed up, is there any chance of me still going into OCS or SISPEC? Not that I'm aiming to get into them, I just don't want to be dropped into infantry or the sorts.</p>

              <p>Well, if you get in the August enhance batch (If there is one), you should be able to make it in time to enter uni in the same year. </p>

              <p><br>Haiz... You still cannot get it... The problem is that most of us (including myself) have already finished NS. If u were to enlist b4 this new bmt system kicks in then the info given by us would be useful.. But the info based on ur so called 'our past experience' would be flawed and is not applicable to the current context.. If that's the case wat's the point of asking here only to get the wrong answer.. The other guys (NSmen) might not even be aware of the changes to the BMT system. You should ask your Jc peers who have enlisted under the new system or those working in BMTC as specs or officers for a more up to date informaton or call CMPB directly.</p>
              <p>It seems like you do not only sucks in math ar... You also need to work on your attitude.. Given the attitude displayed by you.. forget about OCS os SISPEC la. Just hope that you will not be whacked by ah bengs in the army or spend time in DB for insubordination..</p>
