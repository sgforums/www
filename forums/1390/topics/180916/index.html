I went for the 5th Common Phase and the total strength was about 90, with engineers, Armour, Arty, Guards, Infantry being there. i don't think cdo goes to sispec.<br><br>in common phase you'll have a day of tbtl, which is team building team learning, and how to conduct it etc.. and you'll learn alot of leadership stuff, and also about ammo control, about informal punishment, blablabla. No OPS. I think its weird that you know that you are going for common phase but yet don't know that sbo/ chiong sua equipment is not needed. they do give out store list when you go for briefing..<br><br>And NO you do not get your 2SG rank after the course. I've got 1SGs in my course who attended even the ops phase. then what? promote them to SSG? not really applicable yeah? besides, you're only attending 2weeks of common phase and want to get 2SG?<br><br>rumor has it that you get the 2SG rank after you have served as a 3SG for a year, and has attended PS course.</div>

Is this true? So we all have to go to Pasir Laba camp even if we are not from infantry,gds or cdo?</ul><br><ul>If so, what do we learn in the common phase? Is there a lot of chiong sua or just more of leadership talk etc.? Need to prepare SBO/chiong sua equipment again?</ul><br><ul>Lastly,do we get our 2SG rank immediately after the course, if at all?<br></ul><br><br>Can anyone who has attended the course before please help to shed light on this?<br>Really appreciate it. Thanks!</div></blockquote>Well when i was a NSF i also wen PScoz. But whether you promote to 2SGT or not depends on your CO. He has to recommend that u be promoted. PScoz does not mean u become 2nd SGT. Untill then u draw 3rd sgt pay but u can draw ammo.<br><br>For me i was promoted locally a month become i went PScoz, i have no idea why, then after PScoz i started drawing 2nd SGT pay.</div>

As long your CO recommends u fro promotion u get. BUT most of the times only PS get 2nd SGT so it seems that way.<br>Cheers</div>
