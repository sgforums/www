            <div class='col-md body'>While I'm not entirely familiar with the inner mechanisms of the Singapore army, it is not hard to understand where the author's coming from.<br><br>Think about it : in most developed countries, the leaders of the respective armed forces are schooled in military academies preparing them for a career in the military (and that includes the world's leading military force, that of the US) and not one in another domain, only to be deployed in the military later on.<br><br>While one might draw parallels that the likes of Colin Power has transited from military leadership to a top post in a civilian administration, it doesn't alter the fact the system, by and large, trains individuals for that particular field (you don't see top US generals having been schooled at Harvard and Yale Law School for instance) - in essence, anyone with ability in a given field can rise through the ranks to the highest post of a given field in the US. That, unfortunately, can hardly be said about Singapore - let's face it, Colin Powell would never have become a general if he'd been born in Singapore since the posts of generals are reserved primarily for the academically-inclined who might not have the slightest nuances/acumen for the military...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  To better get a grasp of what the author is driving at, try imagining having a Harvard Law School graduate administer treatment to you if you had cancer...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly, I dun see the point why some of you are for the US bugger. US and SG are two different countries with two different defense policy.<br><br>What if our CPTs are 40s and our BGs are 60s. Can they command better in wars or plan better strategies?<br><br>So what if you have a war-experienced BGs with war-experienced officers leading NS soldiers to battle? Would we fight better?<br><br>So is anyone suggesting we participate in future wars, so that our soldiers are "battle harden" with "war experience"? The idea wun even make it through government as your parents will complain like mad!!!<br><br>Something I've read some wise guy in a book about the cold war (which I can't remember) talks about experience and effectiveness is not related in a linear graph; but convex. There is a point where increase in experience is not proportionally equal to increase in effectiveness. If this is true, then tiger woods would never have won anyone older and started playing golf earlier than him.<br><br>So what if a particular sales agent has 20 years of sales experience, it is not to say he'll win the younger junior sales execs every month.<br><br>The key is not so much about experience.

            <div class='col-md body'>i think this article need to study from the perspective from military standpoint not poltical or race. Nevertheless it could be a point the US is trying to point out that Mindef need to seriously consider the experience issue.<br><br>but I think there are 2 keys area that need to address by SAF.<br><br>The experience issue. The question become should we send our career solider in harms way to learn the hard knock of War to gain the knowledge of battlefield. No matter how realistics is the training, it is always different when a person is go thru war zone.<br><br>2nd is the racial card issue. It is clear that any conflict arise with neighbouring country will touch on race.  Gov has always face a delima as they discovered that if we are more Singaporean we are less lean towards the chinese heritage, less value on the chinese tradition and its value, and all its virture will be lost, including Indian and Malay, at least the next few generation will reflect that characteristics.<br><br>but the more racial divide we are, we are less of a nation. - Singaporean.<br><br>I recall couple of years ago when the Malay parent were trying to insist on the headscarf.  CNN reported them as Malaysian.  But they were Singapore citizen with ethnic Malay. Not Malaysian.<br><br>So the world outside cannot tell the different between a Singapore malay vs a Malaysian.<br><br></div>
