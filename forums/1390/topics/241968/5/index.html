For every Ariel or Napoleon there are many "young generals" who are handicapped not by capabilities but by experience. Scientific studies have shown that improved outcomes come from learning by experience. Albeit, there is a tradeoff in that after a point, experience may also constrain one's capabilities by blindsiding you. So the key here is to maintain a balance of young highly competent staff officers and experienced generals. Highly effective generals are those who are able to temper their experience with youth energy and enthuasiasm. The current SAF structure loses the experience factor.<br><br>Would someone correct me - but was Winston Choo a "scholar" and how long did he take to reach LT Gen? he is one person in the SAF (retired now) that I fully respect. Further, his "physical" presence does bring some pride to the entire institution. The current CDF severely lacks that and frankly when I saw him finally in person, I really felt abit awkward that "this guy" is our Chief.<br><br></div></blockquote>well i do admit modern day excamples are alittle harder to come by, but seriously age is relative and not really a benchmark of skill or ability.<br>What do i mean?The black prince Edward the 2nd i think was 20 plus when he went rampaging all over France and kicked it's ass.<br>Alexander the Great (mind u,he stuided under some of the world's best tutors of his time) was in his early 30's when he DIED<br><br>Heck up until recently even Generals who were over 50 were considered old<br>General Rommel 53 when he was made FIELD MARSHAL. Same with General Walter Model who was made captain at 26 and major general at 40ish.<br><br>How then do these outstanding people help prove that age is of no barrier? Well other then the 2 ww2 examples the rest lived in an age where the average age was 30-40 meaning most Generals didnt make it pass 40 haha.<br>The other 2 examples simply show that some US Generals at age 60+++ are way way old.<br><br>Anyway about west point.......Sure Patton was from west point,Omar Bradley to.But arent u forgetting Custer(finished LAST in his class IIRC) was also from there?For ever Patton there will be a Custer.<br><br>Alot of countries use academic results as a bench mark for being an Officer and then both results AND service record.<br><br>Do u know how hard it is to get into westpoint to earn your freaking degree from there? Imagine having to study for your degree while serving NS and still not fail or risk getting booted out. By that reckoning they had already weeded out quite abit of people.<br><br>All through time some of the greatest Generals were also very well read. Even the Great Khan was well read for his erm.......background.(his mother tutored him alittle so he wasnt all brawn)<br><br>Napoleon studied at some of the top French military schools of his time.(At that time there was no such thing as a scholarship,at most a sponsor.)His was paid by his family who were richer then the average person hah.<br><br>But like always there are exceptions to the norm and there will always be useless scholars(in terms of leadership) and bloody brillient people who didnt really study.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As much as some overzealous guerrilla groups think fighting in a jungle is manly, the fact is, once the urban centres are taken, you don't have anything left to fight for. This is of course true when it comes to M'sia. However, Indonesia is too large to bother to fight over. So if they go the forest to hide, I think it is time to tolerate some haze and unleash thermobaric weapons.</div>

He doesn't know whther he will live after killing the enemy muslim.. Do you think he will dare to pull the trigger?<br><br>This is another reason I used to wonder about muslims being in the SAF at all.. I always wondered whether what they felt in peacetime (I can server my country) would transcend to war (can I kill another man?).<br>I always kept my mouth shut so as not to stir up any problems in Singapore. But I think the people here are sensible enough not to create havoc so I shall put my thoughts here.</div>
