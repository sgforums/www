            <div class='col-md body'>First, let me begin by saying all this ruckus is a waste of time. Malays not serving in sensitive positions has been one issue raised many times by our neighbours. Looking at it conversely, their armies too lack officers from the other races. Racial sensitivity has to be properly dealt with as history has proven with the Sepoy Mutiny in the past. As long as the Malay is not marginalised, I do not see a problem at all. Afterall, a Malay MP is already of higher rank and status even when compared to the Chief of Defence Force.<br><br>Pertaining to experience in combat missions, despite all their ecperience and expertise, our pilots and servicemen still come out tops in the war games they organise and in the courses they conduct. I do not see the problem here.<br><br>And lastly, I do agree that the SAF needs to improve by ensuring commanders are fit and ready to lead their men to battle if need be. During NS, I found the regulars whom I worked with highly undesirable in terms of work ethics and preparedness. Fat, highly unfit, not competent in knowledge; traits that lead the way to failure. My officer was so imcompetent! Didn't even know the necessary checks and had to be briefed over and over again by NS fellas! That's really sad!</div>
