            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by walesa:<br><br>But the point is most professional armies deploy their generals at military institutions (think West Point, etc) to give them a solid grounding that prepares them for a career in the military and nothing else - that's the kind of training I am talking about.<br><br><strong>This is old school way of learning...and i cant believe the US are still using this. It just shows that they are not progressing. How is it that military institutions will only provide a career in military and nothing else?? In our SAF, we learn soldier management, how to motivate people, technical stuff, human-relations, social skills, deployment of units, inventory optimizations, etc...which are ALL very useful whereever you go...including private companies, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </strong><br><br>Let's face it - someone cut out for West Point isn't necessarily Harvard material; likewise, someone who is cut out for Harvard isn't necessarily going to make the grade for West Point. That's simply because Harvard and West Point prepare individuals for two very different lives entirely.<br><br><strong>This is typical tunnel-vision. Who says that all who is cut out for Harvard cannot be cut out for West Point. For heaven's sake, there is the OCS, and tonnes and tonnes of courses, PT tests, SOCs, etc...if you do not pass the military institution with flying colours, for both war tactics, physical fitness, combat readiness, discipline, etc, you will still not become an officer. That is, whether you are from Harvard or not, is secondary, because EVERYONE, REGARDLESS of your educational background, HAVE TO GO THROUGH MILITARY SCHOOL, not direct posting to your positions, duh... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </strong><br><br>What Singapore is effectively doing is picking someone qualified for Harvard and have them schooled at Harvard and then place them at West Point on virtue of the fact that they're Harvard-material - evidently, this is going to compromise the quality of the individuals West Point is intended to serve when they might never have been West Point material had they not been eligible for Harvard. Similarly, there could be many worthy West Point candidates turned away simply because they aren't Harvard material when there clearly is no direct and intrinsic relation to suggest Harvard and West Point require the same set of assets and skills to thrive.<br><br><strong>Again, another boo-boo....I dont know about what West Point or no West Point, in Singapore, there is no such things. All this writing by the americans just shows they do not know Singapore well and at the same time, want to act smart as if they know and knows how to strategize, etc. In SAF, depending on your educational background, you can be groomed to become specialists, sergeant majors, master, warrant officers, and if your performance is good, you can convert to commissioned officers to majors. A personal experience of mine is that i know of a poly student who worked his way to warrant officer, then he took up a degree course and go through advanced officers course, and know he is already LT-COL. a department head. How's that?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </strong><br><br>The fact that Singapore picks its generals from a pool of academically-inclined applicants and subject them to their own form of military training cannot and will never compensate for the quality of training what many professional armies do with their generals...</blockquote><strong>This reply is SO SO SO Wrong.

For every Ariel or Napoleon there are many "young generals" who are handicapped not by capabilities but by experience. Scientific studies have shown that improved outcomes come from learning by experience. Albeit, there is a tradeoff in that after a point, experience may also constrain one's capabilities by blindsiding you. So the key here is to maintain a balance of young highly competent staff officers and experienced generals. Highly effective generals are those who are able to temper their experience with youth energy and enthuasiasm.

The reason many of us (not everyone in the forum) are to point it mildly irritated by scholar/paper generals is that their tour in the active battalions tend to perfunctory. They rarely (not all of course) spend more than 2 - 3years. How do you expect us on the ground to be fully convinced if the general up there only have a helicopter/20000mile high view of what is happening? That is the crux of the problem of "young" generals. Not so much the age but the ground experience that they have gained to really "deserve" the command and power that they thrust into. In essence some of the current practices subvert the oft quoted but only given lipservice principle of meritocracy.</div>

The world's strongest military (measure it in terms of its military activities or just its worth in terms of the amount its government has spent on its defence) clearly pursues a policy (in fact, many of the world's leading militaries) of what is "old school" to you and commonsensical to me. Of course, you're entitled to your opinion and can remain oblivious to what are inconstestable facts if you like (you could argue North Korea is actually the world's most prosperous regime if you insist). And old school or world-class or not isn't the main issue here anyway. So back to your point...<br><br>Who says someone who thrives at Harvard would not thrive at West Point? --&gt; You raised a very good point here, but you still are not answering the crux issue. <strong>Why should the benchmark for admissions to Harvard be used as the benchmark for admissions to West Point (That, in essence, is what the Singapore military does - if you aren't good enough academically, you haven't got a hope in hell of rising through the ranks even if you were genuine military general-material. At least, that's the case for the current generation of generals.)?</strong> Surely, an individual gifted enough to possess the attributes to excel in both domains will have no problem getting past their respective admissions process and the crux of the issue here is obviously not whether there're such individuals. Rather, the point is, if West Point were to admit candidates based on their Harvard credentials, are those whom they admit (at least, generally speaking in a manner reflective of their entire student body) really the best candidates West Point intend to nurture? Although Colin Powell attended neither West Point nor Harvard, he nevertheless bears testament to the point that one's competence in one domain is by no means indicative of one's credentials in another as he happens to be an accomplished general, but a less-than-mediocre statesman.<br><br>Just as a very good rugby player could potentially be a very good footballer, the top football clubs are not going to sign a very good rugby player without first having taken a look at him <strong>playing football</strong>. That's the distinction between your stance and the Harvard-West Point one. In the Singapore context, there'll be no one admitted to West Point who isn't Harvard material - that is the underlying and the biggest difference!</div>

Deploying Gen Tan with a temporary rank and then reverting him back to BG upon his return does not speak very well of our leaders.
