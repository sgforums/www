              <p>Actually, the harmful drugs are even cheaper and more effective than the expensive one. And the polyclinic doctors have them. But they are harmful.</p>
              <p>You have taken prednisone for 11 months? That is too long. If it is effective, 2-3 days you will see the difference. After 2 weeks if you dont see any difference. You should change a new drug and dont waste time.There is a whole library of drugs to try. You should change a doctor also.</p>
              <p>You should also try to find out what causes the outbreak. It can be anything, from food such as shellfish, washing powder, bleach, weather, dust, no. 4 uniform... </p>
              <p>If you are frequently sick by flu and other illness, it is normal because your immuno system is being suppressed by the drugs you are taking.</p>

              <p>yes, as issued by my MO, A&amp;E &amp; NSC..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>saw NSC head of eczema by luck on my last visit to NSC and he commented on that too , when i asked him why his doctors issued it, he just kept quiet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i dont really have problems with any of them previously, now i have problems with all of them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>perhaps i did not add, after NSC took many blood tests from me and could not decide, i thought it might be stress and did see a psychiatrist in TTSH &amp; SGH.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>during midway like 4-5th month. had signs of bipolar disorder.</p>
              <p>had a week of my life i could not remember, did weird things, thought was not going to make it.</p>
              <p>during the day, the councillar from TTSH did a housevisit as she felt that smth was wrong.</p>
              <p>did notify mo and saw him on a personal note but did not follow his arrangement to A&amp;E instead took leave to take a breather, because i thought if i was not able to make it, at least i did something i wanted to do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>subsequent visit to SGH was diagnosed with depression.</p>
