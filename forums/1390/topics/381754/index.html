              <p>hi quincy.</p>
              <p>based on what i know, you will be send to Pasir Laba Camp for RCC conducted by Combat Intelligence School.  it is a short 2 month course. you will form the main bulk of the course with SCTs from infantry/guards units. there will be officers and senior specs in the course as well. the role of recce is explained by the name itself, to conduct reconnaissance. in short is to "spy". you will be taught about recognition of targets, weapons, vehicles, aircrafts etc. there is also CST, shortened version of jungle confidence course. training is a bit tough. especially when it comes to the outfield part. it is one after another. you will go around everywhere with your FBO, for lunch, for lessons. you will carry more load than the standard FBO. one team consist of 4 man, so you share the load of things like signal set, batteries, parang, surveillance equipment. when in camp, usually training ends by dinner time then you'll be quite free. there is occasional nights off and canteen breaks. you will spend few days in tekong too towards the end of the course. then there is Ex Longwalk, a 3D2N navex, which amounts to about 60+km map distance. you will pass out from the course as 3SG but you must clear either bike or jeep course.and it's always book in sunday night book out friday evening.</p>
              <p>swimming is not really necessary but there will be CWO involved. don't worry there is always life jackets. and you won't be swimming. basically it is training how to use/row the 3 man boat, inflatable type.</p>
              <p>don't have to feel depressed about it. it is not that difficult to get through it. i've seen people made through it, i believe you can as well. just make sure you help and encourage one another. when you finally receive the jungle hat, you'll have lots of pride and memories.</p>
              <p>hope it helps (:</p>
              <p>FIRST IN. LAST OUT. RECCE!</p>
