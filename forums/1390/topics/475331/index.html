              The programme includes weapon training with the SAR 21 rifle which
              will teach recruits technical handling and marksmanship skills; a
              Battle Inoculation Course that simulates a real battlefield; a

              BMT</span></strong><br> As evidence has shown that obese recruits are able to achieve
              optimum fitness levels and weight loss in about 19 weeks, the new
              BMT programme for recruits with Body Mass Index (BMI) scores
              exceeding 27.0 will be 19 weeks. This BMT programme is designed to
              help obese recruits improve their physical fitness progressively
              while equipping them with basic soldiering skills and
              knowledge.</p>

              combat and combat support vocations, such as signal operators,
              combat medics and naval system operators. These recruits will be
              given a new medical classification of PES B2, in place of the
              existing PES C1 classification. This is to ensure that the medical
              classification of our soldiers is consistent with their deployment.
              The new 9-week programme will include customised physical training,

              training to prepare them for combat service support vocations, such
              as service medic, and those related to logistics and

              <p>To be worthy of donning the coveted "Guards" shoulder tab and
              the Khaki <a title="Beret" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beret">beret</a>, trainees have to go through the
              gruelling <em>Guards Officers Conversion Course</em> for officers
              and <em>Guards Specialist Conversion Course</em> for Specialists.
              The enlisted men go through the <em>Guards Advanced Infantry
              Training</em> (GAIT) to earn their mark as Guardsmen.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Guards#cite_note-Guards-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> These

              the elite Guardsmen and push every soldier physically and mentally
              to the limit. Only those who qualify will be given the right to be
              called a "Guardsman", wearing the coveted khaki beret. In Dec 2011,

              <p> </p>
              <p><span>The 23<sup>rd</sup> of August 2013 marked a very special day for the Commanders and Men of 3<sup>rd </sup>Battalion Singapore Guards 15<sup>th</sup> Mono
                               In-take (III.XV) – It was III.XV's Family Carnival and NS Milestone 
                              Parade.   This was an opportunity for the soldiers of III.XV to celebrate
                               the successful completion of their active NS cycle with their families.
                               The Family Carnival took the form of an NS Journey Exhibit to showcase 
                              the experience of the unit over the past two years while the NS Milestone
                               Parade consisted of a traditional "ORD Parade" that also featured the 
                              Assumption of Command by the NS Key Appointment Holders, to emphasise 
                              the continuity of NS beyond the active cycle.</span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p>The NS Journey Exhibit was a series of photo and video exhibits that 
                              depicted the achievements and experiences of the soldiers over the past 
                              two years. The servicemen brought their families and friends on their NS
                               journey through a series of static and interactive displays that 
                              incorporated two main themes, namely, "Becoming a Guardsmen" and 
                              "Becoming Operationally Ready". </p>
              <p>The first segment of "Becoming a 
                              Guardsmen" showcased their journey from BMT through the Guards Advanced 
                              Infantry Training (GAIT).  Besides the sights and sounds of the 
                              photos and videos, there were combat ration tasting, camouflage-painting 
                              stations, as well as weapons/ combat equipment display. These stations 
                              gave opportunities to the servicemen to explain and re-live the 
                              challenges they first experienced when they entered National Service and
                               the memories they had onto attaining their coveted Guards tab and Khaki
                               beret.</p>
              <p>Across the parade square, the soldiers of III.XV proudly brought 
                              their families through their journey of "Becoming Operationally Ready". 
                               This segment depicted the unit's quest of building Professionalism, 
                              Perseverance and Purpose - and striving towards their vision of becoming
                               a Mission-Ready unit, with Elite and Committed Warfighters and an 
                              Enduring Character.  The photo and video exhibits brought thesights and 
                              sounds of their overseas training and ATEC Evaluation. There was 
                              an Advanced Combat Man System (ACMS), soldier models for photo 
                              opportunities, and a Tactical Engagement System (TES) station. The TES 
                              was one of the most popular attractions which saw soldier scoaching 
                              their families and friends how to use their weapons effectively.  </p>
              <p>The NS Journey Exhibit also unveiled III.XV's Honour Board and 
                              Achievement Board.  Winners of the "Guards Character Award", the unit CO 
                              Coin and RSM Coin were honoured with a display of their portraits (inthe
                               No.1 uniform).  The Honour Board also featured the awards won by the 
                              various Comapnies over the two years in III.XV's Best Coy Competition - 
                              ie Best Coy in IPPT, Marksmanship, VOC, and Combat Proficiency.</p>
              <p>Summing things up, CPL Ahmad Jamhuriah, a Guardsman from Charlie 
                              Company said, "I think it is good that we have this event so the 
                              Guardsmen's family can see what we are doing. Today is a memorable and 
                              sad day as I ORD; I will miss everything."</p>
              <p>At dusk, the stage was set for the much anticipated parade to begin. 
                               3WO Suffian, the Parade Sergeant Major formed the Guardsmen up into 
                              four contingents in the prestigious No.1 Uniform, and marched proudly 
                              onto the parade square. Performing their drills with pride,honour and 
                              precision, the commanders and men of III.XV paid tribute to their 
                              Commanding Officer, LTC Fredie Tan, with the march-past and 
                              advance-in-review order (14-1-2), to mark the successful conclusion of 
                              the unit's active NS cycle. The parade also featured the assumption of 
                              command by MAJ Tay Kwang Leong, and the assumption of appointment by 2WO 
                              Rama Chandran, as the unit's Commanding Officer and Regimental Sergeant 
                              Major respectively in ORNS.</p>
              <p>This symbolically commenced III.XV's ORNS 
                              cycle and emphasised the importance of their continuous commitment and 
                              operational readiness in NS as 738 Guards. </p>
              <p>The parade reached an 
                              emotional high point with the song 'Au Lang Syne' in the background, and
                               with both Commanding Officers and the Battalion Command Team insalute, 
                              as the commanders and men slow marched off Victory Square, Home of The 
                              Elite Guards. </p>
