              <p>Auto techs do not repair the engines so there is no chance of you to learn much about the engine except duing class in OETI.</p>
              <p>In general i would say what autotech does is to remove and replace. Therefore we mostly remove faulty components and replace with new components. We DO NOT repair the components so you might be abit disappointed.</p>
              <p>What you will learn besides the location of all the vehicle parts might be just vehicle inspection, electrical fault diagnostics due to ECU, wiring etc, air system faults due to air leaks, weak/faulty air compressor, PCU etc.</p>
              <p>Things like brakes, engine, transmission etc major stuff are all outsource for repairs to enternal contractors.</p>
              <p>Anyway i think thats enough of OT. If you have any comments to things to ask, please pm me.</p>

              <p>If u OOT from BMT, you will not get a combat posting. Recourse will depend on the schedule as well as your PES status since they won't sent you for BMT again until your PES is confirmed. Generally its near the end of service if you perm down PES or before you reach 1 year service if its only a temp down PES and you change PES again before a year is up.</p>

              <p>PES D is only given for medical checkup i think. I don't think PES D is given after that and when you are awaiting a new PES, you remain as your old PES till its confirm. PES status doesn't affect much anyway except what sort of posting you can get which for your case will not be combat due to your OOT.</p>

              <p>Hi Genius1111,</p>
              <p>It seems you are a CPC clerk who knows a lot about the insides of Post-BMT Posting Orders; that's great! BTw, you mean a small team of CPC clerks are now sorting/ranking the recent batch of SIT tests / BMT performances, to assign either courses or vocations ? What do you mean by 'camp assignments should start earliest by Friday'?Â  Do you mean that it includes the listings of who's who to go for which courses, etc? You people must be quite fast and efficient in the processing and allocation; to do in a matter of a few days... impressive... care to elaborate further?</p>

              <p>Vocation assignments are not done by NSF i believe from all the past discussions on it.</p>
              <p>What he does is just receive a few hundred names and look at all the units under his portfolio and just assign ppl to them to fill in all the gaps. The reason why they can do it so fast is because they don't bother to check addresses etc if not it would be months before everyone get their posting if the clerk has to cross check the address of each and everyone and allocate them to their nearest unit.</p>
              <p>This is how Jurong people can go Selarang etc and Pasir Ris ppl can go Jurong camp etc</p>
              <p>Courses you attend is decided by the respective unit and not CPC.</p>
