After passing the final test, then u get the familiarisation of the 5 Tonner which is the norm for trooplifting nowadays.<br><br>After that, u will be sent for Transport Supervisor course. It's another 6 weeks but it's damn fun la. You will learn Navex, Cover and Concealment, Immediate Trajectory of Vehicles and many more. There's also Theory and practicals.. Theory is essentially the memorisation of mostly different vehicular drills and the laws of SAF pertaining to vehicles and the usage. U will learn different drills when you are in the vehicle. You will learn how to use the Indentation forms and many many (really alot) forms which are useful when u come across LRI (a very relax and fun period where u can lobo  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) in your unit. Practicals will be mostly learn how to operate different types of vehicles (CAT C and B) in the SAF such as wincing and learn how to tow the vehicles. The finale of the course will be Ex Playtime  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> You bear arms, camou urself and the vehicle. My time was a 5 days,4 nights exercise...where you have to navex on foot and flanking..you have to make your own command post (yes! you and your driver alone!) and shellscrapes around your 5 tonner..camouflaging the vehicle is the worst! my trainer had my buddies and i to camou on and off the vehicles and the drivers more than 10 times at 3am  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> You literally shed kilos during this playtime..(i shed 5kg during this Ex  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ) My time was stay out by the way  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Now, its stay in...but it's quite fun...when you are in Sembawang Camp, remember your head dress..and stay clear of a MSG Kannan  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> The bond between ur peers and you will be very close during this period (i still maintain close contact with them) and if you are lucky like me...you will have a female amongst your batch  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> also a trainee..<br><br>Then after that, is your MSET..basically Maintenance Skill Enhancement Training..
