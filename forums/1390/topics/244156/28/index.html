              <p>Transport sup will generally look after the drivers in transport company, sent vehicles to external units, sent vehicles to workshop, do vehicle UQM etc. Will be very busy during LAB but at other times their jobs are generally manageable and shouldn't be too tough since those i know were sometimes slacking and not working at all since there is no work to do.</p>

              <p><br>I was a Transport Supervisor back in my active days and i guess there's not much difference now and back then. Transport Supervisor encompasses many different job scopes. For one, you can be in charge of all the 5 Tons, Land rover, Admin vehicles or do the detailing for the drivers. I was in charge of detailing the drivers and trust me, you will be the most hated person in your MT Line. Drivers will threaten you, ignore you and even pangseh you. There's truly no enjoyment in being a transport supervisor. Much so, if you are the only NSF spec in your MT Line, you will be picked on by the regulars, the MT SGT (A SSG or MSG) or the MT WO..They will ask you to do all their shit or whatever u can to cover their asses or assist them in some carrying balls.. I have been there done that..The job really sucks.. if possible, try to ask for a posting in the HQ and not in the MT Line..</p>
              <p>First of all, you have to go through a driving course which lasts for 6 weeks and you will be staying in at Sembawang Camp..after which, you will be having a Maintenance course for 5 weeks at Sembawang camp..then is the transport supervisor course at Sembawang camp for another six weeks..after that, you will be posted to various CMTLs or Transport Hubs.. It is possible to get 7000km for your civilian license if u havent got any..just be in charge of detailing...</p>
              <p>Truthfully speaking, there's no glory in being a transport sup both in active and reservist times..there comes a period where you will be doing shitloads of work and it's called LRI...during that period, you will be helping the regulars to cover their shitholes..like filling up forms...going to other camps to get temporary replacements..washing vehicles..etc..anything more can pm me</p>

              <p>Either i'm lucky or drivers now are much better since i don't hear drivers threatening, ignoring and pangseh their specs. They aren't exactly the most obedient people to work with that i can't deny and there are black sheeps but i've work with them alot during my NS time and they are not as scary as you make it sound. Sometimes i think i give the specs more trouble than their drivers do when transport gives me problem :p</p>
              <p>Regardless what vocation you are in, its alot of saikang so its not restricted to just transport. All units will have the some sort of shit to clear and all of them sucks.</p>
              <p>LRI or what is known as LAB now is indeed the busiest and worse period for a transport spec but once that is over, things seem to slack off quite abit for a short period at least since most of the work is completed.</p>
              <p>Compared to many other vocations, many other types of specs, i won't say transport spec is so bad or even anywhere near the worse spec to be.</p>

              <p>It all depends on the unit per se... Some drivers can be cooperative while some aren't.. in my case, when i was active, 40% of all my drivers are married with kids albeit at at average of 20 years old. Therefore, it's hard to put them to overnight details and in turn, the other drivers have to bear the brunt and thats where the job of a detail clerk becomes very precarious..Most of the regulars seriously wun help you and they rather go to the mess and drink themselves silly..</p>
              <p>Besides your regular job as a transport supervisor, u have to do duty as well...I had 29 of my weekends burnt (yes i counted!) before i ORD..and even then, i cant ORD in peace because just nice, my ORD date lies a day before LRI...during my leave, i need to go back and offer my help..believe it or not, even when i off my hp during my leave, my MT SGT even went to my doorstep and asked for my help..jeez..</p>

              <p>I guess all the camps i been to none of them had such a high rate of married drivers. The lack of drivers is more due to them being in DB than being stayout due to married.</p>
              <p>I had less weekend burnt, never really bothered to count but i rather enjoy doing guard duty as mentioned before in another post. Its a good time for me to know the drivers (and once STC trainees) in camp since i don't work directly with them and often i have drivers with tales of their life/experience etc etc to tell to chat through the night. Furthermore buying duty was a good source to supplement the pathetic allowance ;)</p>
              <p>If i had known LRI was coming, i would have cleared leave earlier. Its quite expected to be recalled and have leave cancelled etc during LRI due to lack of manpower. I was on course during LRI duration yet i was recalled during the weekends to work after lossing a 30min arguement on the phone with my warrent officer. As long as you are in the army, your leaves and offs are never really safe. I didn't managed to finish clearing mine as well.</p>
