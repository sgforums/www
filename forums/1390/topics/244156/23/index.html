              <p>Supply Supp course is stayout except on certain days when
              training requires you to stayin. It is the HQ for 1TPT as well as
              the transport north hub. Navy has a camp which is behind the

              <p>At least STC trainees no longer have to do guard duty. In the past supply supp have to do guard duty but they changed that about a year ago with STC withdraw all their trainees and specs from duty giving the rest of us doing duty alot more work to do...</p>

              you want to stay in also got problems. You will be running

              <p>You will spent about 3 months in OETI and 2 months OJE before unit posting. Since 3AMB is the only 1 taking in C meh, you won't be posted anywhere else so your OJE place might be where u are staying till ORD unless you are 1 of the lucky/unlucky few who get posted to units/airforce/navy.</p>

              <p>Of all 3, C veh have the least technicians, just 1 company while there are 2 for A and 3 for B which is why you don't see them as much.</p>
              <p>1st day will be mostly admin stuff, like intro the place, breifing and meeting your instructors in the morning. Afternoon might be coverall and boots fitting as well as an introduction to what you will be studying and even starting the actual content. All will depend on your instructors. C veh i think MSG Alias might still be 1 of your instructors, hes a nice guy. They often change around so an instructor now in B might go to C etc so i am not sure the exact trainers for C veh at the moment.</p>
              <p>PT will be on tuesday morning/evening so its rather safe not to bring your PT kit but its not too heavy to carry anyway.</p>

              <p>You will need informed them and its advisable to postpone ur MAs to after OETI if you can cause u will still need meet a certain attendence for the course. They cannot forbid you from going for ur MA though so don't worry.</p>
              <p>Unless you are excuse RMJ/lower limp, you will be joining in the run. If you are excused, you joined the walking contigient. There is noone who will be slacking and not doing anything during PT session. Last resort is do area cleaning during PT if you can't join in. OETI trees love to sent leaves to the ground on certain months so if you are unlucky, area cleaning can make you go crazy.</p>
