              around and search a few forums. Only dunno whether i will need to
              route march and SOC. Thanks for ur help! Wow i didnt know PES C ppl
              do 2 more months than PES A/B. I guess I wont down pes unless very

              <p>How long you serve is decided on the day you enlist and won't be affected when you change pes later. PES A/B is those who pass napfa that gets the 2 months reduction and not all.</p>
              <p>Generally drivers will not need to route march cos u need to drive the vehicle. You route march u think the vehicle will move on its own? SOC i dunno.</p>
