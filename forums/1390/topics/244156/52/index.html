              <p>I seriously doubt SAF will look into your diploma etc when deciding vocation since all my experience shows otherwise. As a auto tech, out of the 60+ in my batch, i think only 1 had mechanic knowledge with a large number of us from the science, business and IT fields which is totally not related to repairing of vehicles. Furthermore, SAF do not take in people who have driving licences for drivers.</p>
              <p>Whether or not medic is given special piority due to them dealing with live human beings i'm unsure but in general, your course of study has little effect in affecting ur posting from what i know.</p>

              <p>That would violate the reason they did not allow ppl with license to be drivers in the past cos they dun wan them to zuo bo etc during the driving course since people who knows how to drive will be way ahead of the others.</p>

              <p>Unsure about the odds of a nursing student being posted to medic but there are surely alot of nursing students who do not become medics. There is always chance of friends who got into a vocation base on their 'specialisation' but there are alot more out there that get thrown to something totally unrelated.</p>
              <p>For eg, my entire batch of 60+ autotech, only 1 was an ITE student who studied on automobile. If he was the only friend i known, i might have said that an automobile student would have a high chance to become an autotech yet he was only 1 out of the 60+. Get what i mean?</p>

              <p>I am a technician myself, do you think i dunno the ratio of the type of courses people were from and posted to that vocation? What has IT got to do with technicians anyway? Almost all the medics i know were not nursing dip graduates so out of the 100s of nursing graduates each year really get into medics and not other vocations that you really know of rather than just 1 case?</p>
              <p>Actually i would say someone who studied automobile in ITE is more qualified than most of the rest of us in all vehicles repairs, do the work quicker and more efficiently but theres hardly any of them sent to be a autotech.</p>
              <p>If you want to say there is a higher chance, why do drivers rarely get driver vocations? Aero Eng/tech students not mostly get technician in RSAF etc etc. I know of many poly grads who were posted to fields totally unrelated to their course of study regardless how they they have done and many did not choose to go to command school.</p>

              <p>You don't need to even be at CPC to know the education of your peers and I do not believe CPC clerks can and bother to check the NSF's education background to determine posting.</p>

              <p>err fyi, aero eng/tech students the field they're in is held by regulars in the rsaf.. the nsf techs in rsaf do not service aircrafts at all..what has IT grads gotta do with techs? a technical job in the rsaf is not all bout mechanical work, airrcaft has systems.. thats why im saying from what i know, the people who works closely with me, i know their education has maybe somewhat played a part however minor it is. its too many to ignore..in fact few years ago, technicians in the rsaf only took in poly grads from engineering/it courses and there were no A lvl grads at all. see the logic?</p>
