              <p>hello, i have a question, but im not sure if this is the correct place to post it.</p>
              <p>i am in a pes BP obese batch, and i have 10 more days to pop. during the course of my bmt, i have fell sick frequently, with stuff like flu and chest infection. as a result, during my ptp phase, alot of that time, i was on status. However, during my bmt phase, i tried my best to endure, and passed all my high-key, including field camp, sittest, BIC and BTP. i have read online that to pass out from bmt, i have to fulfill 2 out of 3 criteria, which i did( field camp and BTP. ippt fail). however i also read something about having to fulfill attendance.</p>
              <p>because of my attendence, i am worried i wont be allowed to pass out. However, i have only 10 more days to pop, and nobody said anything(i didnt oot/ooc or anything). So my question is: will i be able to complete bmt without having to recourse? especially since its so close to pop already and they didnt ooc me.</p>
