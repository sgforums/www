              <p>BMT is just a very general basic military training course. The proper rifleman vocation training will be done when you get posted to a rifleman vocation by the infantry companies</p>

              <p>As with all vocations, you will be trained when you get posted to units. Tekong just trains you in the basics like technical handling, marching, discipline etc but all vocation base skills are taught by the respective units.</p>

              <p>You cannot base the intake just on forums alone since there is less than1% of each BMT batch that visits and post on the forums. I believe all formations will take in people all year round so there is no BMT batch which will surely not get a certain vocation though we cannot rule out the possibility of certain combat units having slightly higher rates of recruitment during certain months. Such data only someone in CPC can have a better idea of.</p>

              <p>am back from my 1st wk at Signal Institute for SIG OPR IC2 course.. as heard from many pple the course itself is not very physically tiring, but its mentally tiring.. why mentally? cos u got to study a lot of things.. a lot of lessons but very little time.. self study somemore.. and worst thing is u studying something very foreign for more pple (unless u took IT related courses in poly.. or u have knowledge of how radio works). And since im Pes C, the course is 5wks instead of 6. so basically is eat study slp. lol</p>
              <p>as many said, its after the course whether its xiong or not (see whether u get posted to garang unit or slack unit). which of cos i dunnoe as of now, cos im only 1wk into the course.</p>
              <p>a qns for any former or current signallers who have been posted out from SI.. is it true that u will be posted to units based on how well u do for the tests? cos i saw one senior who finished the IC2 course and he told me that the top few person(in terms of test results) will go to garang unit and air force (which is stayout), then for the rest dunno how they split. that pattern has repeated for the past 2 batches according to him. anybody knows how its decided? i dun think its solely random.. and neither will they just post u to camps near ur house.</p>

              <p>Your school will just sent CPC the list of ppl who have finish the course and the CPC clerks will randomly allocate everyone to the units that needs people randomly. This is part of the job scope of 1 of my friend who works in CPC last time. Signallers was 1 of the vocation he does the posting.</p>

              <p>ok, but are they "supposed" to post us to somewhere near our house? like are instructions given to them to post us to near our home as much as possible? but just that they are too lazy to bother and make things difficult for themselves thats y they just anyhow post. or are there no instructions given to them at all?</p>
