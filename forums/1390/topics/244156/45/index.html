              <p>ok, but are they "supposed" to post us to somewhere near our

              <p>Good question, i always forget it. Just know P is for personel but no need care what it stands for. Its just a branch in CMPB where the clerks determine all the fate of your camp posting but as far as i know, vocational posting is not done by them.</p>

              <p>Thats a good question which i dunno the answer. Some people say its already decided before you enlist, some say its affected by that test u do at CMPB during checkup etc etc. All i know is its not the CPC clerks or at least my friend's job to do vocation posting but only camp posting.</p>

              <p>You would already have a posting when you disrupt IF you completed the whole BMT and POPed just that you might not have been informed beforehand. What unit you will get will most likely be that posting which you didn't know of.</p>

              <p>Hey, I'm a relatively new guy from CPC PMC. CPC PMC stands for Control of Personnel Center, People Matters Center. Managing NSF postings is done by a single branch only. The majority of the people in the unit deal with the development of career for WOSpecs actually.</p>
              <p>Only a small team does vocation assignments. Staff officer is an old man who has been there since CPC began. He is quite nice really, but if he (or another satff member) accidentally assigned you a wrong vocation, then too bad.</p>
              <p>NSFs (and other adult staff members) are able to decide what camp you go, if there are multiple units to choose from. Currently, only 8 posts are given to NSFs that directly deal with posting of people to camps. It is no easy feat. During the post-POP period, some guys have to stay still 9pm or 11pm just to finish their work, if they are dealing with combat vocations. I like to think that I have more power than the 3SGs/2SGs/2LTs that I have met.</p>
              <p>In deciding units, priority is given to units that have shortfall (and esp those that make requests). Organizational requirements come first. Whether the camp is near your house is a smaller factor. However, for those technicians, you guys have no choice but to be sent to Ayer Rajah.</p>
              <p>If you hate your vocation, well, see if you are lucky to get OOC, or get a nice recommendation from your specialist/MO.</p>

              <p>Hey, I'm a relatively new guy from CPC PMC. CPC PMC stands for
              Control of Personnel Center, People Matters Center. Managing NSF
              postings is done by a single branch only. The majority of the
              people in the unit deal with the development of career for WOSpecs
              actually.</p>
              <p>Only a small team does vocation assignments. Staff officer is an
              old man who has been there since CPC began. He is quite nice
              really, but if he (or another satff member) accidentally assigned
              you a wrong vocation, then too bad.</p>
              <p>NSFs (and other adult staff members) are able to decide what
              camp you go, if there are multiple units to choose from. Currently,
              only 8 posts are given to NSFs that directly deal with posting of
              people to camps. It is no easy feat. During the post-POP
              period, some guys have to stay still 9pm or 11pm just to
              finish their work, if they are dealing with combat
              vocations. I like to think that I have more power than the
              3SGs/2SGs/2LTs that I have met.</p>
              <p>In deciding units, priority is given to units that have
              shortfall (and esp those that make requests). Organizational
              requirements come first. Whether the camp is near your house is a
              smaller factor. However, for those technicians, you guys have no
              choice but to be sent to Ayer Rajah.</p>
              <p>If you hate your vocation, well, see if you are lucky to get
              OOC, or get a nice recommendation from your specialist/MO.</p>

              <p>I don't think my database allows me to check the people who end
              up in RSAF and RSN. CPC does not manage 100% of NSFs.</p>
              <p>I didn't say anything negative about Ayer Rajah. Just that all
              guys who are technicians (no matter where they live) have to go
              there for at least 3 months. I also heard about the good food.
              Never been there myself though.</p>

              <p>But why single out technicians? Why don't say drivers all posted to sembawang where the food sucks etc etc, should not say too many units and their training school locations in case its confidential.</p>

              <p>I was just illustrating an example where all servicemen are
              dumped into the same unit, regardless of where they live, becuase
              there is only 1 central unit that can accomodate them.</p>

              <p>Actually thats the case for all logistics vocations and a few combat vocations. The training schools are all allocated in certain camp and they all go there only to post out later to the individual units</p>
