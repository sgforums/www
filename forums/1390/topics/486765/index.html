              to collect and keep all documents relating to your injury and your
              treatment. These will help when you submit the injury report and

              sustained an injury during your NS training, it may be considered
              as attributable to service only when service is the cause of
              injury. If you sustained an injury during ICT, you are required to
              report immediately to your unit’s Medical Officer and unit S1. This
              is so that your unit can arrange to attend to your injury, and
              document your injury sustained in your medical docket.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"> <br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"> Before MINDEF determines that an injury is attributable to service,
              you are responsible for bearing all medical expenses. Treatment for
              your injury must be sought at government or restructured hospitals
              at your eligible ward and referred to by a government or SAF
              Medical Officer.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"> <br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"> In the case of permanent disablement due to service injury, a
              medical board will be convened. Eligibility for disability
              compensation will be based on the degree of residual permanent
              disability as endorsed by the SAF Medical Board.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"> <br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"> If your service injury requires continuous medical or
              hospitalisation leave beyond your ICT period, you are eligible for
              a stepped-down compensation as a form of ex-gratia payment.
              Compensation will be based on your civilian pay or an equivalent
              regular serviceman’s pay (whichever is higher) if you do not
              receive any income from your employers. This ex-gratia payment is
              compensation for your loss of income during this period. Payment
              will cease when you are no longer on medical/hospitalisation leave
              or when disability compensation is paid, whichever is
              earlier.</span></p>

              serviceman make a claim for the medical costs incurred for service
              injury?</strong><br> <br> The PMC (Personnel Management Centre) will issue all serviceman
              with the SI (Service Injury) Card if their injuries have been
              approved as attributable to service by the Pensions / Awards
              Officer. The serviceman must produce this card to be eligible for
              fully-subsidised medical treatment at the government / restructured
              hospitals.<br> <br> If the SI Card is not produced when seeking treatment, the
              serviceman will have to pay for all the medical cost first and seek
              reimbursement via the respective PMCs with the following
              documents:<br> <br> a. the original medical bills and payment receipts<br> <br> b. a memorandum from the attending doctor to prove that the
              treatment received was for his service injury.<br> <br> The serviceman is required to notify his PMC immediately when he
              loses his SI Card. There will be an administrative charge of $15
              for each replacement of lost or defaced SI Card. He will need to
              make the payment via MINDEF Cashier / Internet and submit the
              receipt to the unit PMC before he will be issued a new SI
              Card.<br> <br> While waiting for the SI Card to be issued or replaced, the
              serviceman may approach the respective PMCs for the issuance of the
              SI Memo (a temporary identification document) for the
              fully-subsidised medical treatment.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #008000;">It is crucial that you update your NS
                      HRCs if you develop a new medical condition or if an existing
                      medical condition has worsened, which may affect your ICT
                      performance. This is so that arrangements will be made for you to
                      attend a medical review at the SAF medical centre to assess your
                      fitness condition for NS.<br> <br> You <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MUST</span></em> bring along all your investigation results and memorandums from
                      your external physician or specialist during your medical review.
                      You may be given a medical certificate for ICT deferment, be
                      scheduled for a medical board to downgrade you if your medical
                      condition is significant, or be referred to a restructured hospital
                      for further examination depending on the outcome of your medical
                      review.<br> <br> If your medical condition is deemed suited for ICT participation by
                      the medical officer, you will then be allowed to attend
                      ICT.</span></p>

              <p>Suit accuses SAF of failing to provide safe and conducive training environment</p>

              <div class="clearall"> </div>
              <div class="byline">By K C Vijayan Senior Law Correspondent</div>
              <div class="clearall"> </div>
              <p>The family of a national serviceman who died in 2012 after an 
              allergic reaction to smoke grenades is suing the Singapore Armed Forces 
              (SAF) for allegedly failing to provide a safe training environment.</p>
              <p>Private Dominique Sarron Lee's platoon commander and the exercise's chief safety officer are also being sued for negligence.</p>
              <p>The suit has been filed in the High Court, where claims exceed 
              $250,000. The damages being sought include $34,300 for Pte Lee's 
              tombstone.</p>
              <p>The 21-year-old suffered breathing difficulties and passed out during
               the exercise in Lim Chu Kang in April 2012, which involved the use of 
              six smoke grenades.</p>
              <p>The former track athlete from the Singapore Sports School was 
              evacuated to Sungei Gedong Medical Centre before being warded at 
              National University Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at about 2pm 
              the same day.</p>
              <p>A coroner's inquiry in August 2013 found that he had died from an 
              acute allergic reaction to zinc chloride, a key compound used in smoke 
              grenades.</p>
              <p>The coroner also agreed with the findings of an independent Committee
               of Inquiry in 2012 which said that the number of smoke grenades used in
               the exercise exceeded the limit of two specified in safety regulations.</p>
              <p>State Coroner Imran Abdul Hamid also pointed out that Pte Lee had 
              "underplayed and underdeclared" his asthma history during a 
              pre-enlistment medical check-up, in which he failed to mention his 
              latest attack.</p>
              <p>The plaintiff in the suit, filed by lawyer Irving Choh, has been listed as the estate of Pte Lee.</p>
              <p>His parents are divorced.</p>
              <p>According to the court papers, Captain Najib Hanuk Muhamad Jalal, 
              then the platoon commander in the 3rd Battalion Singapore Infantry 
              Regiment to which Pte Lee was attached, and chief safety officer Captain
               Chia Thye Siong allegedly contributed to the death of Pte Lee.</p>
              <p>It is claimed that the officers were duty-bound to ensure that only 
              the maximum number of smoke grenades allowed under safety regulations 
              were detonated.</p>
              <p>It is also alleged that Capt Najib failed to bear in mind Pte Lee's 
              asthmatic condition, which made him more predisposed to suffering an 
              adverse reaction from the smoke.</p>
              <p>Pte Lee, who was diagnosed with asthma prior to enlisting in November
               2011, had to wear a blue band around his wrist to indicate his 
              condition.</p>
              <p>Capt Najib's lawyer R.S. Bajwa has filed a notice of appearance in court to address the case.</p>
              <p>Lawyer Laurence Goh Eng Yau is defending Capt Chia.</p>
              <p>The Attorney-General is named as a party in the suit, to defend the SAF.</p>
              <p>According to the suit, the SAF had a duty to provide a safe and conducive environment for Pte Lee to train in.</p>
              <p>This includes providing adequate protective gear for national 
              servicemen during exercises that involve the detonation of smoke 
              grenades.</p>
              <p>Among other things, it is claimed that the SAF failed to provide a 
              sufficient system of checks to ensure compliance with regulations, such 
              as the number of grenades which can be used.</p>
              <p>In the wake of the incident, SAF tightened its safety checks, 
              including having more safety officers on the ground, and set up an Army 
              Safety Review Board to examine the army's overall safety structure, 
              processes and culture.</p>
              <p>An Attorney-General's Chambers spokesman told The Sunday Times that 
              it has "filed an appearance in the action and is presently assessing the
               matter". A pre-trial conference is due next month.</p>
