              <p>2) Is this an annual thing. so i can be expect to be called up for ICT yearly?</p>
              <p>3) I just orded in Dec 07 how come i got unit so fast?? I though uni ppl usually in some holding list?</p>
              <p>4) Is it likely for them to amend the ICT dates after issuing the SAF 100? I'm asking this because i'm overseas the whole of May so i horlan if they change the dates to may</p>
              <p>5) Anyone in this unit also? Can get to know each other. This is my 1st ICT</p>
              <p>6) WTF should i bring when reporting??? No info give. PS this might be a bit kanchiong of me to ask but i'll just ask anyway.</p>

              Looks like you're posted to a laojiao unit, if mhcampboy's info (3 ICTs served) is correct. The bad news is the unit is probably ready to take things to the next level - i.e. overseas-training stints - now that the reservist commanders are comfortable taking charge. In Arty, for example, we went to ROC for a month each during our 4th &amp; 6th in-camps, with the unit performance peaking during this period (&amp; thereafter plummeting for the rest of the training cycle, as heavier civilian-career, spousal &amp; familial responsibilities took hold).
              
              Hmmm, funny that you're not following a newly-ORD IHL unit (it's usually the latest one or the next available one). Best to ask around when you report on whether your posting is permanent or just filling in (for someone who's deferred).
              
              On the 'IHL Blackout window': BTW Industrial training &amp; internships during varsity vacations still don't 'count', as far as I know. Your employers must still release you for ICTs if they overlap.

              I was called back thrice in 4 years at NUS myself. Two 3-week ICTs during the term breaks, plus 9 consecutive weekends burnt for a military-tattoo parade for SAF Day (during what's supposed to be a low-key year). Imagine how siong it must've been for those working reservists during the latter: work Mons to Fris, then report on Sats &amp; Suns from 8am to 12am &amp; it was stay out &amp; no count against the training cycle some more. 
              
              Also tio area I/C duties during mob manning duties during term time, &amp; I was staying in the hostel on the other side of the island!

              <p>actually it is depending on the previous unit during NSF. If it is a combat unit like arty/armour/SIR, then this will apply, cos they want everyone to be back together as a unit for ICT. But for other vocations such as storeman/driver/technician/service vocations etc, there should be another case.</p>
              <p>In my case, i ORD in 95 as an ammo technician, work for one year before entering NUS. They (2 PDF) call me up in 96. i got a letter from NUS certifying i am a full time student and send it to them. They acknowledge and send me letter telling me that i have been posted out from that reservist unit and then inform me that once i have graduated, must inform them immediately. but now dunno is it the same situation or not.</p>

              If the unit's only done 2 ICTS (presumably with a low-key year in between), then I suppose it's still fairly new enough to take in the undergrad-pengs. *shrug*
              
              How often do they designate IHL units in infantry anyway? In my time (start of the '90s), it was kinda like every alternate batch in Arty. So those Air-Level NSFs who were serving the extra half-year would follow the next ORD-ing unit for reservist, &amp; it was in turn designated accordingly as IHL. (Who knows, their old unit could've already conducted their first ICT before these 2.5-year CPLs finished their NS.) Quite systematic in that sense, cuz the formation only has 4 active units to rotate with (a 5th, 24 SA, doesn't "count" cuz they're radar trackers). Infantry, of course, has 6 active units.
