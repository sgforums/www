              <p>1 - How long before my enlistment can i go back to CMPB for a re-checkup?</p>
              <p>I am planning to do so, if possible, get to Pes B or BP.</p>
              <p>2 - What does "Modified BMT" stand for?</p>
              <p>3 - What are the vocations for PES C9?</p>
              <p>Well , you see my family is very into NS, its a 3-son family so we are all very interested in the guy stuff and all the military equipment BMT and my first brother went a very enjoyable NS (So enjoyable he even extended it, till a few months before entering University).</p>
              <p>4 - If i do enlist as a PES C9, can I get myself upgraded?</p>

              <p>It all depends on the medical condition that you got PES C9 for. Not all medical conditions can be upgraded just because you want to be.</p>
              <p>Modified BMT just means the PES C BMT which is modified from the usual PES A/B BMT.</p>
              <p>PES C9 are restricted to mostly all the logistics vocations like technician, driver, storeman, clerk, medic</p>

              <p>Well im a Fat C9, i was on a food-touring-session  when i  took my medical - so got chlolesterol problem.</p>

              <p>But before that, i was doing 10-20km jogs, heart healthy, no cholesterol or history of cholesterol, blood pressure was fine even at 100kg, fitness was good. I could run my 2.4 at 15mins (I know its still a fail, but think that if you are 60kg and carry 50kg and run 2.4km)</p>
              <p>So im definitely going to try my best to work it out, and i dont even mind going to BP to do a 19 week BMT under the new scheme.</p>

              <p>If you are really sure thats what you want, you can request to see the MO at CMPB again before your enlistment for a reevaluation of your PES status as early as possible when you think you can pass the cholesterol test since changing PES too late will delay your enlistment.</p>

              <p>U need to seriously reconsider if you want to be upgrade. Eventhough, IMHO, now BMT is much easier compared to maybe 5-10 years ago? Still Pes A/B BMT can be quite a lot of difference min term of toughness compared to Pes C.</p>

              <p>Hi Shuaze,</p>
              <p>As dkcx has kindly replied, you should do so as soon as possible. This is provided that you know that you can pass your cholesterol test though.</p>
