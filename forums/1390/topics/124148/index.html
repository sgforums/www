            <div class='col-md body'>Hello guys, seeing so many supportive people here I guess I'll post my problem here also.<br><br>I'm a PES C2L3 clerk with 8 months left to serve. I used to be PES B but downgraded so now supposed to go back for PES C BMT Recourse.<br><br>Problem is, I am facing some family problems and am thus reluctant to go back for recourse. My father has Stage IV cancer and nobody knows how long more he has. So I don't want to go BMT and only get to book out to be with my family on weekends. Family time is important to me now. Moreover, I don't want to regret not being around if anything bad happens to him while I am away in Tekong.<br><br>I managed to convince my MO to excuse me for the April intake, and now have to worry about the June and October intakes. My camp MO will be ORDing soon if I am not wrong, so I don't know if I can get him to excuse me again for the June batch by the time the request for FFI comes in.<br><br>My unit superiors are not very keen to help me request for BMT exemption from CPC as they do not think that CPC will approve such requests based on compassionate grounds. So I am now at my wits' end - What can I do?<br><br>I thought of getting my parents or an uncle to approach my area's MP for assistance (since servicemen are not allowed to approach MP for help). But am not sure how effective this would be. Or whether I will get punished for getting parents/relatives to approach MP for help.<br><br>Furthermore this BMT recourse thing is also not very relevant for me especially since I am excused IPPT, firearms, etc. So practically will just be going BMT for the sake of having been there. Of course there are other things like IFC and teamwork and etc that they teach there but considering my situation is it really more important for me to attend BMT than to stay near my family in this difficult time?<br><br>Anybody know of people in similar situation that managed to get exemption or know who to approach?</div>
