            <div class='col-md body'>Our ArmyÂ’s soldiers will soon have to face new challenges during live-firing as revamped shooting packages that are more realistic and effective are introduced. On 13 and 17 May, Chief of Army (COA) MG Desmond Kuek and other commanders were given a briefing on the shooting package and also test-fired the new shoot for themselves.<br><br>Devised by the School of Infantry Weapons and the School of Infantry Specialists, these new shooting packages are designed to <strong>make the shoots more tactical and operational. </strong>For the improved Advanced Target Practice (ATP) package <strong>targets now come up at random instead of having predetermined positions.</strong> This thus simulates a battlefield more closely where the enemy can appear anywhere.<br><br>There is also a whole new combat shoot package being introduced. The package involves people in <strong>a firing detail working together to shoot at their targets, receiving collective rather than individual scores. </strong>This shoot thus requires the firers to practice their coordination and communication with each other and also introduces to the soldiers the concept of overlapping arcs of fire.<br><br>For both the packages, there are <strong>manoeuvre and support versions to cater to the soldiers in different Formations. </strong>Soldiers in the Infantry, Guards, Commando and Armour Formations would go through the manoeuvre shoot that is designed to simulate assault actions. Soldiers in Artillery, Engineers, and Signals would go through the support shoot, which focuses more on defensive positions.<br><br>The new shooting packages also use between <strong>20-68% less ammunition than before, four magazines instead of eight, and require much less time spent at the shooting range.</strong><br><br>After test-firing, COA and the commanders gave their stamp of approval on the new shoot. COA noted, Â“The shoot is more challenging, more realistic, and it sees how people can work together as a team.Â”<br><br>The expected launch of the new shooting packages is in July. Watch your front for it!<br><br>-- ANI<br><br>[/quote]<br><br>going to be harder / easier to get marksmanship?<br><br>will there be a team marksmanship award??</div>

But you can't really put a hard cap on it, can you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  The good thing about kneepads is that it allows you to lie prone or kneeling for an extended period of time. If they do come up with an integrated kneepad design for our No. 4, it will probably be the soft type. Under prolonged use, wear and tear, and washing , I dunno if it can still provide that same level of padding.<br><br>Btw, a little off-topic here, but speaking of No. 4, the SAF should change the camo pattern to the digital types now. Harder to see the individual soldier, as it is designed to confuse the human eye... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Unlike our No. 4, which consist of stripes and splotches of green, brown and black, the new digital camo is actually a mess of small squares of different shades of green, black and brown. Look at the Canadian link:<br><br><a href="http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/Chief_Land_Staff/Clothe_the_soldier/hab/1/13_e.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/Chief_Land_Staff/Clothe_the_soldier/hab/1/13_e.asp</a><br><br>This is even better:<br><br><a href="http://www.hyperstealth.com/CADPAT-MARPAT.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hyperstealth.com/CADPAT-MARPAT.htm</a><br><br>I looked at the camo pattern from a distance of 50-60 metres before...all I saw was a mess of colours no different from the greenery around. Its because our eyes can only process that many colours and shapes at one time<br><br>I'm sure the SAF can come up with something similar also.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
