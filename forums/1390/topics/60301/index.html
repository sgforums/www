I have an infantry manual book and i have to learn all the specs just in case we are tested by those guys who activate you during standby. Wonder where you get your 4.06kg for M16 really....? By the way, i have handled both weapons before, 6 weeks for M16. And sometimes i uses SAR21 for live firing, outfield and range. Where did you get the 4.06kg really? For it certainly feel really lighter than SAR21.<br>After using SAR21 for over a year and feedbacks of it's pros and cons from my bunkmate who use it i can share with you specifically if you want.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry, but your handbook appears to be way off. Load your M-16 up to combat weight, and stick it on a weighting machine. The M-16 weights a good 8.79 pounds, or 3.99 kilos. That's not counting the bayonet attatchment and other combat acessories that would might like to stick on it.<br><br>2.7 kilos? Not very likely unless you are using some special version that is made of high tech lightweight polymers. The actual weight of the SAR-21 versus M-16 differs depending on the acessories you stick on it, but the offical stats in are that an SAR-21 should be marginally lighter. Have you considered that your experience of a heavier SAR could be due to it's more centric CG which makes it feel heaiver to those M-16 shooters who are used to the forward balance of the M-16? It seems that way.<br><br>If you have been shooting poorer on the SAR-21, it's probably because you have been applying your M-16 shooting techniques to the bullpup, or are simply too ingrained to the M-16 that any reaction to the SAR is that of a kneejerk reaction that tends to spot flaws with the weapon, rather then actually getting down to learn to shoot the weapon properly.<br><br>If you ask me, I prefer a weapon that's more accucrate, durable and most importantly, reliable and does not IA in battle after having being through mud, water, sand and dust, and at the same time not having to be constantly taken care of everyday and still preform. I'm afraid the M-16 doesn't quite cut that, but the SAR does pretty well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bah, I tot you were refering to the M16A2, which is a bit heavier but by any standards the definative M-16 variant in terms of reliability, accuracy and other nick nacks.<br><br>Yes, the SAR-21 is heavier then our little S1, but that's mainly due to the inclusion of a no parallax 1.5x scope and the LAM, which in my opinion, is a good trade in for combat effectiveness. Esp. when the marginal increase in weight means that shooting becomes a lot more accucrate.<br><br>Yes I handled both weapons before and snapped off enough shots to know that the SAR-21's reputation as a "failure" is more due to ignorance and M-16 worship syndrome then actual preformance. And of course, I do have a guards friend which has extensive experience with both weapons to make an impartial choice about them.<br><br>I like the weapon for the fact it rarely IAs (and you can adjust the gas tap selector), and you don't have to worry about parallax and sight pictures to snap your targets down. Pratice is what you need to get used to the SAR-21 shooting method, not shoot a few rounds, note how different it is from the M16, and get irrated.<br><br>In the end, it's the concept of the assualt rifle that that produces projectiles and makes it easy to direct these projectiles at a target while making sure it does survive field abuse and conditions that matters. Not what emotional attatchment we actually feel with a vintage weapon. Sadly, it's not surprising that most soldiers tend to stick with what they know, and not actually exporing new possibilties with other weapons.<br><br>It's strange how many grunts tend to view the SAR-21 through the M-16 yardstick, which is a strange one for an assualt rifle, for the M-16 is a fragile, unreliable and complicated one as assualt rifles go in history. Somehow the fact that the SAR-21 is far more reliable, accucrate, well balanced, durable, idiot-proof and loaded with features that the M-16 can only emulate at far greater modification and cost, is conviently glossed over by many soldiers who insist on sticking with their M-16, which by any standards, is a poor and rapidly obsolent weapon.<br><br>Comparing the M-16 with the SAR-21 is prehaps akin to comparing an M-60 Patton with an Abrams tank. I doubt many grunts actually gave the SAR-21 an fair trail.<br><br>If weight is an issue, go grab an MP-5 submachine gun and jump into battle.<br><br>Amazingly, many of the same people argue against using body armour as it is way too heavy esp when stats show that wearing body armour can cut fatalities and casuties in battle by up to 70 percent! Just because it's too heavy. I pity the army that is obessive about cutting weight to the point of sacrificing actual effectiveness.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by jacobs:<br>M16:<br>-Lighter at around 2.7kg.<br>-Simple.<br></blockquote>Erm, as international AR standards go, the M16 isn't a simple rifle, in terms of operating principle. Want a simple rifle? Go look at an AK-47. The SAR-21's inner works are actually far simpler then the M16, and the rifle strips into much less parts which are easier to take apart and put together. In terms of pratical field complexity, meaning the complex tasks you have to preform to strip or clean the rifle, the SAR is certainly far easier to handle then the M16.<br><br>In war, a reliable and idiot proof weapon can be want makes the difference between life and death.<br><br><blockquote><br>-War-proven.<br>-Have the same range as SAR21.<br>-Weight is well-distributed.<br></blockquote>Ahem, the M16's track record has been very troubled, by any means. In vietnam the thing was hated to the core when it was first introduced, it jammed like crazy, fouled and was poor in bad conditions. The M16's reliability is a sad footnote in history as one of the most unreliable infantry firearms ever produced.<br><br>Consquent versions improved on this defect, and though it is far better then in the vietnam, any grunt can tell you this rifle is still a tempremental one that requires a lot of attention to keep it going. In war, you may not have the chance to be so nice to it. The only reason the SAS decided to use this over the SA80 was because that piece of British junk was even worse then the M16.<br><br>The maximum effective range of the SAR-21 is actually more then the M16. The longer redesigned barrel allows it to hurl projectiles a bit faster and further.<br><br>As for weight is well distributed, I'm afraid you have not shot many firearms to know what this means. In terms of egronomics, the M16 is very primitive. You want to experience good weight distribution? Try your hand at an MP5.<br><br>If anything, the M16's weight is forward heavy, as opposed to the centralized CG of the SAR-21. Leaverage plays a larger role in egronomics then sheer weight. This means that despite being lighter in weight, it is actually harder to handle and aim the M16 as it requires quite a bit more strength and cordination from the left hand.<br><br>I don't think many modern rifles are made to be front heavy like the M16. The general theory now is that either centralized CG (sar-21) or rear weighted rifles (TAR-21) are easier to point index and use.<br><br>Centralized CG allows the SAR-21 to be easily held and  fired one handed, if need be. By focusing the weight onto the right hand, the left hand is left with far less weight to adjust and aim the rifle, allowing quicker snap point indexing and easier aiming.<br><br><blockquote><br>SAR21:<br>-Not easy to get rusty.<br>-Higher accuracy in the day.<br>-Shorter, gd for BUA fighting.<br></blockquote>The reliability of the SAR-21 is certainly far in excess that of the M16.<br><br><blockquote><br>I have some bad things to share regarding SAR21, not to bring down it's name. SAR21 doesn't really withstand knocks well as in the laser aiming device often comes loose.</blockquote>Ahem, this is certainly not true. You can slam the rifle to the ground a few times and find that it still works prefectly and that was demostrated. The SAR-21 has been engineered to be far tougher then the M16. Unless you want to argue that the M16 can be abused as hard as the SAR21, I doubt "it dosen't really wistand knocks well" really holds up.<br><br>I think it would be prudent to readjust the LAD after it has been knocked loose, there's no going around it.<br><br>The thing now is, the generally mentality going around SAF circles from what I gathered, is that they are treating the SAR with a galss rifle mentality not because it is fragile, but because the rifle is new and they don't like the idea of abusing it too soon.<br><br><blockquote><br>It would be best if they weld it.

And you shouldn't be complainting about sharp plastics as this feature will be probably that could safe your life considering they are a large part of the reason why the SAR-21 is so tough and reliable.<br><br>My only gripes with that thing is that they could include regular iron sights above the scope instead of the ridiculus knobs, and a better safety fire selector position. Other then that, the rifle is an excellent piece of work.</div>

Secondly, the sharp edges is internal plastic's edges, not really crucial parts. About the LAD again, have you tried before at 300m range? can't find the red dot at all when i aimed squarely on the target. The rifle sadly isn't idiot proof too.... the safety catch has no indication with two colours, think have to squeeze trigger to try? if is on fire mode, you will misfire. It's a gd package, but please, it has things to refine, like what i have stated. By the way, the SAR21 is heavier at the front because of the LAD.</div>
