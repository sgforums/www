            <div class='col-md body'>Well, after your BMT , you would go through ur specialist training at SISPEC.<br>After that u will come back to mowbray camp for SPEC 2 course for 3 months.<br>Upon completing it, you will be a sgt in the unit.  You can be posted to companies like Secret Investigation Branch, Security Branch, Dog Unit, Mindef..If u kena Active Provost company, good luck to u! coz it's the most xiong company even though u are a specialist. Life in MP as a regular is not bad, only it gets very monotonous...my sgt who's a regular in there actually regretted signing on MP becoz of that. The regulars there are 8-5..actually almost everyone there go home at 5, unless you are doing duty or u are still a trainee in the camp.</div>
