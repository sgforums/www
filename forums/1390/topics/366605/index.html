              <p>You will be revocated to any of the non combat vocations such as clerk, storeman, technician, driver, medic etc. Noone knows where u will be sent since its not confirm until the day u get your posting which can take anything from weeks to months after OOT.</p>
              <p>Recourse will depend on whether you get downPES after seeing the specialist and will only happen much later so don't worry about it so soon.</p>

              <p>Where you recourse and what your vocation will be is not the point, The critical issue is - Why did a normal healthy person like you would 'black out' on a simple 8km normal march, where everyone suffers little or nothing except tiredness only?</p>
              <p>Your heath is of primary concern. Perhaps you may want to see an outside physician for a second opinion, find the problem, get the remedy. Even if you were to be assigned to less hectic vocation, but when you work in real life later, the pressures and responsibilities, the long hours, espacially since you are probably are a UK degree holder (I'm presuming here) and will be working at management levels, all added up can be worse than a mere 8km march</p>
              <p>Take care.</p>

              <p>sending you to unit is nothing.... you will be clerk, storeman, help out nia. There is not training while you wait for BMT recourse.</p>
              <p>But when you go for bmt recourse, you get to go thru the whole damn shit again. Well, black out during BMT route march is very common. Last time, my fren fell face first during a route march, but he recovered the next day and completed his BMT.</p>
              <p>Tell ya self its all in the mind. but dont push ya limits to the max. If ya feel sick start falling out. Dont wait till limit then black out. With correct mental preparation, you can do it.</p>
