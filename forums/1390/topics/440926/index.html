              <p>Hi forumers I'm asking this for my friend. He is pes e clerk and has got quite abit of health problems which require frequent medical followup. Happens that my unit is a garang one and they are taking issues with his frequent medical appointments. Now I do know that under extremely special circumstances, RSO is a previlege that can be revoked for people suspected of malingering. However, can your unit superiors revoke or limit your right to go for medical appointments when they are reffered by polyclinics/saf doctors and these appointments are in goverment hospitals? Who should you seek if you feel that this is happening to them.</p>
              <p>Share with me your constructive views. Cheers!</p>

              <p>As long as your friend has official medical appointments with a specialist, only another medical specialist has the right to stop your friend from going.</p>
              <p>If his superiors want to bar him, they are doing so at their own peril.</p>
              <p>No, seriously. If your friend drops dead because his superiors stopped him from going for his appointments, at best their careers will end, and at worst they will all face manslaughter charges.</p>
              <p>If his superiors try to stop him, he can raise it with the unit MO. He'll raise merry hell for them for trying to override his specialist referral orders.</p>

              <p>Medical appointments are written on the appointment card. So it is considered as a written-proof.Besides every appointment is accompained by an attendance sheet or MC.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is the specialist who give the follow-up appointments, not the patient.</p>
              <p>Do you think that the boss is stupid enough to revoke a medical appt? If that person happened to be a diabetic or have a heart problem, and he do not do his checkup on time and happen to die the next day. How is SAF going to be responsible for it?</p>
              <p>In some cases, the person may be taking some dangerous drug with side-effects. Constant monitoring is absolute, he might have a medical appointment every 2 weeks or every month.</p>
              <p>If the boss dares to step over his line, the person can complain to his boss's boss. He can also complain to the chief or defence minister directly. This is an issue of life and death and it is not a joke to play around.</p>
              <p>Besides, do you think it is funny, for a patient to get this blood drawn every month, or get insulin jab every day? </p>
              <p>Medical appointment is a right. Even if the whole unit have to go overseas 3 months, the personnel will be excluded from training to attend medical appt. At most, he will be attached to mindef HQ for the period.</p>

              <p>well. unit can always limit you to anything. however if it's due to medical condition you can always go to the MO and raise the issue. BUT if your case not genuine please don't push the limit.</p>
              <p>RSO may look like a privilege but you can make it a "must" for you. Just head to the MO tell him you got this this condition, if require to come back camp you just ask him; would he or any regulars willing to take the responsilibity? of cos you gotta provide some medical evidences. And depending on your luck see if you can request for a letter from the MO to ALLOW you to RSO. Well it happens in my unit. If you are the kengster kind, few advices, keng something that cannot be detected. do some research on some medication related. medications that are not available at the medical centre or show them some damn strong medications or controlled drugs that only hospitals have. with such strong reason, i believe few would dare to stop you.</p>
              <p>As to RSO that leads to malingering, i guess as long as you RSO and stay at home, you will be safe. they can touch no hair of yours.</p>
              <p>these are just my opinions. take it or not up to you.</p>
