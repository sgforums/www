            <div class='col-md body'>Hello,<br><br>Recently I've injured myself during Reservist and got my knee dislocated. I'm currently waiting for ACL reconstruction and menisci repair. I have large joint effusions at the posterior intercondylar and lateral joint line. Tears at the posterior horn on both medial and lateral menisci and anterior tibial shift due to a complete ACL tear among others.<br><br>Currently I am claiming all medical expenses from my company. But I am wondering if I should claim from MINDEF first since I sustained the injury during Reservist? Anybody familiar with this type of claim procedures?<br><br>Anybody here went thru ACL surgery before? How's the road to recovery like?<br><br>Thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>previously during NSF days i remember 1 or 2 frens got this same issue<br><br>basically, you need to prove that this injury is sustained during the course of your reservist training .. ie this is a service injury.<br><br>very important .... what exactly were you doing when you sustained the injury? is it during training ? is it during your own recreation sports during reservist time?<br><br>did you report sick to the medical centre immediately?<br>did you inform your officers that you sustained the injury?<br><br>did you see the MO for him to examine you and for him to document the injury into your medical records.... this is actually proof that you sustained the injury during training.....<br><br>if you did all the above... then you should have no problems claiming from SAF for your injuries. Go through your unit S1 who will then give you the relevant instructions...<br><br>if you did not do the above, then there is no evidence to to show that your injury is sustained during training, therefore  it will be unlikely for you to claim for your injury.................<br><br>hope this helps</div>

Was sent to the medical centre and the MO referred me to Tan Tock Seng. However, right now I am a private patient. I guess I will just give my unit a call to find out more...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Thanks.<br></div>

This will take some time though...... so in the mean time, you've gotta settle the bills and once its been approved as a svc inj, you'll be paid back + u should be getting free med coverage for this inj.

At least after this, you'll be compensated for your costs. Next step is to claim Permanent Disability compensation. And trust me, you are definitely entitled to it for this injury.<br><br>As for the hassle, you'll probably need to make bout 2 trips back to camp, and once to MMI. Not that bad la.....<br><br>Claiming money for private doctor eh? Personally never seen such a case lol. Ill try to read the directive when i get back to camp and get back to ya on that one......<br><br>wow..... u got 6 wks MC when u first got injured? My MO only gave me 2 wks MC. When my spec gave me another 2 wks, he cut it...... forced to go to camp even though i couldnt bend my leg <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Mm, actually there's an allograft option that's quite common in other countries. Do discuss with your spec...... i heard the recovery time is much faster....  although im not sure if its available in Singapore..... my doc only offered me hamstring or patella.</div>
