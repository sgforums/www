              <p><br>i took it once as a kid. and hell i swear never to take it again. it was a scary experience. damn noisy and damn jialat. i remember i was standing, and i was crying the entire journey, covering my ears with my arms while holding to the pole for support. scary man.</p>
              <p>yeah they should close it down. it's an ancient relic which has zero use for singapore. but then again, it belongs to the m'sians...and funnily which i can NEVER understand in my life is why did we let them build it so deep in the first place? it's a friggin eyesore. did you guys see their plot of land? friggin dirty and messed up. i used to study in a school near the railway at cck there...there was once i went to check out the post/house of some guy manning the railway at that area. i didn't go in, but i did see the things outside. it was machiam like his mini-kampong house. haha! clothes hanging outside, plastic red chairs outside, and the lights were turned on inside the house/post. and surrounding that area are modern HDB flats. like wow...classic eyesore. a fine comparison of m'sia and s'pore i thought. classic.</p>
              <p>and yeah, i'm so waiting for the day they shut down the railway system. it's quite a pain in the ass. they are using quite alot of our sovereign land which somehow i feel like it's not much different from a land invasion or conquest. and also i never quite understood why did such a deal came down. furthermore, isn't the railway one darn good way of ferrying illegal immigrants, goods and worse of all...m'sian troops. i used to wonder what if they launch a sudden invasion on us, with their troops loaded into their trains and ferried into singapore...and after landing and blowing us up a good bit, they officially declare war. it wouldn't be damn hard for them to ferry troops in, is it?</p>

              <p>They should stop it because no one Singaporean takes that silly rail train anymore. Only M'sians take it to come here and go back.</p>
              <p>It's the worst attack on the ass most people know (though most Singaporeans I know have never taken it and only knows of it through hearsay as a horror story) and very early 20th century, in no way an Orient Express.</p>
