I'm just too pissed..<br><br>today i went to seletar camp (in no. 4 riding an saf vehicle no less) and forgot my 11B. To my surprise and horror, the guard house don't want to accept any other form of identification that i have on me. I had my camp pass, saf ezlink card and saf driving license and they don't accept any of this. In the end i was refused entry as i can't change a visitor pass.<br><br>I mean what sort of system is this. If some guy forgets his 11B and his no civilian driving license, that means he can't have access to other camps even on official business? wtf logic is this esp since got so many other forms of identification i had with me</div></blockquote>actuali they hv to be cautious so cannot blame them... if u lost ur 11b u go report, else go back take lo...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>don't blame the RPs they are just doing their job. if their CSM/RSM finds out they let people in without proper documents, they are going to sign extras, not u.<br><br>anyway Seletar RPs are one of the most on-balls RPs in the SAF. their guardhouse CSM (a MSG, don't know still there or not) is also very on the ball.<br><br>just to brief u all on the documents allowed for changing of pass. they are;<br><br>[*] 11B for soldiers<br>[*] Pink/Blue IC for civilians<br>[*] Driving license<br>[*] Valid non-expired work permit for foreign workers<br>[*] 15A aka temporary 11B issued by the unit if u have misplace your 11B.<br><br>if u have none of the documents above for whatever reasons, u may use your non-expired passport to change for a pass.<br><br>if u lost your 11B, it is advisable u make a police report asap and keep the police report with u where ever u go.<br><br>alternately u can call up the contact person inside the unit and tell him to speak with the RPs or their superiors to grant u entry.<br><br>depending on camps, some camps don't allow using camp passes to exchange for visitor pass.</div>
