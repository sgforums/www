            <div class='col-md body'>the biggest joke i don't understand about the entire SAF is this....<br><br>k, i don't anyhow say this but there's a manpower directive on how schools instructors (by this i mean PCs, and 3SG) are posted...<br><br>in summary, the ratio of B-graders and above to C-graders (during their SISPEC/OCS) would be lower for schools. e.g. for every B-grade there will be 10 C grade going to bmtc. the ratio is determined by manpower requirements of other units since priority is to them first.<br><br>Those who go operational battalions are like mostly better performers. since ratio is to their advantage.<br><br>In short, i am trying to say, BMTC and other schools/units (BCTC, ITI, NCC) comprises of instructors who do not perform that well during the SISPEC/OCS training.  Also, 3SG who "pass out" from OCS, will definitely go schools, these people are mostly OOC for reasons you and i clearly know.<br><br>Especially in BMTC, are we not supposed to groom future commanders? ANd yet commanders are chosen by the very people who do not perform?<br><br>So non-performers are trying to groom recruits to perform??<br><br>This is in very stark contrast to schools of the US and UK army where performers or the best in the cadre will remain behind as instructors. Whereas others with fairer knowledge of combat skills will continue to hone it in their units.</div>

Many ppl in this world do think for themselves, not just singaporeans and the government would not help you especially if you are in dire straits. Where do you stand after you do your NS? even when i was presented a medical condition i still have to pay a substantial amount. Sucky....everytime i think of those ppl from china that do not have to go for NS and get priorities in jobs and places in our tertiary institutions / universities here i get so pissed<br><br>How could NS be meaningful with the way Nsfs are being treated? and is everyone suitable for NS? I would rather help out in a hospital then shoot stuff in the jungle . Millions have gone through NS but billions haven't gone through it. So what makes them special then?<br><br>2 years in your youth is a lot... How many 2 years of youth does one have?i am already in my 20s and to know i have 2 more years of s**t going on for me for NS is so disheartening...before i am even enlisted I keep receiving letters asking me to go for this and that and i have to disrupt my studies every now and then. Not to mention CMPB is so inefficient.. and after 2 years of NS there is still this reservist thingy. Not to mention the shit pay NSFs  receive in the army. Even when i call for a job appt , even the government sector, ppl told me they are looking for those who have done their NS and do not have to do NS for the jobs...and the pay isn't that great too....I could have work and study for the job before going full-time on my job in not for tht s****y NS....NS...a complete waste of time<br><br>and those who say ppl who regular chao keng in NS is a reflection of their attitude in their worklife is a bunch of bulls***. NSFs are being made to do something they aren't willing to do</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ponders:</div><div class="quote_body">THey do select who the future leaders of SAF. depending when you met these BMTC commanders, i can tell you the past ones are better than the current ones.<br><br>but how would one select what best for SAF when these commanders themselves do not know what's expected of them since they themselves haven't seen the operational side of SAF.<br><br>well, if you talking about instructional methods, everything in BMTC is already in lesson plans. they just follow what the lesson plans say. BUt on the intangible aspects in training them, they do not demand standards, they do not teach to convince but tekan as a show of force.<br><br>It has somehow become a culture there, "my sergeant tekan me when i was a recruit, so now it's my turn to tekan them".<br><br>Of course i am not saying everyone is like that, but i would say overwhelming numbers have done so that bmtc instuctors are stereotyped.<br><br>as for commanders selecting commanders... its really sad... i have personally seen SIT TEST assistant assessors (PC/PS/Sect comds) randomly assigning marks simple because they are tired. Since sit test scoring is somewhat confidential....  i would say he gave his detail like.... first 5 guys on the list X-number of marks. the next 3 Y-number of marks and last 3 Z-number.<br><br>So is this not a joke?<br><br></div></blockquote>The purpose of this school is to train soldiers with basic soldiering knowledge.  Their specific roles, combat skills and knowledge will be further enhance in their respective units.<br><br>How sure are you on the selection process? Is it solely determine by OC/PC level? Even OCS/SISPEC is not disclosing this themselves.<br><br>Indeed, the incident that you provide sadden me if it was true.<br>But recently I heard that they are implementing a new system whereby all commanders-hopeful will be tested together in SISPEC by more experience WOs. Hope this new system works out fine.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The system is degenerating into a farce.<br><br>There is so much difference in the training regiment.Course outline aside, what the army and country needs to do is to make us all feel that the 2 years spent in there is worth it.It is impossible to exhort people to rise up and be counted when those that do rise up on their own account are slapped down.<br><br>However, recruits these days should also learn some form of gratitude.Your seniors have gone through 2.5 years and their training was much more siong than present.If you cannot take the training, then by all means pull your stunts or march on.It is about teaching you to make your own choices in life, to make a judgement call.<br><br>Jeez, wtf I see so many wimpy teens nowadays, all spoilt and soft, superficial and stubborn without due cause and brains.Granted, NS is a conscription and it's fair enough if you have a different work ethic outside, but virtues such as perseverance and commitment also need to be nurtured, you cannot expect them  to turn themselves on automatically when you graduate/ORD and begin your career.<br><br>And for those of you who think there is zilch to learn in the army, open your eyes.There are many things you can learn, whether it's small or big.Right now, we are not the policymakers, so if it's gotta be done, at least do it well, and tactically too, as long as you don't cause inconvenience to your mates.<br><br>I did not like NS,but at least I learnt a few things about man-management and organizational behavior.</div>
