Posted as sniper PC (recommended by my OCS PC and OC, and of course i did not have a say in my posting haha) attended sniper course there after.<br><br>This was what i have gathered ... First of all, it's your performance in SISPEC not BMT that determine your chances to be a sniper. Guess there is no harm asking your BMT PC.<br><br>Best bet is to perform well enough to qualify for SISPEC first. During SISPEC you can indicate your interest to your PC. Must be PES A or B with high security clearance (guess that's beyond your control) Topo and range score are important. IPPT is a consideration, but not crucial. Last of all, must "wayang" during interview if you are shortlisted.<br><br>P.s. I'm not sure if snipers are nowadays selected from SISPEC or some advance infanty training course. Hope some SISPEC chaps in the forum can confirm.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To whoever wants to be a sniper.<br><br>1) No glasses.<br>2)Right mastereye. If you're left mastereye, you better shoot right hand. Don't let your trainer tell you which hand to shoot from. Remember, Masterhand decides which style you adopt, not the master eye.<br>3)Right handed (sorry, left hander, forget it. You will never come across a left handed bolt-action rifle in SAF.)<br>4)PES A<br>5)Score in any given IQ test before NS registration. You will need good memory and a wierd sense of your surrounding. And be an opportunist.<br>6)Behave like an outcast if you are posted to CDO. It helps.<br>7)Score FUCKING WELL in your ATP ( I heard you don't have that anymore)<br><br>To fully enjoy your Basic Sniper Course, you must learn how to sew, master stereo vision, gain weight(light people NEVER shoot too well), protect your feet, learn to enjoy long hours of pain and boredom, and love your weapon. Really love your weapon, because after you grad from there you may never see your weapon again. Oh and love the smell of the case of 7.62x51mm/ .308win.<br><br>Sad to say range only takes up a tiny portion of the training. It's not a marksmanship training camp, if you are more attacted to the latter, join the SAF shooting contingent. The truth is a sniper does not need excellent marksmanship, the weapon takes care of that. A sniper need sto be good in mathematics as well as have a good gut feel of how things are going to develope in the next 4 or 5 seconds. It's a hunter they want, not a sportsman. To help you through the training, it's important to look forward to the objective of your individual exercises and concentrate on that instead of the bugs. Don't listen to your campmate sprout nonsense about how they make you stay in a hole and not move and let insects bite you. You stay in a hole, you can move, and insect repellant is applenty.<br><br>OK, I think i've said too much. Enjoy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok, what i have learnt during my visit to SIW (school infrantry weapons)<br><br>*a marksmen does not necessary = to sniper<br>*you work in pairs<br>*you carry your field pack, sniper rifle and an m16<br>*no one knows how to use your sniper rifle except you and your buddy &gt; you have adjusted it your self, and this rifle is 100% yours for 2 years<br>*must be fit enough to withstand the recoil from the snip rifle &gt;&gt; A Sgt. @ SIW told me that snipes have strong shoulder bones through all these shots<br>*if your buddy is down during field camp training you will need to carry him, your field back with rations and his, your gun, his gun, 2 m16s. Imagine the weight. so you must be fit<br>*Snips are not as easy to be spotted @ all from far &gt; they have a net, then they need to tie strips of camo cloth into the holes and fill all of them. It will take 2 weeks to do a nice one.<br>*it's 100% impossible to hold a rifle with 1 arm like rambo<br></div>
