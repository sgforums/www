            <div class='col-md body'>[from http://www.talkingcock.com/html/article.php?sid=1730 ]<br><br>The 4 boys who were lost over the weekend in the MacRitchie Water Catchment zone have been found. The heroes of the low-key saga were, ironically, 4 illegal immigrants who were finally engaged to look for the boys as they were familiar with the area having had their hideout there before.<br><br>The 4 boys, Habis bin Mati, 10; Boh Gia Map, 11; See Swar Chow, 9 and Sarjit Yilang, 12, were all members of the local Scout Troop form City Dwellers Primary School.<br><br>They were part of a larger group out on a private trip to camp in the Catchment Zone over the weekend when they followed the wrong trail and got lost. Upon realization that they were lost, the teacher-in-charge of the troop, Mr Bu Hui Suan, 29, called the police and their parents. 600 commandos from the 2nd Commando Battalion were immediately mobilized and sent to search the area for the boys assisted by the Dog Unit from the Police.<br><br>Â“Very suay lah,Â” said Pte Hor Lan King. Â“We were just all going to book out for long weekend on Friday when nao hiah, these kids had to go missing and they activated us.Â”<br><br>Â“Yah lor,Â” interjected Cpl Wah Kwah Boh. Â“Lucky the occifer in charge recognized that we were all in a dangerous mood and issued us with live rounds to simulate hunting illegal boat people in Vietnam. If anything we just say they stray into live firing area.Â”<br><br>Â“Sum more the SAF issued maps damned condemn one,Â” said LCP Lan Cheow Pheng. Â“They never show where the nearest ice-milo stall and air-con place is. We all nearly died-ed from the heat. Lucky some of us got KTV girlfriends from Malaysia who got their boyfriends back home to lend us their maps they used during their NS. Damn power one, their maps, where we always go for company halt-and-laager they also got mark with red circles and dunno why they put there Â‘ARTY BMBDMNTÂ’. None of us Â– even the air-level ones Â– can make it out.Â”<br><br>The rescuers spread out in an extended line and combed the area, which included the local golf course, causing some amount of consternation amongst the weekend golfers.<br><br>Â“Scare me only,Â” said Ms Chin Choon Kah, 20. Â“I thought what are these peepur doing. Nearly thought our northern neighbours had invaded us.Â”<br><br>Not all were that forgiving, however.<br><br>Â“They made me slice terribly when they came crashing out of the bushes like elephants! What kind of commandos are they? They didnÂ’t even shout Â‘foreÂ’,Â” exclaimed Mr Kheng Ang Moh, 31, in a forced accent. Â“To hell with them and let those kids eat cake! I need my golf; the gahmen should do something about this!Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>continue........<br><br>Despite walking the grounds several times, the rescuers failed to find the missing children till the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) brought in the 4 illegal immigrants they apprehended a few days ago in the same area.<br><br>Â“They all very powderful one. They know all the routes. If we hadnÂ’t appealed to their baser instincts by luring them out with those xiaolongnuÂ’s we would never have had caught them,Â” said Sgt Mo Tao Nao from ICA. Â“Anyways, they tok kong one. They said they needed to perform some magic rites to appease the forest gods and for that they asked for food, clothes, money and their passports. They chanted a bit before they plunged into the forest and they actually found them when 600 men couldnÂ’t!Â”<br><br>When asked what incantations they chanted, SGT Mo said he didnÂ’t understand Burmese but said it sounded like: Â“Hehehaha, whattamoronsanddemidiots.Â”<br><br>According to the boys, the Â‘kind unclesÂ’ found them sitting on a rock within searched ground about 500m behind the rescuers extended line.<br><br>Â“They gave us some food and water and told us to head in that direction to reach the main staging area after which they apparently slipped past the rescuers ahead and disappeared,Â” said Sarjit Yilang. Â“We were actually trying to attract the attention of the commandos earlier but those closest seemed to appease their girlfriends over the handphones judging by the looks on their faces.Â”<br><br>Â“Told you those guys were good,Â” said SGT Mo at the press conference. Â“Only thing now is we need to find them again so we can charge them for their offences. If we canÂ’t find them, weÂ’re going to arrest those boys for aiding and abetting illegals in escaping. Too many prisoners have been escaping recently; we gotta charge someone to keep up the publicÂ’s faith in us.Â”</div>
