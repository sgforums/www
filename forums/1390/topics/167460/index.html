            <div class='col-md body'>Seen it happen too many times already.....<br><br>Girl cheats on bf who's in the army, girl dumps bf on the excuse that he doesn't have time for her, girl who whines and moans that she hates NS because it separates her from her guy....<br><br>Seriously, I get extremely pissed whenever I see this sort of things happening. Shows an extreme lack of maturity on their part. Some may say that they only wish to be happy, but to me those girls are just being self-centred. They only care for their happiness and not for their boyfriends' feelings.<br><br>I'm quite heartened to see that artistic isn't one of those girls. Let's all hope that it stays that way.</div>
