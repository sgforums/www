            <div class='col-md body'>I don't see the big problem camps have with issuing labels for personnel to drive in.<br><br>Usually these personnel are perm-staff at HQ or doing admin work. Needless to say, for combat personnel, driving in is almost a waste because the car just sits there from mon-fri. But for admin staff, they normally get to book out every day. So driving is definitely much more convenient.<br><br>I find that camps that refuse to issue parking labels to NSFs who drive, usually claim "security issues" as the main reason, which of course, to me is nonsense. That's the whole point of the label - to issue one to an unit personnel so they can identify who's who.<br><br>I find that the underlying reason is that these units/camps are too "kilat", and it's no surprise that the CO or S3 usually have inferiority complex. If they are driving a Toyota Altis, they can't stand it when an NSF comes in in a BMW, Lexus, or modified Lancer. It's all a question of face.<br><br>My ex unit was a "kilat" unit for the wrong reasons. Every rule they had was ridiculous. Driving in was one of them. Apparently the S3 had problems with NSFs driving in and wouldn't issue extra labels. Well, we were mostly returning from disruption and drove nonetheless. Thank god our S1 was a reasonable man and even though he knew we drove in, never made noise.<br><br>My friend always parked his Lexus next to the CSM's car. Not that he wanted to spite the CSM's hyundai, but the first day he drove in, the CSM made a sarcastic comment about how "NSFs cars are bigger than us regulars". My friend didn't like the comment very much.<br><br>Well, like i said, my unit didn't issue labels. But my S1 didn't have a problem. Neither did the RPs give a damn. By the time anyone really gave a damn, we had already ord.<br><br>Damn this post is long. But i really get worked up over silly SAF policies.</div>

It's all a question of face.<br><br>My ex unit was a "kilat" unit for the wrong reasons. Every rule they had was ridiculous. Driving in was one of them. Apparently the S3 had problems with NSFs driving in and wouldn't issue extra labels. Well, we were mostly returning from disruption and drove nonetheless. Thank god our S1 was a reasonable man and even though he knew we drove in, never made noise.<br><br>My friend always parked his Lexus next to the CSM's car. Not that he wanted to spite the CSM's hyundai, but the first day he drove in, the CSM made a sarcastic comment about how "NSFs cars are bigger than us regulars". My friend didn't like the comment very much.<br><br>Well, like i said, my unit didn't issue labels. But my S1 didn't have a problem. Neither did the RPs give a damn.
