            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno if this is posted b4 (Couldnt search out this issue).<br><br>Anyway, I am a 28 yr old Combat medic.  Went to 2nd Low key ICT in march (1 week) with my new infantry unit (formerly a school medic in Safti)<br><br>Then recently i recently received a letter from HQ, saying I have been posted out to Med Downgraded/ Excess List managed by NSPC.<br><br>I dunno what happened sia.  I didnt see MO at all during my incamp for any medical issues.<br><br>Being C1L2 I have to take IPPT and i have already booked RT this May.  However , now when I checked my earlier booking, it says I am on holding list/deserter list and something blah blah.  What the heck?<br><br>I checked mindef webby and it did say ppl on NSPC list need not take IPPT.  ANd when I checked with NSPC, they no idea why I got posted to them.<br><br>Directed me to my HQ unit, they oso puzzled.<br><br>In the end directed to call a number, (think my unit) and end up being told by some impatient guy to call back later even without hearing me speak at all.<br><br>Kaoz, what should I do?  Just go with the flow and dun question the decision? (which i am damn happy to do so?) or probe further (cos i am scared of any disciplinary actions against me for msising my RT).  Has anyone encountered this same situation?<br><br>Please advise on what u will do.  Please no flaming.</div>

During ICT they conduct another round of IPPT that is excluding your annual IPPT. At least that was my reservist.  So annually u can get 2 money reward.</div>
