              <p>Male children who take up permanent residency status through their permanent resident parent's sponsorship will be required to serve National Service like other Singaporean males (2nd Gen). However, foreigners who take up jobs in Singapore or become permanent residents of Singapore will not be required to serve National Service. (1st Gen)<br><br>PR status will be void and and forfeited.<br><br>2) If u do NS, there will be some sort of a "SG citizenship priority form" from the unit chief clerk whereby u r given better standing for SG citizen. (like the same for advanced standing for university entry.)</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Male children who are granted Singapore Permanent Resident (SPR) status under their parents' sponsorship are liable for national service (NS) upon reaching 16½ years old. NS-liable SPRs are expected to serve NS.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Renouncing SPR status without serving or completing NS may adversely impact future applications to work or study in Singapore.<br><br></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">After cancellation of SPR status, a Short Visit Pass valid for a month is usually granted.  Former Singapore Permanent Residents who wish to continue to study or work in Singapore must apply for a student, work or employment pass from the appropriate authority.  As noted above, the decision to renounce permanent residence may have an adverse impact on applications for work or student passes.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">A former SPR may be granted entry to Singapore as an ordinary social visitor upon his / her return to Singapore, subject to Singapore's entry requirements, which include holding a valid passport with at least six months validity, entry visas (if applicable), confirmed return / onward tickets, sufficient funds for the period of stay in Singapore and entry facilities, including visas, to their onward destinations. Decision to admit the traveler is at the discretion of Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority officers at the time of arrival at Singapore checkpoints.</span></strong></p>

              <p>I have sign up for NS after receiving the "Red letter", which
              seriously stated COMPULSORY. I have regretted for signing up after
              knowning that actually I can choose not to, which I was not
              informed at the first place.</p>
              <p>I am choosing to migrate to other country where i can further my
              studies, instead of wasting my 2 yrs in NS. How do I cancel my
              registration now? It's ok even i have to give up my PR.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Please Reply according to the
              topic, dont try to mix up your emotions with the problem issue,
              which i found that many of the people here did. If the topic is too
              sensitive to you, please kindly keep your comments.</span></p>

              <p>And you do not for a moment imagine that it would be an emotive issue for other people ? ..... are you deluded ? .....</p>
              <p>do you know why you pissed other people off, really ? ... <strong>it is NOT that you do not want to serve NS, .... </strong><strong>BUT the fact that you are </strong><strong>STILL looking for ways and means of enjoying the rights and privileges of being a PR and citizen here, without paying the price</strong> ....</p>
              <p><strong>you know what a parasite is ? .... I think you are one .... </strong></p>
              <p>and yes you can .... you can renounce your PR anytime .... please expedite the process as quick as possible, before you get into NS, I don't want my tax dollars to be wasted on your uniform, your allowance, and feeding you during your NS ....</p>
              <p>and let us know again ... so we can wish you good riddance ...</p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>1. PR once forfeited through such means, is unlikely to be reinstated as there is a mark against your record.</p>
              <p>2. No, you may not. If you are a 2nd generation PR, citizenship is a process after completion of NS. Should you choose to leave and forfeit your bond, you may be arrested upon return if you are detected upon arrival, and that pretty much destroys any chance of citizenship.</p>
              <p>If you want to get the citizenship, serve NS. There's no free lunch.</p>
