              <p>Ok fine,  you win. Just let me know when the officer corps
              give you a letter of commendation for your courage and bravery for
              defending their honour. Or justification for them to slack and not
              use critical thinking and use their "me is occifer, therefore me is
              right" attitude.</p>
              <p>My statements are based on what i see on the field, which i
              spend 2 years of my glorious youth, with kids from various
              upbringing and education struggling to cope with the job they do
              not want. i also saw officers who are too dumb to make decisions
              yet rolled their eyes when the platoon sergeant or section
              commanders try to help him to make it. I saw my PC insisting on a
              frontal assault in spite of the comments of my PS, that the
              situation has changed and he could not follow as per planned
              before. The result is 75% casualty for my platoon.. And we havent
              even breached the wire. Not bad considering its TES and i get to
              lie down and rest instead of doing leap and bounds. I hear
              grumblings of soldiers when the leadership makes mistakes, and
              waste their time and energy doing things twice or thrice. Yet the
              same people entrusted with this leadership do not have the moral
              courage to even apologise for their errors.</p>
              <p>Oops, sorry my words means nothing to you cause you lead a desk
              of pencils and pens. Yeah, you guess it, i have a chip on my
              shoulder. And it wont get any smaller considering the same idiot PC
              is still my PC in reservist.</p>
              <p>Nah, the real tragedy is why the military decision makers didnt
              make you an officer, you obvious have all the data you need to
              decide who is best and who is not.</p>
              <p>Not hijacking the thread anymore, its an RSAF thread for god
              sake.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your lengthy insight into your experience with a bad occifer.</p>
              <p>Please refer to this posted before. Same Shit.: And make no mistake, there are many officers, both regulars and
                                      NSF. Few are educated (by my standards). I don't even feel majority
                                      of them exhibit good leadership skills, but it just sucks balls
                                      that these shitty officers are often the same majority in the
                                      officer corp who aren't educated.</p>
