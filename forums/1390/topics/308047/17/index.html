              <p>That's actually not entirely true, at least in the case for my batch.</p>
              <p>In my batch, the 'holding wing' was Echo Wing. Sierra Wing is a support arms/female wing. There are quite a number of NSFs who got transferred from Sierra to Air/Mids Wing after the first 2 weeks (CLM).</p>
              <p>Not too sure about now though.</p>

              <p>In any case, all the best in his career as a Signals officer. Signals officer or WSO(C3), both are just officers of the SAF and they will have to do their relevant roles in the defense of this little island.</p>

For pilots who want to go to a private university here like unisim or go overseas university, would they have to pay the full fees themselves or would rsaf sponsor a bit? Cos last time I thought I heard someone say that they will sponsor u the amt that the corresponding course in NUS or NTU costs. Is this true? And also I suppose if u take a study leave here u wont be getting any pay at all right? </p></div>

But, what happens on the ground can be another total issue. The worse is failling to understand feelings on the ground. Talk is cheap, the officer can say all he wants.

              <p>I'm glad you never went to OCS. Did I accuse you of wanting to go there? Like I said once before, and unfortunately I'm forced to repeat, I called you out on your claims of education, leadership and the armed forces. I never disputed or claimed you badly wanted to go to OCS, so why keep assuring me you never did? What a waste of my time. I called you out on your claims of leadership and education, if you have never been to leadership school, let alone experience, ok that's asking for too much, let alone saw the process by which the organisation moulds the people it deems it leaders, you are not qualified to talk about this process. Thats what I called you out on. An analogy: If you didn't go to medical school, talking all day long and making judgments about the best surgeons is making only one person look silly and it's not anyone you talk about. It's you.</p>
              <p>And make no mistake, there are many officers, both regulars and NSF. Few are educated (by my standards). I don't even feel majority of them exhibit good leadership skills, but it just sucks balls that these shitty officers are often the same majority in the officer corp who aren't educated.</p>
              <p>On your next point, I know the presence of many fit CSM or RSM or what have you, be they hokkien peng or not. I also know of OC and CO who run marathons across deserts, across the island, never fail to get IPPT gold and year on year turn out SOC timings that make any hokkien peng CPL weep. What I said to you earlier stands. You were just too thick to understand. What you haven't got to see, does not mean it doesn't exist. To the people who have seen and know better, once again you just look stupid.</p>
              <p>Your final quote though was what made me LOL, truly brightened up my night. It's amazing how much in denial anyone can be. You said: "But you talk machiam you Sword Of Honor
                                  winner. Or some big time "champion"</p>
              <p>I have never once boasted about my military prowess. It's people like YOU, who have not produced anything to claim that you have attained any remote benchmarks of leadership who yak all day long about leaders who require the remark that came from your own mouth above. Look into the mirror tonight and tell yourself your own line: "you talk machiam you Sword Of Honor
                                  winner. Or some big time "champion". Yes, the line you spouted out of your mouth was really customised for you. How ironic.</p>
              <p>Leaders you don't know and have never
                                  met, but for the unfortunate fact that they have lots of other things
                                  you don't have like brains and qualifications, that incurred your sour graped wrath.</p>
              <p>That was the whole crux of the tragedy. And what I called you out for.</p>

              <p>"Did gloaterback pass judgment on what he cannot be?"<br> <br> Am I safe to say that the critical answer would be a YES?<br> <br> But still, I wonder what did you actually did or is still doing for
              you to make that brave claim "If you never had the room of the
              view, you just sound stupid talking out of your arse about the
              scenery". Chances are, you are probably in the same
              situation.<br> <br> My lowly rank made me know that our scholarly officers can plan
              untill perfect. But, what happens on the ground can be another
              total issue. The worse is failling to understand feelings on the
              ground. Talk is cheap, the officer can say all he wants. But
              getting the respect is another thing. I too had my fair share of
              planning stuff and getting my hands dirty at the same time.<br> <br> I would agree that our paper generals has all the brains they have
              to succeed. However, that is not just enough. They would still need
              the skills and diplomacy to balance men's morale and command
              respect.<br> <br> With that, nothing will hold water here if my answer to your
              question is wrong.</p>

                  You are up there with the Ng Family.</p>
              <p>Still, I am surprised by how you glorify yourself through

              <p>As for my comments about people from poly, I guess it's the

              <p>Please pardon me. After all, I am not from a scholarly genetic
                  lineage. Too bad that I happen to be the first in my family to be
                  in JC. You may like to ask why I am insulting my own family members
                  from poly. What I said is what they told me. So if you think that
                  you, a jc 'air-level' kia, know better about poly people compared
                  to poly grads themselves, so be it.</p>
              <p>The world will hand down the ultimate judgement on your place in
                  society. It's not for a farmer-to-be like me to do so.</p>

              <p>You are the first person in your family to go to JC and you made those remarks about poly students? I haven't seen this thread since the last conversation until tonight. Amazing! You're really suited to be a farmer-to-be!</p>

              <p>Ok fine,  you win. Just let me know when the officer corps give you a letter of commendation for your courage and bravery for defending their honour. Or justification for them to slack and not use critical thinking and use their "me is occifer, therefore me is right" attitude.</p>
              <p>My statements are based on what i see on the field, which i spend 2 years of my glorious youth, with kids from various upbringing and education struggling to cope with the job they do not want. i also saw officers who are too dumb to make decisions yet rolled their eyes when the platoon sergeant or section commanders try to help him to make it. I saw my PC insisting on a frontal assault in spite of the comments of my PS, that the situation has changed and he could not follow as per planned before. The result is 75% casualty for my platoon.. And we havent even breached the wire. Not bad considering its TES and i get to lie down and rest instead of doing leap and bounds. I hear grumblings of soldiers when the leadership makes mistakes, and waste their time and energy doing things twice or thrice. Yet the same people entrusted with this leadership do not have the moral courage to even apologise for their errors.</p>
              <p>Oops, sorry my words means nothing to you cause you lead a desk of pencils and pens. Yeah, you guess it, i have a chip on my shoulder. And it wont get any smaller considering the same idiot PC is still my PC in reservist.</p>

              <p>Nah, the real tragedy is why the military decision makers didnt make you an officer, you obvious have all the data you need to decide who is best and who is not.</p>
