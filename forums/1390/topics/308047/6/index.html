              <p>it's very important to speak well cause officers need to do paperwork. they also see your background and what you've done to fuel your dreams of becoming a pilot.</p>
              <p>if they ask you a damn funny question, take some time to think and clarify the question if need be.</p>
              <p>sorry man Cdo &amp; Pilot that you didn't get it. At least you can try again. I'm beginning to think whether I really want to sign on. Being a pilot is one thing. but the bond length is quite another. I would love to fly but must also think of my future. How long do I want to fly? Maybe I fly a few times shiok shiok then I realise actually I just wanted the experience only.</p>
              <p>My medical is tmr. If I fail then I think case close. Out of 6000 they are left with 120 after medical so the attrition rate is damn killer.</p>

              <p>hey mephiston, when did u had ur interview? if u r taking ur medical this week then i assume you had ur interview last week? dun worry too much abt aeromedical la. if you are a normal person with any abnormalities and i wud say u got a 60-70% chance to make it! juz go for it la since u r almost there! dun hesitate now coz not every1 can b a pilot, u shud grab this opportunity given to you. ur statistics of 120 out of 6000 people getting through are based on which yr to which?</p>

              <p>ya. the moment you flunk any part of the entire battery of tests you don't need to continue already. the last part will be the consultation with the doctor where you will go through your entire medical history. if you don't make on criteria you can go home.</p>

              <p>hey Cdo &amp; Pilot, i think we might have some things in common.. I'm currently serving my NS as a commando officer, and i applied for the pilot position too.. i passed the compass, interview and medical tests, left with a heart scan in april ( doctor heard some suspected heart murmurs, but was assured it was most probably nothing) the whole thing is going wayyyy too slow! haha.. from what i heard, cdos &amp; ndu divers have to go through their entire training phase or until 6 months before their ORD, before they can cross over for the pilot training, airgrading whatsoever.</p>
              <p>anyway just wanted to tell you that if you do indeed get posted to the commandos, it's not impossible to be selected for OCS, but it would not be an easy feat. just be sincere and do what is needed when things have to be done.  good luck!</p>

              <p>hey flabtabulous, you muz b a veri garang fellow to b a commando officer! my case abit diff frm you coz i juz fail my interview not long ago and i have not enlisted yet. some more the RO told mi to make it into OCS in order to have any chances of going for a 2nd interview.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but i personally feel that if you become a commando officer then muz well juz sign on coz i heard that commando officers get promoted veri quickly so you may wana consider signing on. but i assume you are oso veri interested in flying. anyway how old are you now? you graduated from poly or jc?</p>

              <p>hey guys, i din visit this forum for a long time so i didn't see the questions.</p>
              <p>1. fep is flying experience programme and it a temp vocation for abt 3mths for recruits who signed up for the pilot and wso(ftr).</p>
              <p>2. basically, there are abt 23 in the jan BMT intake who are in fep now, and we are either posted to AFRC or mindef hq at gombak camp to do admin work(sai kang).</p>
              <p>3. the airforce people will arrange for us to go for like airforce museum trips, air base trips, joyrides at yfc etc. (some are kinda lame)</p>
              <p>4. during this 3mths, the trainees will go for their compass, med and interview and for people like me who passed compass and waiting for med results and for interview, its a total waste of time. chiong so hard in bmt to qualify for ocs and they post me to do admin work..pes A clerk sia...</p>
              <p>5. the only good thing is that this vocation is a 8-5 job.. AHAHHAHA.</p>

              <p>well i just try to do my best.. haha.. i was from a jc, from the 1988 dragon babies.. hmmm contary to what many people think, commando regulars actually have a harder life than regulars of other vocations. this is because the commando formation is only so small, the number appointments available are very limited.. so chances are you may "henta-taki" if the time isnt right..</p>
              <p>haha yeah i'm attracted to the pilot position both by the career and chance to fly..</p>
              <p>any pilots here that can share their experience?</p>
