              <p>precisely my point, i was referring to those who signed on straight after their As or diploma..</p>
              <p>they need a operational cat of minimum B before they can go back out to further their studies. and the pilot trainee years is quite long also especially for fighter pilots.</p>

              <p>hello guys...</p>
              <p>ive read through the entire 22pages of this thread but i dont think i found the answer to my question, so hopefully some kind souls would be able to answer to some questions of mine. </p>
              <p>my boyfriend took his compass test early in 2008. he passed the c3 component, and the airforce recruitment centre told him that he would be granted an interview if he makes it to OCS after his BMT training. thankfully, he made it to OCS... but he has yet to hear news of his interview date. may i know how long should he wait before he should start to voice his concern to his PC? currently it's still his first week in OCS...</p>
              <p>ps: he's applying for WSO C3 officer vocation.  </p>
              <p>i called the AFRC on his behalf and they told me that they can't confirm the date but they told me that he will be going for the interview... can their words be trusted?</p>
              <p>sorry if i appear ignorant, i just wish to know how they operate so that i can understand better and help to communicate the situation to my boyfriend.</p>
              <p>thank you guys! *bows*</p>

              <p>oh and is it common for all cadet officers to be posted to OCS army wing (as stated in the posting) ?  does that mean even if you are pending for interview with the navy or airforce they will still state in the posting details that you are under ocs army wing ?  is this for CLT reasons?</p>

              <p>so waiting up to 2-3 weeks is normal? but ive read that if you dont hear news of your interview within the CLT period, you're most likely gonna be stuck in the army wing for the rest of your term in OCS. is that true? and no, my boyfriend is no scholar, just a poly grad like myself.</p>

              <p>Ok, for a WSO(C3), you need to go into OCS.</p>
              <p>It works slightly differently though. If you are a scholar or from a scholar batch (e.g. me but I am not scholar), you can indicate interest to sign in the 1st 2 weeks of OCS (a common term between all 3 services). For me, I was one of those who were sort of fast-tracked because of my results.</p>
              <p>However, if they still have not conducted the interview, I am afraid he will wait till his Army service term finishing before they take him out. In OCS, there are a few stages: 2 weeks Common Leadership Module (CLM) when cadets of all 3 services are in army wings, Service Term (11 weeks for army, 7 weeks for air force), Professional Term (26 weeks for air force, 22 weeks for army) and the last 3 weeks where all cadets come together to practice for comms parade.</p>
              <p>I quote what the officer that did my recruitment said, "You can only be taken out at 3 points: in the first 2 weeks, after service term or after commissioning since it makes no sense to last till pro term and still don't go for comms parade."</p>
              <p>In this case, it is very likely your boyfriend will be taken out earliest at the end of his first 2 weeks or he will have to go through the 11 week army service term. If AFRC is unable to do it, please make sure he commissions first before going over to air force. Either way, he will either hold at AFRC itself in CMPB or hold at Air Force School.</p>
              <p>One important, please do follow up closely because the WSO recruitment officer is going back to his squadron. The transition might mean that some applications will get lagged behind especially when the WSO recruitment people are busy now with recruiting potential SAFOSes.</p>
              <p>Since it's his first week in OCS, he still has time to go over. There should have been a recruitment session in OCS in the first week and he should have reminded the CPT about his application. Either way, don't worry. They will get you somehow if you have passed the compass test.</p>
              <p>I am speaking from experience because I went over to air wing after first 2 weeks without passing either the compass test or going through the interview. Then again, as I said, it's because the officers were pretty partial to my results that they granted me quite a number of waivers.</p>

              <p>he told me that there was a recruitment drive for air force going on yesterday. a few of them went to take the compass test and 3 were selected for interview today. 2 made it out of 3. so does that mean his chances of going over to air wing after this 2 weeks is gone? and that he has to go through the 11 weeks of army service term before he can cross over to air force again?</p>
              <p>he has told his PC about it yesterday night, PC told him "just wait for them to call you lor."</p>
              <p>huh?</p>
              <p>i hope you guys understand what im talking about, because im not very familiar with the army terms and SOPs.</p>
              <p>how should he go about keeping track of his interview dates? keep calling AFRC? or tell his superiors (PC, CPT or whatever you guys call it =x) to help him keep track? if he's so busy all the time in OCS how can he find the time to call?</p>
              <p>one more question, what if after the army service term of 11 weeks the AFRC still hasn't called him? then he has to wait after commissioning?</p>

              <p>Call AFRC and look for CPT Desmond to talk to. No point asking his PC as they are in the army wings and probably will give close to zilch concerns to such matters.</p>
