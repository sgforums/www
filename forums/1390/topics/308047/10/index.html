              <p>the only thing that sets apart a military pilot and a civilian pilot is the type of flying u get exposed to and u can only get that in a military organisation. we're just talking bout the flying bit here.</p>
              <p>airliners just go from point to point, the transit process is just pretty mundane. military flying is much more hectic, with demands for mission planning and execution and the dynamism of each flight in a jet. u won't be able to get it elsewhere.</p>
              <p>i would go as far as to say once u've had your fair share of fun flying in a jet, you probably had enough and u'd be happy to cross over to the airlines to earn the $$ once ur time is served knowing u had that sort of experience.  by than u'd prob be in yr mid 30s and u want a more 'relaxed' sorta lifestyle right. but at least u can say u been there done that. if u regret ur decision then tough. if u thoroughly enjoyed it, then good for u.</p>
              <p>no doubt the job comes with alot of added baggages in terms of stupid work chores. but not everybody can make it into the cockpit of a jet. thats some achievement u can keep in yr pocket.</p>
              <p>its safe to say that some commercial pilots were once military pilots. but not necessary commercial pilots can become military pilots.</p>
              <p>seriously again think carefully.</p>

              <p>anyway, for commercialisation- they are only commercialising the
                  not so critical stuff right? like training and some maintenence and
                  the less sensitive operations. <strong>i think the fighter side is not

              <p>no ar, the acc command can set a lower tasking requirement to be
                  met if they want to. F16's also usually never meet their tasking
                  one..</p>
              <p>isn;t nsfs even cheaper labour then those uncles from
                  ST?hahaha..</p>
              <p>yeah i see the techs work so hard and long hours, its not
                  justified for the pay that they're getting and the food they're

              <p>Its not just savings in terms of pay. Hiring uncles means transfering of staff liability to the contractor. RSAF won't have to be bothered with their insurance, safety, medical coverage etc.</p>
              <p>But isn't it true that "ah gong" wants to encourage more techs to move over to ST once their contract expires?</p>

              <p>Once anyone has been with any organisation for an extended amount of time and can't choose to leave, its very hard for them to not get disgruntled. A lot of the lao jiaos in the force grumble day in and out (you can't begin to imagine how whiny some pilots can get! haha), but i understand where they come from. Its just time for them to leave. if you really have the passion, go for it, but after you have weighed the pros and cons. And weigh them by your own standards and beliefs, don't compare them to someone else's. At the end of the day, it is your life afterall and what you want to do with it.</p>

              <p>Hey one and all,</p>
              <p>need some career advice here.</p>
              <p>Im 20 this year currently serving ns in cdo for 1.5 yrs now. I sat for both pilot and wso ftr test earlier this year and only wso ftr got back to me. Im up for interview soon and was wondering if everything goes well, will the contract of 10 years for wso ftr be worthwhile.</p>
              <p>I have secured a place in NUS and was wondering if i make it to wso ftr, will they sponsor or subsidise my studies? If so, how will the route be? Am i able to take my degree first or only after some basic training first?</p>
              <p>Any idea how much is the pay scheme for trainee WSO ftr like? And any idea what if i fail air grading or something? Is it worthwhile signing on to a military life although i have secured a uni placement?</p>
              <p>Yes, i do enjoy military life. But in terms of career-wise, what are ur opinions on these?</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hello Guys, I have a question to ask and I'll explain my scenerio.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I applied for pilot vocation before my BMT, took my COMPASS test before BMT and only got my medical appointment along with others who applied for pilot during BMT. That sucks, because some of them took their compass only a few days before and they got a medical appointment on the same day as me when i took my compass months ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, our medical appointment is only 1 week before our posting results. Most of us got posted to SISPEC. Does that mean we have already failed to qualify to become pilots? My other friend from YFC said once the medical results are out and if we passed the interview and medical, we will be pulled out from sispec. How true is it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do not want to spend my time waiting in anxiety about the process and outcome of our application, so I hope somebody can shed some light about our chances now.</p>

              <p>I have a question.. I heard that only those with perfect eyesight will be allowed to fly the F16, and that if you are shortsighted you will only be allowed tofly the choppers or transport aircrafts eventually though they will take u in for pilot training, even with lasik. Can anyone confirm this? From what I heard its some kind of unwritten rule that noone mentions but happens?</p>

              <p>They call u using their hotline no: 62701010.</p>
              <p>U can call em back using the toll free no: 1800 2701010. Actually its the same as above other than the 1800. lol. I'm not very sure whether both are toll free, but for cheapskate reasons i use the 1800 no. when calling them.</p>
              <p>And how sure are u that u are going ndu? They called u down for interview alr? Cos if thats so and u showed interest, then good luck. U will be stuck in there for 9 bloody months taking shit and hell, while the rest of us tekong boys will be going over after 3 months. If u really wanted to be pilot, shoulda turned down commandos and ndu if they ever ask u.</p>

              <p>Dont think of joining SIA so easily, or by using rsaf as a stepping stone. Its many many many years of ur life u have to give to the air force before your contract even expires, so I think that if u go in thinking abt SIA half the time, might as well not join rsaf right? Just go join SIA straight once u reach 26.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if u wanna be a pilot next time, no difference as to whether u poly or jc. However, a university degree is almost always a requirement for SIA. For the air force, they do take in people with just a plain poly diploma or A Level cert, but then do take note that u will forever be one of the people down at the bottom of the chain if u go in without a degree. Dont make urself so disadvantaged. </p>
              <p>Let me just give u advice from a JC point of view. If u like to study, or have no idea what kind of course u want to do in poly (like me), then choose JC. But remember that the JC route is much more academic-intensive. If u are the type who cannot study one, then die die also dont come jc. Go poly instead. Poly route spans 3 yrs, but overall if ur goal is to go university, then both routes would result in the same number of years studied. So doesnt matter either way. Go the route that suits u most that can allow u to go university.</p>
              <p>However, if u dont fall into the study person type, or even the type who can survive well in poly, then my advice is to just go poly. Cos the fact of life is that a poly grad will always earn more than an A Level grad without degree. The poly grad would be armed with skills that can get him a better pay grade. Hope this helps.</p>
