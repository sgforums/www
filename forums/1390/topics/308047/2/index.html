              <p>you want to know what passion is?</p>
              <p>quitting your high paying job, getting a miserly pay just enough to survive but feeling happy about it.</p>
              <p>loving to fly an aircraft is passion, understood. </p>
              <p>now let's see, you love flying. you sign on but you spend your days planning things, doings WITS projects, clocking USMS, doing ground runs, doing air checks, doing duty. you barely make it for your monthly flying hours... and you try to push for more flying because if u don't hit those hours, you have no extra money.</p>
              <p>then you have to clock currency, you have to go for course, you sit in the stupid hot and cramped cockpit with the lousy cushions, you fly the same old circuit everyday. you fly the same circuit so that u can clock flying hours.</p>
              <p>you love to fly, but damn its CAT1. you look at the sky, doesn't look like its CAT1, so you can't fly.</p>
              <p>your boss arrows u to do a job, you kena scolded by boss, your friend asks u to take over duty.</p>
              <p>the weather is so hot, you're arrowed to do a ground run. you have to start the aircraft for 15mins and there's no air conditioning, what's more you don't clock flying hours.</p>
              <p>now, please don't tell me its a passion just because you're from SYFC and you love to play military games and you like to go to the bloody airshow to see f-16s break the sound barrier.</p>
              <p>its a joke to see all this online when i can see the real thing at my workplace.</p>
              <p>all come out, black face, finish flying, tired... all looking forward to finishing their bond and going to SIA.</p>

              <p>haha...never log in for 2 days nia den got so many comments
              liao. wah is the SAF so scary like u all described anot? seriously
              wat i'm worried abt signing on wif SAF is that after u completed ur
              bond and they dun wana renew ur contract den how ah? somemore i
              diploma only, very hard to find job leh. u all tok abt SIA but you
              all know how hard to get inside SIA as a pilot anot? its like as
              hard or even harder than RSAF lor. But i guess everything comes wif
              a price and sacrifices to make, so juz take one step at a time
              lor.</p>

              <p>fully agree.</p>
              <p>neither rsaf nor any saf service is the place for a person if they so desire to achieve big bucks. if you want to earn good money and enjoy the flying, commercial is the way to go.</p>
              <p>i think only passion for your job and military flying can keep someone going once they are fully in service and under bond. no doubt the organisation is far from ideal but then again even the biggest armed forces around the world are having the same issues as us.</p>
              <p>at least we don't have to send people into combat for a protracted period of time unlike some western countries. i've got some friends who've been to iraq twice or more in certain western airforces and they've been complaining about the hardship and all. at least in singapore no such stuff. but yah nobody put a gun at you and force u to sign the contract, so think carefully before you sign cos you will have to accept all the good and bad that the job brings to you.  no point complaining bout the job everyday, makes life more miserable.</p>

              <p>regular.</p>
              <p>most of the time pilot without degree = highest rank, captain. with the occasional exception going to major, which is quite rare. </p>
              <p>but don't worry, you'll be a lieutenant for the longest time too, you'll get your CPT and u won't feel the difference.</p>
              <p>RSAF will not send u for degree courses, unless you apply for it and u leave work to study full-time. but after you finish studying, you're bonded to SAF for more years. so good luck if you want to leave early.</p>
              <p>another option is that u take it urself, but you will be working shifts. so you tell me how are you gonna take a part-time degree?</p>
              <p>it is the military, people use rank. so you tell me, if you're gonna be a LTA or a CPT vs the old pilots + scholars who are MAJ, LTC. you tell me who is gonna be there to do the stuff they don't want to do?</p>
