              <p>my bad. there is a non-controlling position within the tower

              basically there to oversee the entire operations and lend a helping
              hand in an event of an emergency, where there is a lot of

              <p>no need to worry too much into the working process. if you are

              <p>ALS, which is assume kopiosatu is from, you still have a WOIC

              consist of officers and specialists, it is a slightly different

              <p>then again, if you are in the system, you will know how it
              works. these are the small details which should not be a

              <p>most of the time pilot without degree = highest rank, captain. with the occasional exception going to major, which is quite rare. </p>
              <p>but don't worry, you'll be a lieutenant for the longest time too, you'll get your CPT and u won't feel the difference.</p>
              <p>RSAF will not send u for degree courses, unless you apply for it and u leave work to study full-time. but after you finish studying, you're bonded to SAF for more years. so good luck if you want to leave early.</p>
              <p>another option is that u take it urself, but you will be working shifts. so you tell me how are you gonna take a part-time degree?</p>
              <p>it is the military, people use rank. so you tell me, if you're gonna be a LTA or a CPT vs the old pilots + scholars who are MAJ, LTC. you tell me who is gonna be there to do the stuff they don't want to do?</p>

              <p>clarification.</p>
              <p>if you have a degree, it does not jump you straight to captain. it really depends on whether you are on scholarship, study award, or just someone who apply as an officer with a degree.</p>
              <p>if you are an officer with a degree, not payable by SAF, you will skip the 2LT phase, which means you will commission as an LTA. the rest of the advancement is the same.</p>
              <p>if you are on LSA, my understanding, dependent on how long you serve the force before you leave for your studies, more often than not, approximately one year from returning, you will be "promoted" to the rank of a captain. note that it is an emplacement rather than a promotion. meaning, your salary range will start on the lower bracket of that of a captain.</p>
              <p>if you are a SAFOS, or SMS scholar, then your route of advancement would be totally different.</p>
              <p>there is 3 scheme of salary within the SAF for the officers, scheme A, scheme B and scheme C. you can ask your recruitment officer about it. generally, scheme A is the pay scheme for diploma holders, scheme B is that of degree holders and study award holders, scheme C are that of scholars, meaning SMS or SAFOS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>del_co, if you are a captain all the way, or worse still, a LTA, your life is pretty much fucked. anyway, in all jobs, you want to go up and up. if you just want to stay stagnant in the force, would you not be better off as an NSF?</p>

Airgrading is basically to test whether u r suitable for flying lor. its not all abt precision flying but also ur attitude and enthusiasm towards flying. we r considered laojiaos in a way that airgrading is also something like what we do in YFC e.g. straight &amp; level,turning,climbing &amp; descending, RT calls etc. I'm trying to find whether there's any ex-trainees who went for the airgrading too...wish mi luck man!<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> </p></div>
