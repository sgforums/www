              <p>ah yes, but u also have to state that they like to punish and pick on the dumbest things.</p>
              <p>jaded servicemen won't help because they screwed up that serviceman from the beginning. i went in, wanting to be in the military... but now it turns out with the 3G wayang, the pay doesn't justify my work.</p>
              <p>ask my colleagues... all of them signed on, wanting to prove themselves... now, everyone is jaded. i have a senior who wanted to conver to be an officer, was siao on. now he totally switches off and in the past you would never hear "air force sux" come out of his mouth. he's even prepared to pay money to break his bond.</p>
              <p>i don't mind pilots coming in. but i think there are not much experienced technicians left... besides, they are starting to commercialise, soon everything will be prepared by ST Aero uncles... got war or any humanitarian effort, ho sey liao</p>

              <p>i hope i dun come across as being pro-organisation.</p>
              <p>i guess being jaded/ disgruntled/ disatisfied applies to whichever job u're working at. the only difference that in the military if u're at the bottom of the chain u don't really have much speaking right. and most of us are probably tied down with some bond or other and thats a pain to serve out.</p>
              <p>but i guess we have to keep telling ourselves why we signed up in the first place and do our job to our best right? even though u hate it, shouldn't go around poisoning others. just serve and then leave and find something better that u're happier with.</p>
              <p>i don't even know myself if i'd be staying after my first contract but juz make the most of it and see what lies ahead when the time comes. maybe one will get condemned, maybe one will do well?</p>
              <p>anyway a military job is never one for us to earn big bucks, much less in singapore. militaries are money spending organisations, not earning money so bonuses are minimal, workload is high cos not many people joinÂ cos' i think the asian thinking of 'good sons don't become soldiers' still holds true.</p>
              <p>a capable person would probably find a better paying job outside. if u're in the forces its either cos' of interest, passion, service to country and lastly the pay. i do agree that the pay is rather low compared to outside job for the amount of work but what to do? i think the best thing is to encourage more ppl to join so that there;s more ppl to spread the workload and then maybe the pay is justified? heh.</p>
              <p>but obviously, the manpower policies i think need to be tweaked.</p>
              <p>good luck to those wanting to join. join for the right reasons please.</p>

              <p>why are they commercialising? why are they saving costs getting NSFs to maintain equipment? its all for cost saving... the day my pay is justified is when i only turn up for work for 3 days, because the amount i get outside for working 3 days is that rate.</p>
              <p>i've been around enough to see how its going down. the military will still be around, but at the rate that its going, its asking for more problems.</p>

              <p>basically SAF screwed themselves when they decided to employ more educated people at the lower bottom of the shit pile.</p>
              <p>the military (generally) has been a service when the "uneducated" or "lowly educated" are given a good pay to work for the country. the smart ones (scholars), will lead the guys and that's how it goes. the lower ones won't complain because the money they get with their current education will not be available in the corporate sector.</p>
              <p>while the more educated ones should be helping the country boost their economy in the commercial sector. the "lower educated" ones won't argue about their pay, or the work... because it is a good paying secure job.</p>
              <p>gone are the days when u just had a technician. now a technician regular is virtually extinct. where are the missing lower rung regulars?</p>
              <p>now they determine that a diploma is the lowest education qualification to accept, that would leave the "uneducated" or "lower educated" with lower job opportunities within the government sector.</p>
              <p>i've got nothing against the "lower educated" because i'm one of them, but it is plain silly to see a SOP military employment policy being changed by the morons above. i don't even wanna get started on the PP scheme</p>

              <p>well i think or i reckon i've been around long enough. maybe not as long as u but i think its a significant amount of time spent already. almost all my good years are gone.</p>
              <p>i tend to agree for a fact that the manpower schemes don't really benefit the ppl. i for one lament the lack of medical coverage..</p>
              <p>cost savings is a measure that not only our armed forces is doing. almost every other nation is doing it. and we're not the only unhappy military personnel in the world. its almost the same in every other country. worst stil those that have to go into combat. this is the feedback i got from my peers working in other countrie's armed forces. same shit different country different currency.</p>
              <p>anyway, for commercialisation- they are only commercialising the not so critical stuff right? like training and some maintenence and the less sensitive operations. i think the fighter side is not going into that area anytime soon.</p>
              <p>sometimes i think i hate the organisation. other times i think its alright. but i just thought i'd give my 2c worth cos too much bashing of the force makes us look stupid and bad. cos if its that bad, why are are we stupid to join in the first place. need to balance the argument a little.</p>
              <p>but again to add. military is not the place if u wanna earn big $$.</p>
              <p>go commercial!Â  better life. job satisfaction i don't know. maybe money can compensate for it. but its individual i guess.</p>

              <p>i'm in the ops side. different perspective from logs i think. so i don't see that much of the commercialisation nor does it really affect me..</p>
              <p>so my view might be different.</p>
              <p>i guess the logs ppl would have more to bitch about.</p>

              <p>the organisation is screwed up, depending on who u ask.</p>
              <p>whether they are high flyer, so-so, or condemned or not doing so well or just simply unhappy.Â everyone will have a point of view. those doing well would encourage, those so-so ones might be 50-50 depending on who u ask. the condemned ones generally will hate the whole organisation for their misery.</p>
              <p>generally,Â admittedly the place is far farÂ far from ideal but if u still wantÂ toÂ follow your ambitionÂ you canÂ decide for yourself later if u made the right choice.</p>
              <p>i mean, no matter how screwed up a place is. if its really what u wanna do, u'd be able to find something good out of all this. because at the end of the day its your own dream and ambitionÂ here, not others. if u just want to fly and make money then go SIA. cos airforce is not the place to be.</p>
              <p>Â but think carefully, once u're in and u pass out from training. they own your ass for 10 years. so even if u regret ur decision then, u got to suck it up....</p>

              <p>the way i see it, as a pilot... what's the point of flying when you don't earn loads of cash? at least with SIA, you literally see the world... u get to fly around to different countries and visit them. who can beat the comfy seats and cabin crew to serve u coffee?</p>
              <p>i personally am more money driven. i for one, do not like the idea of working long hours and i'm not rewarded for it. especially so when the commercial sector has been paying well for God knows how long. the pay increments that they give sporadically doesn't cut it either. evern more so when i am earning my monthly pay in 2-3 days outside. so that explains my general perception to work in life.</p>
              <p>there ARE positives, its up to you to decide if the negatives outweighs the positives. if u want to fly higher as an officer in the airforce, it'll be better if you join with a degree. you don't have to be condemned to hate the organisation, i have high flyers at my unit who also hate the organisation... its just that they professionals and continue to do their job well. that's why i said these guys are a waste to be in the force when they should be flying even higher elsewhere.</p>
              <p>but like cheeze has said, u have think carefully... they are going to hold onto you for 10 years.</p>
