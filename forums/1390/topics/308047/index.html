              <p>I'm recently just graduated from SP. Applied for Pilot and WSO(UAV) positions on 19 Nov 2007. Completed my COMPASS on 14 Dec 2007 and currently waiting for interview. Anyone else applied for this positions too? Looking for buddies here who are applying for it too. Can suffer the long wait together.</p>
              <p>The wait seems to be seriously long.</p>
              <p>Hope to get replies soon. Thanks.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>hey del_co, i know your problem with the RT. I used to have tt problem too at first, freaking hard to multi-task though! Anyway u made the right decision to join air force.i tink SIA is only the last resort if touch wood cannot get into air force. i would rather b a fighter pilot than being a commercial pilot. But tts not to say SIA easy to get in. Its as stringent if not more than air force in their selection process. Your friend damn zai leh. I tink he will confirm b a fighter pilot with regards to his current position in air force. I tink regarding the OCS issue, you must be very garang and chiong sua type during bmt. always show or tell your sergeant or PC that you are freaking interested in being an officer. Plus if i tink they know you are selected for pilot training, maybe will try their their best to recommend you for OCS. Thats the case if you are posted to tekong, its not tt easy to be posted to OCS in cdo unless you are the damn fit and garang type. I guess chances for everyone to get into OCS is higher in tekong than in hendon. Anyway are you bespectacled?? </p></div>

Fighter, rotors or transport...it's a gift to be in the air flying and upholding our independence. It is a passion man! Almost a love...but den its a sensitive issue. I must only maintain the word "love" for one person...my gf. If not....die. haha!</p></div>

              <p>Yes, love for flying, aviation, military aviation..</p>
              <p>No one can understand my love for aviation. Hell, I even got an unofficial record with the police for my passion.</p>
              <p>I was like you once. Damn garang, applied various positions in the airforce. During BMT, I realised how this organisation functions and understand the shit and regimentation and decided this kinda life isn't for me. I gave up my applications and served my 1 year 10 months and F off. How glad that I made that decision.</p>
              <p>You gotta be in the organisation to see and feel yourself the shit and regimentation and ask yourself if this is really what you want.</p>
