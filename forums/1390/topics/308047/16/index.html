              <p>ok he's in sierra wing. at least they are sensible there. delta is not.</p>
              <p>for people that conduct these talks, they are the recruitment officers so they will do both concurrently. be sure to ask your boyfriend to talk to the air force recruitment officer directly (CPT Desmond). usually, the officer will find the cadets to sign the contract around the 2nd week of ocs, at least that was my case.</p>

              <p>oo, next week is the 2nd week of ocs for him. interesting... hehe. i dont know why am i so excited about this, as if im the one thats going for the interview. haha!</p>

              <p>quota? no. educational criteria is really secondary for c3 once you meet the basic requirements (at least a dip) because the compass test and your apitude test results are more important.</p>
              <p>i am serious? hmm didn't seem to detect that. just relating my own experience even though they are not entirely relevant since i am from a levels.</p>

              <p>i noticed you have been taking the advice of the clown above, <strong>teraexa</strong>. I regret to inform you that he is a farmer, who most times is completely ignorant of what he's talking about. He can't tell his arse from his face. Suggest you overwrite everything he's told you so far, with anything else he's not told you-which will be more accurate for sure.</p>
              <p>In a recent conversation with me, he sounded so super cock sure of how much he thought the salary of people that he IS NOT even close to ever being, he said it without even a hint of reservation or humility most people without first hand or second hand knowledge would have. Of cos i know for a fact that he knows shit about what he's talking about and really as it turned out from the shit he spewed, he knew crap. Making hollow presumptions is a very farmer trait. He is really just being himself and easing himself into his oncoming placement.</p>

              <p>Besides crapping about SAFOS pay when he's not a SAFOS, you can see how he made a fool of himself in this thread when he said WSO (fighter) is the one commanding the plane and the pilot is just the 'driver', he was shot down by 3 separate people later so he had no choice but to keep quiet.</p>
              <p>The same thing happened in another thread when he tried to elevate some farmer award= SMS he said he was offered and he attempted to convince us that it was very 'difficult to attain' and 'prestigious' but was shot down and exposed by 3 separate individuals who said that its a farmer award with low criteria.</p>

              <p>They're not commissioned at 23, good grief. They're commissioned at 19 and then flown off overseas to study, they come back at 23. I thought everyoneknows they get their sword early and they disrupt from OCS at 19? Its common knowledge.</p>

              <p>Also in three different posts you equated going through OCS, being commissioned as well as "re-entered service" to CPT, which is wrong. OCS only gets you commissioned. That is only a 2LT rank. In other words, your friend commissioned at 23 is it?</p>

              <p>hello guys...</p>
              <p>ive read through the entire 22pages of this thread but i dont
              think i found the answer to my question, so hopefully some kind
              souls would be able to answer to some questions of
              mine. </p>
              <p>my boyfriend took his compass test early in 2008. he passed the
              c3 component, and the airforce recruitment centre told him
              that he would be granted an interview if he makes it to OCS after
              his BMT training. thankfully, he made it to OCS...
              but he has yet to hear news of his interview date. may i know
              how long should he wait before he should start to voice his concern
              to his PC? currently it's still his first week in OCS...</p>
              <p>ps: he's applying for WSO C3 officer vocation.  </p>
              <p>i called the AFRC on his behalf and they told me that they can't
              confirm the date but they told me that he will be going for the
              interview... can their words be trusted?</p>
              <p>sorry if i appear ignorant, i just wish to know how they operate
              so that i can understand better and help to communicate the
              situation to my boyfriend.</p>
              <p>thank you guys! *bows*</p>

              <p>i noticed you have been taking the advice of the clown above,
                          <strong>teraexa</strong>. I regret to inform you that he is a
                          farmer, who most times is completely ignorant of what he's talking
                          about. He can't tell his arse from his face. Suggest you overwrite
                          everything he's told you so far, with anything else he's not told
                          you-which will be more accurate for sure.</p>
              <p>In a recent conversation with me, he sounded so super cock sure
                          of how much he thought the salary of people that he IS NOT even
                          close to ever being, he said it without even a hint of reservation
                          or humility most people without first hand or second hand knowledge
                          would have. Of cos i know for a fact that he knows shit about what
                          he's talking about and really as it turned out from the shit he
                          spewed, he knew crap. Making hollow presumptions is a very farmer
                          trait. He is really just being himself and easing himself into his
                          oncoming placement.</p>

              <p>Dear Mr Gloater,</p>
              <p>As a trained WSO(C3), I am telling you right in the face that you
                          know nothing, I repeat, nothing about WSO(C3). Don't try to pull your
                          SAFOS WSO(C3) friends into the picture. I know who they are too.</p>
              <p>You speak of me as if I am trying to mislead and misinform butterfries about certain things. I am sure butterfries is smart and intelligent enough to judge for herself about my comments. She has no obligation to take my advice. I am just relating my experiences and seeing if they can be of any help to her bf. Come on, don't tell me that you were one of those who switched from an army wing to air wing in ocs after the first 2 weeks upon signing on? You claimed you never signed on so you definitely didn't go through this part.</p>
              <p>Let this farmer-to-be tell you something. Yes, indeed, I do not have
                          the privilege to be educated in a non-farmer, foreign university like
                          you because my parents do not have the money to send me there. Yes you
                          received "quality education". That's your privilege. Yes, I was offered a farmer SMS but you weren't even offered a scholarship. Yet, unlike you, this farmer-to-be do know the meaning of not succumbing to bigotry and hijacking threads to spread my own agenda.</p>
              <p>I will not desecrate the meaning of "lies" by labelling your accusations as such. I will just accept it that it is the unintended by-product of your non-farmer quality overseas education which is beyond the grasp of this farmer-to-be.</p>
              <p>As for my comments about few poly grads "making it big in society", please do tell me how many diploma grads there are in the cabinet or the top 50 companies in Singapore by net worth? I am sure with your supposed connections with the scholars, you know the answer very well.</p>
              <p>Lastly, about being a pilot or not be in the air force at all, I am sure quite a number of people in the air force will have an axe to grind with you. After all, without the engineers and technicians to turn around the aircraft, without the controllers to guide the aircraft in the air and without anti-air missiles to help augment air superiority, I will like to see how pilots can conduct their operations.</p>
              <p>Then again, I can't fanthom your mind. Maybe that's because of your "quality education in a non-farmer overseas university" and I am just another farmer-to-be.</p>
              <p>Please forgive me. &gt;&lt;</p>
              <p>Yours un-sarcastically,</p>

              <p>Hahah you numb-nuts, I have 3 SAFOS in the family, a larger number as my best of friends, am surrounded by them almost daily since sec school through JC, in Mindef in NS and then in a US university that they also go, and then back in Singapore. I have grown up with them, they were around me in school and at home, before they became SAFOS and as they went through their selection and after they return to service, I know of their lives almost daily.  I even saw their payslips more than once, &gt;$100k a year by 25 years old because they have AO components. You on the other hand, can't tell your arse from your face. I did not go through the PSC selection because I have to work for the family. I can't be offered a PSC scholarship when I did not apply. Can you understand the simple concept? No apply = no offer. Seems to be rocket science to you.</p>
              <p>You on the other hand, only knew them as Delta wing mates before they were taken out to be disrupted and you on the other hand were one of the rest of the rejectees. What's the use of boasting you know how many and who are on the PSC interview panel when this same panel rejected you? The information is an SMS or phone call away for me. Subsequently, you were offered the 3rd rate farmer award, which 3 separate forummers attested to be given out readily. Therein ends your knowledge of the subject matter. You continued your NS life in a unit, while you await to immerse yourself in intellectual mediocrity on a full blown scale. The SAFOS of your D wing in fact, are STILL STUDENTS now as we speak in the US, who yes may be drawing full monthly salary now, but they've not even returned to service!!! And you have the gall and presumption to imagine you'll know more about salary than me, who are surrounded by those who are 26?</p>
              <p>So please lah, don't come talk cock to me about knowing more in depth details about remuneration or postings or ROI. The only knowledge on the subject you have is your rejection in Delta coy and by PSC, and your tenuous ties (over MSN perhaps ha ha) to the few selected SAFOS acquaintances who are just 20 year old students oceans away!! Wat a joke ha ha ha. In any case, my point is your uncontrollable tendency for baseless presumptions is a direct result of an impending de-education. <strong>De-education attracts a certain type of candidate. The signs are evident.</strong></p>
              <p>When did I say that engineers, technicians, WSO(C3) and other assorted support roles, like other support roles like MOs in the armed forces and ADA are not necessary for the pilot's operation? Did I say that? I'd love to see you quote me. I said that as service support and support roles they are second or third class (depending on what service) citizens in the air force and SAF, this is a fact.</p>
              <p>You cannot understand the simple concept that everyone has a role to play in a sociological framework, but it's not a negation of value stratification in the framework? If so then why would some things, status (who you are),  vocations, postings and places be more coveted than others in a framework?</p>
              <p>This is why you are bound for a de-educating experience. Looks like you're all primed! Consider taking your communistic ideologies to your asylum that is your future institution and try to not tell too many people in the outside world of it.</p>
              <p> p/s: you said in a thread that butterfries and the like of her "can't make it big in life" and in this thread call her "smart and intelligent".</p>

              <p>To Gloater: Fine, you have 3 SAFOS in the family. Good for you. You are up there with the Ng Family.</p>
              <p>Still, I am surprised by how you glorify yourself through connections. Granted, connections are everything so just blare all you've got. People here can judge.</p>
              <p>As for my comments about people from poly, I guess it's the exception-vs-mean issue all over again.</p>
              <p>Please pardon me. After all, I am not from a scholarly genetic lineage. Too bad that I happen to be the first in my family to be in JC. You may like to ask why I am insulting my own family members from poly. What I said is what they told me. So if you think that you, a jc 'air-level' kia, know better about poly people compared to poly grads themselves, so be it.</p>
              <p>The world will hand down the ultimate judgement on your place in society. It's not for a farmer-to-be like me to do so.</p>
