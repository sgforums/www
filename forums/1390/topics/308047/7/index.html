            <div class='col-md body'><p>ard the same. i got fcked too cuz the diploma i took not related to flying and for other things. but i just tahan lor, and just be honest n sincere. the major kept insisting i have no interest in flying and that i only like f-16 becuz rsaf got. indirectly say im bootlicking them la.  but overall it was cool. they got ask how come i got chopped out frm yfc too. the later part not as jialat cuz i explained to them about how i've learnt my lesson from this and that and come out a stronger person who knows how to prioritise. my interview took ard 10mins. got 15 people i think. 3 poly ppl. the rest A lvls i think, cuz they are currently serving either in ocs or bmt. yup.</p></div>

              <p>del_co &gt; bro, seriously dont worry so much. Honestly speaking, its pointless of you broadcasting your passion and interests to the rest. Pretty sure a handful of them whose care factor r absolutely zero regarding your passion. Most of the ppl here alrdy made it clear to you on how the whole uniformed organisation works, and you alrdy made your stand clear in signing on. So, what's left ? Wait for your enlistment and get inside army .if you are really that good, you will make it.  Otherwise, finish serving 2 yr of NS come out and work in private sector loh. And i do kind of agree what the others say, don't rush to the decision yet when your not even in the force, don't tell the rest that " im gonna enjoy flying"  when you are not in the force yet . What i'm trying to say is, before you compliment about something, make sure you alrdy experienced it in person and not "assuming" .You r a pre-enlistee currently, same as me. And with all big words you used in your posts like "dreams", "passion" "give up my job etc", u bound to get more negative replies than positive ones. IMO, get into army, get selected for OCS then pilot, bla bla bla graduate liao then come back and tell the rest about your experience. Like that more convincing right ?</p>
              <p>Whatever your decision is, i sincerely wish you good luck</p>
              <p>-just a opinion coming from a pre-enlistee.</p>
