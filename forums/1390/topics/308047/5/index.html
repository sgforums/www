              <p>as long as u r a poly student from any of our 4 recognised polytechnics or a jc student, you are eligible to apply for YFC. they will see your attitude thru interview, medical and i think now got some psychomotor tests. so there's nothing to worry abt. YFC is good, sure...but it doesn't mean tt if you are from yfc u sure can make it pass BWC or airgrading. i bet the culture at rsaf is different, and so are the training attitudes.</p>
              <p>and walao, my eyesight like shit la....on the verge of failing...degree is fine, but astig 125. how sial? max is 200. SO CLOSE. and i haf NO CONTROL over it. sighs...</p>

              <p>Hi all. was reading this as i just finished my interview today and going my medical on thursday</p>
              <p>I took my compass on 29th jan so actually damn long to get back to me. almost 7wks plus.</p>
              <p>my basic NS medical was 26 nov last yr then i applied pilot within a week so actually very slow. if you're impatient give the career center a call.</p>
              <p>anyway you don't need to worry about the interview la. sure pass. Apparently 6000 pple apply a year. then COMPASS will cut about 70% according to the RO. So if you pass compass you're alr the top 30%</p>
              <p>then interview must see la. cause you're going to be an officer so means you need to do paperwork. if your english chui then you jialat. very impt to speak properly and think through first</p>
              <p>the question they confirm ask is tell me more about yourself. so you say why you want to be a pilot, give background, talk about what you have done to further your interest. the major there will give briefing before the interview don't worry.</p>
              <p>but the more i've read this thread. the more I feel that i have better opportunities elsewhere. i worked hard more my dip grades to go uni so i don't think i should waste with the SAF. the RO tell me can get scholarships but someone said the course is they choose for you some kum pui course. personally i still need to think more before i decide to sign on or not. but if you really love to fly, you see yourself flying till 45 then go SQ by all means go for it.</p>

              <p>Hi all. was reading this as i just finished my interview today and going my medical on thursday</p>
              <p>I took my compass on 29th jan so actually damn long to get back to me. almost 7wks plus.</p>
              <p>my basic NS medical was 26 nov last yr then i applied pilot within a week so actually very slow. if you're impatient give the career center a call.</p>
              <p>anyway you don't need to worry about the interview la. sure pass. Apparently 6000 pple apply a year. then COMPASS will cut about 70% according to the RO. So if you pass compass you're alr the top 30%</p>
              <p>then interview must see la. cause you're going to be an officer so means you need to do paperwork. if your english chui then you jialat. very impt to speak properly and think through first</p>
              <p>the question they confirm ask is tell me more about yourself. so you say why you want to be a pilot, give background, talk about what you have done to further your interest. the major there will give briefing before the interview don't worry.</p>
              <p>but the more i've read this thread. the more I feel that i have better opportunities elsewhere. i worked hard more my dip grades to go uni so i don't think i should waste with the SAF. the RO tell me can get scholarships but someone said the course is they choose for you some kum pui course. personally i still need to think more before i decide to sign on or not. but if you really love to fly, you see yourself flying till 45 then go SQ by all means go for it.</p>
