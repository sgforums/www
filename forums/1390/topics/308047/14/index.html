              <p>31 years old major without degree? its damn hard..</p>
              <p>and erm, there is no such thing as a 26 years old degree holder
                                      pilot unless you're a scholar.. most pilots less the scholars who
                                      decides to take up a degree course only gets to go uni after they
                                      get their Cat B which is around 27 years old.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>i agree with you that 31 yr old non grad can't be Major. That is true. I was only focusing on basic degree holders. 26 yr old degree holder pilot is possible. Most of the graduate pilots are LSA or ATA people. They apply for some study award as and when they apply to be pilots. Can be after right A levels (and they only qualify for ATA, got kicked out of SMS), can be during their uni yrs, can be after at 23 or 24. Pls note that SAF study awards can be applied anytime.</p>
              <p>These people are not SAFOS, which is a one-time thing after A levels. You never find some loser at 21 apply for SAFOS do you? Anytime anyone wants to apply to join SAF, they apply for an award and hope for the best and see what they can get. Some get SMS, some get ATA, some get LSA. They apply to be pilot and get the award, get backdated course fees.</p>
              <p>And no, they're<strong> not </strong>scholars. Not everyone who gets some kind of sponsorship from SAF is a scholar.</p>
              <p>Because almost all degree holders in SAF have some kind of sponsorship. Despite what they go around claiming. If they dare to claim (which I know <strong>some</strong> do all the time), ask them to talk cock to a president's scholar. And i'd love to see their balls shrink.</p>

              <p>I was wondering are you a student? if you are not, i guess you must be working for some SME.</p>
              <p>For a GLC to make loss, it's very 'cham' liao. The alarm bells ring when profits DIP. You don't need to wait for a loss for a GLC to shout for help. That one, is gone case already.</p>
              <p>Our GLCs generally year on year, go ask anyone who's worked in a huge company like a GLC before, post profits. Even during the last crisis which was SARS, they posted profits, just drop in profits. When profits don't post double digit growth, they worry. When profits drop, it's considered VERY BAD.</p>
              <p>Are you aware that DBS recently axed 900 people? Of course it seems like a drastic move to most. And i guess it's pretty serious. Did they post a loss? It will not come to that stage for GLCs, which are 1) huge *unlike nobody SMEs or some silly MNC outpost in Asia 2) conservative *unlike American investment banks.So you prob think that for such a drastic action for DBS to axe 900 people, they posted a loss? Of course not. Huge companies backed by govt never wait for "loss" to react. The L word is taboo. for people who haven't started working or have never worked for big companies, they don't know this. http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking+News/Money/Story/STIStory_306976.html DBS also made money this yr, it just posted a 38 per cent drop in profits. Yet 38 per cent drop is considered very alarming already, severe enough for them to axe 900 people. that's how big boys operate.</p>
              <p>According to this news report, hmmmm, http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/sub/companies/story/0,4574,310140,00.html</p>
              <p>"SIA<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"> reported its biggest slump in traffic in more than five years as a
                                      global recession cuts travel demand. Passenger numbers slid 6.1 per
                                      cent last month to 1.54 million. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">
              </span></p><p>That's the biggest drop since a 7.6 per cent decline in August 2003</p>
               <span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">
              <p>SIA's traffic has declined in two of the past three months as financial
                                      firms cut business travel and people cancel leisure trips. Global air
                                      traffic will decline 3 per cent next year, the first drop since 2001,
                                      the International Air Transport Association has said. The airline
                                      gained 0.2 per cent to $11.06 in trading yesterday. The shares have
                                      declined 36 per cent this year."</p>
              <p> If you want to wait for SIA to post an actual loss before you find out the truth about commercial airline pilot pay, its just holding on to a broken dream.</p>

              <p>ok i was trained as a wso(c3) so i can tell u that wso(c3) are basically controllers. they are the one who control how aircraft move about in the air.</p>
              <p>wso(fighter), on the other hand, is the "co-pilot" in a fighter plane. his main objective is to deliver the payload and fulfill the mission objectives while the pilot is just his "driver". think of the wso(fighter) as the tank commander + gunner while the pilot is the tank driver. you get the idea.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys Im enlisting into the army this year. I took my Compass test on the April of 2008 and am enlisting on the 11 April 2009. My question is during BMT i heard there are opportunities for recruits to take the compass test. However the other day when i called RSAF they told me candidates can only take the test after a period of 2 years prior to the last Compass test date. Therefore my question is am i eligible to go for the Compass test again during my BMT?</div>

              <p>Well SISPEC is a specialist course, but of cos they are for
              biased towards infantry training. But in order to be spec in other
              vocation u must go BSLC 1st....</p>

              <p>SISPEC is a must if you sign on as a combat specialist like ADSS, infantry, guards etc etc.</p>
              <p>If you are signing on as service specialist such as AOSS, Senior Tech, you do not need to go through BSLC.</p>

              <p>working hours for C3? if you are a controller kind, theres no fixed hours..</p>
              <p>basically as a C3 officer hardly are there fixed ones, even those posted to tower.</p>
              <p>the ones manning radar no need to say.</p>
              <p>so its not ur standard 8-5 job.</p>

              <p>To be a C3 officer, you need to know that your training never stops, not even after you are commissioned. You will continually undergo operational cat upgrade.</p>
              <p>Do not have the illusion that WSO(C3)'s chopping rate is low. For the last 3 WSO(C3) courses, at least 3 cadets have been chopped.</p>
              <p>As a WSO(C3), you will realise that training is unlike playing a computer game. It's not easy to adapt to the RT brevity of a controller. Also, you must think like a controller and be able to be calm on position. That's because you will be exposed to periods where high intensity of stress will be rained mercilessly on you. I am not kidding you as the pressure will not only come from the situation but also the pilot(s) and your instructor beside you. You must be able to remain calm and project a sense of confidence on position (whether you break down after standing down is a different matter).</p>
              <p>For your Pro term training, your typical day starts with a muster parade before simulator slots and/or theory lessons. Compared to WSO(ADA), there is significantly less emphasis placed on physical training although you are still expected to pass your IPPT. There is a lot of emphasis on theory knowledge (if not how are you going to ensure that your ops is carried out smoothly? there is no time to refer to references on position. the info has got to come from your head.)</p>
              <p>But first, do 'enjoy' your first 2 weeks of CLT in an OCS army wing before moving on to Air Wing. Air Wing is significantly less regimental than army wings but Air Force School is a vastly different matter altogether.</p>
