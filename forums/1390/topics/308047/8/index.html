              <p>del_co &gt; bro, seriously dont worry so much. Honestly speaking, its pointless of you broadcasting your passion and interests to the rest. Pretty sure a handful of them whose care factor r absolutely zero regarding your passion. Most of the ppl here alrdy made it clear to you on how the whole uniformed organisation works, and you alrdy made your stand clear in signing on. So, what's left ? Wait for your enlistment and get inside army .if you are really that good, you will make it.  Otherwise, finish serving 2 yr of NS come out and work in private sector loh. And i do kind of agree what the others say, don't rush to the decision yet when your not even in the force, don't tell the rest that " im gonna enjoy flying"  when you are not in the force yet . What i'm trying to say is, before you compliment about something, make sure you alrdy experienced it in person and not "assuming" .You r a pre-enlistee currently, same as me. And with all big words you used in your posts like "dreams", "passion" "give up my job etc", u bound to get more negative replies than positive ones. IMO, get into army, get selected for OCS then pilot, bla bla bla graduate liao then come back and tell the rest about your experience. Like that more convincing right ?</p>
              <p>Whatever your decision is, i sincerely wish you good luck</p>
              <p>-just a opinion coming from a pre-enlistee.</p>

              <p>thanks for your opinions dude. well yes i may not like a regimental life at all. who knoes? yeah i do rush too much. well, gotta go bmt and see how. looking forward to bmt. you? anyway, just looking for ppl who are interested in signing on in the rsaf cuz i heard frm my rsaf fren that those potential pilot trainees will be put tgt during bmt.</p>

              <p>As for signing on, please do consider it carefully especially prior to entering BMT or even OCS. This concerns 10 years of your future. Make sure that you weigh the pros and cons first.</p>

              <p>so if i feel that dropping out is not ok i shldnt attempt it? you don't make cow sense. sir, where is all that "to lead, to excel and to overcome" spirit? i have considered it, and i've concluded i wldnt go cut my wrists and end my life. haha! and just like you i do haf frens who have gone thru that path, but unlike you, they aren't trainees. im pretty clear how shitty it is, even the waiting time can eat you up. btw if the RSAF suck so bad, then why did you sign on? and oh you can be sure i'd make an informed and common-sensed decision, my family members are in the force.</p>
              <p>in every vocation, there are concerns. how old are you? do you think i am one of those kids who suddenly out of nowhere wanna be a "top gun cum tom cruise<br> pilot? i thank you for your good advice. but just to let you know, i'm 22 years old and i took a good 5 years since my yfc days to decide if i really want to pursue a career in the rsaf. i've heard shitty stories from yfc seniors to mates abt trainee life, so pls tell me if you really still think i buy that glamour shit? im sick and tired of ppl telling me to give it up, think hard...like c'mon, i'm 22. i've thought hard and long enough. i've bloody seriously thought for 5 hard years. did my goddamned homework. even when i dropped out of jc and i still thought about it...i've waited an extra 3 years compared to my syfc mates. they've completed their AJT in France/Canada. and where am i? a tekong-bound pre-enlistee. great! i noe the risks, and i noe the shit. and the commander of the flying training school has made sure of that. so thank you very much gentlemen. =)</p>
              <p>sorry for being pretty uncouth, but enough is really enough. thank you.</p>

              <p>del_co, in the commercial world... u work as a pilot, u are a pilot. i'm a technician, i should just be a technician.</p>
              <p>in the military, u are a pilot, presenter, prostitute, sai kang warrior, wayang performer, AV club projector repair boy, yada yada yada... you really spent lots of time doing everything else which is "beneficial" to the organisation but when you look at it you'll be thinking "what the f*ck, its a waste of time". it is the organisation's way of saving money, instead of spending money on employing more people to handle the minor stuff. yet they like to give alot of money to the lazy worthless shitheads sitting way up on top.</p>
              <p>there are pilots with only diplomas and what do they do? ground run... steady lah, fly a little bit but ground run alot. ground run don't clock anything, no extra money, just to see if the aircraft is serviceable or spoilt and to clock perspiration time under the sun.</p>
              <p>too many pilots, too little time to fly, too little airspace</p>
              <p>and if u wanna quit the job, u CAN'T! that makes u even more pissed knowing that you have to go through the entire shit and you can't do anything about it.</p>
              <p>so to sum it all up for you</p>
              <p>1) you're not paid to do your primary job, you're paid to do many jobs and your performance is based on those insignificant jobs.</p>
              <p>2) you can't quit when you realise you hate the place, which is as early as the day you start military life OR when you start your unit life.</p>
              <p>honestly, training life is the best.</p>

              <p>i think before you sign on you should already have found out what airforce life is like, which you have already heard.</p>
              <p>some may think its good, same may be so jaded they think its bad. either way, nobody is going to point a gun to you head and force you to sign up. if you sign on the dotted line, you acknowledge that you want to be part of this so called 'good' or 'screwed up' organisation, depending on who you talk to. of course if you get your promotions on time, you don't get punished, condemned or whatever or do anything wrong u'll find that the place is 'good', however if you fall on the other side of the fence you might end up feeling alot of resentment. but military organisations are like that, whether it is in singapore or the rest of the world. they have one thing in common- they lack forgiveness should anything go wrong.</p>
              <p>anyway the drop out rate is high simply because if you can't handle the jet, you better not be flying lest you end up killing yourself doing so,or worst case killing others as well. so take it with a pinch of salt, if you try and you fail, it may not be so bad after all. there may be better things to do with your life.</p>
              <p>imagine you have a 10 yr contract, and u start having ill feelings 1 yr into the contract, you have another 9 painful years to go! and its basically a slap in your own face for signing the contract because u've already heard the pros and cons.</p>
              <p>why dont' just make the best of it and enjoy yrself while working and then leave after 10 years. the grass may be greener elsewhere.</p>
              <p>honestly speaking, the organisation may be far from ideal but there's ways and means to improve it, but it has to start from somewhere too right. and a jaded serviceman doesn't help the situation.</p>
              <p>btw, i doubt' we have too many pilots. in fact i think there is lack of it thus the level of overwork.</p>
              <p>dont' forget we're expanding our capabilities and missions, we need more people to spread the pain around. haha</p>

              <p><br>i see. i'm still waiting for medical results and i've got to qualify for OCS first before i even get to smell the contract, much less touch on the dotted line. i understand that the medical results are frigging long. 2 months on an average, and i've yet to complete bmt. so i guess i'd be using the bmt i haf to do the thinking.</p>

              <p>ah yes, but u also have to state that they like to punish and pick on the dumbest things.</p>
              <p>jaded servicemen won't help because they screwed up that serviceman from the beginning. i went in, wanting to be in the military... but now it turns out with the 3G wayang, the pay doesn't justify my work.</p>
              <p>ask my colleagues... all of them signed on, wanting to prove themselves... now, everyone is jaded. i have a senior who wanted to conver to be an officer, was siao on. now he totally switches off and in the past you would never hear "air force sux" come out of his mouth. he's even prepared to pay money to break his bond.</p>
              <p>i don't mind pilots coming in. but i think there are not much experienced technicians left... besides, they are starting to commercialise, soon everything will be prepared by ST Aero uncles... got war or any humanitarian effort, ho sey liao.</p>
