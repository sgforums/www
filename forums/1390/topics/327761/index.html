              <p>But something the clerk said disturbed me. Here i have my MC in front of me with 3 types of excuse(ippt, ict, etc) listed clearly with the dates, and there he is saying he only see excuse for ippt.</p>
              <p>Which makes me wonder "what system" is he looking at. Because the last time i checked my medical excuse status in ns.sg, it's the same as the hardcopy i have.</p>
              <p>Very funny that he "cannot see" the rest. I'm not so busy these few days that's why thought i might as well inform my unit just in case. What about other fellow nsmen who have valid saf mcs and can't be bothered to make the effort to call their units to update them? Then what kind of info are the ns clerks seeing in their system?</p>

              <p>Give me number to fax my MC. No problem, like rednano said, clarify with them directly.</p>
              <p>But something the clerk said disturbed me. Here i have my MC in front of me with 3 types of excuse(ippt, ict, etc) listed clearly with the dates, and there he is saying he only see excuse for ippt.</p>
              <p>Which makes me wonder "what system" is he looking at. Because the last time i checked my medical excuse status in ns.sg, it's the same as the hardcopy i have.</p>
              <p>Very funny that he "cannot see" the rest. I'm not so busy these few days that's why thought i might as well inform my unit just in case. What about other fellow nsmen who have valid saf mcs and can't be bothered to make the effort to call their units to update them? Then what kind of info are the ns clerks seeing in their system?</p>
              <p>Basket, after typing so much, feel like shooting a letter to ns.sg to complain. </p>

              <p>ns.sg cannot do anything. rednano, do u understand how the NSHRCs and ns.sg work. complaining w/o knowing how things work won't get u the desired results.</p>
              <p>matchless, im quite sure that the medical centre personnel didn't update for u properly. if u r really that patient and don't want to make a complaint. u can ask your unit to get the med centre to update the system for u and give u a notification when it's done.</p>
