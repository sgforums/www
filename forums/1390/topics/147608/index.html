I think what most important is that someone who can really do work loh and be recognised. A warrant officer doesnt even know how to type an email as compared to a pte soldier... how senior the warrant is also no use.<br><br>And i think pple who play ranks are defenceless and useless pple loh. Cos they know they lose to other pple in terms of capabilities mah... so can only use rank. wahaha.<br><br>I think the most ideal person is having high capabilities and also rank and know which to use according to situations.</div>
