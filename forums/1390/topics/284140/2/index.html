            <div class='col-md body'>that's when mutual respect comes in... a warrant officer or spec, even if hold SSM appointment still must respect a commissioned officer, simply because they are commissioned.<br><br>Yet on the other hand, although the SSM gives face to commissioned officers, SSM's appointment gives him the power to exercise discipline. If junior officers give disciplinary problem, SSM can't charge him, but he can make a "recommendation" to senior officers who will see to it that the junior officer get something.<br><br>On the other hand, because SSM old bird, he can make life difficult on a daily basis for junior officers, simply because of his appointment, yet he also can get charged by these young 2LT if he show disrespect to the commissioned ranks.

Going by his title Â“King of the Parade SquareÂ”, the Parade RSM is authorised to wear the sword as a mark of his authority in controlling the parade.

            <div class='col-md body'>they won't engrave your name on the bayonet if you're an award recipient, mainly cause it's too short, and thus won't look nice. And unlike the OCS Sword where you buy it, a bayonet is given to you as an award, so since it's 'free' they won't bother engraving for you.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The sword is given to commissioned officers. Don't have to pay for it.<br><br>It used to be engraved, but now it's just got some real poor quality printing of your name. This fades off after a while.<br><br>FYI The ceremonial sword also used to be made of silver. At least my father's sword was, cos when it rusted it turned green from oxidisation. It's heavier and better made all round. Those were the kind of swords you can be proud of.<br><br>My sword is merely plated and the plating is flaking off after 7 years. The quality of the blade has decreased over the years and it can't even cut a cake properly. The gold plating on the hilt is starting to go too even though it's been kept in a cupboard since commissioning. The newer ones are good for roasting big marshmallows though. SAF trying to stinge nowadays i guess. Don't play with your sword in front of SAF personnel until you ORD though. Once you get your pink IC back, you can do whatever you want.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
