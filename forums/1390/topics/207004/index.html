Because that's where ur family and loved ones are at, and they have more love for the country than u do.<br><br>Look at it this way, in other countries like Taiwan, there's also conscription into the army. I think they serve longer than us, yet the taiwanese I came into contact to never felt it was a waste of time. They know it is essential.<br><br>As for the FT thingy, it is up to the individual to step up their efforts a gear, and prove to their bosses that they are just as good, if not better than these so-called FTs.
