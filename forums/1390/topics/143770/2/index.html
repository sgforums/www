You don't have to like it; you just have to do it.<br><br>Unless you want to get sh*t being thrown back at you.</div></blockquote>Actually, the salute is not to the person holding the rank. The salute is an acknowledgement of the "commissioned" status of the rank, that by Constitution, the person is empowered by the state to execute his duties. You are actually saluting the Constitution, the state and the government.  So , we should be impartial in saluting.<br><br>Just like in civvy life. Somehow, you got to acknowledge the boss.

We've had guys deliberately deep-six their CO interviews so that they could stay with the platoon instead of being sent off to OCS.<br><br>The culture of the unit is such that rank's nowhere as big an issue as being with your guys.  I don't know of anybody who was miserable about being an NCO instead of a commissioned officer.</div></blockquote>Do not know Gedanken will agreed with me.<br><br>The unit cultre in Cdo is alittle different, men and officers work together for common objective. We are working in form of team.  Therefore, very often, we dun salute, buit we pay due respect to their rank.<br><br>Must understand this point, your platoon mate started BMT together with you, but when their are back from OCS course, it is like old friends liao.  Very different from infantry unit deployment.<br><br></div>
