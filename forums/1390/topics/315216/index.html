              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am new to this forum, and i come here because it is the most actively forum that discussed about downgrading when googled.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A little introduction, I am 32 this year and I have a ICT coming this coming October. Recently, the cardiologist diagnosed that i am having hypertension.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Without medication, it is usually 170/110 and with medication control, (the doctor is still adjusting the dosage felodipine for me) it is 150/100. May be with 15mg of felodipine it will be better, I guess. I am a new patient to hypetension, I really have no idea what this could mean....but everyone surround me ask me to get a downgrade. So here goes my question.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Is hypertension 170/110 consider high?</p>
              <p>2. With medication control, say (my doctor also target to have) 140/80, am I still eligible for downgrade?</p>
              <p>3. And since medicine can control blood pressure, why am I still eligible for downgrade?</p>
              <p>4. My GP said that bp 160/100 by national standard has to be send to hospital immediately, is that true?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now the reason why i asked the last question is because I have several bad encounter with my in-camp mo. And my specialist said that if MO refuses to downgrade, just go to medication center without taking the felodipine...then the MO is obligated to send me to hospital immediately or at least send me to a sick bay or attend-C bunk</p>

              <p>1) yes. it's high. its index is like BMI. got range one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>acceptable systolic (upper limit) range = 100 to 150 mmHg<br>acceptable diastolic (lower limit) range = 60 to 90 mmHg</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) yes, u can downgrade, just get a specialist memo/report, book an appt @ eHealth module of <a href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a> for medical review at ur reservist camp medical centre.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) even with medication, ur case is still valid. another common medicine can consider is atendol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) if u want, u can consult a specialist govt/private to get ur condition stablised and keep under control 1st. thereafter u may request for step down to ur local family GP for review.</p>

              <p>Hi EAC,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks for the prompt reply. I have done the blood test and urine test to check the causes of high blood pressure. And so far everything seems normal. Does this mean it is consider as a white-coat hypertension.</p>

              <p>this one u should ask ur attending doctor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but so long as u get the specialist report/memo to give the reservist camp doctor, u will be considered for medical board.</p>

              <p>Thanks, I wanted to get a letter and get a downgrade because for safety reasons. I dun think I am as capable to handle a rifle, go jungle tracking for a few days and nights without proper resting anymore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I had very bad bloods with MOs before...To be honest, I was graded C2L2 previously and because my unit had not enough manpower strength for ATEC, they upgraded me to PES B during in-camp. And I was limping all the way during the outfield, during the preliminary ATEC training, which in the end they have no choice but to put me back to PES C2L2 again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On a separate occasion my knee problem was injured during my RT. For this i asked SAF to provide specialist and medical attention to it. Which I had very bad arguement with the HQ chief clerk and MO who refuses my treatment....In the end, they downgraded me to C2L2 for a year and allow me to pay for my X-Ray and physio-therapy and specialist consulation session.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just last year, I was upgraded to PES B automatically because my knee problem is better. I didn't have much confident to face the MO again. Thanks for building my confident again.</p>

              <p>it's okay</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>just to note: most of the CPT MOs in the medical centres are NSF too. so give the medical centre a year or so n they will too ORD, so will hand over/take over. that's y.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>most of the reservist units' MOs r only back for their ICTs too, same with u. they r NOT the MOs handling the medical boards cases in the medical centres.</p>

              <p>Hi eac,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am reading your other topic about 8 simple rules to get downgrade where you mention that need to spend money to get specialist report...my specialist is from NUH, do I need to spend money on this report?</p>

              <p>since u r already been given the <em>final diagnosis</em>, a memo should be sufficient.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>on ur next visit to the nuh specialist, ask him/her to write a memo to the saf mo. he/she will know what to do liao since its a common request. the short memo is free anyway. n just ask if u can have a copy of the blood lab report or whatever to provide support to the memo. this should be enough, when the specialist certified the diagnosis, and its better if the memo indicate the BP figures, medications n something sort like 'pls downgrade patient accordingly'.<br></p>

              <p>Actually, NS training with hypertension is still ok (if your knee is not giving you any problems...)</p>
              <p>I was diagnosed with hypertension when I was still in my late 20s, but I did not report this to the Army and I completed all my ICTs. However, I did seek the advice of my doctor and he confirmed that in my case, ICT, jungle/ field training &amp; IPPT etc. will not affect me.</p>
              <p>I just need to pop a pill every morning and everything will be under control. Of course I need to bring my pills during field exercises. This caused me some minor inconvenience, but overall I find that this works to the benefit of my hypertension because ICTs/ IPPTs forced me to adopt a more active lifestyle and thus protecting myself against the complications of hypertension. Without my ICT/ IPPT my lifestyle will be very sedentary.</p>
