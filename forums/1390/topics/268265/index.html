            <div class='col-md body'>If you going to kena DB of course faster ask your parents come and help you la. Its not a joke lor.<br>Sometimes also if really unjust and unfair punishment you lan lan also have to seek help. Sometimes this is how the SAF works. Nobody squeeze their balls, they don't work.<br><br>Like one time someone's relative pass away and the guy was refused off to go for the wake coz not direct relative. End up the parents call and say "even MP got time to come for the wake, how come the son got no time."<br>Next thing you know, the person got his off and a free ride to the nearest mrt station.
