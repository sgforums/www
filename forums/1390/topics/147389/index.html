            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone,<br><br>I'm contemplating signing on with the SAF (army) since I completed my degree  (overseas uni) last month. But  a few of my guy friends who were NSF or currently serving strongly advised me against it. One of them reckons it's pointless for a girl to join as she will be discriminated against and because of her gender she won't go far.  What is your take on this?<br><br>It sounds almost too old-fashioned to think that way, and there is just so much cynism coming from our NSF. When I asked him if it was just the NSF who feel this way, he said there are regulars who also hate their jobs in the army. I am greatly interested in the military and this is a great opportunity for me to serve my country. My friend said there's a female regular in his camp who said the same thing (she wants to serve her country) and he just doesn't believe/understand her. Is there anyone here who signed on because they are interested in the job or because you'll like to serve the country?<br><br>I know that at the end of the day I make my own decisions, but I'll really like to hear from what you guys have to say.  Because I've been reading your posts for a while and I really admire your maturity. It's a fresh break from the "singapore sux", SAF-bashing, unconstructive comments that I usually hear.  hopefully I'll be able to get some insight from everyone reading this thread.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good for u. What department are you intending to go? Combat, non-combat?<br><br>Agreed that army personnals can get a little sexist at times. But in general, using ur degree, u probably will become a female officer. Officers are generally, well mannered compared to the normal soldiers.<br><br>I knew a female combat officer during my NSF days. She super garang, well respected and even have a diver's badget. Put a lot of men to shame.  I think she will go far, all the superiors liked her and respected her.<br><br>SAF is a career stable career, but if u want to go far, quite difficult.<br><br>Lastly, please don't think SAF as a weight-loss program.<br><br>Good luck</div>

I'm not biased against females signing on as a non-combat or combat vocation. If you are planning to sign on in the combat vocation, you must prepare to spend your working hours exposed to our climate and working under a regimental controlled environment. You will be exposed to dirty equipment, dusty environment, uniform and undergarments soaked after rain, hot and humid weather, unable to shower during exercise, feeding to the mosquitoes and other insects (subjected to even hornets attack) and not forgetting the inconvenience of doing your business when you are out in field etc etc ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I strongly believe in differing perceptions... I've friends who signed on and really enjoy their job, conversely, I've also friends that signed on but lived in misery eversince... it's really important that you match your personality with the job... if you're a person which is highly disciplined, principle motivated, enjoys the outdoor and doesn't mind regimental lifestyle. Military maybe suitable for you... but if you're a freedom lover, hates authority and is highly laissez-faire, then you may want to re-consider...<br><br>Girls doesn't have experience of military like guys do... do aquire more information or go down to Army Recruitment Centre to speak to some female officers... hope that helps <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

(rmb the thread on "is ns a waste of time?" ?)<br><br>you really have to love the army to enjoy it and different pple have different passions, you can't condemn an artist/dancer simply because they follow their passion. respect them cos they dare to step out of their comfort zone and disregard pple's perception of them.<br><br>same for regulars. more respect shd be given. why? cos some friggin nutbrain do not know that there are actually <strong>REAL soldiers who are willing to give their lives to fight for those nutbrain.</strong><br><br>i told a female friend i signed on, she went hystical and was like "U MAD OR WAT?! SIAO AH?!" i ask her wat's wrong with signing on? i love my job! she was dumbfound and went "i don't know... sign on army? no good lar. i dun know but no good lor!"<br><br>shows how shallow pple really are.<br><br>anyway, ladies do fly as high as their male counterparts in the army. lotsa lady majors ard in my formation and some going on to LTC (i hope)<br><br>so if you are good enough, dun worry about such trival matters. the SAF will take good care of you.</div>
