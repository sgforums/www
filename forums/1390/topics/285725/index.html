            <div class='col-md body'>If you are just mild obese, there are 4 intakes a year (mar,jun,sept,dec) together with the PTP guys if i'm not wrong and severely obese there are 2 intakes in Dec and Jun and seems like sure to be E coy.<br><br>How much weight you loss will also partly be due to yourself and how hard you intend to work on the training provided. Most people do loss some weight in tekong but if you bring alot of snacks and junk food in and eat during all your breaks then you could be like 1 platoon mate of mine who gained more than 5kg in his 3 months in tekong. Sounds unbelievable but he did it by eating alot of biscuits, cup noodles etc in between meals.</div>

For instance, while Pes A and B people may start immediately on 4km route march, u guys start off with 2km(just an example, may not apply now)<br><br>And during my time, my coy(PesBP also) have 3 requirements that we must fulfil before we can book out each week. We just have to fulfil 2 of them. i)Lose 1 kg each week. ii)Do a certain number of chin-ups. iii)2.4km timing meet the requirement set by ur sergeant. Again, not sure if its still the norm now, it may not be so.<br><br>Don't worry about losing weight. I weighed 88kg before I entered BMT, and after BMT, i dropped to 72kg. Provided of course, u don't go and snack too much and drink soft drinks. Stick to the three meals they give u every day and u shall be fine. During weekends, I would also eat whatever i want, but of course in moderation too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm previously from Apache Company in BMTC.. just poped a month ago tho.<br>it was a mild obese intake then. but anyway.. to my knowledge the training is somewad progressive.. expect quite a number of endurance run (2km) and other PT like going to the gym for strength and circuit training.. however we dont really do exercises like the PTP/Enhance batch do. for instance we don't do AGR/Speed training etc.. the training programme vision is to cut down the weight basically, not really designed to let you pass IPPT with flying colours. Alot of work is needed cos if u happen to get into command school next time when u POP... it's gonna be very tough as the physical demands compared to mild obese training difference is quite a margin</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Come to think of it, I was secretly glad that I was Pes BP during my BMT days. I knew I wouldn't have survived had I been Pes B or A. The training would have been more than I could handle, and I probably would have made Straits Times headlines "NSF commits sucide in Tekong" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
