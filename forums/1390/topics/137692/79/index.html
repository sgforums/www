              <p>poly usually is june and sep for ptp, the sep batch usually recieve the letter same time as the june, i duno if they would send some letter at a latter date or not, alternatively u can use the ns portal to check your enlistment if there is any.</p>

              <p>Would like to know if I should do a medical board review since I had a bit of heart problem. Would it be pointless if I get that memo/report for the MO during my checkup at CMPB when I will most likely be entering Pes C or Obese due to overweight? </p>
              <p>I couldn't find information regarding IPPT. Anyone got link or can explain?</p>
              <p>What is the ranking for Diploma qualification?</p>
              <p>I got diploma in the field of IT.Does it help in anything?</p>
              <p>Note: I'm overweight/obese,pre-enlist going for checkup soon.</p>

              <p>Hello guys.</p>
              <p>I got a problem here. going back to tekong for PES C recourse in jul to aug. I'm currently TEMP C2L2 for 6 months cause i injured my knee though and have excuse grass. problem is, i already kinda completed almost everything in PES B BMT liao. SOC, BCCT, IPPT, AGR, GAC, THT, IFC, UO, all done. but because i OOT during field camp, my company apparently didnt even write down my attendance at all. So now i'm going back to waste 7 wks of my life in tekong AGAIN because i missed outfield (i'm still gg to be excused anyways), and BTP. I was there all the way until POP summore. sians... IPPT i passed btw. guess many ppl will say dun complain and just go bah, bt kinda dun want to waste time again in tekong. summore my unit got overseas exercise and other events during tt time, dun want to be forced to miss it leh. =( was thinking of appealing, but dunno who should i send the letter to. any ideas? =S</p>
              <p>btw oso heard from seniors tt for recourse batch, usually the timetable the company will try push everything to be done fast fast, so tt aft tt, last 2 wks nothing on. then they may gif 2 wks off. any idea isit true? (hoping for sum consolation at least. =X)</p>

              <p>It is the only stand alone camp currently in spore...if my info is right.You should be the last batch of soldiers to be train at the camp cause the unit would be moving to near Mandai hill camp in the near future...It's one of the most ULU camp..ok..not much facilities within camp n small compared to many other complex camps..can be quite quiet..no canteen also.Good thing?camp food probably one of the better ones for SFI cookhouses...Just have to say,u will feel quite emo,no doubt.</p>
              <p>IF i'm not wrong,you are PTP batch?..Go thru 3-4 months of BMT,(not too sure of the new BMT scheme)..after which u will have a POP parade..to celebrate abit..but its just the start of things..then go thru Advance infantry training phase...u may be selected to be in support company stray away from infantry vocation...after which ...there's a lot of things..the rest u will find out urself..gonna be 2interesting yrs ahead of you boy.</p>

              <p>with regards to linwei20...welcome to 4SIR.LCK Camp 1.Jus ORD
              from there, was a SGT there..</p>
              <p>It is the only stand alone camp currently in spore...if my info
              is right.You should be the last batch of soldiers to be train at
              the camp cause the unit would be moving to near Mandai hill camp in
              the near future...It's one of the most ULU camp..ok..not much
              facilities within camp n small compared to many other complex
              camps..can be quite quiet..no canteen also.Good thing?camp food
              probably one of the better ones for SFI cookhouses...Just have to
              say,u will feel quite emo,no doubt.</p>
              <p>IF i'm not wrong,you are PTP batch?..Go thru 3-4 months of
              BMT,(not too sure of the new BMT scheme)..after which u will have a
              POP parade..to celebrate abit..but its just the start of
              things..then go thru Advance infantry training phase...u may be
              selected to be in support company stray away from infantry
              vocation...after which ...there's a lot of things..the rest u will
              find out urself..gonna be 2interesting yrs ahead of you boy.</p>
              <p>gdluck.</p>

              <p>Hello guys.</p>
              <p>I got a problem here. going back to tekong for PES C recourse in jul to aug. I'm currently TEMP C2L2 for 6 months cause i injured my knee though and have excuse grass. problem is, i already kinda completed almost everything in PES B BMT liao. SOC, BCCT, IPPT, AGR, GAC, THT, IFC, UO, all done. but because i OOT during field camp, my company apparently didnt even write down my attendance at all. So now i'm going back to waste 7 wks of my life in tekong AGAIN because i missed outfield (i'm still gg to be excused anyways), and BTP. I was there all the way until POP summore. sians... IPPT i passed btw. guess many ppl will say dun complain and just go bah, bt kinda dun want to waste time again in tekong. summore my unit got overseas exercise and other events during tt time, dun want to be forced to miss it leh. =( was thinking of appealing, but dunno who should i send the letter to. any ideas? =S</p>
              <p>btw oso heard from seniors tt for recourse batch, usually the timetable the company will try push everything to be done fast fast, so tt aft tt, last 2 wks nothing on. then they may gif 2 wks off. any idea isit true? (hoping for sum consolation at least. =X)</p>
