              <p>@tarutaru, I am previously from BTMC as a commander. </p>
              <p>Anyway, there are cases where people enlist early. Mostly it is because there has been a mistake on the part of the administration of enlistment or the soldier was re-posted to another company but the notification cannot be sent to him.</p>
              <p>If this is the case, then, they will still host the recruit in whichever of the companies that can accomodate him, usually a company that is having an intake on that day. The recruit will stay there and then be sent to his company when that company finally has an intake.</p>
              <p>However, if you make a mistake on your own part and misread the enlistment letter, they will probably turn you away at the ferry terminal, as there is a check there and there are computers and all to register you.</p>

              <p>And you can't really cheat on the MAPAS test, cos if the results are inconsistent, they will ask you to come by and take it again. Sometimes as late as in BMT. But usually before.</p>
              <p>Just do it as per normal, as it is really tedious and not worth doing a second time.</p>

              <p>Hi all.. have been reading this thread for a while and i think i have a question to you guys as this problem is frustrating.. I am currently 17, turning 18 on October this year..</p>
              <p>Recently just received the NS Registration to register at Feb..other than that. I didnt receive before.<br><br> Just graduated last year but this year, i am not study anymore but going to study private school which is enrolling at March, the course is abt 10month. I am worry that the NS Enlishment will send me a letter and force me to quit my school for it.. Any ideas that i am able to make it? <br><br>I heard that as long you are below 17 half year old and you sign up a private course, it should be no problem until you are 18 and a half.   Thanks for the help bro!</p>

              <p>dadeadman1337-  I think there are some on partitism. I can't really recall.</p>
              <p>WhatMe- If you have a letter from the school showing that you have been admitted, you can apply to defer NS for your education. I think there are no issues as you say you are under 17 and a half. The application is online. Kinda standard application thing. If they still don't approver (Though unlikely) you can call up Army Recruitment Center or the number as per your enlistment letter to state your case. </p>
              <p>B00mx - The process until enlistment varies. Your enlistment can be as fast as 3-4 months after your checkup or even a year or more as some of the dragon babies faced. (PS the dragon babies are those born in the year of the dragon. Usually, there are much more of them than from other years.)</p>
              <p>Shootme - If you are a PR, you should have your IC. Thats all you need to submit. As far as i know. Unless they changed the procudure.</p>
              <p>But if you're asking if you need a passport to enter Tekong, then the answer is no. Tekong is still a part of Singapore. <span style="color: #ccffff;">Dont be a dumbass</span></p>

              <p>Thanks.</p>
              <p>I haven't registered yet though, so wanna know about the medical checkup, what are the range of dates I can choose from after registering? Will it be the coming month, lets say I'm registering this month, the medical checkup will have to be next month (March?) or how many months or weeks after registering that I have to go for my check up?</p>

              <p>Oh and I haven't yet turn 18. But am 18 this year.</p>
              <p>Is it necessary that they will enlist me before I turn 18? Or only after I turn 18?</p>

              <p>Alternatively if you want to be enlisted early, just commit a crime like vanadlism or shoplifting. Then during your hearing just say that you are bored waiting for your enlistment with nothing to do. </p>
              <p>The judge can make you enlist early. </p>

              <p>Yes, the result will likely affect your enlistment date. This is because you will be joining the enhanced batch, since you manage to got a silver for your NAPFA recently.</p>
              <p>As for the broken machine, it should be alright as long as your results are recorded down, though you did not receive a result slip. If you really wish to call CMPB up, by all means, go ahead. </p>

              <p><br>Hi. Base on your enlistment date, you will be enlisted into 1 SIR 14th mono.. Think your NSF life will not be easy. You will meet people from various backgrounds. Maybe you will get to see me a few times in camp.. But at most for a few days cos I ord on the 12th march.. A word of advice, throughout my stay at the camp, I have seen quite a number of guys going into DB for various reasons such as awoling, drug abuse etc. Life will be stressful but just try your best to finish your two years and don't get into unnecessary trouble.. Good luck...</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I just got a quick question to ask as currently im having attachment and my company wish to know around when would I be enlisting into army so as to draft out a contract for me.</p>
              <p>I have went to my medical checkup on Dec but were graded pes D till early Feb where i received a letter saying im pes B. I have failed my napfa too.</p>
              <p>I know you all will not have a definite answer but I just would like to know from experience what will be the range? As i read from some forum they say after 6 months from your medical checkup which for my case I do not know is Dec or Feb.</p>
              <p>I also learned that the letter of enlistment is not necessary be posted to you one/two months before enlistment and sometimes they could give you a call and tell you that you are enlisting two weeks later.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yup.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks! </p>

              <p>Hi, I've got a few questions to ask.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've juz finished my A lvls in Nov 2009 and have a medical condition. I last went to CMPB for medical appointment on 6 Oct 2009 and they are now still pending for the medical report from SGH. I called up CMPB and they said that if it's taking too long, they'll usually enlist me first as E9, according to my educational cohort.</p>
              <p>Approximately, when do you think I will be enlisted if the report is taking too long?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How many months in advance will the enlistment letter be issued before enlistment?</p>
