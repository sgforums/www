You don't want to lose or break your specs (with all the double here double there, pt, field camp etc it is quite possible to do so) and then spend the rest of the week "blind". BMT is tough enough already when you can see properly! Also, with your specs, they will fall off easily when you are sweaty and have to do push-ups. To stop this, either get a string to tie the "ears" together, or you can buy plastic "ear hooks" (usually opticians will have) that extend the ear piece to hook around your ear more securely. Very much recommended that you do something to make sure your specs don't fall, as you don't want to be trying to pick and wear them all the time when your sgts are yelling at you.<br><br>Also as far as I know you can wear whatever underwear you like (men's underwear only ok!!). The most important thing is that it is comfortable even when you sweat a LOT, and that it is not visible when you wear your black shorts. Some fellows in my section also preferred to wear no underwear, but I recommend that you don't do that. Your sgts are very unlikely to do "stand by underwear"... if they like to do that then I think you have other things to worry about...</div>

Its 1 lap using breast stroke. If you can swim without goggles then its not a problem.<br><br>It depends on how bad is your eyesight. As long as you can still see without your glasses then its ok especially if you need to take the swimming lessons as its not easy to do what is required sometimes if you can't see what they are demostrating.</div>

To increase your chances i guess you just have to be more proactive and exhibit your leadership ability. SIT Test will be the best time to show your leadership etc i would think.<br><br>How fit a person becomes will depend partly on how hard he is willing to train. I have many friends who went into PTP without passing napfa and by POP, quite few went up to silver and even a few gold.<br><br>Whats the hardest part about BMT is hard to say since it differs with everyone, due to their individual strengths and weaknesses. The more xiong things should be last few route marches, SOC, field camp etc.<br><br>Most of the time should be spent on training except when its CAT 1 and training is cancelled. First 2 weeks is alot of boring lectures and stuff and after that your days are filled with mostly physical training and army training stuff. The most free time you will get is maybe the week before POP or so when almost all the trainings are completed and there is nothing much else left to do. I remember we sometimes even have the whole day to sleep in bunk.</div>
