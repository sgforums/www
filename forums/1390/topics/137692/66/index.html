              <p>During BMT there is a FIX bookout timing because the ferry service does not work 24/7. Each company is schedule to take the ferry at a fix time so they cannot hold you back regardless how they try to threaten the recruits.</p>

              <p>For fridays its usually in the evening, for sats its usually in the morning. Assuming there is no special training etc</p>
              <p>The time depends since all the companies in the school will bookout around the same time and each ferry can only carry a limited number of people so the range in bookout timing can be 1.5-2hrs depending on the order which the companies are allocated</p>

              <p>Was the MC endorsed and accepted by the MO as valid and he can be on ATT C in the first place? MC by doctor is often accepted by MOs but sometimes MCs might not be strictly followed if they feel that the problem does not require u to stay at home through and they can just give u excuse UL etc and make u return to camp.</p>

              <p>Yeah. U will not change coy. The PTP batches will stay in the same coy together till POP and the direct BMT batches that enlist will be in other coys.</p>
              <p>Btw, if i am not wrong, the new enlistment starting from Dec is changing the 13 wks PTP to 17 weeks PTP since they adding 1 more month to PTP. This will make the BMT batch enlist 2 months after the PTP batch and let them all POP at the same time rather than the staggered time now.</p>

              <p>There are generally 2-3 coy having enlistment on the same day so same day same time has a good chance of being together but still might be different platoon. Same day different time might be same coy or different coy depending on how far the time difference is.</p>
              <p>Never heard of a sch 3 yet. The only 'new' coys i know are the 2 or 3 new coys that are now using the former SISPEC camp but they belong to sch 1</p>
