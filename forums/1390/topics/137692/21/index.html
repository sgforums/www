In the beginning, no need. what they give you is enough actually..... After a week or 2, then u see whether u still need to buy or not...<br><br>2. Its better to park at PR and take the bus... cos at SFT, there will be limited parking space.... Unless of course they are just dropping you off.... Be there at SFT around 845... If you take bus then follow timing...<br><br>3. No one will know what coy u going to...<br><br>Best of luck!</div>
