              <p>1) Is it true that the sergeants will punish us for no reason? As I was used to be from NCC, my so called "sergeants" in ncc will always make us do stupid punishment such as doing knuckle pushups in hot sun, sockdrills. I heard from my fren who in PTP batch that we will stay in pushups position for 1hr?</p>
              <p>2) Book out time is always very late? The sergeants will take their own sweet time and let us book out late? And the standby bunk takes a very long time?</p>
              <p>3)Lastly, I am blur type. Will I sabo the whole team? :/</p>

              <p>1)If they do that,it is usually because of some joker breaking the rules like sneaking out to smoke after lights out.That sort of punishment encourages responsibility...after all,not many will be able to bear the sight of their fellow platoon mates holding in knock it down position just because of their mistake.Don't worry though,your commanders know their limits.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2)As Rednano pointed out,ferry timing is fixed.If you miss the ferry,so will your commanders so they won't anyhow play play with you.Don't be surprised if you see your OC or CSM sneaking away to the jetty while your PC/PS/SC is pumping you on your bookout,lol! I have seen OCs ordering that the bookout be delayed because of people being  sloppy about the standby area and not cooperating with each other.8.00 am bookout becoming a 1.00pm bookout.....on a saturday.</p>
              <p>3)Your commanders might use your weak points initially as a chance to give "punishments" but most of them do that to drill in the fact that as a team,you should be encouraging each other and tolerant of each others faults while improving yourself.Learn,don't be shy,making mistakes infront of others can be a humbling and rewarding experience on that long road to be an adult.</p>

              <p>Thats not going to be possible in tekong as far as i know. Just try your best and be alert. With NCC background a few of the things might be familiar to you so hopefully you would be abit less blur compared to people who have 0 related experience even if NCC and NS is still not exactly the same.</p>

              <p>I am not too sure about the effectiveness of push-ups for pull-ups but personally I found it close to useless. Lats pulldown in the gym can help. However, for me, the most effective way was just to hang from the bar. Get used to your body weight and sooner or later you will be able to do your 1st pullup. The 2nd will follow soon. I used this method and went from 0 to 8 in 3 mths even though I have been stuck at 0 for 4 yrs before that.</p>
              <p>As for 2.4, I ran about 3+ km? Get used to running more than 2.4km and 2.4km will seem relatively easier. As for timing, be realistic. Aim for a 11:00 to 11:15. 10:00 is close to gold timing itself so for you to aim for 10:00 is a very huge step. It represents a vision rather than a goal. 11:00 to 11:15 will be much more achievable and will net you a silver IPPT (around gold napfa standard) if you get the minimum requirements from other stations at your age grp (Cat X = &lt;25 yrs old).</p>
