              <p>I'm unsure how many ppl in a platoon now since my time it was 50 but now they have increased the number of beds. 4 sections makes up 1 platoon, 4 platoons makes up a coy thats correct.</p>
              <p>The training schedule is by company and they are carried out at company level for most but for some activities, it will be at platoon level and each platoon will rotate in their activities due to lack of facilities/equipment.</p>

              <p>OCS is strictly base on ur BMT performance and ur SIT test results. Once u enter a leadership BMT, u have as high a chance as everyone else there to go into SISPEC/OCS</p>

              <p>What i mean is that the people who are enlisted into a leadership batch have chances to go to SISPEC/OCS if they are willing to and have the ability to. It does not mean everyone who is in a leadership batch will surely go cos there are ppl like me who choose not to go to command sch and there are people who do not meet the requirements to qualify for command sch.</p>
              <p>Non-leadership batches generally have 0 or very very low chance of going command sch.</p>

              <p>U do not get to choose your enlistment and generally you will enlist with people of ur age group even if u finish ur studies etc before them. NS system requires that everyone leaves NS and can persue further education at the same age.</p>
              <p>PTP has been increased to 16/17 weeks now so there is no more 13 wks or 15 wks. The least u will get will be 16/17 wks if not longer since i dunno the full changes being implement yet.</p>

              <p>I doubt so. As i say, u have to enlist mostly with ur batch. Earliest would be JC batches who are 18/19 this yr so are u going to be 19 next yr?</p>
              <p>Regardless, i've near heard of anyone enlisting within 6 months. All the next few intakes should already be filled by those who done their medical checkup earlier in the year.</p>

              <p>Wanted to ask, does the upgrading of PES status affect when you get enlisted?</p>
              <p>Because I recently got reallocated from PES BP to PES B and I realized most of my classmates already received the enlistment letter.</p>
              <p>I reallocated about 2 days before my friends started receiving the letters. Some of the are enlisting as late as late April.</p>
              <p>So will I be enlisting with them, or will my enlistment be later (after late April)?</p>

              <p>Sometimes it does. I will assume u are going for the PTP batch. The Dec intake is full and the next intake is Apr which i am unsure whether its full or not. Chances are u will be allocated together with ur peers but even if you were to be delayed to the likely Aug batch, u can apply for a disruption if u are aiming for further education.</p>

              <p>U will be allowed to bookout on chinese new year but since u did not serve ur confinement, u will generally have ur confinement period as ur 2nd and 3rd week which means confinement starts when u return to camp from CNY.</p>
              <p>Going overseas requires you to apply for overseas leave. Since its only 1 week into your enlistment, it will depend on whether your coy clerk has the time to help you apply for overseas leave since NSFs are not allowed to leave the country without applying for overseas leave.</p>
