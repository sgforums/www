              <p>That is quite rare. The only case i know of that is someone who choose to go for PES A/B BMT after he completed PES C BMT was because he wanted to go command school so he went for BMT again and subsequently went on to SISPEC.</p>

              <p>Do not worry too much about it. There is a slim chance that you will have to go for re-BMT, but it is not very high.</p>

              <p>Yes u will go through everything that a normal PES C field camp has during your recourse just that it tends to be slacker and the specs generally treat recourse ppl better though thats subjective.</p>
              <p>1 company obviously cannot take 800+ people so sure to be split into a few different companies.</p>

              <p>Dec/Feb are confirm batches already but all subsequent batches are unknown. Mar would be a wierd date and it depends on each intake how many coys are going to be active, tekong might be very crowded if they have an intake in Mar when the Dec and Feb intakes are still on the island.</p>

              <p>C9L3 are required to be there but do they have to take part in any activties or do they just go out into the field and do nothing for the whole day and just return to company line at night?</p>

              <p>There is never stay in bunk in SAF. Any activity you are excused, you will be doing sai kang such as cleaning the drains, toilets, smoking area etc etc. There are also non physical base activities you have to attend if not you will simply fail ur BMT and have to recourse again later in ur service term.</p>
              <p>U will be issued with almost the same stuff as PES A/B except the gortex jacket which is 1 of the most expensive item army issues which is for PES A/B only.</p>
              <p>Enlistment dates for PES C is uncertain at the moment but unlikely to be ever before Feb-Apr since all the enlistment notice for that period all seems to have been sent out already. If you just got your PES means they will only start finding a slot for you now which should be in the middle of next year generally.</p>

              <p>Most people won't be recourse but there are a small number who does.</p>
              <p>However, if i didn't recall wrongly, your excuse is 6 months temp so you might be sent for PES A/B BMT if your enlistment date is after May when your excuse expire. It will depend on how the clerks arranging enlistment decides about your PES.</p>
