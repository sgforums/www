              <p><br>LOL enjoy ur BMT son. especially in sch 2, especially in ninja coy (if you're SO lucky that is).</p>
              <p>actually BMT is nothing la.. the only tough activities are the longer route marches from 16km onwards.. field camp would be a breeze, live firing would be fun cos it'll be ur first time firing live rounds (unless you were in ncc and fired before), and you'll enjoy the most enjoyable time in ur whole ns life.. well at least it was for me.. stupid place i'm in now sucks to the core of the core. </p>

              <p>You won't be confined again and will be release normally on the night of 30th Apr. However you might have to 'pay back' his public holiday if there is insufficient time to complete all the training required and burn your later weekends.</p>

              <p>I understand the difference btwn the 2, but i would like to noe their diff in terms of the way they are being carried out? As one is parade, the other is ceremony. So just wanted to noe if they are carried out differently.</p>
              <p>I noe C2 and below nd not take ippt, but its just that this friend of mine has a mate who is also c2 and he did take ippt, so that is wad baffles me. Anyway, i believe in the saf directives, so its no nd take ippt.. maybe his case is rather unique? just wanna point out abt this.. tks.</p>

              <p>The parade is a school level thing where all the PES A/B guys will do a formal march in, march pass etc for their POP at the stadium. Parents will be invited to this parade.</p>
              <p>The ceremony is just a company level event which will be conducted normally somewhere near the company. I am unsure whether parents can attend this ceremony though since the only PES C BMT i saw was a reBMT which didn't have parents viewing.</p>

              <p>The parade is a school level thing where all the PES A/B guys will do a formal march in, march pass etc for their POP at the stadium. Parents will be invited to this parade.</p>
              <p>The ceremony is just a company level event which will be conducted normally somewhere near the company. I am unsure whether parents can attend this ceremony though since the only PES C BMT i saw was a reBMT which didn't have parents viewing.</p>

              <p>then one company gets to go home early one day (during my BMT days). everyone, including pes a/b guys, went whinning about why the particular coy got the privilege to go home earlier than the whole of BMTC.</p>
              <p>and POC is just nth much, laze around and wait to go home only.</p>

              <p><br>school 1 - 2 parts. one still in ladang but further from ferry terminal, the other way inside in rocky hill. school 1 usually book out on fridays, school 2 on sats, but as far as i know pegasus and leopard usually fight for fri bookouts.</p>
              <p>same day same school may not be same coy, cos other coys also have intakes. so if you want to know whether you have a higher chance of getting into the same coy as your friends, must be same reporting time too.</p>
