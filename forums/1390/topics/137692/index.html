This is to prepare them for combat service support vocations, such as service medic, and those related to logistics and administration such as supply assistants.<br><br>There's also a new 4-week BMT programme that will be conducted for PES E recruits, focusing on National Education, SAF core values, regimentation and discipline, as well as vocational training to prepare recruits for combat service support vocations.<br><br>Colonel Ng Wai Kit, assistant chief of general staff (training), SAF, said: "The latest changes to the BMT system begin with the introduction of the physical training phase to prepare our recruits who are less fit, and raise their fitness level to that which is comparable with their direct BMT peers."<br><br>There will be no change to the standard BMT for PES A/B recruits.<br><br>In the first phase of the review, the SAF looked at how recruits undergoing the 4-week Physical Training Phase (PTP) could be better prepared for BMT.<br><br>This resulted in the introduction of an 8-week PTP, which will raise PTP recruits' physical fitness to a level that is comparable to their direct-BMT peers.<br><br>The new PTP programme will begin in December 2009.</span><br></span></p>

Get a small ziplock for your notebook and your pen.<br><br>Shaver also, recommend manual shaver because you are not allowed to bring electrical shaver outfield.<br><br>Hangers and pegs, recommend the sturdy plastic ones, not the flimsy ones made of wire coil as the clothes can be quite heavy. If you forget to bring it, e-mart sells them. But e-mart breaks don't come often.<br><br>I will recommend solid soap than liquid soap, because it's easier and lighter to carry. Put it in a soap box labelled with your name.<br><br>Ziplock bags, get one roll of "extra large" from supermarkets, good for packing No 4's. Also get plenty of small and medium ones around the size of A5 paper. You'll find them very useful for your various barang-barang such as the "first-aid kit", packing your outfield stuff, etc.<br><br>Please don't use number padlocks or "turn-knob" locks as your buddy is supposed to hold one of your keys, lest you are not around and the instructors request access to your metal cabinet. Keep your keys with you, recommend that you put with your ID tags.<br><br>Also bring a large tin of Prickly Heat! You'll enjoy powder baths even in bunk. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Recommended optional item: Thirsty Hippo, plus those stuff which can make your metal cabinet smell nice. You definitely won't want to return to bunk and face a smelly cabinet.<br><br>from a passed-out recruit's point of view</div>
