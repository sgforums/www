              to be enlisted. i want to move back to singapore closer to my

              <p>Enlistment is usually 6months to a year after medical checkup IF you have gotten your PES status.</p>
              <p>The online portal cannot have been down for months since others have been successful in checking their status recently. If you are not using IE to access the page, try using IE since certain pages don't load well in firefox etc.</p>

              <p>Its unavailable to me as well but your enlistment should not be anytime before Apr since all of them have got their letters.</p>
              <p>Just ask your family or relatives whoever you put the mailing address as to help you check the mailbol for the letter or wait for the eservice to be working again.</p>

              <p>Its normal for everyone to enlist at least 6 months after medical checkup. For those who are overseas, they will mostly still do NS with peers of their batch and not before to ensure fairness.</p>
              <p>Currently the enlistment dates after Apr is unknown though i would expect the next to be late Jul or early Aug since the Apr batch won't leave tekong till late Jul. Until some enlistees come to update us, we can't confirm but just keep checking ns.sg and you will get it sooner or later.</p>

              <p>However personally i would prefer PTP cos its less packed compared to BMT and the training is slightly more progressive in terms of route marches compared to BMT where you have alot less time to get used to it before they increase the distance.</p>
              <p>Eg PTP can do 3-4 times a 4km route march to condition themselves before moving on to 6km etc but BMT will have at most 1-2 4km route march before going directly to 6km.</p>

              <p>There is the usual 2 wks confinement at the beginning and after that you can bookout on all weekends if there are no weekend trainings. Off will be given if there are weekend training such as field camp which will surely eat up 1 wkend.</p>
              <p>There will be no 2nd confinement during the BMT period so the PTP ppl will bookout while the BMT ppl are confined.</p>
