              <p>Shaver is issued but if u wanna used your own...bring it. As your cv, u need to bring it home on your 1st bookout, as for sleeping attire, you can wear whatever you feel comfortable and how many to bring is up to u.</p>

              <p>different coy got different way to start but I'm sure the 1st wk sure got IPPT becos they need to access your fitness as some of you after passing napfa slack very long some as long as 6-9 months, so fitness might not be there liao.</p>
              <p>With a open mind, you find it easier to pass the days, becos time for BMT is now shorter than before surely it'll be more rush. As for contact lenses, it's up to you last time my coy allow people to wear it for range, as it'll not fog up in range. But be prepared to wear it for a long period, if u cannot wear for a long period like 12-16 hours then don't wear. No one is going to laugh at your glasses.....</p>

              <p>Not true that the weekend will be slackier than the weekday for the 1st 2 weeks. It depends on how your company plans the training schedule. </p>
              <p>Will suggest you don't wear contact lens at all for the entire BMT. First day, yes, people wearing contact lens in is not that uncommon. After first day, don't wear it anymore, because you are expected to train for hours straight, and you will not have time to take them out and clean, which in turn may lead to infection and such.</p>

              <p>Hi guys. I'm enlisting to tekong bmtc school 3 on 5th march. i have to do 8 weeks ptp followed by 9 weeks bmt. i come from a private school(Asia pacific school of sports and business) i did not take my napfa then. i took it one week ago.passed everything except chin ups. i've been trying my best to train for my chin ups in 1 week but i still dont feel much confidence that i can do 5 in 1 week. cause i'm going to retake my napfa again tomorrow. I've also been searching online for tips given by ppl. and quite a number said that those who go for ptp have a better advantage then those who just take bmt...?? so</p>
              <p>1) is it true that those who go for ptp have a higher advantage in bmt then those who just come in and take bmt?</p>
              <p>2)do i have to shave my head before going for ptp and shave again when bmt comes?</p>
              <p>3) do i have to be in camp for 2 weeks confinement before i can book out during ptp other every weekends after the 2 weeks?</p>
              <p>4)is it true that during ptp, there will be napfa tests and if we pass the one of the test during the 8 weeks, the ptp will be cut short and we can come out then wait to go back into army for bmt??

              <p>Hi guys. I'm enlisting to tekong bmtc school 3 on 5th march. i have to do 8 weeks ptp followed by 9 weeks bmt. i come from a private school(Asia pacific school of sports and business) i did not take my napfa then. i took it one week ago.passed everything except chin ups. i've been trying my best to train for my chin ups in 1 week but i still dont feel much confidence that i can do 5 in 1 week. cause i'm going to retake my napfa again tomorrow. I've also been searching online for tips given by ppl. and quite a number said that those who go for ptp have a better advantage then those who just take bmt...?? so</p>
              <p>1) is it true that those who go for ptp have a higher advantage in bmt then those who just come in and take bmt?</p>
              <p>2)do i have to shave my head before going for ptp and shave again when bmt comes?</p>
              <p>3) do i have to be in camp for 2 weeks confinement before i can book out during ptp other every weekends after the 2 weeks?</p>

              <p><br>1) faster adaptation since arrive there 1st.</p>
              <p>2) even if shaved already, go in still need to pay the barber $2 or $4 then can walk away.</p>
              <p>3) of course must be in camp for 2 weeks straight, like that then called confinement what.</p>
              <p>4) PTP will have IPPT trials, but that "pass liao go home rest" period is your father's time rule, now no more already. so pass liao, good, they ask u to train more and aim for silver or gold.</p>
