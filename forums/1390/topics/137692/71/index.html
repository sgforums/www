              <p>By the way, i found a schoolmate who's in PES A and failed NAPFA
              who's going to tekong in march while there's another schoolmate
              who's in PES A and passed NAPFA going to tekong in april.</p>
              <p>Won't Tekong be too crowded seeing that the december/february
              batch won't be out by then? Or are the new schools big enough to
              hold the extra number?</p>
              <p>In April, it appears that all the(PES A/B) A levels students
              plus some poly and ite students will be in Tekong.</p>

              <p>Its currently unsure how tekong is planning their intakes and how big are each intakes to determine whether tekong will be overcrowded but the schedule is pretty messy as it it now since the confirmed 1st intakes are Dec and Feb which will allow both to POP in Apr while there is a direct BMT intake in Apr but you mention a PTP intake in Mar which will lead to a difference in POP date unless the Mar intake is early Mar since the Apr intake was late Apr if i didn't recall wrongly.</p>
              <p>However, it seems there will be a decent number of overlap in the coming years and we have yet to understand how all the intakes are going to be planned as of now.</p>

              <p>In that past this is the case but with the new increase in PTP duration as well as PES C/E BMT durations, there will surely be more overlaps across the intakes and not the 'neat' quarterly pattern we are all used to.</p>

              <p>There should be more overlaps since in the past, the PTP and BMT batches do not overlap themselves that much since each batch POPs before the next comes in but there are more overlaps with the new 4 months PTP. Mild obese and obese batches are significantly smaller than the usual PES A/B batches so their effect is more minimal compared to the additional 1 month PTP.</p>
              <p>Comparing the obese and mild obese, there is only 1 obese company generally while there are many more mild obese companies so increasing the duration of mild obese batch is in a way making more people stay on the island than less.</p>
              <p>Lastly, the PES C/E BMTs duration were also increased so there is likely to be more people on tekong at the same time compared to the past where most come in and go at roughly the same period but now it seems POP is relatively staggered with already 4 known intakes for PES A/B in Dec, Feb, Mar, Apr.</p>

              <p>Its best for you to just report on the 12th and see what happens. Either you enlist or you get sent back home and wait for a new enlistment date. That is safer than to miss your enlistment and be charged for AWOL.</p>

              <p>Its always better to be safe than sorry. Because the status change is rather late, alot of information at the enlistment side might not be updated fast enough to reflect your status and give you another enlistment date.</p>
              <p>Sai kang in tekong is not that bad so no harm just 'working' there since its more slack compared to most of the sai kang you need do in unit later.</p>

              <p>Hi jkxjie,</p>
              <p>To add on to what dkcx has kindly stated, you are allowed to bring non-camera handphones with you to Pulau Tekong, but you are not allowed to bring handphone chargers with you.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>That is how the army works. After your enlistment you will see more of the inefficiency and how slow they are at doing certain stuff. 2 weeks is definitely too short if you expect them to update everything so i'm not surprised.</p>
              <p>At least be glad that you went if not they could sent MPs to your place and charge you for AWOL. That letter might save you the DB but going down is alot less troublesome than being considered an AWOLer.</p>
