Any tips or advise?<br><br>Also, any tips on how to [b]avoid misfiring </strong>the gun during range? My friend is worried about misfiring ever since his buddy misfired the gun during range. Apparently, the gun fired off by itself even though his buddy didnt pull the trigger.[/b]</blockquote>For SIT test, you will be given a total of 12 missions split over 2 days, normally will just take over half a day to complete. Everyone will get a chance to be the IC and 2IC, some more than once depending on the number of people. Besides that, everyone in the detail will be assigned a different appointment ranging from signaller, navigator, minesweeper, demo, medic, SAW and i think 1 last 1 i forgot what and certain missions will require the 'speciality' of certain appointments to help solve as there will be some basic training before everything starts. (In my opinion signaller slackest cos i was 1 :p)<br><br>They will use your performance as a leader and how well you work in the group to gauge your performance and determine whether you are suited for command sch such as OCS and SISPEC.<br><br>Its actually quite fun compared to field camp.<br><br>To prevent misfire, keep the gun in safe mode loh once it has been cock, if weapon not cock then it can still fire it would be the small arms technician problem liao. Misfire at range is very serious since in range you are issued live rounds, i only misfired during field camp but that was blanks due to a very very stupid mistake...</div>

However, it might be good to just go through the whole 12km as your next route march will be 16km and soon after the 24km already so not much chance for you to get used to the long distance.</div>

If you lag too behind in your training, you will end up doing your 12km when people doing 16 and your 16 when everyone else doing their 24. This might seem like you can skip 24km but there are some coys like mine who AFTER the recruits POP, call those who never finish 24km to come back and clear it together with some other required stuff which i forgot. Its better to clear 24km with your buddies than do it later with less friends around.</div>

What if you had a foot problem and you missed your 16km and 24km? Does the CSM have the power to demand you come back and finish your route march? Btw, which coy were you from?</div>
