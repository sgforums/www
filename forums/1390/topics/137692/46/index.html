              <p>hello, i was prescribed xanax to take by my psychiatrist after my medical and psyc check up (which i got assigned c1l3 for), so the saf doesn't know that i'm on medication now. i'm enlisting into bmt soon and i was wondering if i have to declare it/if i will be able to take it during bmt as it causes drowsiness. thanks!</p>

              <p>Yes,please do declare it.</p>
              <p><br>Bring a memo from the doctor who prescribed you your medicine along with your medicine on your first day.</p>
              <p>Your PC will conduct an interview on the very first day of your enlistment...or at least the next day to find out about your current condition.When you go for it,please sound out your medical condition and your need for the medication.Emphasize to your PC that the medication will cause drowsiness.</p>
              <p>They will most probably ask you to bring along your memo and medicine to the medical centre for the MO to see.From there,the MO will advise your commanders as to how best to go about it.</p>

              <p><br>If there is still some time before you enlist,say about a month or so,try calling up MCC @CMPB at 63731340/1341 to inform them about your medication and ask them directly if you can bring along your medication or what's the procedure you need to go through.</p>
              <p>If you do not have time to contact them,then get your psychiatrist to write a memo about your current condition and the need for your medication.Tell him/her that it's for the army and they will understand.</p>
              <p>I recommend contacting CMPB since they already graded you based on your condition.Keep your psychiatrist's contact details on hand when you call them as they might ask you for it so that they can refer to him/her about your condition if they need to.</p>
              <p>Remember to sound out about your medication during your first day of BMT too even if you were given the all clear to bring along your medicine before that.</p>

              <p>Eating time is definitely enough. You wouldn't want to eat alot anyway, bcos u wan to lose weight, u will tell the auntie to give less rice. Bathing time for my case was anytime. When you got free time, u can bath all u want. Afternoon when u come back from lunch u can bath also.</p>
              <p>Anyway, regarding the bathing shyness part, dun worry. People there will be more concerned with quickly getting washed up and go do their own things (play psp, talk on phone) than actually looking at u.</p>

              <p>The purpose of this forum is to help pre-enlistees so don't hesitate to clear your doubts. Most of the time people will still answer unless its the type of question that we see being asked all the time and the TS is lazy to search. </p>
              <p>I would say most people feel some sort of pressure going into NS, some more some less but we sort of still managed to pass through our NSF life. If you have problems while in tekong, make appointments with the OO or your PC and talk to them and hopefully they can find some way to offer u advice or assistance. Commiting suicide is a stupid thing to do so don't ever consider it again. </p>
