            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps the punishment has a reason behind it. In fact, it does. One has to learn to be <strong>reponsible</strong> of their own actions or wrong-doings. Nevermind if further punishments falls on the 'culprit'. Yi Ren Juo Shi Yi Ren Dang.</div>

When we sent arms back that time one of us accidentally dropped his rifle.<br><br>Just then our PC walked past n asked who the one. No one dare to admit for fear of confinement. So being angry he asked the whole platoon to change to smart four with boots polished in 2 min.<br><br>When we gathered down, I tink exceeded 2 min so he punished half of the platoon to hold in push up position n the other half in kneeling position with rifle over head.<br><br>After half n hour he then order all of us to do 40 pushups( with many start from zero) and then recover us.<br><br>Most of our push ups were done on the carpark, where the gravel and stones ate into your skin, under the hot afternoon sun. My palms were burnt, red and bruised from the countless pushups we had to do..<br><br>Wat r your views?<br><br>haiz.. 3 more hours to booking in!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </div></blockquote>By todays standards, which are getting more and more like a chalet .. it can be considered ill- treatment. Hell, according to the book vulgarity is considered ill treatment.<br><br>What u went thru is just a basic military routine punishment. A simple do it then and carry on kinda thing. The guy didnt ask u all to confine or something right.<br><br>U are in the army, u have to endure certain things to ensure the quality of the training and the trainees are still there. The fact is, the dickhead who drop the weapon shoudl have owned up, he didnt so all kenna ... thats life in the greens.<br><br>Just my views.</div>

The guy knew he did wrong, then just own up la. Sixth core value leh hello, 'ETHICS' (Am I right?).. (Like what I did during my field camp cause some asses threw their MREs away to lighten the load, then the coy got knocked down. Then I just began saying 'eh have integrity leh'. Before I knew it, everyone was saying also, and hence, the guilty ones had no choice but to own up cause everyone knew who they were..) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heh, we kenaed a similar situation also.  Some pricks from the other "younger" platoons threw away the food and was found.  That day itself, our platoon was already wacked upside down left right centre liao, we were super shagged out at the end of the day.  We knew what was coming if no one owned up.<br><br>A few of us decided that we had to do something abt it.  So we decided to take the blame for the throwing away.  So instead of the whole platoon, and coy kena all the nonsense, it was just us that kenaed "extra" guard duty for the night.  It wasn't that bad spending the night talking cock with my friends.  We vowed that we would not go to any command school after seeing how cock up the "instructors" were.  True enuff, the few of us got posted up to various units as men. Heh.</div>
