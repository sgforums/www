              <p>go for the officer level if u are born fit for most people they can hardly run and get a bronze even.</p>
              <p>ippt?its a series of physical fitness tests of</p>
              <p>1)situps2)shuttlerun3)chinups4)standing broad jump5)2.4km run</p>
              <p>officers are expected to have better grades than the other non officer ranks.</p>
              <p>the tests all have timing and with grades awarded to each station.expected to take it every year and pass them.</p>
              <p>the above is only part of it.u would still need to deal with company politics if they liked u or not ,work loads,yearly appraisals by management of your daily work etc etc.plus the posting might be far from where u stay.some even reported more than 1 hr ride by bus to work daily and another &gt;1hr ride back home.so if u are lucky u might get a 20 min trip just to work.</p>
              <p>i suppose they could promote u to other departments  in spore other than in some mp unit in years to come  if u are an officer.</p>

              <p>After reading all the posts, I realised that you all never tell mercury94 what does a milltary police (MP) do? </p>
              <p>MPs are those that wear the white helmets and throw the rifles around during NDP. They are more of performers rather than soliders. They spend most of their time doing drills. </p>
              <p>There is a height required to be an MP.I dont think they accept female.</p>
              <p>They do mainly security guard job. Just look for the blue uncle outside your school. The difference is they wear the green uniform instead.</p>
              <p>The MP-dog unit is very small. Most of them do security guards.</p>

              <p>I knew a female SSG who was an MP. And she was shorter than me. And I'm only 1.7m tall, which is already not very tall. She couldn't have been more than 1.6m, tops.</p>
              <p>Mercury94: what I can say is this. All the people in here have given you a rough idea of what to expect should you sign on. </p>
              <p>You need to be physically fit, but more importantly, your mental fitness must be there. It doesn't matter if you are GI Jane if your mind does not belong in the Army.</p>
              <p>Someone has to do guard duty or man the phone in the company office at all times. If weekend/public holiday duties give you pause, then forget about signing on. </p>
              <p>And finally, stop and think about your reasons for joining the Army. If the top two reasons are 'job security' and 'good money', please forget about joining it.</p>

              <p>I think you got no idea what is an MP.</p>
              <p>throw rifle those are precision drill team, security job? those mostly are RP, and those that require MP to do security are those sensitive areas.</p>
              <p>SIB is alo under MP. Kranji Detention barrack is also mann by MP.</p>
              <p>MP also sometime have to go for excercise. Div level deployment sometime have a platoon of MP attached.</p>

              <p>hmmmm.......WELL..IMPROVISE MAN!doesnt matter if u are a civilian or regular!if u think its too heavy then make one trolley for her and end of story.put in wits suggestion to enhance soldier effectiveness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and for your issue on their pay....u might as well tell the generals that they are paid too much and any manager in any MNC can do their job cheaper,faster  n better.true the pay in civilian industries stinks n one cant survive muchg with civilian pay because many people frpm overseas ruined it.,,,i understand your feelings on why a captain should be paid so much when she cant do a mans job.but if u paused for a long time,u will understand its not her fault that her pay is high.would u have carried her load for her and not a him...if her pay was reduced to civilian pay?in war.....things get pretty confused and to win battles...everyone must help one another out and not create problems .im sure u or we deserve a high civilian pay but the captain female is not to be blamed for your pay.and she is also not responsible for the follies of miniosters bad decisions on our civilian salary in spore .</p>
              <p>from time to time,i come across this but i dont think of the salary thing.life sucks because some manpower minister screwed up and she isnt the manpower minsitrer thats responsible for low civilian salary.</p>

              <p>how to carry 100kg weight and an entire campsite material for 2 platoon strength ina swamp land or up hill?i did all those as a boy scout.the worse would be the 240 tents thats 120kg up a muddy wet hill on a 45 degree slope that stretches up 4 storeys.</p>
              <p>it hurts.thats why when i was a lil kid ,i swear i dont want to use manual methods but use simple devioces.im sure theres lots of  rugged all terrain gizmo for that job.if they dont have.....invent one n make $$$$.not that hard as i think of it $_$.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>doing a manual method is good once a while but doing it in battle means u would be too tired to throw a grenade,fire and radio hq while lugging a 120kg weight and trying to stand up all at same time.people who did that in battles often dont come back.thats why u need to improvise things like macguyver and survive in the end.dont do old fashioned methods....they wont work much in this high tech world of today.</p>

              <p>I think you got no idea what is an MP.</p>
              <p>throw rifle those are precision drill team, security job? those

              <p>SIB is alo under MP. Kranji Detention barrack is also mann by

              <p>MP also sometime have to go for excercise. Div level deployment
                  sometime have a platoon of MP attached.</p>

              <p>Yes. You are right then. I thought that MP and RP are simliar. Regardless, they still do security jobs and perform drills. It just show that people dont really take note of them. </p>

              <p>The point is, if TS want to sign on, making a career out of it, please do something significant. </p>
              <p>Or else, sign on as DXO or ME. DXO basically do adminstration work. ME mainly technical jobs. These skills are more transferable to the society when TS wants to leave the military 10 years later.</p>

              <p>Dog lover?..............never heard of dog Major level.</p>
              <p>A technical unit would be good. Admin as well. But if you think its is not for life then you should be prepared to take on civilian life and to do that you need professional certification like a degree minimum. If you got O level only...vocation very limited. If post to infantry....finito..ROD ten years later maybe can do security job. If hve A level...then can take PT study but very hard as SAF is 24 hrs on call so you may skip class and may miss exam if time clash with SAF duties coz SAF is always priority. Young ppl much regret signing off esp when they have brains to do something better. For a gal, better first get a basic dip then join SAF to get some practice eg if you do a 2 yr simple dip in per mgmt then you sign 10 years then you may ask for related job, that way you are trained before sign on and possible will like your job better and can get back to civilian life easier. I dun know how gal adjusting to civilian life after ROD. Maybe easier. But many guys officer after ROD cannot adj to civilian life and got into a mess coz civlilian life is about commercial and professional skills to get ahead beyond a manager. I know of many SAF techi non-officer, who have no prob after ROD. Even those atheletic type get into prob after ROD coz commercial / professional life entirely different perspective.</p>
