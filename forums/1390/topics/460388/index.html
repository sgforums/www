              <p><br>Job security? now a days from what i know, this may not be true.</p>
              <p>From what i gather previously from regular, by certain yrs in there, you dont make certain grade. They wont renew your contract when expiring. That why those regular i know, volunteer to go peace keeping force.</p>
              <p>MP and work with dogs, not sure will this help, my fren previously from that unit. Never heard him say there is female in his unit. Maybe thgs have change now.</p>
              <p>But be mindful those dogs is different from what you have..</p>
              <p>one of the training is you will suit up with padding and let the giant firece dogs attack you on purpose.. one fine dog during normal routine, my fren was attack by his dog, it takes 4 men to make his dog release his bite.. My fren arm whole flesh was bitten off.. he was hospitalise for 3 weeks..</p>

              <p>If your primary motivation is 'job security', or 'good pay', or something to that effect, I would advise you against signing on.</p>
              <p>No, seriously. Those are the exact reasons all those jaded regulars had when they signed on. The only ones who actually enjoyed being in the SAF are those who have <em>'I seriously, really, do enjoy being in the SAF' </em>as the first reason.</p>

              <p>If you have no real love for the military, then it's a bad idea.</p>
              <p>You can't just quit if you become sick and tired of it. To do that, you have to pay a huge penalty.</p>
              <p>No amount of money or job security can make up for the fact that you hate your job. Which is why I say the pay and job security should not be at the top of your priorities.</p>

              <p><br>dont be mistaken.. is not a bad idea.Personally i regretted previously as i was offer 2 contract for different vocation when I was about ORD. I rejected the offer due to certain reason.....</p>
              <p>Is a good idea if you like military life, as ONLY with passion in military the shits that you will face that need to get you promoted seems worth while. other wise time inside will be difficult.</p>
              <p>If your motivation is job security and and handle dogs.. then you shouldnt.</p>
              <p>1) previously i got to know a batch of female soldier.. They sign on indcating preference in navy. after BMT etc.. they were told navy dont require manpower at that time, and they given 2 choices, either air force tech or army artillery.</p>
              <p>2) those dogs in the military is not meant to be play with or pampered.. you like dogs, i think trained to be a pet groomer will be a better choice.</p>
              <p>Find out more before you sign on... Or even maybe as a police K9 unit will be another choice, at least they wont throw you in combat and see trees almost everyday</p>
              <p>You still a police even you wont get into K9</p>

              <p>times have changed!for mp job it might be good for short term...after that end up as security guard if they decide not to renew your contract because u have ippt problems every year and not gold standard or silver or cant pass it every year.</p>
              <p>if u want a job,make sure the job is soimething that cant be taiught instantly but neeeds years of experience.</p>
              <p>handling alsatian dogs?they have ns conscripts 2 years for that job but then they have trainers fer that.anyway the army didnt get people to handle dogs alone as that is secondary.primary task is to do the real mp job such as arresting people and discpline them.for that task,they have 2 years ns conscripts who can do that job equally well.then that would lead to some difficulty in renewing your contract as performance might not be good and depends on how good u are at polishing the apple n werking yer ticket even though theres no future.</p>
              <p>have u tried the airforce or navy?they have jobs that 2 years ns conscripts cant do due to the amount of years needed to absorb knowledge.anything that a conscript can do and are doing now,,best not to sign up for that job such as cooks,police,guard,storeman,..unless they guaranteee u another contract to continue after the first contract etc etc.</p>

              <p>Why bad idea?</p>
              <p>The contract.</p>
              <p>The contract signifies a commitment to SAF, hence the "easy to come in, hard to get out". Hence if you really love SAF and the military lifestyle then I would also recommend against sign on.</p>
              <p>Besides, I believe one of the forumers have said it, it depends on manpower requirements, although you might indicate your preference for K9, if there is already sufficient manpower there already and you already sign that piece of paper, you really have no choice if they decide to send you to infantry.</p>
              <p>Then you tell me, you are stuck in a contract, that you can only get out if you pay a penalty, in a job that you did not originally sign up for, and get stuck for the next 10 years or so.....so you tell me, will you get jaded?</p>
              <p>Meanwhile...after 10 years, your friends who did not sign on, get a job in a pet industry, have 10 years of experience, have a wonderful 10 years working with animals and you finally can get out of the SAF with zero working experience outside, zero experience working with animals, zero prospect of getting a job in the pet industry because of your age, etc.</p>
              <p>I am not pouring cold water at you but sometimes cannot just think of job security, etc must also think of 10, 20 years in advance of where you see yourself, if you see yourself as a pet professional in 10-20 years time then SAF is not really a good idea.</p>

              <p>actually looking at labour market.</p>
              <p>SAF salary scale is only one thats sufficient to foot a developed world status but the down side is the skill might not be relavent especially if get sent to MP.if thread starter worked in a MNC,salary wont be that high especially for o levels or A levels.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what they neveer tell yiu is that before each contract ends,,there might be a quota to select people to stay.that is if your section has  10 people and the quota from higher management only allows 6 people for some reasons.....then those unlucky people wont be able to get another contract.kind of like the survivor series only in real time and career.dont know if they still have this type of system.</p>

              <p><br>everything sounds good.even in  say  japan airlines..they will tell u their airlines good this and that...where got tell u their supply lines got problem or company running out of funds.</p>
              <p>for $$$$$ wise..SAF is a safe bet because whatever they are slave drivers or dictators..they are the biggest payers so far and most civilian companies cant pay that much.</p>
              <p>but i have never heard of burning  weekends unless its out to catch soldiers booking back into camps and capturing them from poor uniform etc etc.sounds like a prefect job but desling with soldiers and u arent allowed to carry arms.</p>
              <p>i have seen often that mps in 3 escorting a skinny guy to changi hospital.if that grabs u then i cant say whats good for u or not.</p>
              <p>well...whay matters is u get a job that u love and cross your fingers that there arent any comoany politics in your future unit as that will also eventually drive or had driven most of the regulars out despite the great pay!</p>

              <p>but go check again all those scary stuff with recruiters.they might have stopped practice years ago perhaps.</p>
              <p>best is sign on as an officer(start from LTA rank) the uniform is smarter and comes with an expensive looking gold buckle  and gold metal rank on your uniform even and it has more powers given if you are very atheletic.</p>
