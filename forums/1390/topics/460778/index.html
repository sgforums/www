              <p><br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Types of Basic
              Military Training</strong></span></p>
              <p><br> <strong>PES A/B1 BMT</strong><br> This 9-week programme trains combat-fit recruits in the basic
              military skills to prepare them for advanced vocational training.
              The programme includes weapon training with the SAR 21 rifle which
              will teach recruits technical handling and marksmanship skills; a
              Battle Inoculation Course that simulates a real battlefield; a
              Field Camp which develops basic survival skills; progressive
              training to complete a 24-km route march which builds combat
              fitness and endurance; and hand grenade training.<br> <em>For those who fail to achieve the NAPFA test silver award, they
              are required to undergo an 8-week Physical Training Phase (PTP)
              prior to the PES A/B1 BMT.</em><br>  <br> <strong>PES BP BMT</strong><br> As evidence has shown that obese recruits are able to achieve
              optimum fitness levels and weight loss in about 19 weeks, the new
              BMT programme for recruits with Body Mass Index (BMI) scores
              exceeding 27.0 will be 19 weeks. This BMT programme is designed to
              help obese recruits improve their physical fitness progressively
              while equipping them with basic soldiering skills and
              knowledge.</p>
              <p><br> <strong>PES B2 BMT</strong><br> Enlistees who were PES C1 previously underwent a 7-week BMT
              programme. The new 9-week PES B2 BMT programme will be conducted
              for recruits who are medically fit for deployment in selected
              combat and combat support vocations, such as signal operators,
              combat medics and naval system operators. These recruits will be
              given a new medical classification of PES B2, in place of the
              existing PES C1 classification. This is to ensure that the medical
              classification of our soldiers is consistent with their deployment.
              The new 9-week programme will include customised physical training,
              as well as basic combat training to prepare them for their combat
              and combat support roles.<br>  <br> <strong>PES C BMT</strong><br> The 9-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES C recruits. This
              programme will include light physical training and vocational
              training to prepare them for combat service support vocations, such
              as service medic, and those related to logistics and
              administration.<br>  <br> <strong>PES E BMT</strong><br> The 4-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES E recruits. This
              programme will focus on, vocational training as well as National
              Education, SAF core values, regimentation and discipline to prepare
              recruits for combat service support vocations.</p>

              <p>Hello, fellow PES E soldier here:D</p>
              <p>1) Don't have to bring anything. Just your IC will do. Everything will be issued on the 1st day.</p>
              <p><br>2)You'll have zero stay-in throughout your BMT phase. No civilian clothes needed (except the one you're wearing on the 1st day). Every day book out!</p>
              <p><br>3)You'll have to shave, as per the other BMT recruits in Tekong. But we only have to shave once in our entire NS life, so no worries!</p>
              <p><br>4) You'll get to book out every day, like I said. Even on the enlistment day itself. You'll book out around 6-7ish every day, depending whether there's delay or not. Earliest I booked out during my BMT was 5+? Latest was around 7+.</p>
              <p>You'll have nothing to worry about for your PES E BMT. Have fun for the next 2 years! </p>

              <p><span>From 1 Sep 2012, camera mobile phones will be permitted in
              designated areas within 14 Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) camps as
              part of a pilot security zoning programme.</span></p>
              <p>Selected for the high volume of Operationally-Ready National
              Servicemen (NSmen) and full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) who
              pass through for training or administration, these include camps
              that house fitness conditioning centres, training institutes, the
              Central Manpower Base and Basic Military Training Centre.</p>
              <p>Areas in camps where camera mobile phones are allowed are termed
              Green Zones, though the existing security stance on photography
              remains the same. Unless authorised by unit commanders for special
              events such as open houses, graduation parades and cohesion
              activities, photography is prohibited. Examples of Green Zones
              include medical centres, accommodation bunks and cookhouses.</p>
              <p>Within the Red Zones, which are areas where sensitive and
              classified information is present, camera mobile phones are not
              allowed. Before entering a Red Zone, camera mobile phones must be
              deposited in lockers. Examples of Red Zones include units'
              operation rooms and offices with computer access to classified
              information.</p>
              <p>The pilot programme was implemented for the convenience of
              servicemen, and because of the proliferation of smart phones,
              according to Chief of Staff-General Staff Brigadier-General Tung
              Yui Fai, who announced this initiative at the Infantry Training
              Institute (ITI) on 31 Aug.</p>
              <p>He added: "This security zoning allows us to better secure areas
              we think we need to protect better. At the same time, it allows
              flexibility and convenience for our servicemen who operate within
              the camp."</p>
              <p>Enhanced security measures will be in place at the Red Zones.
              Where practical, a perimeter fence will be erected to demarcate the
              Red from the Green Zones; clear signboards will be prominently
              displayed at the entrance of a Red Zone, and digital locks and
              close-circuit cameras will be installed for added security.</p>
              <p>Only camera mobile phones are allowed in this pilot programme,
              which will last for six to nine months before a review is
              conducted. Tablets such as iPads, laptops and digital cameras are
              still prohibited.</p>
              <p>For NSman 3rd Sergeant (3SG) (NS) Lavin Achudan, a
              marketing manager with Johnson &amp; Johnson who uses an iPhone 4S
              to access his work emails, being able to bring his camera phone
              into camp eases his workload. Previously, he would borrow his
              brother’s basic NOKIA phone when he had to go for his In-Camp
              Training.</p>
              <p>"As a marketing manager, I have to constantly reply to emails
              from my sales team and customers, and replying emails in the
              shortest time possible is my highest priority. Allowing me to bring
              my iPhone to camp allows me to communicate with my customers
              efficiently, and that is very important to me," said the platoon
              sergeant of 731st Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment.
               </p>
              <p>"When I am not training, I can reply to these emails
              immediately, as opposed to having to wait till I book out at night
              to reply to emails. It allows me to reply whenever I have time...
              It's about the convenience of being able to bring in a phone which
              I always use, which happens to have a camera," added the
              28-year-old.</p>
              <p>Echoing this sentiment is 20-year-old NSF 2nd Lieutenant
              (2LT) Kok Chun Hou, who is a curriculum coordinator at ITI. He
              uses a basic NOKIA phone in camp and an iPhone 3GS outside of
              camp.</p>
              <p>Citing some inconveniences of using two phones, such as having
              to input contacts into both phones, 2LT Kok said: "This current NSF
              generation grew up in the IT age; it's our habit to stay connected.
              We live, work and play differently from previous generations, so
              connectivity is very important to us."</p>
              <p>"I would also use my smart phone for personal banking and
              stock-investing. With the implementation of the pilot scheme, I now
              have the option of just stepping out of the office to use my smart
              phone," he said.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>==============================================================</strong></em></span></p>

              programme, these 14 camps will be segregated into two distinct

              <p>Hi there,</p>
              <p>I would like to know whether if I am PES C, E or F? </p>
              <p>I am currently diagnosed with 3 heart conditions which are a Heart Murmur, Valve Leakage/Back Flow and Irregular Heat beats and I have a learning disability with is kind of severe which is Dyslexia. I sometimes see words opposite and the letters get mixed up sometimes or when I am nervous. I am failed NAPFA tests and a Australia Military Physical Standards Test. I fainted from a black out 2 times and a white out 1 time due to (lack of oxygen, cold sweat, can't see and shortness of breath). How do I prove to the SAF Medical board that I have these conditions, do I see a private and gov doctor to write a detailed report stating that I am unfit for national service due to list of reasons....</p>
              <p>I have seen the DAS (Dyslexia Association of Singapore) for testing and observations and I have got a report but states that I am able to work beyond my capabilities despite of the conditon. </p>
              <p>What do I do???</p>
              <p>Thanks,</p>

              <p>No, u are wrong merkava4. there is a few vocations available for Pes E, Security Trooper, Clerk, Storeman, Medic and Hr Assistant at mindef. Pes E security troopers are those that have baton tied on their waist with a belt. they don't carry firearms. For Pes E Security Trooper its considered as (Service Side) while not on the (Combat Side).</p>

              <p><br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Types of Basic
              Military Training</strong></span></p>
              <p><br> <strong>PES A/B1 BMT</strong><br> This 9-week programme trains combat-fit recruits in the basic
              military skills to prepare them for advanced vocational training.
              The programme includes weapon training with the SAR 21 rifle which
              will teach recruits technical handling and marksmanship skills; a
              Battle Inoculation Course that simulates a real battlefield; a
              Field Camp which develops basic survival skills; progressive
              training to complete a 24-km route march which builds combat
              fitness and endurance; and hand grenade training.<br> <em>For those who fail to achieve the NAPFA test silver award, they
              are required to undergo an 8-week Physical Training Phase (PTP)
              prior to the PES A/B1 BMT.</em><br>  <br> <strong>PES BP BMT</strong><br> As evidence has shown that obese recruits are able to achieve
              optimum fitness levels and weight loss in about 19 weeks, the new
              BMT programme for recruits with Body Mass Index (BMI) scores
              exceeding 27.0 will be 19 weeks. This BMT programme is designed to
              help obese recruits improve their physical fitness progressively
              while equipping them with basic soldiering skills and
              knowledge.</p>
              <p><br> <strong>PES B2 BMT</strong><br> Enlistees who were PES C1 previously underwent a 7-week BMT
              programme. The new 9-week PES B2 BMT programme will be conducted
              for recruits who are medically fit for deployment in selected
              combat and combat support vocations, such as signal operators,
              combat medics and naval system operators. These recruits will be
              given a new medical classification of PES B2, in place of the
              existing PES C1 classification. This is to ensure that the medical
              classification of our soldiers is consistent with their deployment.
              The new 9-week programme will include customised physical training,
              as well as basic combat training to prepare them for their combat
              and combat support roles.<br>  <br> <strong>PES C BMT</strong><br> The 9-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES C recruits. This
              programme will include light physical training and vocational
              training to prepare them for combat service support vocations, such
              as service medic, and those related to logistics and
              administration.<br>  <br> <strong>PES E BMT</strong><br> The 4-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES E recruits. This
              programme will focus on, vocational training as well as National
              Education, SAF core values, regimentation and discipline to prepare
              recruits for combat service support vocations.</p>
