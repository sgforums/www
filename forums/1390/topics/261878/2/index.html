There are different panels that we have to connect and then let the heavy vehicle launch it across the river. Each panel weighs at least 200kg, and needs at least four men to carry. I do not know how many panels there are in an average bridge, but I reckon there are at least 30.  And not to mention the heavy decks that we have to place on the bridge manually. That is also damn exhaustive, needs good stamina. It takes upwards of 2 - 4 hours to build and about 3 hours to dismantle.<br><br>There are tons more horror stories I can tell you about life in 30SCE but as you can see, your life in 30 is so much better than mine.

The first thing we kena when we get there is confiscate handphone (no HP during whole of training phase). Every time knock it down is 50 rather than 20.
