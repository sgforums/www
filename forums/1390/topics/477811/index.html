              <p>Dear All,</p>
              <p>First and foremost, I'm a 2nd Gen PR going to serve NS in 2015 after my GCE A Level. Grown up in Singapore since I am 9. I truly consider Singapore, this is home truly where I know I must be since all my friends and loved ones are here. But my mother is still on Dependant’s Pass though, so somehow or rather perhaps it might be a factor in my NS posting, right?</p>
              <p>I'm also thankful for the education and opportunities Singapore have given me for I am willing and love to serve the country for nation building. Growing up to train up such as jog regularly in hope of 
                  increasing my qualifying critieria to get into the best NS vocation I can get. Really training hard to
                   get &lt; 9 minutes for 2.4km. But hearing that PRs cannot enter sensitive vocations. Just need to know so that I don't need to keep my hopes up.</p>
              <p>1) PRs usually cannot enter any sensitive NS units/ vocations due to military security clearance/ background screenings such as CDO/ NDU/ some other sensitive vocations...etc.</p>
              <p>2) We, the citizens of Singapore, pledge ourselves as one united people, regardless of race, language or religion, to build a democratic society based on justice and equality so as to achieve happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation.</p>
              <p>3) I also heard PRs usually get posted to non-sensitive vocations.</p>
              <p>Hope for good NS experience.</p>
              <p>Hope knowledgeable people can help me, and I will be thankful! </p>

              <div>
              <p><span>National Servicemen can expect new measures to better
              motivate, support, and recognise them, as well to help them balance
              their NS commitments with their family and career
              commitments.</span></p>
              <p>These aims were revealed by the Committee to Strengthen National
              Service on Wednesday, after it held its first meeting at the Basic
              Military Training Centre on Pulau Tekong. Over the next six months,
              the committee will gather ideas from servicemen and the public
              through focus group discussions and town hall sessions.</p>
              <p>The public may also air their views on a new website <a title="www.strengthenNS.sg" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.strengthenNS.sg">www.strengthenNS.sg</a> or through e-mail at <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:strengthenNS@starnet.gov.sg">strengthenNS@starnet.gov.sg</a>.</p>
              <p>The 20-member committee is chaired by Defence Minister Ng Eng
              Hen, and includes Members of Parliament, senior military personnel,
              employers, and NSmen. It was set up during this year's Committee of
              Supply Debate in March, which saw robust debate over how to better
              recognise National Servicemen in light of continued immigration and
              the need to preserve a Singapore core. In recent months, members of
              the public have responded to the news by calling for greater
              monetary incentives, including subsidies for transport, education
              and health, and time-off to rest after reservist in-camp
              training.</p>
              <p>Over the next six months, Singaporeans will be asked for
              feedback on how to beef up National Service.</p>
              <p>The Committee to Strengthen National Service, announced in
              March, will lead focus group discussions and town hall sessions
              while also conducting online consultation sessions via a new
              website, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/strengthenNS/index.html">www.strengthenNS.sg</a></p>
              <p>The Committee meeting for the first time today, expects its work
              to be done within a year.</p>
              <p>Made up of 20 members, including Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen,
              Members of Parliament,military top brass and private sector
              employers, the committee will use the feedback gathered to
              recommend measures to enhance National Service as a critical
              institution for Singapore's continued survival and success.</p>
              <p>The measures are meant to motivate servicemen to give their best
              in serving, help them balance their duties with family and work
              commitments, enhance support from families, companies, new citizens
              and the broader community, and promote recognition of servicemen's
              efforts.</p>
