            <div class='col-md body'>A good day to everyone here. I am new here and I have a few questions regarding my NS.<br><br>First off, I enlisted into BMT as Pes C9L2 due to a metal implant in my ankle due to a previous fracture<br><br>I have only recently gone for another operation to remove this metal implant from my ankle and I am now on MC waiting for it to heal.<br><br>As I had to do this operation on my leg, i was taken out of course from my initial course, which is CQ course. Fact that even though the CQ course is one of the slacker courses in the SAF already, I still experienced pain in my ankle from time to time throughout the course and I do not feel that it is really worth it for me to experience pain and suck thumb while going through the course. Going through the course with no injury and pain and going through it with nagging pains are two different matters (in my opinion).<br><br>I would like to know if anyone can provide me with the answers as to whether I will be slated for a recourse of the CQ course? Or i will most likely be posted to another course/straight to my unit. If so, does anyone have any idea what will my next vocation most likely be?<br><br>Also, will there be any changes regarding my Pes Status?<br><br>Once again, thanks for your time.<br><br>PS. my doctor is mad. The same day my operation was done he said i can try walking already, and even when my leg was dangling from the wheelchair it was hurting me. wtf is with docs nowadays?</div>

Dunno if the curriculum's changed much, but in my time I understood it to be a one-month course, mostly lectures &amp; exams (with maybe some on-the-job training). No field EX, as far as I know.
