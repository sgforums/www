              <p>If you have marfan syndrome OR simliar then good luck to you, sure go all the way to Pes E or even F. It is a matter of time before your heart, lungs, eyes, muscules, bone, tendons and joints start to fail, enjoy your life now, when you are still alive. Good luck. </p>
              <p>It isnt a joke but going to BMT or whatever is the least thing you should worry about.</p>
              <p>The life expectancy for a marfan syndrome sufferer is 30 years old max. And with good medical and treatment, half of them may live past 70 years old.</p>
              <p>If you are 18 now, you have about 12 more years to live. Good luck. Start praying to God now, blah. Compared to that 19 year old guy, you can stay alive for another ten years more.Comfort yourself considered lucky blah...</p>
              <p>And for now, SERIOUSLY DONT DO ANYTHING STRESSFUL UNTIL YOU ARE VERIFY THAT YOU DONT HAVE THIS DISEASE. THE TENDON AND LIGAMENT ARE LIKE TISSUE PAPER, EASILY TORN INTO TWO. </p>
              <p>you should search more on this disease on the internet. it is a well studied no-cure diesease.</p>
              <p>hope this post will not upset you.</p>

              <p>I say "or similar". There are many type of connective tissue disorder. The doctor is expecting or suspecting something before they send you for test.</p>
              <p>You say that doctor say you are marfaniod. Hypermobility itself can also be downgraded to Pes C9 or lower. These people tend injury themselves easily with dislocation, arthritis etc. Based on your BMI, it is considered highly abnormal.. </p>
              <p>Dont worry too much, wait for the medical side to give you can answer and follow it accordingly.</p>
