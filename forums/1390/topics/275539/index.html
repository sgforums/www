            <div class='col-md body'>Sure, if you meet their qualifications (eg. medically PES A/B, etc). Keep in mind that you must pass an interview too, just like for any civilian job. A lot of people seem to think the Govt will just accept all applicants, which isn't true per se. But, upon signing on, you must be prepared to commit 5 years -- of course, while earning a regular's wages -- to fulfill your former NS liability. Same for SCDF.<br><br>If you sign early, then won't have to do two BMTs (SAF &amp; SPF). If you wait a bit  to see where your SAF vocational posting is, then perhaps something else may interest you instead -- eg. SAFPU, or military police.<br><br>The below is taken from the SPF website:-<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Q. If I've not served my National Service, can I apply?<br><br>A. Yes, you can. SPF will have to check with Central Manpower Base (CMPB) prior to your appointment for approval to release you from full-time National Service enlistment.<br><br>All male Singaporeans/ Singapore Permanent Residents who have not completed full-time national service must serve a minimum term of 5 years (known as Minimum Term of Engagement, MTE) as a regular officer so as to fulfil your full-time National Service obligation.<br><br>Q. If I'm a full-time National Serviceman, who is presently serving my 3<br>months Basic Military Training (BMT), am I eligible to apply?<br><br>A. Yes, you may. However, you have to submit your application early (preferably at least 2 months prior to your completion of BMT).<br><br>This is to facilitate the arrangement for your interview before your BMT completion and vocational unit posting.</span><br><br><a href="http://www.spf.gov.sg/career/protect/protect_faq.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spf.gov.sg/career/protect/protect_faq.htm</a></div>

Needing mollycoddling like that, how can be a resourceful constable? ~lol~<br><br>I note you wrote something about further studies in an earlier post. IMO Won't be so simple, if you sign on. The Govt is always quite ngeow about filling NS commitments, requiring a confirmed academic place, minimum time already served first, sometimes a bond (if going overseas) before allowing any early release -- even then doing so only a week or so before term starts.<br><br>The only exceptions, as far as I know, are for the SAF scholarship-holders: they must enrol the year they received it. Other Govt scholars don't enjoy such benefits, I believe.<br><br>So you must talk to the Police recruiter to find out more their MTE rules &amp; conditions. The above link already touches on this some (under "Promotion Prospects and Continuous Education"), &amp; it doesn't seemingly have good news about early disruption.<br><br><blockquote>anyway i wanna ask for june intake , any idea what unit will i mostly likely get into? </blockquote>Must confirm your PES status first. Wow, no NAPFA scores either? Those results shall decide which BMT you'll kena &amp;, related to that, perhaps which service arm to be posted to. Who knows, maybe you'll get enlisted to join a unit mono-intake (instead of Tekong BMTC), or to SPF or SCDF.</div>
