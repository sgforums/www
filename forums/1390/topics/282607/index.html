            <div class='col-md body'>I can give you some info bout MATADOR. (FROM WIKI)<br><br>The MATADOR is among the lightest in its class. The warhead is effective against both vehicle armour and brick walls. The weapon has little backblast, making it safe for operation in confined spaces.<br><br>The MATADOR's projectile is insensitive to wind due to its propulsion system which results in a highly accurate weapon system.<br><br>The warhead can be used in both High Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) and High Explosive Squash Head (HESH) modes against armor and walls or other fortifications respectively. Selection is done by extending a "probe" (most likely a fuse extender) for HEAT mode and leaving the "probe" retracted for HESH mode.<br><br>The longer front grip handle prevents the soldier from misplacing his finger in front of the muzzle during firing, thereby eliminating the risk of injury. It also allows the soldier to rest the weapon on the ground, thus improving accuracy when maintaining a firing position. The foldable pistol grips similar to the ARMBRUST allow the soldiers to lock the weapon, preventing accidental firing.<br><br>Field trials were conducted to tailor the position of the optical sight to SAF soldiers. The chosen sight magnification provides soldiers with good field of view while allowing for more precise aiming. A Picatinny rail allows night vision devices to be mounted for night operations.<br><br>A wide, soft, rubber sling replaced the conventional hard, slim canvas sling to reduce the stress on the soldierÂ’s shoulder due to prolonged slinging. The new sling also comes with a quick-release buckle to allow rapid switch from sling to firing position.<br><br>Similar to the Armbrust, the countermass counteracts the recoil of the weapon upon firing. The countermass consists of shredded plastic which is projected out of the rear of the weapon when it is fired. This plastic is rapidly slowed by air resistance allowing the weapon to be fired safely within an enclosed space. In addition, the positioning of the countermass takes into consideration the centre of gravity of the weapon to ensure good balance for greater accuracy.<br><br></div>
