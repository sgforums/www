              <p>I have a problem regarding IPPT so i need some advice. (However i am not here to talk bad about the army system).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am an engineer with a firm that have a manufacturing plant situated at an rural area in indonesia. My job scope requires me to stay in indonesia for 3 months after that i will be back in singapore for a week and then i am back there to indonesia again. I need to take IPPT annually so far i have pass 3 ippt sessions. Recently i take my ippt and pass all stations except chin ups (all my other stations i get silver timing). </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was never good in chin up, in my peak days the most i did was only 10 chin ups my recent ippt i can only do 1 chin up. So i am allowed to retake chin up station in 8 weeks. However my main reason for doing 1 chin up is because i have no place to do chin up, when i am in indonesia, i only do running in a rural park and just push ups. Most people knew to improve chin up you have to keep doing it. I stay at a cheap inn in indonesia thus i cannot bring my chin up bar there and there is no gym near my work place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I try to talk to my boss but he said the only purpose he hire me is due to station me in indonesia but if i fail i have to go rt for 2 months. My boss said its impossible to let me back for RT.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I understand its my duty to pass my chin up but i only have 1 week of training after every 3 months everytime i came back i saw my chin ups never improve. Is there any means i can escape my RT? Thank you     </p>

              <p>can you commit yourself to do the training for 1 whole week? day one do 10 in the 3 timings u set. day two do 10+1 and so on.. wednesday rest totally dun do. thursday continue 10+2.. and saturday rest again.. by sunday do your max for all time slots.</p>
              <p>once you see some improvements, you can increase the sets.. however chin up must practise at the bar.. but you no choice, so at least you work your muscles.. better than don't have it when u need them..</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>TS, go to your family doctor and tell him you have arm pain problems. Try to get excuse letter and excuse chin-up when you go for your IPPT. Best still downgrade. Since you are working oversea, must die die 'keng' liao. No point die for country. Now ish die for your job/rice bowl/company. Got it?</p></div>
