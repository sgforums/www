              <p>Controversy arose when the penalties were increased in January

              music during his enlistment age and later acquired British

              Defence Minister <a title="Teo Chee Hean" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teo_Chee_Hean">Teo Chee Hean</a> provided some illustration of the punishments defaulters would

              <ul>
              <li>Where the default period exceeds two years but the defaulter is

              NS obligations in full, a longer jail sentence to reflect the

              <p>did they forgot to tell you you are a wanted man even after you have completed national service for certain reasons?its a crime too under their directive if you were to go out without their approval when you stop donning the army uniform once you are a reservist.</p>
              <p>currently those reservists are only allowed to leave singapore if they have  work overseas or studies overseas or perhaps they might grant an exit permit for you joining your folks in oz or you tell them you are immigrating.its upto them.but if you were to serve ns the accomodation would be the issue in hand.</p>
              <p>defaulting would be years in a military prison.heard rumours they are usually naked inside.even reservists get it when they return to spore after working overseas without valid documents.first on landing ,they get arrested at aiurport and get housed at airport lockup.then they get transported to kranji or some far out jungle prison.dont know if transit would be affected as you have not went thru customs with the computer and people looking at the photo documents of wanted people.you arent the only person who is wanted really.once many deacades ago,there were documents and pictures of wanted people in spore and the customs had them at airport customs counter physically.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and no,im not a defaulter.i didnt run away or anything.i did my ns and found out later on i had been sold out by spore and its counterproductive labour policies.and once above 40 yrs old,it would be hard to get any work if you are retrenched even if you are a degree holder as its the culture there mostly.only job would be a low paying job probably commandeered by people that have not done any ns in any country.its alright if they are polite and professional but they are mostly nasty , power hungry and rude.not much different than a fish monger. thanks to the many sporeans and people who see nothing,know nothing and hear nothing.</p>

              <p><span><strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan: </strong>To ask the Minister for Defence how 
              many National Service (NS) defaulters have been sentenced to 
              imprisonment for defaulting NS over the past three years and whether all
               NS defaulters will be sentenced to imprisonment.</span></p>
              <p><span>
              </span></p><p><strong>Minister:</strong> Over the past three years, five National Service (NS) defaulters have been sentenced to imprisonment by the Court.</p>
              <p>To maintain equity of treatment and the commitment for all who are 
              liable to serve their NS, it is necessary to take a tough stand against 
              the few who default on their NS obligations. MINDEF will press for a 
              custodial sentence on the NS defaulter based on the length of default 
              and the following guidelines:</p>
              <p>a. Short jail sentence. Where the default period exceeds two years 
              but the defaulter is young enough to serve his full-time and 
              operationally ready NS (ORNS) duties in full, MINDEF will press for a 
              short jail sentence.</p>
              <p>b. Longer jail sentence. Where the defaulter has reached an age when 
              he cannot serve his full-time NS in a combat vocation or fulfil his ORNS
               obligations in full, MINDEF will press for a longer jail sentence to 
              reflect the period of NS evaded.</p>
              <p>c. Maximum jail sentence. Where the defaulter has passed the age of 
              40 and cannot be called up for NS at all, MINDEF will press for a jail 
              sentence up to the maximum of three years.</p>
              <p>The Court decides on the sentence received by NS defaulters taking 
              into consideration the circumstances of the individual case and the 
              sentence MINDEF has pressed for. After their punishments by the Court, 
              NS defaulters who are still NS-liable will have to serve NS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span>NS Defaulters</span></strong></span></div>
              <div><span>In
               line with these three principles, MINDEF has consistently taken a tough
               stand against those who default on their National Service obligations. 
               We have introduced various measures over the years to prevent such 
              persons from evading National Service.  For example, the Constitution 
              was amended in 1979 so that those who refused to serve could not escape 
              their National Service obligation by simply renouncing their 
              citizenship.  Only those who have emigrated at a young age and have not 
              enjoyed substantial socio-economic benefits are allowed to renounce 
              their citizenship without serving National Service.<br><br>Since 1970, 
              we have required pre-enlistees who are going overseas for an extended 
              period to post a bond as a promise that they will return to fulfil their
               National Service obligation.  The bond quantum was $20,000 in 1970 and 
              it has been increased over the years.  Since 1992, the bond quantum has 
              been set at $75,000 or half the combined annual income of the parents, 
              whichever is higher.  The bond is however not a substitute for National 
              Service.  If a pre-enlistee fails to return to serve his National 
              Service, not only has he broken his bond but, more importantly, he has 
              broken his promise and broken the law by not returning to fulfil his 
              National Service obligation.  The bond quantum that is forfeited is the 
              penalty he has to pay for breaking the bond.  It is not redemption and 
              not a substitute for National Service.  He still has to face the law for
               failing to comply with his National Service obligations under the 
              Enlistment Act; and he still remains liable for National Service.<br><br>There
               is strong support for National Service among Singaporeans.  Every year 
              only a small number, about 0.5% of those liable for NS each year, or on 
              average 100 unresolved cases of NS defaulters a year over the past five 
              years, fail to register or enlist for National Service, or fail to 
              return after their exit permits expired.  The vast majority of these 
              defaulters are overseas.<br><br>An average of 12 NS defaulters a year 
              were charged in Court for failing to comply with the Enlistment Act.  
              The offences carry a sentence of up to three years imprisonment, a fine 
              of up to $5,000, or both.  The sentence is decided by the Court based on
               the circumstances of each case.  Besides answering to the Court, NS 
              defaulters who are still Singaporeans and below the age of 40 will have 
              to serve National Service.</span></div>

              <div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span>Penalties for NS defaulters</span></strong></span></div>
              <div><span>Sir,
               let me now touch on the issue of punishment for NS defaulters.  The 
              legal framework for National Service is contained in two pieces of 
              legislation – the Enlistment Act and the Singapore Armed Forces Act.<br><br>The
               Enlistment Act applies to all Singaporeans and Permanent Residents from
               age 16½ to 40, or age 50 in the case of officers.  The Act provides for
               the registration and enlistment of those liable for National Service, 
              and also for the requirement to apply for an Exit Permit or to notify 
              MINDEF when going overseas.  Those who fail to comply with the 
              provisions of the Enlistment Act are dealt with in the civil courts 
              regardless of whether they are pre-enlistees, full-time NSmen or 
              Operationally Ready NSmen.  On conviction, they can be sentenced to a 
              jail term of up to three years, or a fine of up to $5,000, or both.<br><br>The
               Singapore Armed Forces Act deals with those in the service of the SAF 
              and contains provisions pertaining to their conduct and discipline.  
              Those in the service of the SAF comprise regulars, full-time NSmen, and 
              Operationally Ready NSmen who have been served an order to report for 
              service.  Pre-enlistees are not subject to the Singapore Armed Forces 
              Act as they are not yet in the service of the SAF.  Servicemen who 
              commit offences under the Singapore Armed Forces Act are dealt with 
              either in the Subordinate Military Court or by SAF disciplinary 
              officers.<br><br>NS defaulters are dealt with under the Enlistment Act 
              as they have failed to respond to orders to register or enlist for 
              National Service, or failed to comply with Exit Permit requirements. 
              MINDEF’s approach in dealing with NS defaulters has been to charge them 
              in Court for Enlistment Act offences and let the Court impose an 
              appropriate sentence based on the circumstances of each case and the 
              provisions of the Enlistment Act.<br><br>Over the past 20 years, 185 NS 
              defaulters have been convicted in Court for Enlistment Act offences. Of 
              these, 43 received jail sentences, 140 were fined and two were punished 
              in connection with other civil offences. Of the 140 who were fined, 35 
              were ultimately jailed when they did not pay their fines.<br><br>Of the 
              185 convicted defaulters, 127 were enlisted or are awaiting enlistment 
              for National Service following their convictions. Two were supposed to 
              enlist but defaulted again prior to their enlistment. 33 were not 
              drafted as they were unsuitable for enlistment for security or medical 
              reasons - they would not have been enlisted in any case even if they had
               not defaulted on NS. The remaining 23 were not drafted because they 
              were either above the statutory age limit or no longer Singaporeans.<br><br>Of
               note is that the High Court had, in a 1993 case, reduced the sentences 
              of two NS defaulters - two brothers - from eight months' imprisonment to
               a fine of $3,000 on appeal. This was an unusual case where it could be 
              said that there were mitigating circumstances. Since then the 
              Subordinate Courts have been using this case as a guideline, and not 
              imposed a jail sentence on single-instance defaulters, no matter how 
              long the default period was. The courts have imposed jail sentence on 
              single instance defaulters only in cases where there are aggravating 
              factors, such as repeated Enlistment Act offences, past criminal 
              records, concurrent charges of other civil offences, and absconding 
              during investigation.<br><br>It is for the Court to decide on the 
              appropriate punishment for individual cases of NS defaulters. MINDEF had
               not been pressing for custodial sentences, nor had it appealed for 
              heavier sentences. The majority of cases so far have been those who 
              returned at a relatively young age and were still able to fulfil their 
              National Service obligations. Half of those charged in Court over the 
              past 20 years returned at age 21 or younger, and 80% returned at age 28 
              or younger. A fine for such NS defaulters was not inappropriate as they 
              were still able to serve their National Service obligations in full.<br><br>However,
               Melvyn Tan’s case has highlighted an inadequacy in penalties for those 
              who have defaulted for so many years that they are no longer able to 
              discharge their National Service obligations in full. Since the appeal 
              case in the High Court in 1993, besides Melvyn Tan, there have been 13 
              other cases of convicted defaulters who were sentenced only to a fine 
              and who were not subsequently enlisted because they were already over 40
               or almost 40. This is something that we need to look into more closely,
               especially as there may now be more defaulters who are 40 or older 
              coming before the courts with the passing of time.</span></div>

              <div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span>Review of Enlistment Act</span></strong></span></div>
              <div>Sir,
               in the middle of last year, MINDEF embarked on a periodic review of the
               Enlistment Act and the Singapore Armed Forces Act. This review focused 
              on the penalty regimes in the Acts. The review of the penalty regime in 
              the Singapore Armed Forces Act was completed in November last year and a
               Bill to amend the Singapore Armed Forces Act is up for Second Reading 
              now before the House. The proposal is to increase the maximum fine 
              quantum provided for in the SAF Act.<br><br>The review of the Enlistment
               Act has taken longer, because in addition to reviewing the penalty 
              regime, MINDEF is also studying how to modify the exit control measures 
              to take into account the impending introduction of the biometric 
              passport. I will provide details of the changes in the exit control 
              measures at a later sitting when I move the Bill to amend the Enlistment
               Act.<br><br>Let me deal with the issues regarding the penalty regime. 
              MINDEF considered whether, in the context of current conditions and the 
              number of NS defaulters, it is necessary to change the nature and scale 
              of punishments in the Enlistment Act. In particular, we looked at 
              whether the maximum jail sentence of three years is adequate, whether we
               should specify a mandatory minimum jail sentence, and whether the 
              maximum fine that can be imposed is adequate.<br><br>MINDEF will be 
              proposing to the House to increase the maximum fine provided for in the 
              Enlistment Act from the current $5,000 to $10,000. This will be in line 
              with the amendment to the Singapore Armed Forces Act which is now before
               the House. While the maximum fine will be higher, it is important to 
              note that the fine, like the bond, is not a substitute for serving 
              National Service. The fine is a penalty for failing to fulfil his 
              obligations under the Enlistment Act, and the defaulter remains liable 
              for National Service.<br><br>MINDEF has concluded that the maximum jail 
              sentence of three years is adequate, as it is longer than the current 
              full-time National Service duration of two years. Whether or not a 
              particular offence merits the maximum punishment of three years' 
              imprisonment would be a matter for the Court to decide based on the 
              facts of each case.<br><br>MINDEF does not consider it necessary at this
               time to seek a minimum mandatory jail sentence for Enlistment Act 
              offences, as the circumstances of the cases vary widely.  However, from 
              now on, MINDEF will ask the prosecutor to press for a jail sentence in 
              serious cases of NS defaulters, and explain why we consider a jail 
              sentence appropriate in a particular case. Serious cases include those 
              who default on their full-time National Service responsibilities for two
               years or longer from the time they were required to register or enlist,
               or from the time their exit permits expired for those granted 
              deferment, whichever is later.  We believe that it is in the public 
              interest that such NS defaulters face a jail sentence, unless there are 
              mitigating circumstances.<br><br>I would like to provide some 
              illustrations of what MINDEF considers to be sentences appropriate to 
              the nature of the offence or commensurate with its gravity:<br><br></div>
              <div><span>
              <ul>
              <li>Where
               the default period exceeds two years but the defaulter is young enough 
              to serve his full-time and operationally ready NS duties in full, MINDEF
               will press for a short jail sentence.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the 
              defaulter has reached an age when he cannot serve his full-time NS in a 
              combat vocation or fulfil his operationally ready NS obligations in 
              full, a longer jail sentence to reflect the period of NS he has evaded 
              may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached
               an age when he cannot be called up for NS at all, a jail sentence up to
               the maximum of three years may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>In all 
              instances, we expect that the Court will take into account whatever 
              aggravating or mitigating circumstances there may be in each case to 
              determine the appropriate sentence.</span></div>

              <p>This is a quiet little secret I heard from overseas ex-Singaporeans. Go and renounce your citizenship overseas.</p>
              <p>Singapore has an "age 11 rule" applies if you are in Singapore and are going
                                      to leave Singapore. Within the territory of Singapore, you may not
                                      renounce Singapore citizenship beyond the age of 11.</p>
              <p>If you are overseas, how can you expect Singapore jurisdiction
                                      to apply? Simply go to the Singapore embassy nearest you, fill up a
                                      form and get rid of it once and for all. Many have done so and will
                                      continue to do so, it takes mere minutes. This applies at any
                                      age. No one can stop you from doing so, but they may give the impression you cannot.</p>
              <p>Your main concern is not leaving Singapore, but having citizenship or right of residence in
                                      Australia or your chosen country of residence. Make sure you have it otherwise you will
                                      be stateless.</p>
              <p>As for that emergency travel fairy tale, what are the chances, and don't you think Australia will tell Singapore to keep its hands off its citizens?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Read the above lengthy post and you will see it applies to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">defaulters</span>, ie someone who is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">legally liable</span> to serve but who evades service. Non citizens are not legally liable.</p>

              <p>I think TS is well prepared to face the consequences and not worried about "in case" scenarios.</p>
              <p>Eg Singapore wants us to learn Chinese up to A Levels "in case we must go to China". A lot of us take physics in A Levels "in case we do engineering" but never use it in our lives. Result- years of wasted study.</p>

              <p>If you want to default, go ahead, You can spend 2 years buliding up your work life in AU instead of wasting your time here. 2 years is enough for an individual to work his way up the industry to be honest. I don't encourage people to default but if your families are living in a foreign land it is a great chance, Why not?</p>
              <p>And don't worry, I don't think AU flights to other countries will 'stopover' at SG, At most at HK then they will stop over. If you are scared why do you want to default?</p>

              <p><br>I understand that there are extradition laws in place but I also know that extradition doesn't just happen straightforwardly.<br>First the appeal has to be valid, and to make it valid, a common condition is that the crime committed has to be a crime in the country you're requesting from as well.<br>So things like murderers, rapists, robbers, etc. extradition would make a lot of sense, but Australia is a country that not only doesn't view avoiding compulsory military conscription as a crime, it also has humans rights groups actively fighting for the people who seek safety usually from countries of serious physical danger (ie. the Middle East).<br><br>Though my case is not as extreme, I have quite a handful of close, personal friends who have done what i'm contemplating and by "friends" I mean they're in their mid 30s to 40s already and nothing has happened to them.<br><br>On top of that, even after the extradition request is sent out, another country has the right to reject it outright if it doesn't seem valid. And as a PR, studying and living in Australia, and as a skilled worker no less, it's not in their best interest to hand me over for something that is not a crime in their own country.<br><br>And let's say, after this extradition request is approved for review, I will be fighting my case in the foreign court FIRST, which would be Australian court.<br>So what alize has said previously seems very accurate.<br><br>It was something to the effect of: "Australia is allowing Singapore to operate its embassy within Australia, not the other way around, so Singapore laws don't apply in a Singapore embassy overseas."<br>Which makes alot of sense because i'm sure no one has been arrested for chewing gum in a Singapore embassy overseas.<br><br>And while I realize that it is still a grey, untouched and secretive area, I DO believe many, especially in recent years, have migrated overseas wholesale. <br></p>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 0.1em;"><strong>Jurisdiction</strong> - Jurisdiction over a crime can be invoked to refuse extradition. In particular, the fact that the person in question is a nation's own citizen causes that country to have jurisdiction.</li>

              <p>What happens if he is overseas at the age of 18 because he has somehow not enlisted into the SAF? He will then be a legal adult according to the definition of "legal adult" in Singapore and/or the foreign jurisdiction. Will he then be able to renounce it? What if a foreign jurisdiction, that he will come under, allows him to renounce it regardless of adult status?</p>
              <p>Secondly, assuming he has no elective rights of his own, his parents exercised his elective rights on his behalf and brought him into Singapore citizenship. Why can't they similarly exercise them to bring him out of it?</p>
              <p>This passage I reallty don't understand. If 1/3 of PRs have left Singapore before doing NS rather than do it, what way out have they taken?</p>
              <p>Thirdly, who knows. He might be the world's first refugee or asylum seeker who takes refuge in China. Which would be hypocritical because China in theory has conscription which is never practiced.</p>
