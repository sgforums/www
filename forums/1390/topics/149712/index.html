            <div class='col-md body'>For the story, I heard so many versions of it, from different friends. Some how it get twisted or scarrier when retold, I give u my classic example<br><br>Soldier 1 to Soldier 2 : "Yesterday night, I heard strange metal noise in blk XXX"<br><br>Soldier 2 to Solder 3 : "Eh! Soldier 1 saw something last night in blk XXX!!!!"<br><br>Solder 3 to Solder 4 : "Eh! Soldier 1 saw a ghost last night in blk XXX!!!!!"<br><br>Soldier 4 to Soldier 5 : "Just heard that Soldier 1 saw a pontiank flying around blk XXX"<br><br>Solder 5 to Soldier 6 "Rumors has it there are a group of pontianks flying around blk XXX"<br><br>Soldier 6 "SH*T!!!! My bunk is in blk XXX!!!!!!!!!"<br><br>Soldier 6 to OC "Sir!, I wish to change bunk, there are pontianks HERE!!!"<br><br>OC :  "WAT RUBBISH, I was in blk XXX yesterday night trying to get my f**King metal carboard open and I saw nothing!!!"<br><br>So I believe the story maybe just simple one but got twisted here and there, add oil add spices to become wat is it become todae. Just think about it.<br><br>As for camp 1, been there twice, once we took sheldered there because of a storm. just infront of the jacobs ladder. (Yeah, the infamous,  ladder)<br><br>Seccond time was a weird one though, I think I mentioned before, we were jogging there in the morning, we saw a grp of stray dogs feasting on a dead white rabbit just behind the cookhouse.
