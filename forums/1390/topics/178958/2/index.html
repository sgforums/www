Maybe alright for the 90kg ang moh, but for the average sized 60 - 70kg Singaporean, it can be quite a challenge to say the least.  And let's face it with the GPMG being belt fed, no way we can hold the GPMG with one hand and fire accurately running up a hill, whilst using the other hand to keep the belt from tangling up.  That's only from those silly Rambo movies.  Even then he was using a Stoner M63, not the GPMG.<br><br>For the way we deploy for war, I think the current saw capabilities is ok, except for the fact of the 30 round mag.  Like already mentioned, 30 rounds go in a burp!  But they should look at using better materials and stronger "joints" to make it more hardy.<br><br>However since I mentioned, the Stoner M63 or some modern day version might be nice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

We charge hills all the time.  In war, defensive positions are often around hills, maybe not right at the top, but usually not right at the bottom either.  So if you are not charging up the hill to take the enemy position, it's fire and movement.  Don't think it's possible to fire the GPMG on the move accurately, an if it's not accurate, does it really matter how good the firepower is?<br><br>Sure, a skinny guy can carry the GPMG, but to charge and fire or do fire and movement, let's face it, not very practical.  Again one hand on grip pulling trigger and the other holding the belt to make sure it doesn't get tangled?  all the while running, taking cover, rolling, proning, getting up, etc...

In war, defensive positions are often around hills, maybe not right at the top, but usually not right at the bottom either.  So if you are not charging up the hill to take the enemy position, it's fire and movement.  Don't think it's possible to fire the GPMG on the move accurately, an if it's not accurate, does it really matter how good the firepower is?<br><br>I am not trying to say in SAF we dont charge hills... i charge like mad doing my time as an infantry sect comdr. My PC always used the GPMG team beside him with the left and right assault even though mys sispec days we dont train like that. his reason was he want superior firepower up front thats why we can run instead of crawling during trench clearing or fire and movement. but the Gimpy never run and fire they just provide support fire to keep the second level of enemy trench from firing back... during PS course we were asked how we clear trenches, those from ADF would always say crawl, and i agree with them</div>

(Sorry, not trying to be difficult here) Since PC is in the centre of the platoon, the GPMG would be firing in between two charging sections.  So GPMG can't really cover the entire front but only a very narrow front, otherwise he shoots his own soldiers in the back.  Thought GPMG normally deployed to the side during assault.  Anyone else encounter this?<br><br>Ha ha ha... Yeah, I think if given a chance to crawl when clearing trenches, I would too.  Who would want to present a target to some guy with his rifle propped up on a sandbag, moving target or otherwise.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
