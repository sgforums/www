But i do feel that a linked weapon, would be more effective in achieving fire superiority.  The drum would have been fine IF it wasn't hard to load.  The Beta-C mags would be good, IF they were reliable.  So far, only the belt has proved to be more effective for sustained rate.<br><br>The M-16 is not just too fast.  It's barrel is too light for sustained fire. Rounds fired from the automatic M-16 would literally jump up!<br><br>I wouldn't say I am totally advocating the M249 or mk46.  Tho the mk46 is infact the lightest of the series, just that it cant accept mags. Another reason why the m249 series isn't the ideal replacement is what u have said, too heavy n bulky, besides that, the 249 is quite an old design too.<br><br>I would feel the best SAW would be one that is -<br>1. Ergonomically designed, (well balanced for the user to support the weight easily.<br><br>2.  Belt -fed - / Unless they can come up with a better n reliable solution to the drum or Beta-C.  -&gt; backup ability to load mags would be optional?<br><br>3.  Limited weight.  We won't want something that weighs 9kg.  Anything under 6.5kg would be nice.  Bearing in mind that if the weapon is ergonomically designed, 6.5kg won't be too bad.   - I bet the proposed SAR-21/m203 combo fully loaded would almost be 6kg loaded also lor.</div>
