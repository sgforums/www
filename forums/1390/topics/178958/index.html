Meaning singapore can only make the m16 according to original specs and further modifications are not allowed as part of the license agreement despite if the modfication is actually an improvement.<br>This severely limits singpaore's flexibility.<br><br>2) Changing nature of warfare. SAR 21 is designed so that our fingers are not lmited by trigger guard. This makes it easier to handle if we are wearing MOPP 4, etc.<br><br>3) M16 are running near (with some beyond) their useful life.<br><br>4) SAR 21 designed with the typical Asian user in mind. So butt stock's shorter, etc.<br><br>5) Shorter weapon, easier to wield.<br><br>6) Singapore can finally make a rifle where they have full rights on, meaning can modify as they please.  I personally konw there are 2 improvements on SAR 21 though I believe there are many that i dunno about.</div>

You can comfortably hold SAR21 with one hand on the grip but you can't do that with M16.<br><br>Swopping mag, i just think the lever is too far back to change mag easily.<br><br>I think they choose bullpup so as to come up with a shorter rifle for fibua usage.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can see the logic of having bullpups over traditional battle rifle designs.  But the weight is just ... not viable.<br><br>One thing I appreciate is that the SAR-21 is a safe rifle.  But that additiona kevlar plate is really contributing to most of the weight isn't it?<br><br>The picatinny version of the Sar-21 is much lighter, why dont we adopt those instead? U can attach according to requirements, eg, if u are just a rifleman, a 1.5 scope or reflex sight etc. Then after that u can have a slightly lighter version of the picatinny sar-21 and M203.</div>
