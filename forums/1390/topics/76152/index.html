            <div class='col-md body'>BG Yeo began as a Signals Officer, then posted to Command &amp; Staff College before heading to the Air Force.<br><br>BG Lee was CO of 23 SA. You can say Khabib Camp ("Home of the Gunners") remains his personal turf; I could still sense his lingering presence there during my ICTs, stretching back to when I was posted to SOAY for my vocation training back in '86. I'm not sure 23 SA was always located there - all I can vaguely recall is a host of Arty units shifting over from Kangaw Camp (present Sembawang Airbase) in the early '80s, before I enlisted - but they &amp; 24 SA have been associated with the place in the 20 years since.<br><br>In any case, BG Lee literally rode out of the SAF at Khatib, on top of a 155m howitzer; the murals depicting his speeches are still there &amp;, during my earlier NS &amp; reservist years, some old-timer regulars still speak his name with pride/awe - he was just 32 years old when he left as a brigadier-general for a political career. In fact, I'll credit him for setting the example that turned the "good sons don't become soldiers" prejudice over on its head for good.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Found a terrific photo of George Yeo, Teo Chee Hean &amp; Lim Hng Kiang together in their SAF days: http://www.psc.gov.sg/ctb/chapter4-04.html<br><br>The trio, along with LHL &amp; Lim Swee Say, were the 1st 5 SAF scholars who later entered politics. If I recall from Tim Huxley's book, LHK was a LTC with RSAF before he became HDB chief; TCH was of course with the Navy; &amp; LSS was "unique" in the sense that he was Chinese-educated &amp; only made Major before leaving for the Civil Service &amp; NTUC.<br><br>All 5 were remembered more as staff officers in the military, except I think LHL is just as (fondly) known as a former command/combat officer for whatever reason. Perhaps it's really due to the eradicating-of-former-bias I referred to earlier; IMHO the concept of a local-bred, meritocratic-based SAF leadership centered around 2 men in the '70s: Winston Choo &amp; LHL. They helped bring professionalism to the officer corps, as opposed to the older pragmatic days when Goh Keng Swee was de facto CIC &amp; LKY-favored defence ministers could promote military leaders without Cabinet approval.<br><br>I'll also recommend a old, GKS-initiated book, "Youth in the Army" - copies surely available in the libraries - where SAF psychologists profiled a number of NSFs who served in the '70s, from average soldiers to officer cadets to drug-takers. I found the case studies to provide, indirectly, a fascinating sociological insight of that era's conscripts. It's a world that's entirely different from the one I enlisted about 8 years later, a world before the advent of Total Defence &amp; even the standard IPPT test, a world when the defence budget would double by decade's end &amp; then increase by a further third before the mid-80s. It's also a world that LHL must've led as a junior combat officer, with him still being young enough (he must've been in his early- or mid-20's) to be part of that generation.<br><br>P.S. For "busybodies", the book profiled Lee Hsien Yang back when he was a OCT too, when he acknowledged his sheltered, Science-stream/JC-eduated life who wanted to be an engineer &amp; had no interest in signing on as a regular; the revealing info is that, while he's obviously articulate &amp; had leadership qualities, neither his coursemates nor his instructors ranked him at the top of his batch.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Didn't wanna post this until I could confirmed it. For the record, BG Lee was never Chief of Arty; he had a knack for joint-service restructuring &amp; thus the SAF had bigger plans for him. He finished his military career as Chief of Staff (General Staff).<br><br>The relevant Chief Arty Officers, as listed in the Singapore Artillery 100th Anniversay coffee book, were COL Mancharan Singh Gill (appointed '69), LTC Kwek Boon Yong ('72), COL Chan Jwee Kang ('76), LTC Govinda Rasu ('80)  &amp; LTC Low Yee Kah ('86). [I'm familiar with the latter duo: GR was a former CO of 21SA &amp; I recall us "claiming" him as "our own" then, while LYK was the "tua pao tao" during my NSF. ]<br><br>LHL, of course, entered politics in '84. Oh yeah, found out he was Presidental cum SAF Overseas Scholar in '71. GY, LHK &amp; TCH were similarly awarded in '73 &amp; LSS was also of the same year (SAF Overseas Scholar "only") - so they're all roughly the same age, even as the latter quartet entered politics later: '88, '91, '92 &amp; '96 respectively.<br><br>My bet is on TCH, not GY, being DPM after the next elections, once Tony Tan steps down.</div>
