            <div class='col-md body'>"Prowler"! I was looking for that word. Somehow "patrol" didn't sound right.<br><br>Never been to Mandai Hill Camp before, so I dunno how fortified it is. But if they use the usual welding-mesh type of fence -- eg. Khatib Camp(?) -- then it's not that great an obstacle to clear. Except maybe for the barb wire on top, if any.<br><br>I find the idea of deserting via the main gate, with rifle &amp; ammo in hand, quite unbelievably brazen. It's incredibly garang to attempt this. I mean, did he threaten to shoot those trying to stop him? Why not just AWOL, sans weapon?<br><br>If it was a spur-of-the-moment decision, then absconding away stealthily sounds more logical. We reservists used to literally "climb over the wall" in ROC, to sneak out of camp. But that was for fun!<br><br>What a waste to ruin your life.</div>
