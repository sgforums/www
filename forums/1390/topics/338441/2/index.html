              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>In case it escaped your notice, I repeatedly state my very low
              view of patriotism and fighting for arbitrary causes in my post.
              I'm not about to go lay down my life for a drawing on a map. The
              choice between being a rabid patriot and a 'traitor' is a false
              dichotomy.</p>
              <p>Besides, it's highly unlikely that any would-be invader
              would rape, burn and pillage their way through Singapore
              since there's too much infrastructure at stake for them to
              simply discard it all.</p>
              <p>@ Gedanken: I'm of the opinion that our military
              isn't a much of a deterrent. Singapore is
              ill-equipped to wage the kind of intense urban warfare (i.e.
              fighting for the kitchen and getting shot at from the bedroom)
              that would be necessary for us to resist any invader. Who
              are we kidding? The moment war breaks out, we're going to face
              a great deal of trouble in bringing in resources to continue the
              fight. Also, after our inevitable capitulation, any invader
              would be more inclined to be vicious with the civilian populace if
              they had previously faced dogged opposition from our
              troops.</p>
              <p>You do raise several good points in your second paragraph. Yes,
              military service is not without its benefits, but in my view, it
              still penalizes the male section of the populace quite
              unfairly. Instead of getting the freedom to choose, we're forced
              into bondage for the two years, and the supposed compensation
              doesn't come anywhere close to offsetting the effort demanded.</p>
              <p>Also, gender equality and feminists can go jump off a cliff
              if males are still the only ones expected to defend their
              country.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>finally someone who realised that the "modern warfare" tactics are not so modern after all.</p>
              <p>we are living in an age where insurgent can take out a heavily armoured tank with a well position hand grenade. wth. (in iraq, they send people to manually place hand grenades under stationary tanks. knocking out multi-million-dollars high tech toys with an extremely low tech equipment.)</p>

              <p>well, i agree that our military is only a deterrent. nothing more.</p>
              <p>you can easily scare off potential aggressor with all those high tech toys. but in an actual war, you think those toys are going to keep functioning? eventually we will run out of ammo, parts etc. look at idon and m'sia. they have the raw material to manufacture ammo, but not singapore. we have to purchase all our equipment from abroad, directly or indirectly.</p>
              <p>and to the hell with the geneva convention. to date, i haven seen any country which fully abide by the convention. hospitals and schools are still bombed.</p>

              <p>i last heard that they are going to further reduce it to 3-6 months, smthing like the malaysian NS. the taiwan ns will then become something for the youth to get aquainted with.</p>

              <p>singapore is much much smaller, with everything concentrated in a city. Israel still have some countryside as buffer.</p>
              <p>and yes, the israelis have won alot of wars with syria, egypt etc. but those are very short wars which ranges from days to weeks.</p>
              <p>if the agressor decided to drag on the war, with reference to the War of Attrition by Egypt from 1968-1970 (3 yrs), israel lost alot of territory. like taiwan, without the protectorship of the USA, these tiny states facing large powerful enemies can never survive on their own.</p>

              <p>Again, talking about time spans and resources skates on OSA, but just look at who Singapore has defence ties with and tell me what the point of talking about Singapore fighting singlehandedly is.</p>
              <p>Uhh, don't know which War of Attrition you were watching, but by the time the ceasefire was signed the front lines were pretty much unchanged from 1967, and Israel still retained the Sinai.</p>
              <p>Pardon my saying, but what I'm hearing you say is that Singapore is indefensible, and so we should just drop NS, roll over and let the oppostion tickle our bellies.  Is that right, or am I missing something here?</p>

              fighting for the kitchen and getting shot at from the bedroom)

              into bondage for the two years, and the supposed compensation
              doesn't come anywhere close to offsetting the effort demanded.</p>

              <p>and this sentence, really, speaks of your mentality, your character .... so you're the sort who advocate women not to resist rapists cos the rapists would be inclined to be vicious ? ... that if you were robbed on the streets, you'd say, take this, take it all, just leave me alone ? ... I dunno about you mate, but I like to think women may be better served learning how to gouge out eyeballs and squeeze nuts in self defence ... I also think we should go down fighting, even if defeat is inevitable ... and it's not that a defeatist character simply sucks either, but the knowledge that we'd go down fighting itself is a deterent too ...</p>
              <p>but yeah, I guess it takes all sorts  ... you're already thinking of giving up even before the war's started, I think we have to fight for what's ours ... if not for the drawings on the map, or even the flag, then certainly, for my family, my loved ones, the things that belongs to me ...</p>

              <p>as i have indicated in my earlier reply to this whole question, i am a supporter of National Service. In my opinion, it is an honour to don on a beret and go through hell week and firing practices to toughen up. However, I am not for laying down the life for country because of several reasons. Hence i believe one can serve NS proudly, train himself physically and mentally yet not lay down his life for his country as what you mentioned, "for an arbitrary cause".</p>
              <p>every abled-body male has to put in 2 years of his life. this is compulsory and no point arguing. so why not make your experience better? join a specilist, get a beret, be proud of the honour of wearing it, and at the same time make friends, and toughen up. <br>i have a very optimistic friend who said national service gives you free food, free drinks, free training, free gym, free health assessment, free accomodation, free friends, free overseas trip, free uniform and bag....</p>

              <p>Try applying these points to Israel.  Small area, surrounded by the opposition, little defensive depth, built up infrastructure, not too much by the way of primary industries, yet the facts bear out that they've not only defended themselves from Syria, Egypt and other countries, they took the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>
              <p>We can if and but till the cows come home, but the facts already tell us that we're by no means forced to roll over and expose our bellies.</p>

              <p><br> there is a difference between Israeli and Singapore troops. Although similar in army size, the Israli army have greater strength and determination. Look at their commandos for instance. They are the best in the world, their training is more gruelling which makes them tougher. here, we have generations of schoolboys where only about 10% are considered "tough" . it is not the army muscle, what matters are the tactics and the determination, whether people are willing to lay down their lives. and that is what makes israeli troops special. </p>
              <p>nevertheless having a deterrant is better than having none. if you got lost hiking in the woods and met a bear, would you wish you had a dagger or was unarmed?</p>

              <p>No I didn't.  As you have yourself noted, the difference is in the approach to NS, which is that raison d'etre of this discussion.  The other circumstances are similar enough that if Singaporeans got their heads screwed on right, they stand as much of a chance and don not need to immediately wave the white flag.</p>
              <p>Hell week?  You a diver?</p>
