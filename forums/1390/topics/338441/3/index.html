              <p>Sounds like we have a hell lot of pple with pre enlistment blues.</p>
              <p>To set the record straight...i hate NS. Waste of my time, but its something that have to be done.</p>
              <p>If ns hadn't started, we probably be singing some other national anthem 30 years ago. We will probably be some sort of 2nd class citizens under another "motherland".</p>
              <p>And besides, we wouldn't be able to enjoy those economic growth that we are experiencing now. Simply because ns gives foreign investors the confidence in singapore.</p>
              <p>So just suck it up for the greater benefit for every one. Otherwise there will come a day where people will start talking about singaporean boat people running to all over asia.</p>

              <p>so ....</p>
              <p>what would you fight for ? .... your home, your wife's honour, your children, your own life ? ...</p>
              <p>remember that that "drawing on the map", may just be where your home is ...</p>
              <p>and so you think any likely invader would not rape and plunder and pillage ? ... I just have to roll my eyes at this ..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>nevermind about the gulf war, nevermind about what happened to kuwait, that may be a bit distant in your memory, (so I shall not even bring in WWII), just look at georgia ? ....</p>
              <p>sure, they may not "burn" your flat, if that's the kind of infrastructure you're talking about, but you think your wife, your money, your car, your baubles, won't be fair game ? ... if you think that just because we live in the 21st century, that warfare has become "civilised" ... then you are naive, .... and if you look around at our geography, and the nature of our potential aggressors, the kind of things they routinely say against our country, and the largest component race of our country,  then I must say you are deluded ...</p>
              <p><strong>Also, after our inevitable capitulation, any invader would be more inclined to be vicious with the civilian populace if they had previously faced dogged opposition from our troops.</strong></p>
              <p>and this sentence, really, speaks of your mentality, your character .... so you're the sort who advocate women not to resist rapists cos the rapists would be inclined to be vicious ? ... that if you were robbed on the streets, you'd say, take this, take it all, just leave me alone ? ... I dunno about you mate, but I like to think women may be better served learning how to gouge out eyeballs and squeeze nuts in self defence ... I also think we should go down fighting, even if defeat is inevitable ... and it's not that a defeatist character simply sucks either, but the knowledge that we'd go down fighting itself is a deterent too ...</p>
              <p>but yeah, I guess it takes all sorts  ... you're already thinking of giving up even before the war's started, I think we have to fight for what's ours ... if not for the drawings on the map, or even the flag, then certainly, for my family, my loved ones, the things that belongs to me ...</p>
              <p>just remember ... desertion in times of war will get you executed ..</p>
              </div>

              <p>Naive? Hah, look who's talking! I've read a fair bit about warfare, and I have no delusions as to the nature of it. However, in terms of value, Singapore is best left undespoiled. Our people are mostly sheep who follow whatever the rulers say. Any invader looking to squeeze some value out of this place would attempt to keep the occupation civil.</p>
              <p>For an example, look at Germany's occupation of France during World War 2 (Surprise! I know my history!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">) . The French were surprised as to how remarkably civil the German occupying forces were. The trouble only started when the French started to actively resist, being the idiots that they were. If you wish to resist an occupier, do it passively, there's no call to get other people executed for your stupidity. Don't show up to work, do sloppy work when you do, etc etc. That way, nobody gets hurt unless Darth Vader shows up.</p>
              <p>Also, I believe that you have reading comprehension problems. I was going to tell you not to cast aspersions on my 'character', but I doubt you'd understand what I meant. I'm a remarkably amoral person in that I don't believe in intrinsic morality. In my view, there's no black and white, just shades of grey and points of view. People who believe in good and evil probably still believe that babies are delivered by certain subspecies of <em>Ciconiidae </em>(I'm looking at you, conservative Republicans).</p>
              <p>Anyway, the example that you used was quite irrelevant to the matter at hand. A woman fending off a rapist has a decent chance of fending him off. It's her responsibility to resist and ensure that she can escape after incapacitating the attacker if she can do so (Obviously, this doesn't apply if the would-be assailant is 6 foot 6 and has a steel codpiece, which is the situation we're in).</p>
              <p>However, if she's stupid enough to <em>still </em>get caught after doing so, she deserves whatever fate she gets. I shed no tears for such people. These are the sorts who'd try swallowing cyanide just to see if they can vomit it out before it kills them. I'm no misogynist, just a misanthropist.</p>
              <p>As previously mentioned, in Singapore's case, it's not a matter of 'if' as much as 'when'. Most of our would be allies have minimal force projection capabilities. The one that does is bogged down in battles of attrition in the Middle East. Our economy depends on the major shipping lanes, and our most likely opponents have us by the balls in that regard. I'd like to see how well you can fight when you're equipped with twigs and pebbles. From what I know, our 'game plan' against our most likely foe supposedly relies on a massive first strike or counterattack. Bear in mind that pushing things about on a map is far easier than the actual work.</p>
              <p>To make it simpler for you, I'll continue the rape analogy. We're supposed to put all our effort into kicking the guy's groin first. It doesn't say what happens if he has a codpiece, or if he's trained enough to deflect the blow with his thigh. It also says that we'll scream for help, but it doesn't actually say what we should do if there isn't any available. The little old ladies looking out from the nearby apartment block may keep yapping at the rapist while he penetrates the woman, but they're about as useful as lingerie is as an anti-rape device. These little old ladies may eventually get someone down to help, but by then, the act has been committed.</p>

              <p>if your intention is to debate about whether Singapore can survive any aggressor, then we can do this till the cows come home, but of course, the stand that you take in this, really tells a lot about the kind of man that you are ......</p>

              <p>See, people like you are why I'm a misanthropist.</p>
              <p>I guess it's easier to laugh at someone who thinks differently than to sit down and think it through, eh? This just proves that people in Singapore are sheep. They want to conform, and people who're unusual i.e. not stupid get the short end of the stick. 'big words'? Only if you have the brain of a retarded three year old, my friend. I guess you still believe that storks deliver babies, eh?</p>
              <p>Now, on to the argument. Firstly, I resent the imposing of an arbitrary authority on my actions. In order to die on your feet (i.e. fighting), you have to first suck the collective cocks of all your 'superiors' in the military. Dying on your knees is <em>almost </em>equally distasteful, but I know which I'd choose. At any rate, that choice is a false dichotomy (look it up). Present your 'choice' to the many people who continued their daily lives under foreign occupation, and see what they'll say to you. In case you didn't know, it's quite possible to live on in Singapore even when a foreign flag is flying over it. It doesn't make the shit smellier or the food less filling.</p>
              <p>Also, epic reading comprehension fail, anybody? I've never spoken of collaboration, though if I knew you, I'd certainly be tempted. It's already been established that Singapore doesn't have a great deal to muck about with when defending itself, and we can safely assume that our allies already have a great deal of trouble of their own if anybody ever tries to invade us. Go look up 'force projection' before we continue, and tell me if you think we can still afford a conflict. Go compare the dispositions of the forces of our most likely opponents, and our own forces. Look up our daily consumption of food and other essentials, and do some quick mental math (if that's beyond you, I'd suggest suicide). MBTs are extremely iffy to use in tropical conditions, since they bog down extremely often in wet weather. The AMX light tanks that we have are barely capable of standing up to a fart, let alone modern AT weaponry. Ground strike aircraft are going be able to do jack shit against enemy positions in forested areas unless you embark on a massive defoliation programme. <strong>In effect, our military is just there to threaten anybody who attacks with a bloody nose.</strong></p>
              <p>On to your example. Funnily enough, I've noticed that all of them seem to involve rape or some kind of assault on females. You might want to undergo a psych assessment for hidden misogynistic tendencies and rape fetishes.</p>
              <p>I'm guessing that you've <strong>never</strong> had any kind of training in unarmed martial arts or self-defence. Those odds are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>highly</strong></span> unfavourable, and unlike the movies, the 'hero' usually doesn't take one mook down with one hit, and I'm speaking as someone who's tried sparring with multiple people. If you choose to stay and fight, I'll be sure to nominate you for a Darwin Award. If I may say so, you'd stand an excellent chance of winning, since fighting a group of armed men by yourself, with the life and dignity of a female at stake is the epitome of stupidity. They'll cease giving out the awards because nobody is going to be able to top that.</p>
              <p>Anyway, in that situation, I'd make a run for it <strong>with</strong> my female companion. Before that, I'd throw my wallet as far as I can in the opposite direction, and make sure that my companion is ready to bolt as well. If I have to fight to delay my pursuers, I'd do it.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, I'd drop my wallet fairly close to me, and when somebody comes to pick it up, I'd wallop the shit out of the guy and grapple him. His friends can either back off, or watch as I break his bones and joints. It's pretty easy to break a fair number of them, and coincidentally, those are also going to cause a great deal of pain. The elbow, the shinbone, the knee, the feet, the hands and the wrist are all prime targets. I'd bet money that most of them make a nice, satisfying crunching sound as they break.</p>
              <p>From what I've seen, you'd try to resist, get beaten to a pulp, and have your wife get assaulted, robbed and raped too. Get it into your head that foolishness is not bravery. Repeat after me:</p>
              <p>Foolishness is not bravery.</p>
              <p>Foolishness is not bravery.</p>
              <p>Foolishness is not bravery.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Naive? Hah, look who's talking! I've read a fair bit about
              warfare, and I have no delusions as to the nature of it. However,
              in terms of value, Singapore is best left undespoiled. Our people
              are mostly sheep who follow whatever the rulers say. Any
              invader looking to squeeze some value out of this place would
              attempt to keep the occupation civil.</p>
              <p>For an example, look at Germany's occupation of France during
              World War 2 (Surprise! I know my history!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">) . The French were surprised as to how
              remarkably civil the German occupying forces were. The trouble only
              started when the French started to actively resist, being the
              idiots that they were. If you wish to resist an occupier, do it
              passively, there's no call to get other people executed for your
              stupidity. Don't show up to work, do sloppy work when you do, etc
              etc. That way, nobody gets hurt unless Darth Vader shows up.</p>
              <p>Also, I believe that you have reading comprehension problems. I
              was going to tell you not to cast aspersions on my 'character', but
              I doubt you'd understand what I meant. I'm a remarkably amoral
              person in that I don't believe in intrinsic morality. In my
              view, there's no black and white, just shades of grey and points of
              view. People who believe in good and evil probably
              still believe that babies are delivered by certain subspecies
              of <em>Ciconiidae</em> (I'm looking at you,
              conservative Republicans).</p>
              <p>Anyway, the example that you used was quite irrelevant to
              the matter at hand. A woman fending off a rapist has a decent
              chance of fending him off. It's her responsibility to resist and
              ensure that she can escape after incapacitating the attacker if she
              can do so (Obviously, this doesn't apply if the would-be
              assailant is 6 foot 6 and has a steel codpiece, which is the
              situation we're in).</p>
              <p>However, if she's stupid enough to <em>still</em> get caught
              after doing so, she deserves whatever fate she gets. I shed no
              tears for such people. These are the sorts who'd try swallowing
              cyanide just to see if they can vomit it out before it kills them.
              I'm no misogynist, just a misanthropist.</p>
              <p>As previously mentioned, in Singapore's case, it's not a
              matter of 'if' as much as 'when'. Most of our would be allies have
              minimal force projection capabilities. The one that does is bogged
              down in battles of attrition in the Middle East. Our economy
              depends on the major shipping lanes, and our most likely opponents
              have us by the balls in that regard. I'd like to see how well you
              can fight when you're equipped with twigs and pebbles. From what I
              know, our 'game plan' against our most likely foe supposedly relies
              on a massive first strike or counterattack. Bear in mind that
              pushing things about on a map is far easier than the actual
              work.</p>
              <p>To make it simpler for you, I'll continue the rape analogy.
              We're supposed to put all our effort into kicking the guy's groin
              first. It doesn't say what happens if he has a codpiece, or if he's
              trained enough to deflect the blow with his thigh. It also says
              that we'll scream for help, but it doesn't actually say what we
              should do if there isn't any available. The little old ladies
              looking out from the nearby apartment block may keep yapping at the
              rapist while he penetrates the woman, but they're about
              as useful as lingerie is as an anti-rape device. These
              little old ladies may eventually get someone down to help, but by
              then, the act has been committed.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>So you're proposing that we may as well lay back, spread them, say, "Go ahead, rape me" and then hope that we don't get too badly beaten up or killed.</p>
              <p>To be blunt, your morality or lack thereof is irrelevant here.  What you are proposing is against the self-evident laws of nature; any animal would defend itself against attack, be it by means of escape or counterattack.</p>
              <p>If that's not what you're proposing, you're then taking a stand against
              defence without taking a stand for an alternative.  Frankly, that's
              nothing short of intellectual cowardice because it's so much easier to dig your heels in and say no to something than to come up with a solution.</p>

              <p>To ExtraVehicular: I suggest you go and re-read your posts and see how much of the 'ME' concept there is in them. 'ME' referring to you, yourself, and ExtraVehicular.</p>
              <p>Then go ask yourself how much of the 'THEM' concept there is. 'THEM' referring to your family, friends, home, school, your favourite chicken rice stall, and everything that you love so much.</p>
              <p>Do this objectively, and you'll be struck at how much of the former there is - and how little of the latter there is, too.</p>

              <p>Now, on to the argument. Firstly, I resent the
                              imposing of an arbitrary authority on my actions. In order to die
                              on your feet (i.e. fighting), you have to first suck the collective

              <p>That argument is based upon a fallacy, namely that said authority is arbitrary.  The fact of the matter is that the authority is held by persons who have been trained to manage the situation at a higher level than you are, the level being commensurate with the authority held.  Since the authority is based upon the training held by the appointment holders, it is by definition not arbitrary at all.</p>
              <p>That being the case, if you see it as sucking the collective cocks of superiors, the problem is not with the system at all.  The problem, in fact, lies in your lack of grasp of the system's nature, and simply goes to show that you're not as clever as you think.</p>
