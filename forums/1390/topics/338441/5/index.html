              <p>Ooh, no no no no.  Read Tajfel - over the past 50-odd years, his work on social identity has been supported by a substantial body of research.</p>

              <p>If they took a cynic's point of view, they might find that it is
              as irrelevant to their identities as it is to you
              and me. Identity is what you make of it.</p>
              <p>Personally, I think the furore over this is because of the
              human need to dominate and to avoid domination. Being able to put
              one up on anyone by fending an attack off is the equivalent of
              tweaking their nose and 'proving' that you're superior in some
              way.</p>
              <p>However, if you have someone like Gandhi, who steadfastedly
              refused to play the game, it infuriates the players to no small
              extent.</p>
              <p><br> Are we not slaves now? Most of us are trapped in
              an endless cycle of economic bondage that lasts from the
              cradle to the grave.</p>
              <p>You cannot eat freedom, or honor. You cannot heal your wounds
              with them, you cannot breathe it, you cannot fight with it. You've
              never been truly hungry, have you?</p>

              <p>It's the most rudimentary of frameworks, based upon a set of "should" proposals.  That's what makes it impractical.  If you want to get any real work done, deal with "is" rather than "should".</p>

              atrocities happens.</p>
              <p>Osama and his bretherens are fanatics. And i can probably name
              you a hell lot of nations that has the same kind of fanatical
              national armies.  And some of them are not very far away from
              us. So you try to reason with them. hope i don't see you on youtube
              with your head cut off.</p>
              <p>the oppressors have plenty to gain. One i can control the
              population by fear. 2 by restricting their rights their movements i
              can have an iron grip on the population.</p>
              <p>And finally, what makes you think  the next potential enemy
              is not going to be some genocidal wanabe?</p>
              <p>And even if a commander is a nice reasonable man like you, what
              makes you think his men are going to follow his orders?</p>
              <p>There is no such thing as reasonable in war. If there is reason
              in a war, the war wouldn't have started. diplomacy would have
              solved everything. War comes when all forms of reasoning has been
              exhausted and people become brutal.</p>

              <p>Occupiers oppress by definition because they take territory by
              force.  Looks like you're the one who doesn't seem to
              understand who's being oppressed.</p>
              <p>It's ironic that while you rail against the Singaporean
              government for imposing national service on you, you're more than
              happy to let another government in and kowtow to them.</p>
