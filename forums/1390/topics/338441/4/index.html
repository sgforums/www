              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>See, people like you are why I'm a misanthropist.</p>
              <p>I guess it's easier to laugh at someone who thinks differently
              than to sit down and think it through, eh? This just proves that
              people in Singapore are sheep. They want to conform, and people
              who're unusual i.e. not stupid get the short end of the stick. 'big
              words'? Only if you have the brain of a retarded three year old, my
              friend. I guess you still believe that storks deliver babies,
              eh?</p>
              <p>Now, on to the argument. Firstly, I resent the
              imposing of an arbitrary authority on my actions. In order to die
              on your feet (i.e. fighting), you have to first suck the collective
              cocks of all your 'superiors' in the military. Dying on your knees
              is <em>almost </em>equally distasteful, but I know which I'd
              choose. At any rate, that choice is a false dichotomy (look it up).
              Present your 'choice' to the many people who continued their daily
              lives under foreign occupation, and see what they'll say to
              you. In case you didn't know, it's quite possible to live
              on in Singapore even when a foreign flag is flying over it.
              It doesn't make the shit smellier or the food less
              filling.</p>
              <p>Also, epic reading comprehension fail, anybody? I've never
              spoken of collaboration, though if I knew you, I'd certainly be
              tempted. It's already been established that Singapore doesn't have
              a great deal to muck about with when defending itself, and we can
              safely assume that our allies already have a great deal
              of trouble of their own if anybody ever tries to invade us. Go
              look up 'force projection' before we continue, and tell me if you
              think we can still afford a conflict. Go compare the dispositions
              of the forces of our most likely opponents, and our own forces.
              Look up our daily consumption of food and other essentials, and do
              some quick mental math (if that's beyond you, I'd suggest suicide).
              MBTs are extremely iffy to use in tropical conditions, since they
              bog down extremely often in wet weather. The AMX light tanks that
              we have are barely capable of standing up to a fart, let alone
              modern AT weaponry. Ground strike aircraft are going be able to do
              jack shit against enemy positions in forested areas unless you
              embark on a massive defoliation programme. <strong>In
              effect, our military is just there to threaten anybody who
              attacks with a bloody nose.</strong></p>
              <p>On to your example. Funnily enough, I've noticed that all of
              them seem to involve rape or some kind of assault on females. You
              might want to undergo a psych assessment for hidden misogynistic
              tendencies and rape fetishes.</p>
              <p>I'm guessing that you've <strong>never</strong> had any kind of
              training in unarmed martial arts or self-defence. Those odds are
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>highly</strong></span> unfavourable, and unlike the movies, the 'hero' usually doesn't
              take one mook down with one hit, and I'm speaking as someone who's
              tried sparring with multiple people. If you choose to stay and
              fight, I'll be sure to nominate you for a Darwin Award. If I
              may say so, you'd stand an excellent chance of winning, since
              fighting a group of armed men by yourself, with the life and
              dignity of a female at stake is the epitome of stupidity. They'll
              cease giving out the awards because nobody is going to be able to
              top that.</p>
              <p>Anyway, in that situation, I'd make a run for it
              <strong>with</strong> my female companion. Before that, I'd throw
              my wallet as far as I can in the opposite direction, and make sure
              that my companion is ready to bolt as well. If I have to fight to
              delay my pursuers, I'd do it.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, I'd drop my wallet fairly close to me, and when
              somebody comes to pick it up, I'd wallop the shit out of the guy
              and grapple him. His friends can either back off, or watch as I
              break his bones and joints. It's pretty easy to break a
              fair number of them, and coincidentally, those are also going
              to cause a great deal of pain. The elbow, the shinbone, the knee,
              the feet, the hands and the wrist are all prime targets. I'd
              bet money that most of them make a nice, satisfying crunching sound
              as they break.</p>
              <p>From what I've seen, you'd try to resist, get beaten to a
              pulp, and have your wife get assaulted, robbed and raped too.
              Get it into your head that foolishness is not bravery. Repeat after
              me:</p>
              <p>Foolishness is not bravery.</p>
              <p>Foolishness is not bravery.</p>
              <p>Foolishness is not bravery.</p>
              <p>Foolishness is not bravery.</p>
              <p>Foolishness is not bravery.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Corrected. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>I'm completely willing to fight for and die for a cause that I
              believe in, but 'patriotism' is not it. Defending a line in the map
              is not it. Defending a government that I don't particularly like is
              not it.</p>
              <p>If I need to put that in simpler words, do let me know.</p>

              <p>Ah, now we're getting somewhere.  You are then effectively talking about the same thing.  I assume you are looking at it in terms of being physically trapped.  Fatum, on the other hand, is talking about being trapped by his family and friends not being able to escape.  If you didn't insist on being so literal, you might just find yourself in agreement with him.</p>

              <p>Gross oversimplification.  Take any social perspective at random, and you will find that the concept of a country is much more than real estate - it is identity.  Admittedly, in Singapore said identity is still in its infancy, but it is identity nonetheless.</p>
              <p>As I said, I sympathise because Singapore seems to be as irrelevant to your sense of identity as it is to mine, but that does not mean that such a view can justifiably be imposed on anyone else.</p>

                                      security of the occupying forces. The Germans returned the favour
                                      with reprisals, which then led to a vicious cycle.</p>
              <p>When it comes down to it, a country is just a space where a
                                      bunch of people live, there's no need to shed blood over who gets
                                      what.</p>
              <p>You also seem to be labouring under the delusion that any
                                      occupying forces would lay waste to Singapore and destroy all you
                                      love. Seriously, look at what we have. Only an idiot would destroy
                                      the lot. We've got a fairly competent workforce, industry,
                                      strategic location, and docks. The point of conquest of a nation
                                      such as Singapore is not to raze everything, but to obtain our
                                      resources. They're going to want to keep the citizens content,
                                      because having to devote massive resources to systematically
                                      repress insurgents is neither fun or efficient.</p>

              <p>Gross oversimplification.  Take any social perspective at random, and you will find that the concept of a country is much more than real estate - it is identity.  Admittedly, in Singapore said identity is still in its infancy, but it is identity nonetheless.</p>
              <p>As I said, I sympathise because Singapore seems to be as irrelevant to your sense of identity as it is to mine, but that does not mean that such a view can justifiably be imposed on anyone else.</p>

              <p>Ooh, no no no no.  Read Tajfel - over the past 50-odd years, his work on social identity has been supported by a substantial body of research.</p>
              <p>Cynics, by the way, love standing against things because it hides the fact that they don't stand for anything.  They're cowards.</p>
              <p>And speaking as a practicing psychologist, Maslow's stuff is warm and fuzzy, but ultimately has not proven to be substantial enough for any significant practical purposes.  I'd put it in the "outmoded" bin along with Freudian theory.</p>
