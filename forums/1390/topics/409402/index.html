              <p>Hi MOs here,</p>
              <p>       Hey i enlisted in tekong 3 months ago and now I am only left with the last week for high key events. 2 weeks after I enlisted I discovered that my left lower back is constantly in pain, but weirdly, I could still exercise. Later on I had a numbness going through my butt until my heel whenever I carry heavy loads or run for long distances. Then the MO said its called "Sciatica" and told me he suspect that it might be slip disc and my nerve is being pressed on.And thus sent me to MRI.</p>
              <p>       But my reports are constantly SLR 90/90?</p>
              <p>       Right now, after been through field camp, I could still feel the tingling pain/numbness even at rest and have to take Suniton, Difloc sodium, neuroforte and the grey gastric pills just to suppress the pain to a minimum. My next appointment will be on 020910 at KTPH orthopaedic outpatient clinic.</p>
              <p>       I am currently Pes B L1. May I know what might happen next? I don't wish to down pes and OOT when I am only left with 1-2weeks to POP. T.T</p>

              <p>But have you ever thought that after you POP, because of your poor performance in BMT, you might ended up in guards, SIR and other lousy units. You might have more difficulties downgrading in these units. And if you do end up in leadership school can you cope with the physical training?</p>
              <p>Go with the flow. if you need to downgrade, downgrade loh, it do make your life easier later. </p>

              <p>If he have slip disc he can down pes right? But if he down to PES C he might have to recourse BMT. Better complete ur BMT and no more re-course.</p>
              <p>If he down PES to PES E, he gt to go PES E induction programme?</p>

              <p>If your MO is correct, then it is very likely that you will be given PES C9L2. This means that you may need to recourse BMT if you happen to OOT now. You may want to speak to your PC or OC on this. I believe he may be able to help you.</p>

              <p>should be fine, your next appointment is this coming week, and even if MO decides to downgrade you, it won't be that fast, nothing ever is in the SAF.</p>
              <p>but most probable case would be that ur next checkup will not fully determine your injury so you will need subsequent checkups, by which then you should already have poped. which also means you're safe from thereon to downgrade without having to re-bmt again.</p>

              <p>OK the result is back. All my high keys done, got company best shot and left 3 weeks to POP.</p>
              <p>I got diagnosed with a degenerated spine disc L5S1. Thats causing the pain. I can't even stand the tonner when its going through rough terrain sia.</p>
              <p>OC say he will block OOT for me, he say it doesn't make sense to OOT me. The MO forced me to sign the MMI and OOT forms straight after I showed him my specialist letter.</p>
              <p>So now, as TooFree have said. I am permanent company line cleaner.</p>
              <p>Everyone like told me I could only become a clerk sia, even the MO said something like so. Can anyone tell me what other vocations I should be expecting after POP?</p>

              <p><br>It is likely to be C9L2 which is the same case as mine.</p>
              <p>My slipped disc occured at L4 and L5. Started off with degenerated disc but it will get worsen if you continued to exert pressure due to weights and postures. However, you can still go for non-invasive operation to remove the disc if the pain is unbearable even after painkillers and physiotherapy program.</p>
              <p>Since you are still in your NSF term, get a specialist from outside (not your M.O.) so that the downgrade process is faster. You will need to go for a MRI first and a downgrade recommendation letter from the Orthopaedic Specialist.</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, protect yourself. Slipped disc can stay with you forever (even if you go for an op, it might still occur again) and my advice to you is to seek treatment early.</p>

              <p>Thanks I didn't know that degenerated disc can become slipped disc.. As for heavy loads, I have not been carrying them since I signed the OOT form given by the MO.</p>
              <p>I am more concerned about what vocation will I be getting next, and whether is it a stay-out post. Cuz if it is a stay out I would be going to do an ACCA course.</p>
              <p>Thanks for the concern yeah.</p>

              <p>Well since u already OOT, then most likely you be in Tekong for the time being until further notice, you can be posted to lot of units....whether stay in or out, it's depend on unit policy, but for service personels stay out chances are high. But I think u should noe by now, since u never completed BMT, u cannot be promoted. That's why most people would like to completed BMT then downgrade in unit.</p>

              <p>Hmmm nope I will most likely to POP cuz I am only left with 3 weeks and SAF takes freaking long to process things.</p>
              <p>My company mate had handed in the OOT form 1 month eariler than me but yet he is still in the company.</p>
              <p>I think its highly because that we have both completed field camp, BTP and passed IPPT already which met the requirements for passing out.</p>
              <p>Even as my OC had said, it is insensible for him to put me Out-Of-Training when I have already completed all of the training. Thus, he said that there will be a very high chance that I can POP.</p>
              <p>Furthermore I dun think that I will down pes so soon, maybe only after 2 months from now.</p>

              <p>Ok...since u will most likely be POP, then I would advice u to see the MO in the new unit, to ensure u get medically boarded. You should know by now, SAF can have lot of admin lapse especially transferring unit is involved.</p>
