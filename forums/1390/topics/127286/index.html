            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, say one day you are on Mob and you are called back to deal with say 10000 peaceful protestors just sitting infront of parliament. Parliament in currently in session, and the protestors are calling for the resignation of the Trade and Industry minister who they feel was responsible for a recent industrial accident that resulted in the deaths of 100s.<br><br>Orders are to disperse them through use of non lethal force. However, they are proving to be very resilent and have vowed to stay until the government addresses their grievances. CS gas, water cannons and Rubber grenades have been deployed angering the protestors and they are now threatening to storm parliament.<br><br>You are part of a security force tasked with preventing people from breaching parliament. Use of deadly force has now been authorised.<br><br>Will you shoot these protestors? I have heard many instances of ppl here who say that they will fight only for their families and friends.<br><br>Personally, i would have a lot of problems shooting these people...<br><br>MODS: If you feel this topic touches on issues that are too sensitive, then feel free to delete the topic. Shoot me a PM though. Thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>after an internal discussion, i think this thread can be reopened.<br><br>the topic is debatable. and anyway, we can widen the scope too:<br><br>say during an operation, if you discover that your peers intend to desert or even deflect. what would you do if the situation between yourself and them heats up? at the extreme, would you shoot any one of them?<br><br>and what about if someone is spreading rumours amongst your troops, and causing morale and discipline problems, also during operations?<br><br>or maybe, under what circumstances would shooting one's own guy(s) be acceptable to you?<br><br>anyway, if this thread eventually goes no where, or just dwells in a certain direction, then we would close it again.</div>
