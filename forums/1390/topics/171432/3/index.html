"until the MC ends", but in practice servicemen have been asked to book in the night of their last day of MC.<br><br>I think lately this practice has been changed to requiring them to book in next morning.<br><br>"may remain at home and rest", it does not specify if serviceman must STRICTLY stay home and rest with provisions for meals.<br><br>"may be required to endorse"...  it never state if the MC has to be endorsed on the day the serviceman returns after his MC ends, or he can be called back to first endorse the MC and then use his MC.</div></blockquote>wrong..<br>to sum it off, the GOM stated that as long as the unit deemed fit, the unit can restrict the serviceman to report sick in medical centres only.<br><br>for endorsement of MCs by MO, is anything more than 3 days MC.

            <div class='col-md body'>My viewpoint is that if you have an MC, then you're expected to stay at home for the duration of the MC. Of course, it doesn't strictly mean that you should confine yourself to the four walls of your home... going to the nearby coffeeshop to buy supper or something should still be ok.<br><br>I remember being called on my handphone by my COS once while I was on ATTC. He had called my home phone, and my sis told him that I was outside. The COS said that my Encik was angry with me for not staying at home, but I managed to explain to him that I was outside only to buy supper from a nearby coffeeshop (which was completely true). I managed to convince him - nothing happened to me. I guess it helps not to be an MC king.<br><br>That said, going shopping at Orchard Road, chionging at MoS, or soccer at a nearby field is a definite no-no if you're on MC. If you're fit enough to do all that, then you're fit enough to return to camp.<br><br>If you want to skip duties because you want to go out with your gf or something, for goodness' sake, exchange duties with someone else. If you can't find someone else, then bo pian just do your duty. To take MCs at every whim and fancy when you're not actually sick is extremely selfish to other people who have to carry out your duties in your place.</div>
