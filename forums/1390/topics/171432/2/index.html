So he got himself 3 confinements which he intentionally booked medical appointments on those days.<br><br>So we tell him to book out and come back for confinement after the appointment. But this @sshole get MC during the appointment.<br><br>Then the MC would extend till monday or tuesday.<br><br>So we did spot check during his MC and we are ready to collect evidence already.<br><br>Called him twice, his mom pick up saying he went to lunch. Then a couple of mins after hanging up, he would call camp and say he is out for lunch. So we asked him to call from HOME to PC's handphone in 30 mins.<br><br>He did.<br><br>But we wanted to recommend him for BMT recourse, we looked thru the records and he showed only 30% attendance.<br><br>Brought matter up to CO, CO just say let him go!!!!!<br><br>We (OC, PC, PS, Sgts) looked damn stupid man!!!</div>

"until the MC ends", but in practice servicemen have been asked to book in the night of their last day of MC.<br><br>I think lately this practice has been changed to requiring them to book in next morning.<br><br>"may remain at home and rest", it does not specify if serviceman must STRICTLY stay home and rest with provisions for meals.<br><br>"may be required to endorse"...  it never state if the MC has to be endorsed on the day the serviceman returns after his MC ends, or he can be called back to first endorse the MC and then use his MC.</div>

Gave me 2 months mc and painkillers. he advised me to go swimming to build up my lungs. So basically during the 1st 2 weeks of my mc, i am in pain, but i have recovered since. The bad thing is, i dont know when my lungs will collapse again..</div>
