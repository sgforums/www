              <p>Hello everyone,</p>
              <p>I stumbled on to this forum whilst trawling the web for information relating to the topic title - an issue I'm now realising is a growing one. Hopefully I'll get some decent advice &amp; not too much flaming/trolling.</p>
              <p>Here's my situation. I'm 26, a Brit &amp; government worker. I was born in London to my Singaporean father (no idea what my mum was then but she's from HK though she now has a Sing passport) &amp; was given Singaporean citizenship apparently. I held my Brit one too &amp; looking at my first passports my parents used them interchangeably up until 1988 after that it was only ever my Brit one. My family moved to Singapore before my 1st birthday &amp; but by the time I was 3 I was back in the UK in Scotland. I've not been a resident in Singapore since then &amp; I think I've only visited 2 or 3 times since then. I have very little contact with family from there since my parents split when I was 10 &amp; I have grown up in the UK mainly. I was sent my Singaporean passport &amp; citizenship certificate thing by my dad about 2 years ago &amp; back then I remember reading it &amp; the bit about oaths of allegiance or renunciation before my 22nd &amp; thought nothing of it as I was already 24 &amp; didn't really care about it to be blunt.</p>
              <p>However there is a remote possibility if I get to certain branches of my current career I may find myself being part of a politician's entourage &amp; I'd rather be a "can do" kind of guy &amp; not have to say "Sorry boss can't go near Singapore". That &amp; my brother who I'm quite close to, is working there now &amp; I may miss him enough to visit some day! So I went along to the Singaporean Consulate here in London today &amp; was told all sorts of scary sounding things like NS duties, arrests &amp; mega-fines, then I was told to email the Mindef to start sorting things out.</p>
              <p>I have never known much about Singapore besides the little history bits in Wikipedia :P But having googled search terms "NS, dual citizenship" I've built a pretty bleak picture with that story of the 3 Norwegian guys popping up &amp; a whole lot of stuff about Singapore not recognising dual nationality - what are the chances of me being able visit without being in trouble? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks in advance for reading,</p>
              <p>NW3</p>

              <p>The question is, do you have a pink IC? Do you have a singapore NRIC no.? Do you recognised yourself as a Singaporean? </p>
              <p>Personally, I think you are born in London and have a British citizenship. Your stand should be you are a British citizen. And Singapore is a country of visit which is no different from China, Malaysia and any other country.</p>
              <p>Is there such a form to renounce Singapore citizenship? Just fill it up. It is an administration issue. </p>

              <p>Thanks for the replies everybody. Instead of calling them I emailed the NS address first because I think it was some silly o'clock in SG at the time &amp; have got some kind of reply from one of their staff &amp; will now just wait for them to get in touch as they said they will.</p>
              <p>@Lokey - No I don't have an identity card (thats IC right?) &amp; have no clue what NRIC without resorting to a google search so am assuming I don't have that either. I have never seen myself as Singaporean - pretty much exactly as you described in your reply there.</p>
              <p>Also I thought it was just a case of filling out a form but apparently not :/ </p>
              <p>Hope I don't end up having to meet my bro in Malaysia if I want to visit - not that there's anything wrong with Malaysia!</p>

              <p>Those who are liable to serve national service but refuse are
              charged under the Enlistment Act. If convicted, they face three
              years' imprisonment and a fine of S$10,000.</p>
              <p>Controversy arose when the penalties were increased in January
              2006 after <a title="Melvyn Tan" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvyn_Tan">Melvyn
              Tan</a>, who was born in Singapore, received a fine for defaulting
              on his National Service obligations. Tan left for <a title="London" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London">London</a> to study music during his enlistment age and
              later acquired British nationality. In <a title="Parliament of Singapore" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore">parliament</a>, Defence Minister <a title="Teo Chee Hean" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teo_Chee_Hean">Teo Chee Hean</a> provided some illustration of the
              punishments defaulters would face:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the default period exceeds two years but the defaulter is
              young enough to serve his full-time and operationally ready NS
              duties in full, MINDEF will press for a short jail sentence.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot serve his
              full-time NS in a combat vocation or fulfil his operationally ready
              NS obligations in full, a longer jail sentence to reflect the
              period of NS he has evaded may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot be called
              up for NS at all, a jail sentence up to the maximum of three years
              may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Each year, a small number of people are convicted for their
              failure to enlist or refusal to be conscripted. Most of them were
              <a title="Jehovah's Witnesses" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, who are usually
              court-martialled and sentenced to three years' imprisonment, but
              they are usually held in a low-security detention facility and
              separated from other conscription offenders. The government does
              not consider <a title="Conscientious objector" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector">conscientious objection</a> to be a legal
              reason for refusal to serve NS.</p>

              me thinks its the food they eat.
              
              look at spicy food countries indonsesia and malaysia.u rarely have a revolt cept once in like 50 years.
              
              
              now goto countries like china or england or arab regions where the food is usually not really spicy or simply sour n less spicy.u gey more political revolts cuz food isnt that great satifying both mind n palette.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Whatever the consulate told u is correct.  If u did not serve NS at the appropriate age then u have broken the law.  Unless u want to return to Singapore to serve NS, then just dont bother trying to visit the country cos technically u r still a Singaporean regardless of ur UK passport.  In Singapore, obtaining another citizenship does not automatically make u a non Singaporean,  U must go in to ICA to renounce ur SIngapore citizenship.  Otherwise the Singapore govt treats u as a Singaporean and disregards ur UK citizenship.  If u step into Singapore and something happens to u, the UK govt can help.   Take this matter very seriously and dont even try to step into SIngapore no matter what u read on the web cos u already passed the age to renounce ur citizenship and u did not, so technically u failed to report for ur NS obligation when u should have and u will be on radar wanted list.</p></div>
