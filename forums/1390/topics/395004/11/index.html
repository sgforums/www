              <p>I actually have MC right now till tuesday. I had a fever of 39C
              today when I went to get looked at by the doctor. So I get to rest
              for the next few days. Being sick like this makes everything hurt
              more.</p>
              <p>So the time between getting recommended for a pes downgrade and
              actually getting a pes downgrade varies right? 1month-3months?
              Between that time what will i be doing, sai-kang?</p>

              <p>Do get more rest and drink more water. Your fever may have something to do with your arm.</p>
              <p>Anyway, unfortunately, what you said is true. Between the period when your MO push up your case and when you actually get down-pes, you will be considered healthy and just excused from HL/UL. If your MO does not write anything for you, you will be in quite a fix. Besides sai-kang, you will be expected to participate in all activities which has nothing to do with what your commanders deem as "carrying heavy load".</p>

              <p>100% sure that my arm has nothing to do with my fever. My arm has been like this for 2 weeks already, while my fever just started two days ago.</p>
              <p>But when the MO pushes my case up for down-pes, doesn't he make me sign a form for OOT? I guess I'll have to ask my specialist to be very specific.</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I greatly appreciate this giant faq about pes statuses. But I am
              in quite a situation right now.</p>
              <p>I enlisted into BMT in early november 2010, and after the first
              two weeks I developed a progressively painful sensation in my left
              shoulder. It started out to be only when I lifted heavy weights or
              tried to put my arm above paralell to the ground. But now it has
              progressed into feeling pain with just about doing nothing ie.
              lying down, standing, sitting. What's worse is that the MO gave me
              excuse UL/HL and I was still made to carry full jerry cans, stand
              for the duration of the entire PT session, carry my field pack
              which made the pain increase. I can't even hold my rifle properly
              because my left arm can't take the weight.</p>
              <p>I reported to MO three times, 1st time he gave me panadol, 2nd
              he gave me physio, 3rd was to deliver my specialists letter. My
              specialist said that the bones in my shoulder blade are misaligned.
              I had no idea about this, as I've never experienced any pain or
              this sensation before in my life. I enlisted as PES A status, and
              now I can't even wear my black sling bag on my left shoulder
              without immense pain.</p>
              <p>I talked it over with my parents/friends/relatives and have come
              to a conclusion that screwing up a body part, which will most
              definitly be permanent if I continued BMT is not worth a life full
              of pain.</p>
              <p>I just completed my MRI a few days ago to make sure it's nothing
              worse then a bone misalignment, if it is then I'm SOL =\. The
              specialist said it will takes months of physio to reduce the pain
              significantly, and that it would be absurd to return to the safe
              physical level of activity. Over my short stay in BMT I also
              developed these rashes on my back whenever I slept, I suspect it's
              may be caused by a dust allergy. I'm planning on going to an
              allergist soon to get this tested. If it comes back positive, what
              will happen to me?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Summary:<br> Shoulder blade misalignment causes me great pain: Heavy weights,
              running, prolonged standing (5-10minutes), wearing iLBV, field
              pack, black sling bag), sleeping (woke up many times because of
              rolling onto my shoulder, or being on my back for too long).</p>
              <p>May have a dust allergy that I didn't know I had.</p>
              <p>If I had known about any of these conditions I would have
              presented them to CMPB during my medical check. I'd also like to
              know, since I've finished my college degree, what PES/Vocation is
              most likely for me to be assigned to?</p>

              <p>Dear pringo,</p>
              <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I would like to share with you about my condition which is very similar to yours. I just had an arthroscopic surgery on my left shoulder on 1st Oct. I have been injured since May 2010.</p>
              <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Firstly, 6 out of 10 scale for pain is a bad sign. I told my physiotherapist the same thing, 6 out of 10 when doing nothing, 8-9 out of 10 if I were to carry any objects. As for me, I had cracking sensations on my left shoulder for 2 weeks with the fact that dislocation is ruled out based on the x-ray scan. 2 weeks of pain as simple as sitting, standing, esp sleeping is alarming. I couldn't help that the inflammation spreads to my entire left arm and my left side of my neck. I guess you might have a ligament or tendon tear.Your misaligned shoulder blade may be the fact that the mechanism in your shoulder joint is not normal and has recently caused your ligament or tendon to tear abit, thus causing the inflammation pain in your left shoulder.</p>
              <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Secondly, your health is utmost important above everything else. If you are made to do sai kang, always fight for your health. Don't give in to your commanders' pressure. Sad to say for my case, even my camp MO and my OC does not understand that with one injured shoulder (arm) , they pressume you can use the right arm to carry things. Bullshit. You might overuse your right healthy arm. Even my camp MO finds me alright to continue as a temp storeman. Once your MRI scan shows something that is quite serious, just endorse, surely OOT, get a downgrade. You can recourse another time when you are well. </p>
              <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Thirdly, if the MRI scan shows a ligament or tendon tear, physiotherapy sessions will not work because the exercises only strengthens and prevent your left shoulder from stiffening. Ligaments or tendons do not heal on their own. Surgery is required to mend the tear. It takes 6 months to recovery for shoulder surgery conditions.</p>
              <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Now, I hope that you will get posted to a clerical job. My specialist always checks on me to ensure that I do clerical job because you should know very well that all vocations also cannot except ASA.</p>
              <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>

              <p>If you don't re-BMT straight away, you will be posted to a unit.</p>
              <p>In your case, where cannot lift up things, I believe you will likely be a clerk if you get down-Pes.</p>
              <p>And yes, you will be recruit all the way till you complete your re-BMT, after which they will promote you straight to CPL.</p>
              <p>Being unable to hold a rifle properly will likely affect your vocation rather than your Pes if sounded out by the spec - the biggest factor which will affect your Pes is clearly your arm, or rather how bad it actually is.</p>

              <p>very simple question here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We know that for enlistees, the new pes B2 will be used to replace pes C1 with effect from June 2010.</p>
              <p>Just interested to know what happens to the Pes status of Pes C1 ppl who ORDed since June 2010.</p>
              <p>Since the pes C1 no longer exist, will the existing pes C1 personels upgrade to the new B2 pes upon ording? or will they retain their "unique" status? or is the "upgrade" only available upon request?</p>

              i saw Pes E9 personnel still being called back in my unit ICT
              
              I think it was because they were downgraded after being posted to this camp
              
              and they had to wake up with rest of the battalion at 5.30, and stay in with them during the entire ICT

              <p>What excuse you have depends on your medical condition rather than your Pes.</p>
              <p>Being E9L9 means that you are almost certainly a clerk or storeman, with the former one more likely the case. </p>
              <p>Clerks wear No.3 and storeman wear No.4, so no excuse of uniform.</p>

              <p>Nope. I am Pes C9 L2. I dont need take IPPT since NSF times. I dont like being called back because it is a waste of time. Before the ICT, I need to arrange my work and so many administrations. After 3 weeks, my work piled up and I have to clear like crazy, apologizing to every1 under the sun that I am on ICT. And seriously, SAF really call me back to use eye power. It is only wasting my time, other people's times and taxpayers's money.

              <p>Yes, you are allowed to return home. NS is not prison. for BMT, you can only go home after spending 2 weekends. After that, you get to go home every weekend.</p>
              <p>and if you happen to end up in an 8-5 vocation after bmt, you get to go home everyday.<span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;"><br></span><strong><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;"> <br> 2) Are we allowed to have study part-time during NS?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">Yes you may, but subjected to superior approval and the condition that you are in a 8-5 job which allows you to book out everyday.<br></span><strong><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;"> <br> 3) May I know what is an 8-5 unit?</span></strong></p>
              <p>There is no 8-5 units, but 8-5 jobs. you report for work at 8am, and go home at 5pm.<strong><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;"><br> <br> 4) I currently am wearing brown spectacles. Is it compulsory for
              all<br> bespectacled NS men to wear black spectacles?</span></strong></p>
              <p>yes and no. you can wear any spectacles you like, but when you go outfield for exercises, you are required to wear black plastic specs.</p>
              <p><strong>5) If I get Silver or Gold for NAPFA and I'm in PES C or E, do I
              still get the 2 month reduction from full time NS? </strong></p>
              <p>no 2 month reduction for pes C and E. but if you are pes B, but downpes to C and below during NS, you will still get to enjoy the 2 month reduction</p>
              <p><strong>6) Can I bring the following items during enlistment day or into
              camp: </strong></p>
              <p><strong>- mp3, mp3 charger, Metal retainers for braces, health
