              <p><span><strong>Pre-enlistment Medical Screening</strong><br> <br> Prior to enlistment, all pre-enlistees have to undergo a thorough
              medical examination at the Medical Classification Centre (MCC)
              within the Central Manpower Base (CMPB). This examination allows
              the medical fitness of a pre-enlistee to be assessed and this
              subsequently determines his Physical Employment Status (PES).<br> <br> <strong>Medical Screening Appointment Preparations</strong><br> <br> As part of the e-documentation, you are also required to select
              your preferred medical appointment date as well as to complete the
              medical questionnaire (e7F). You will need to go through the
              medical questionnaire form with your parents / guardian so that
              useful medical information about you is captured.<br> <br> To ensure that your medical experience with us is pleasant and that
              the overall screening process is not unnecessarily delayed, we have
              compiled a checklist for you:<br> <br></span></p>
              <ol>
              <li><span>Print out a copy of the medical questionnaire (e7F) and
              ensure that your parent / guardian and you <strong>sign</strong> on
              the printed document. Bring the e7F on the day of your medical
              appointment at MCC.</span></li>
              </ol> <ol>
              <li>Avoid wearing contact lenses. Wear your spectacles as you will
              be required to undergo eye checks.</li>
              </ol> <ol>
              <li>Wear loose fitting clothes (e.g. shorts) to facilitate physical
              examination.</li>
              </ol> <ol>
              <li>Bring along any medical documents to support your existing

              pass.)<br> <br> <strong>Clinical Laboratory Station</strong><br> <br> At the Clinical Laboratory Station blood samples are drawn for
              G6PD, haemoglobin and blood group typing tests. Simple urine tests
              to detect the presence of blood, protein and glucose (sugar) will
              also be carried out for you at the Station.<br> <br> <strong>Dental Station</strong><br> <br> At the Dental Station, the Dental Officer will carry out an oral
              examination and Dental Charting. A Dental X-ray or
              Orthopantomography (OPG) will also be conducted.<br> <br> <strong>X- ray Station</strong><br> <br> A Chest x-ray (CXR) screening will also be conducted for you at the
              X-ray Station for the radiological assessment of your heart and
              lungs.<br> <br> <strong>Eye Station</strong><br> <br> At the Eye Station routine eye tests are carried out to detect eye

              <p><strong>What is Medical Referral Management System
              (MRS)?</strong><br>        <br> The Medical Referral Management System or MRS is designed for the
              pre-enlistee to perform some of the medical services prior to the
              completion of his medical investigation. In particular, the
              pre-enlistee can update the outcome of his medical appointment,
              apply for a Letter Of Identity (LOI), be reminded of any
              outstanding actions that have to be undertaken by the pre-enlistee
              and find out his latest PES status.<br> <strong><br> What is a Letter Of Identity (LOI)?</strong><br>        <br> It is a form that is issued to the pre-enlistee for every
              appointment. Upon presentation to the hospital, it would waive
              payment up to the point of diagnosis. It is to note that any
              appointment made for purposes of treatment would NOT be paid for
              and shall be borne by the pre-enlistee.<br> <br> <strong>What is a Further Reporting Order (FRO)?</strong><br>        <br> The pre-enlistee is to note that under the Enlistment Act,
              specified in the FRO, he is obliged to attend all appointment as
              required. Under no circumstances is he to default any
              appointment.<br> <br> The FRO also serves as a reminder to the pre-enlistee the details
              to his medical appointment and specify the documents that are
              issued to him or important instructions that he is to take note
              of.<br> <br> <strong>What is a Progress Report on Patient's Medical Status
              (PR)?</strong><br>        <br> This form when completed by the attending doctor at the hospital
              and accurately transcribed onto the electronic version on MRS would
              facilitate MCC in deciding if the pre-enlistee has completed his
              hospital medical appointments.</p>
              <p><strong>I have been referred to the hospital after being seen by
              the Medical Officers at Medical Classification Centre. What are the
              things that I have to take note of?</strong></p>
              <p>You are expected to be punctual and attend your appointment. The
              Letter Of Identity (LOI) is to be presented at the point of
              registration and Referral Letter must be submitted to the attending
              doctor. The doctor is to complete the Progress Report on Patient's
              Medical Status (PR) and hand it back to you after every
              consultation.<br> Please refer to the Further Reporting Order (FRO) for a list of
              other documents that you have to bring to the hospital.<br> <br> <strong>I have attended my hospital medical appointment. What do I
              have to do next?</strong><br>        <br> You are to log onto you MRS account and validate the LOI (confirm
              the attendance of your medical appointment). You can do so by
              either clicking the "Validate LOI" button on the menu bar or the
              row specifying the appointment that you are going to confirm.<br> <br> <strong>What am I to do with the Progress Report on Patient's
              Medical Status (PR)?</strong><br> <br> For every follow-up appointment, you would be issued with a
              Progress Report through MRS. You are to bring with you to the
              hospital appointment and get the attending doctor to complete. You
              are to translate this onto the PR that is available in MRS before
              you can apply for a new LOI (if necessary).<br> <br> <strong>I have another hospital appointment to attend. Can I apply
              for a new Letter Of Identity (LOI)?</strong><br>        <br> Yes you can apply provided the appointment is only for
              investigations up to the point of diagnosis. The LOI is not
              applicable for any appointment that allows you to seek
              treatment.<br> <br> To apply for a LOI, you must first complete the Progress Report on
              Patient's Medical Status.<br> <br> MCC reserves the right not to pay for any of your appointment
              should it be found to be for other causes other than for
              investigative purposes.<br> <br> <strong>What do I have to bring when I attend my hospital
              appointment?</strong><br>        <br> After you have successfully applied for your LOI, the system would
              generate a list of documents for you to print. Of these, you are to
              bring with you the Letter Of Identity (LOI), and Progress Report on
              Patient's Medical Status (PR).<br> <br> The LOI is to be presented to the hospital at the point of
              registration. The PR is to be completed by the attending doctor and
              handed back to you.<br> <br> <strong>I have completed all hospital appointments and MRS informed
              me that MCC would request for medical report from the (hospital)
              doctor and review my medical status. I am to login in 2 months time
              to check on my final PES status. Why does it take so
              long?</strong><br>        <br> MCC would need to request for the medical report on your behalf
              from the hospital. This would take some time, including time for
              MCC medical officer to review the report and determine if the
              investigations done would affect the final outcome of your
              condition and PES status.<br> <strong><br> I have been referred by MCC to the hospital for medical
              investigation(s). Who would be paying for the hospital
              expenses?</strong><br>        <br> The initial referral would be made by MCC. You are required to
              update the outcome of your appointment and apply for a new LOI
              through MRS. This LOI, when produced at the hospital, would waive
              all medical expenses for you up to the point of diagnosis. The
              hospitals would then bill MCC directly for payment of your
              appointment.<br> <br> MCC reserved the right not to pay / reimburse you for your medical
              expenses if you are found to have not updated your status via MRS
              or referral is not made for the conditions that you have undergone
              investigations/ treatment.<br> <br> This would be considered on a case-by-case basis.<br> <strong><br> What should I do if I have developed new medical conditions after I
              have been assigned a PES status?</strong><br>        <br> You can request to see the medical officers at MCC. To facilitate
              them in further understanding your medical condition, you are to
              produce any medical report that would provide further insight to
              your condition.</p>
              <p><strong>What are the types of potential medical appointments
              that I may have to go?</strong><br>        <br> There are 2 types of medical appointments that are available to
              you.<br> <br> Internal medical appointment refers to those that you have to MCC
              to complete your investigations.<br> <br> External medical appointment refers to those that you have to
              complete your investigations at a location other than MCC. They are
              usually done at the (restructured) hospitals or Military Medical
              Institute (MMI).</p>

              <span><strong>MCC Eye Clinic</strong><br> <br> The Specialist Eye Clinic at MCC provides medical assessment for
              eye conditions. An appointment will be made for you during the
              screening procedure should it be deemed necessary. Please bring all
              documents regarding any known eye condition for your
              appointment.<br> <strong><br> MCC ENT (Ear, Nose and Throat) Clinic)</strong><br> <br> The Specialist ENT Clinic provides pre-enlistment assessment for

              suitability of a pre-enlistee with regard to psychiatric conditions
              already known or discovered during the screening process. It is
              essential to have one parent accompany you should an appointment be
              made for you and it would greatly shorten the delay to enlistment
              if you bring all your pre-existing psychiatric medical records for
              your appointment.<br> <br> <strong>MCC Specialist Orthopedic Clinic</strong><br> <br> The specialist orthopedic clinic has the purpose of grading a
              pre-enlistee with regard to any orthopedic problems. A medical
              officer will be in attendance together with a senior doctor from
              one of the restructured hospitals. Here we will grade you based on
              your orthopedic problems. Please bring all medical reports and
              X-ray films for this visit.<br> <br> <strong>Medical Review</strong><br> <br> A pre-enlistee with any abnormalities noted during the medical
              screening will be required to undergo medical review. This can take
              several forms as appropriately decided by the Medical
              Officer.<br> <br> <strong>Referral to SAF Military Medicine Institute (MMI) /
              Government / Restructured Hospitals</strong><br> <br> The pre-enlistee may be referred to SAF MMI, government /
              restructured hospitals for further investigations. If the referral
              is required, he will be given a set of documents to bring along as
              well as information regarding the date, time and
              venue.</span></div>

              <p>Dear MO,</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Hi i got some questions that has been bothering me badly. I am PES A.</span></p>
              <p>I've seen private psychiatrist and prescribe me a couple of medication to curb my anxiety/major depressive disorders.</p>
              <p>It has affected me 3-4weeks.</p>
              <p>Camp MO know about my condition due to endorsement of my MCs. (few weeks of MC)</p>
              <p>Q1) Without memo but with genuine conditions, will he report it to medical board and by any chance get a downpes from there?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q2) MO refered me to see SAF PSY, but was denied</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q3) I managed to get a SAF PSY appointment anyway, and i got my medical report to submit.</p>
              <p>What do you think the chances of downpes is? Perm/temp PES? What pes? How long will it take for the verdict? How long will it take to revocate?</p>

              <p>1. As the saying goes, "No specialist memo, no talk. Got specialist memo, got talk."</p>
              <p>2. It does not meant anything.</p>
              <p>3. It is within PES C to E range. It is up to Medical Board Chairman to decide.</p>

              <p>Hi eac, </p>
              <p>I just went for my medical review today, my pes status currently is 6months temp pes C9L3. Previously when I went to cmpb to do my pre-enlistment checkup I had a specialist letter stating that I'm known to suffer from bronchial asthma and the condition is under control and I'm under</p>
              <p>1.Seretide (250) Acuhaler</p>
              <p>2. Nasonex </p>
              <p>3. Singulair 10mg</p>
              <p>So the mo made me do a asthma survey form, the one asking about the condition and adds up the total points I got and I scored a point of 22. The mo said I should be fit and made me sign a form to refer my case to medical board. I told him I'm still under those medication as mentioned and I'm still seeing my specialist. So what I'm wondering is what will happen next, my pes status remains extended as temp, my pes status gets perm or my pes gets upgraded? </p>
              <p>Thank you for your help doc </p>
