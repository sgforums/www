              permanently to PES C9L9. I have been calling up NS.sg and all
              advises me to report to my unit and it’s up to their discretion if
              I would be re-vocationalise. Last that I checked with my unit, my
              vocation is still an Infantry soldier.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">So my unit has

              be an Infantry soldier even when I am downgraded to C9L9? Isn’t

              <p>I dont think webbing toes is a cosmetical condition. In fact, it is a foot defect. Should have report to MO during CMPB check up.</p>
              <p>Normal walking may be ok. But if you are carrying 35 kg backpack and march for 32 km in boots,  your feet might give some problem. You might be surprised that there are people who can do this, without any problem. And still can go shopping at Suntec the next day.</p>

I got a really bad conjunctivitis years back and after it was treated, ive been experiencing extreme sensitivity to light that will cause migraine after 5 minutes out under the sunlight. So as i were enlisted for NS on the 8th of Dec, decided to see if my eyes are okay. Went to the SNEC Balestiar Branch, and they told me my eyes are complicated and they referred me to SNEC Outram. A specialist checked on me and wrote a memo saying that i have a chronic bilateral eye disease that needs regular follow up. It also includes my sensitivity to light. Diagnosis: Meibomian Gland Dysfunction. Went to see MO at CMPB and gave it to him, and all he said was my eyes are normal. He said this is a normal disease and i'm not deemed eligible for a down pes. Thing is, i have to return to see the specialist every 2 weeks once, and i got all those kinds of medication which aren't affective to my eyes somehow. When i told the specialist of getting a memo, he said he will write me one (which he did) and on my next appointment on the 29th he will write me another. So what should i do? What should i tell the specialist? i really cant take the light. even when i'm under a shade outdoor i have to barely open my eyes. Under direct sunlight, its torturous and i will just fall sick with migraine.</p></div>
