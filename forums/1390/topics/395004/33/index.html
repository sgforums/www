                                  <p>I was initially enlisted with a PES of E9L9 Temp 6 months.</p>
                  <p>And I managed to siam the review till this week (17 months after
                  enlistment and the start of my PES E9L9), when my S1 sent a mail to
                  my direct superior, asking them to make sure I go for my
                  review.</p>
                  <p>So no choice, I went for review with my already-prepared doc's
                  memo. Then the MO was quite friendly, chatted with me, then read
                  his bible, then entered "MBIA PES E1L9 PERM blah blah blah" into
                  the system and then got me to sign the MB form.</p>
                  <p>Here are my questions:</p>
                  <p>1. When is the MB conducted every month?</p>
                  <p>2. Usually will the MB approve the PES recommended by the MO for
                  most of time?</p>
                  <p>3. Since I am technically up-pes-ed from E9 to E1, will there be
                  any difference? I'm assuming since both are E, there are no
                  difference since I'm an ASA.</p>
                                </div>
                              </blockquote><br>
                  E9L9 and E1L9 not much difference one.
                  
                  PES E only vocation normally is clerk or storeman.
                  
                  Most likely u stay as a ASA.
              
              Medical board is every month one time. Most likely the Medical board will approve, don't worry.

              <p>Most likely is pes B. For IBS, there is different grade. So usually most people have mild IBS. Unless IBS develops to become IBD in later life.</p>
              <p>Tachycardia is not a disease. It is a symptom. Unless you are having the HR at 140 per minute at rest. Then you are Pes E or even F.</p>
              <p>Childhood jaundice like childhood asthma is nothing. Many people have slow development especially in the brain. LOL.</p>

              What is the difference between A and B?
              
              Both are combat fit, both can be pilots or commandos. Seems like A is near perfection and B is what most people are.
              
              Any vocatioon A can do that B cannot?

              PES A is totally healthy.
              
              PES B is with minor problems like childhood asthmas, mildly underweight and myopia.
              
              PES C is problem severe enough to warrent non combat fit vocations.
              
              PES E is severe health problems.
              
              PES F is AIDS, cancer, wheelchair bound , severe mental illnesses ... ...

              <p>Hi guys, i need some genuine advice on the medical aspects of my army life<br><br>I was initially enlisted as C2L2 temp due to a past knee injury and excused RMJ for 6 months. In addition, i was on isotretinoin on and off in a private hospital for 5 years and restarted the course at National Skin Centre 5 months before i enlisted. HOWEVER, i did NOT declare that i was having this drug at CMPB as i did not know this drug was that "dangerous" in the SAF.<br><br>For my BMT, we had to complete 4 weeks at Tekong and 5 weeks at our vocational training institute before our POC. I completed my 4 weeks at Tekong. At my vocational training insitute, i was having issues with my acne vulgaris as i felt the side effects of isotretinoin - extreme dryness on my skin and pain in my nose (due to dryness) at times. Hence, i went to declare i was on the drug and to my surprise THEN, i was ordered by the MO to OOC and had to immediately be downgraded to E9L9.(temp 6months)<br><br>Recently i got transferred to my new camp as a storeman. HOWEVER, the serious of the drying effects of isotretinoin was manifesting as i had itchy and sometimes sore eyes in my bunk ( maybe the dust and smoke due to smokers). In addition, time to time, i even have nose bleeding which is troublesome. Hence, very much lately, i had my specialist to write a memo for me to excuse stay in due to the detrimental side effects which i was experiencing. <br><br>When i showed the memo to my MO,he merely gave me 2 weeks of excuse stay in and told me to come back again. (FYI, this MO has a bad reputation in my camp for being Bo Chap and lazy. I could testify to it as once, i had a fever of 38.5 degree Celsius right in his face, and he was still surfing his FACEBOOK and didn't give me attend C which i didn't request anyway &gt;:( )<br></p>
              <p><br>My questions are<br><br>1. Do i have to recourse my BMT since i already completed my Tekong training? <br>(Reason being, i am now a supply assistant and already attended the storeman course. This is the same as what my batchmates go through in their various vocational institutes - Clerk, Storeman, Technician, Driver. I was previously a technician supposedly.)<br><br>2. If i continue taking this drug even nearing my PES review in 6months time, will they extend it? What happens if i have to take it over the course of 2 years? (I can't possibly be on temp PES E until i ORD right?)<br><br>3. As for my excuse stay in, since it is a valid medical reason, do i have the rights to strongly request from the MO to give me a longer stayout period until my nosebleeding and sore eyes situation stabilizes? <br><br>4. And for such MOs who are surfing facebook while treating patients during office hours, are they allowed to do that? I didn't dare challenge him while i was having fever because of our differences in rank but i was indignant that the MO was being unprofessional.<br><br><br>Thank you for reading my lengthy post. Any genuine advice is greatly appreciated! :)</p>

              experiencing. <br>
              <br>
              When i showed the memo to my MO,he merely gave me 2 weeks of excuse
              stay in and told me to come back again. (FYI, this MO has a bad
              reputation in my camp for being Bo Chap and lazy. I could testify
              to it as once, i had a fever of 38.5 degree Celsius right in his
              face, and he was still surfing his FACEBOOK and didn't give me
              attend C which i didn't request anyway &gt;:( )<br></p>
              <p><br>
              My questions are<br>
              <br>
              1. Do i have to recourse my BMT since i already completed my Tekong
              training?<br>
              (Reason being, i am now a supply assistant and already attended the
              storeman course. This is the same as what my batchmates go through
              in their various vocational institutes - Clerk, Storeman,
              Technician, Driver. I was previously a technician
              supposedly.)<br>
              <br>
              2. If i continue taking this drug even nearing my PES review in
              6months time, will they extend it? What happens if i have to take
              it over the course of 2 years? (I can't possibly be on temp PES E
              until i ORD right?)<br>
              <br>
              3. As for my excuse stay in, since it is a valid medical reason, do
              i have the rights to strongly request from the MO to give me a
              longer stayout period until my nosebleeding and sore eyes situation
              stabilizes? <br>
              <br>
              4. And for such MOs who are surfing facebook while treating
              patients during office hours, are they allowed to do that? I didn't
              dare challenge him while i was having fever because of our
              differences in rank but i was indignant that the MO was being
              unprofessional.<br>
              <br>
              <br>
              Thank you for reading my lengthy post. Any genuine advice is
              greatly appreciated! :)</p>

              Lastime I go Medical centre MO surfing youtube.
              
              If you are taking this medicine permanently tell MO and he will give you a perm status.
              
              If not temp status until ORD lor.

              <p>Hi guys, i need some genuine advice on the medical aspects of my
              army life<br> <br> I was initially enlisted as C2L2 temp due to a past knee injury and
              excused RMJ for 6 months. In addition, i was on isotretinoin on and
              off in a private hospital for 5 years and restarted the course at
              National Skin Centre 5 months before i enlisted. HOWEVER, i did NOT
              declare that i was having this drug at CMPB as i did not know this
              drug was that "dangerous" in the SAF.<br> <br> For my BMT, we had to complete 4 weeks at Tekong and 5 weeks at our
              vocational training institute before our POC. I completed my 4
              weeks at Tekong. At my vocational training insitute, i was having
              issues with my acne vulgaris as i felt the side effects of
              isotretinoin - extreme dryness on my skin and pain in my nose (due
              to dryness) at times. Hence, i went to declare i was on the drug
              and to my surprise THEN, i was ordered by the MO to OOC and had to
              immediately be downgraded to E9L9.(temp 6months)<br> <br> Recently i got transferred to my new camp as a storeman. HOWEVER,
              the serious of the drying effects of isotretinoin was
              manifesting as i had itchy and sometimes sore eyes in my bunk (
              maybe the dust and smoke due to smokers). In addition, time to
              time, i even have nose bleeding which is troublesome. Hence, very

              <p>1. Yes. Your status are temp and you  have to recourse when you are upgraded to Pes B.But you might be post back as storeman back into the same camp.</p>
              <p>2. Yes. They will extend it. But this drug is for cancer patient, deadly and should not be used for long term. So most likely you will cycle off soon.</p>
              <p>3. If you got flu today, you got 3 day MC. Now you say you got flu and you want MC perm?</p>
              <p>4. MO are 26 to 28 years old NSF. They also like to chao keng and slack.If you say you have fever and want MC, I am sure he will give you MC. But it is usual for people who take such as a poisonous drug to have fever symptom too. </p>
              <p>This drug is deadly with numerous side effect. It is killing you slowly. You should get some chinese doctor to cure the root of your problem. Good Luck.</p>

              L2 can take part in field training.
              
              Field train is determined by landcode.
              
              Support vocation is possible since B2 is non combat fit.

              <p>Both are very mild medical problem. But whatever the problem is you have to submit to CMPB now,  before BMT enlistment. Let them decide.

              <p>Then it would a mess. You got a temp Pes C2 for while. You will undergo the Pes C BMT. When you are upgraded to Pes B after the temp Pes expired. You will need to undergo the Pes A/B BMT again.</p>
              <p>Medical board is for people who are already in the army. For people who are not inside. You just need to "update" your medical problem which you failed to declare. My friend broke his arm before BMT. He was given temp Pes C9L9 for 6 months. But his enlistment was delayed for exactly 6 months plus and he went into Pes B BMT.</p>
              <p>BUT you must declare what you have, because failed to declare medical problem is an offence.Anyway you need to update CMPB. It get to do with more important issue like compensation and insurances.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>My pes status is currently perm C2L2 due to a torn ligament in my ankle.  Recently, I was diagnosed again at NUH with bilateral femoroacetabular inpingement and iliotibial band syndrome.  My specialist wrote a memo suggesting a permanent downgrade, but didn't specify which pes I would be downgraded to.  Could anyone offer some insights?</p>

              <p>Since your condition is supported with a hospital specialist memo, it's a further downgrade to PES C9 to E range.</p>
