              case statement is prepared for review
              discussion at the monthly medical board meet (usually at

              HRCs if you develop a new medical condition or if an existing
              medical condition has worsened, which may affect your ICT
              performance. This is so that arrangements will be made for you to
              attend a medical review at the SAF medical centre to assess your
              fitness condition for NS.<br> <br> You <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MUST</span></em> bring along all your investigation results and memorandums from
              your external physician or specialist during your medical review.
              You may be given a medical certificate for ICT deferment, be
              scheduled for a medical board to downgrade you if your medical
              condition is significant, or be referred to a restructured hospital
              for further examination depending on the outcome of your medical
              review.<br> <br> If your medical condition is deemed suited for ICT participation by

              <p>Hi Guys,</p>
              <p>No idea if this topic is still active but I'm in search of an answer since forever and hope that you guys could help answer my burning queries.<br>(Please offer constructive suggestion)</p>
              <p>-I have always wanted to become an RSAF pilot<br>-Passed my COMPASS test &amp; awaiting for Aeromedical test</p>
              <p>The thing is that i had minor depression in my teenage tears and went to see a doctor about it. I had since recovered and been discharged within the period of 4 months since diagnosis. </p>
              <p>so....my question is<br>1) would i be required to declare my past<br>2) will that affect my chance of being a RSAF pilot in the future?<br>3) If i am required to declare, would an official letter of discharge from the doctor help at all?</p>
              <p>Thank you guys so much for your help! <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I am 2 weeks before POP from BMT.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">3 weeks ago, I experience shoulder popping sounds on my right shoulder ball socket joint. I didn't bother because I thought it's fine. My right shoulder hurts after BTP live range. Sharp pain near joint when heavy pressure or rotate too much. </span></p>
              <p>One bookout, I'd to carry my black duffle bag on my shoulders due to coy line orders. I didn't sling it properly as we were in a rush. Then I heard a loud 'pop' sound. This time, my right shoulder pain is aggravated, it swell up and went down by book-in but the pain never went away.</p>
              <p>In strength training, trying to throw the medicine ball, I heard another pop sound, I tolerated till the end. Alas, my shoulders are worsened. The pain has escalated till exacerbated.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Moreover, I'd an old back injury (diagnosed as prolapsed intervertebral disc). It took me 8 months to recovery to walk without feeling general discomfort. BMT has taken a toll on me and my body, this old injury pain came back. Everyday, I wake up on my bunk bed with needle-like </span><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">tingling pain on my lower back on the right side of spine. Medical condition: Sciatica?<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I have an appointment on 29 September 2014 at KTPH. </span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>NS is only 2 years... Injury may become permanent for life if not properly treated...</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>1. You request <span style="line-height: 1.231;">the hospital specialist to write you a memo for PES review... </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>2. PES review is up to the MO. Not for me or you to decide...</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>3. </strong><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><strong>Photocopy it. Submit one to MO at Tekong Medical Centre and one to the medical centre of your new NS unit after POP. </strong><br></span></p>

              sustained an injury during your NS training, it may be considered
              as attributable to service only when service is the cause of
              injury. If you sustained an injury during ICT, you are required to
              report immediately to your unit’s Medical Officer and unit S1. This
              is so that your unit can arrange to attend to your injury, and
              document your injury sustained in your medical docket.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"> <br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"> Before MINDEF determines that an injury is attributable to service,
              you are responsible for bearing all medical expenses. Treatment for
              your injury must be sought at government or restructured hospitals
              at your eligible ward and referred to by a government or SAF
              Medical Officer.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"> <br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"> In the case of permanent disablement due to service injury, a
              medical board will be convened. Eligibility for disability
              compensation will be based on the degree of residual permanent
              disability as endorsed by the SAF Medical Board.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"> <br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"> If your service injury requires continuous medical or
              hospitalisation leave beyond your ICT period, you are eligible for
              a stepped-down compensation as a form of ex-gratia payment.
              Compensation will be based on your civilian pay or an equivalent
              regular serviceman’s pay (whichever is higher) if you do not
              receive any income from your employers. This ex-gratia payment is
              compensation for your loss of income during this period. Payment
              will cease when you are no longer on medical/hospitalisation leave
              or when disability compensation is paid, whichever is
              earlier.</span></p>

              serviceman make a claim for the medical costs incurred for service
              injury?</strong><br> <br> The PMC (Personnel Management Centre) will issue all serviceman
              with the SI (Service Injury) Card if their injuries have been
              approved as attributable to service by the Pensions / Awards
              Officer. The serviceman must produce this card to be eligible for
              fully-subsidised medical treatment at the government / restructured
              hospitals.<br> <br> If the SI Card is not produced when seeking treatment, the
              serviceman will have to pay for all the medical cost first and seek
              reimbursement via the respective PMCs with the following
              documents:<br> <br> a. the original medical bills and payment receipts<br> <br> b. a memorandum from the attending doctor to prove that the
              treatment received was for his service injury.<br> <br> The serviceman is required to notify his PMC immediately when he
              loses his SI Card. There will be an administrative charge of $15
              for each replacement of lost or defaced SI Card. He will need to
              make the payment via MINDEF Cashier / Internet and submit the
              receipt to the unit PMC before he will be issued a new SI
              Card.<br> <br> While waiting for the SI Card to be issued or replaced, the
              serviceman may approach the respective PMCs for the issuance of the
              SI Memo (a temporary identification document) for the
              fully-subsidised medical treatment.</span></p>

              The programme includes weapon training with the SAR 21 rifle which
              will teach recruits technical handling and marksmanship skills; a
              Battle Inoculation Course that simulates a real battlefield; a
              Field Camp which develops basic survival skills; progressive
              training to complete a 24-km route march which builds combat
              fitness and endurance; and hand grenade training.<br> <em><span style="font: inherit;">For those who fail to achieve the

              BMT</span></strong><br> As evidence has shown that obese recruits are able to achieve
              optimum fitness levels and weight loss in about 19 weeks, the new
              BMT programme for recruits with Body Mass Index (BMI) scores
              exceeding 27.0 will be 19 weeks. This BMT programme is designed to

              existing PES C1 classification. This is to ensure that the medical
              classification of our soldiers is consistent with their deployment.
              The new 9-week programme will include customised physical training,

              <p>i just received a call about my report being returned and a pes grading has been out. however, the ns system has not been updated. i spoke to the lady and asked if the enlistment date was being processed for this year. however, she told me the date can only be processed earliest at next week (end) after the system has been updated. </p>
              <p>do you know if its possible for me to speak to an officer in charge of the enlistment issues, like do you have their number or anything? i tried calling NS hotline and the ppl there can't help and were very reluctant. i tried asking the lady who told me about my pes status to help but she say she wasn't fromt he enlistment dept, can't help.</p>
              <p>thanks</p>

              <p>Pre-enlistees will be required to complete pre-enlistment procedures 
              and medical screening before they are scheduled for enlistment.</p>
              <p>They will be scheduled for enlistment into the respective enlistment 
              intakes based on numerous considerations such as the medical &amp; 
              physical fitness and educational qualifications of the individual, as 
              well as the manpower and operational requirements of the various 
              intakes.</p>
              <p>In general, pre-enlistees from the same 'A' level/International 
              Baccalaureate (IB) or polytechnic cohort are enlisted over two intakes 
              due to capacity constraints at the NS training schools. For example, 'A'
               level/ IB holders who graduate in Nov/Dec are typically enlisted in the
               Dec and Mar quarterly intakes. Polytechnic diploma holders who graduate
               in Mar/Apr are typically enlisted in the Jun and Sep quarterly intakes.
               ITE certificate holders and pre-enlistees with other qualifications are
               enlisted throughout the year.</p>
              <p>Pre-enlistees can only be assigned to an enlistment intake after 
              being certified medically fit for enlistment at the pre-enlistment 
              medical screening.  Pre-enlistees will receive Enlistment Notices to 
              notify them of their enlistment date about 2 months before their 
              scheduled enlistment.</p>
              <p><strong>Notes: </strong></p>
              <p>Pre-enlistees who are graded PES A/B1 and who attained a NAPFA
               Silver or Gold award in the 12 months before their enlistment date will
               be enlisted for their 9-week BMT directly. Pre-enlistees with PES A/B1 
              but who have not attained a NAPFA Silver or Gold award in the 12 months 
              before their enlistment date will be enlisted into an 8-week PTP prior 
              to the commencement of their 9-week BMT.</p>
              <p><strong>Enlistment dates are subjected to adjustment, due to operational requirements.</strong></p>

              <p>Hi. I'm a PES B1 NSF in Cadet Pro-Term.</p>
              <p>In foundation term, I injuried left big toe in field camp, feeling numb. I ignored it, but now, however, the numbness still not recovered, already been 2 months.</p>
              <p>1st, I reported sick in camp medical centre. MO gave Vitamin B Complex pills for nerve repair and said it's alright. But now, 2.5 weeks of Vit B pills, didn't heal. Toe got worsen as pro-term trainings are more tough. Toe feeling more pain and sore as I'm no choice but to shift my weight balance to more pressure on my sole instead of my toes. (eg. 5km, 7km runs, outfield exercises...etc.)</p>
              <p>I later went to a hospital, the more qualified medical professional told me:</p>
              <p>1) Taking the medication only has a 50% chance of healing (quoted directly from him).</p>
              <p>2) The medication has to be taken on a long term basis.</p>
              <p>3) A memo is to be given to camp MO for any PES medical review.</p>
              <p>4) Given anti-swelling/ pain medicines.</p>
              <p>5) There's no fracture shown in the X-ray, but there could be hair-line fractures.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Return to camp medical centre, gave hospital memo to the camp MO, but this camp doctor brushed me off said:</p>
              <p>1) The injury isn't that serious.</p>
              <p>2) Having just gotten his doctor's licence and medical degree, he's still unsure the healing period. </p>
              <p>3) Just issued Att B 3 days, excuse boots and RMJ.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q1: Does anyone has similar injury before to share their NS experience?</p>
              <p>Q2: Is the toe injury serious enough to warrant at least a temporary PES review?</p>
              <p>Q3: Is the toe injury must wait until total numbness then a fresh-out-of-school SAF MO take this seriously instead of thinking of NSFs are just malingering (keng)?</p>
              <p>Q4: Does a hospital specialist memo carry more weight than an ordinary neighbourhood doctor (General Practitioner (GP))'s note?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Should I just wait out to complete training to get the NS rank to avoid being out of course (OOC) or to seek immediate proper medical attention and care since NS is only 2 years of my life?</em></p>

              <p>Hi, I completed my combat BMT (PTP) PES B1 and thereafter Enlistee Vocational Training Course to be a Security Trooper (Combatant).</p>
              <p>But a back injury sustained in BMT, I need to downgrade PES to take care and recovery after completed the Security Trooper Combat Course.</p>
              <p>When I was PES B1, I was drawing a monthly NS allowance of $480 + Combat Allowance of $100 = $580 Total Nett.</p>
              <p>So now, as a NSF of Permanent PES C9L9, will the NS combatant allowance ceased payment since from combat-fit PES B1 downgraded to non-combat-fit C9L9 combat service support personnel?</p>
              <p>Regards.</p>
