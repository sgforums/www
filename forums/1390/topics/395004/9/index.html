              <p>To coldzero, revocate to what we dunno. Because during your NS we dunno what training you went for, in reservice they probably can't ask you to train in a new vocation.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  line-height: normal;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";  '>Hello. I
                          am an NSF currently in the rifleman vocation, PES B L1.Â 3 months ago in
                          early May, I had an in-service injury, injuring myÂ left shoulder causing
                          strain, inflammation and interrupted sleeps daily. After 3 weeks of ex UL
                          status, the camp MO gave me OOC status with 2 months light duties based
                          onÂ myÂ specialist suspicion that I have a rotator cuff tear injury.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  line-height: normal;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";  '>However,
                          during the month of June and half of July, I was made to become store party,
                          ammo party and also follow the fighting fit to numerous outfield. Even worse,
                          despite sounding outÂ that I have to go for my first physiotherapy appt,it
                          was postponed twice (worth 3 weeks).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  line-height: normal;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";  '>In July,
                          during my first physio visit, my condition was very badÂ despite given the
                          status of light duties.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  line-height: normal;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";  '>To make
                          matters worse,Â I was chosen to be a temp storeman for my coy. Ex Upper
                          limb n doing storework do not match.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  line-height: normal;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";  '>When my MRI
                          scan results came out, the MRI report stated that IÂ have <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">supraspinatus
                          tendinous interstitialÂ tear</span></strong>. The specialist letter stated
                          "KIV downgrade,Â kindly consider ex UL, heavy loads". Hence the
                          MO gave me 3 monthÂ status of ex rmj, HL, UL, overhead heavy objects but
                          did not board me. However, this does not work. I m still a temp storeman.</span></p>

                          recently, my specialist says that i should not be doingÂ store work. Hence
                          he recommended clerical work. Eventually, the MOÂ wrote a memo to my coy
                          office saying that i only can do desk-boundÂ duties. However i cant since
                          my officer says that priority goes to those already downgarded, hence still a
                          temp storeman.</span></p>

              <p>I am in tekong now and was diagnosed with hypertension. Showed the letter to MO and he decided to OOT me and downgrade me for 6 months. Now waiting for medical board.

              <p>Hi all, I went for the pre-enlistee checkup in June and got graded B1L1. Since i havent done napfa (cos of mc during the sch napfa period) I was training pullups when I think I got arm injury. Now everytime do pullup my elbows will crack as i come down and quite painful each time. from 4/5 drop to max 2 now. then progress to cant even carry 5kg ricebag without elbow feeling like its gonna break. went to poly got some crap gp which was no help and refused to give me referral. in the end went to SGH as private. spec says that according to xray scans arm seems normal and if i want to do further checkups then must do MRI scan.</p>
              <p>My qns</p>
              <p>1) When do most PES Bs who didnt pass napfa get enlisted for PTP? i heard usually mid-dec?</p>
              <p>2) Now its like 3 weeks to my A lvls and I dun want to sacrifice studying time. however if i go see spec and do mri after As (like late nov) will it be too late for a med review? i read theres med board once a month so must i submit my case for med review during oct for them to decide during nov?</p>
              <p>3) this kind of condition is usually what kind of PES? b1, b2, or c2?</p>
              <p>4) if i get b2 and excused for chinup station, do i still need to go for ptp if i fail napfa? what if i take napfa outside and pass everything other than chinups?</p>

              <p>1) If waiting for Medical Board, it's halfway through the process of downgrade.<br><br>2) Whether Temp or Perm PES, we don't know. See how, it's up to the Medical Board. If Temp PES, upon due expiry date, you need to go down to the medical centre for review. If you have anymore hospital specialist memo,Â just please show to the MO then.</p>

              <p>2) So long as you have gottenÂ theÂ specialist memos before your CMPB checkup appointment date, then justÂ show the CMPB doctors the memos.<br><br>3) If it's just a light injury, it's a PES B, with excuse upper limbs activities since it will heal eventually.

              <p>2) So long as you have gottenÂ theÂ specialist memos
                  before your CMPB checkup appointment date, then justÂ show the
                  CMPB doctors the memos.<br> <br> 3) If it's just a light injury, it's a PES B, with excuse upper
                  limbs activities since it will heal eventually. If it's a moderate
                  injury, it's within PES C range. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It's all depends on what's written in
                  the hospital specialist memo</span>. e.g. the clinical diagnosis,
                  the recommendations...etc.</strong></p>
              <p>4) For so long as fightingÂ combat fit (only PES A/B), only
                  NAPFA Silver/ Gold will get the 2 months Fitness Cut (22 months of
                  NS).<br> <br> If you are PES C/E, even take NAPFA is of no use at all since PES
                  C/E is non-combat fit,Â thus not eligible for the Fitness
                  CutÂ discount at all, so you will have to serve the full 24
                  months of NS.</p>

              <p>for #2 right, can the MO at CMPB downpes me immediately or must I wait for the medical board thing. what will happen to me in the meantime? like say i go cmpb on 1st dec but in my letter says enlisting 15 dec (or something) for ptp?</p>
              <p>and just to confirm, only pes A/B1 need to go for ptp right. for b2 even if you didnt take/pass napfa still no ptp right?</p>
