              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I'm just wondering. I'm OOT from BMT and my batch is POPing
              soon. When they POP I will no longer be part of my company, and
              instead will be part of the BMTC HQ until they can post me to
              another vocation. But, I'm still awaiting my specialist review by
              the SAF. Am I right in saying that they cannot apply for my
              vocation until I am reviewd by both the SAF Specialist AND the
              medical board? And only when I recieve my new PES status can they
              give me a vocation? Or is there another way to it?</p>

              <p>I already have my recommendation to be down PES'd. However, the MO couldn't recommend a grade for me since my case wasn't in the pink pes bible, hence my SAF specialist appt. After he grades me, does my case get pushed to the Medical Board? Or is there something else that happens?</p>

              <p>Hi, im currently a recuit in BMTC school 2. My company is going to POP tomorrow, however im not going to POP with them, Im currently under OOC and will be waiting for my posting which will be known to be by Jan 14.<br><br>I have a skin problem named Atopic Dematities and have been visiting specialist at Cgh for quite a few months and have gotten 3 Specialist memo regarding my condition. I have given them all to the BMTC MO and they had referred me to MMI for a specialist review. Which is on Jan 12.<br><br>I currently have 3 problems im facing, and hope sgforums kind souls will help me out.</p>
              <p>Problem 1 of whether i should shift the MMI to a further date and get my posting first, or should go ahead to the MMI first and request to change vocation before i get my vocation, because i know that if i get my posting first, the likelyhood of me staying in that camp, or unit is very high. Eg, Storeman in Rockyhill 5th Coy. After MMI i know that the most i can get is Clerk, Rockyhill, 5th Coy and being unable to get out of there. However, if i went for my MMI first, the likelyhood of the SAF specialist asking me to wait for my posting and try it out first is rather high too, as they cant possibly have 2 posting for me.<br><br>I know that Skin problem such as ezema and dematities tend to get C2, or C9 depending on the condition itself and has a high percentage of getting into clerk.<br><br>My skin problem has been around since i was young but i try to keep it under control, my outbreak during Bmt is not even due to Outfield, it was just because of heavy sweating under uniform. When that happens, my whole neck, body, arms and leg has rashes. So its definetly above the 20% margin which is required to even down pes. At a point of time, my whole neck was swollen and turn so flaky that whenever i just touch them, my dry skin will just fall off.</p>
              <p>I have mentioned once to my CGH specialist to write a down pes letter, and after having to check with his higher up, he was allowed to and has written for me a "down pes letter" However, nothing of this words has ever came up in that letter and it only tell the MO my condition, even when the higher up allowed me to down pes.<br><br>I have also mentioned once to my BMTC MO about my down pes, and he said he cant do anything about it except to give me statues and wait for my MMI, and ask the MMI specialist for pes review and change my vocation. <br><br>However, ever since my OOC i hasnt been participating in activities, thus my condition subsided. My body now has recovered around 80% from the worst state ive been, and my specialist memo only explains my condition and did not write the important words of " recommend to pes down."  <br><br>Problem 2, Im now stuck between getting another specialist opinion and ask them to write me a specialist report, " the one that costs money" or just to head to my MMI, while remaking my conditions appear again, to show the doctor of my problem.<br><br>Problem 3, My chances of down pes and revocate, with my current assets, which is 3 Specialist memo, currently under the care of my BMTC MO, Rashes reoccuring when excessive sweat, or weird temperature changes along with heat, dust and smoky enviroment.</p>
              <p>Thanks many in advance.<br>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi. I am a pre-enlistee, enlisting in May 2011 and currently in PES B1. I received a memo from my cardiologist, noting that I am unable to perform strenuous exercise due to suspection of noncompaction of myocardium.</p>

              <p>if you dont wan to enlist later. then jus go to tekong as per normal. then go see e mo during e first week of bmt. then i guess you will b oot immediately if e mo thinks you have a problem.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, you will be downgraded to within PES C to E range, depending on what's on the memo. (e.g. e<em>xtent of diagnosis, degree of diagnosis/injury/illness/disease...etc.</em>)</p>
              <p>The date of enlistment will either be brought forward or backward at most a couple of weeks to fit the batch cohort altogether.</p>
              <p>And please, health is more important than just a couple of weeks of time, so please show your memo to CMPB to review your new PES.</p>
              <p>By non-declaration of any pre-existing medical condition and if should you get injuried/ condition worsened/ faint/ sent to hospital, you will have to bear partial responsibility and fault when there will be a panel to conduct an investigation into this.</p>
              <p>Therefore, please call CMPB @ <strong>6373 1340 </strong>to request another PES review <strong>(for Pre-Enlistees after CMPB Checkup).</strong></p>
