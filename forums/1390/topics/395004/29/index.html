              <p>Hi </p>
              <p>I am currently undergoing my bmt and what I realised is that my
              pre-existing red-green colour vision deficiency has affected me in
              some aspects of my training such as the live firing. During the
              night shoot, I could not see the blinking red lights at all! All I
              saw was a patch of darkness. So yeah, naturally I missed my targets
              and got screwed quite badly lar...May need to go for reshoot
              somemore. </p>
              <p>I feel really stupid saying this but I DO have an official
              notification stating that I have red green colour vision deficiency
              from the Health Promotion Board (Student Health Centre) but I
              forgot to bring it along with me when I went for my medical checkup
              last year.</p>
              <p>So the question is, if I were to go for a medical review (with
              the official letter this time) to down pes, what are my chances?
              And what pes am I most likely to go to</p>

              </p><p>Hi everyone I started a new topic about this but response is slow so i'll try my luck here!<br><br>Before I start i'll give some background information on 
              my less than ideal army life so far.. within the first 4weeks of BMT I was 
              placed out of training due to a stress fecture on my left femur. I moped around 
              camp in crutches for about a week until I was put on medical leave. When I went 
              to see the M.O, he was initially going to put me on 5 weeks attend c since I was 
              going to be on crutches for another 5 weeks. He then told me that he forgot that 
              the maximum period on medical leave for bmt is 2 weeks, so he gave me 2 weeks 
              mc, and when I go back to tekong, see him and get an extension. That's all fine 
              and dandy, but the thing is if I get an extension for another 2 weeks, it 
              overlaps with my company's POP date. So what I was wondering is,<br><br>-if I 
              get the extension, what happens then? Do I have to attend the POP or POC 
              whatever it is?<br><br>-When I receive my exension, do I basically just pack up 
              all my things and return the store items and head home?<br><br>- Is the M.O 
              likely to grant the extension? (only applies if I don't see the same 
              M.O)<br><br>some other relevant things I've also been wondering are:<br><br>- 
              What likely PES will I be downgraded to, and will it be permanant or temporary 
              given my situation?<br><br>- Likely vocations?<br><br>- I'll probably have to 
              recourse bmt, so when will I have to recourse given my situation? I was told by 
              my specialist that my injury will take about 3 months to fully 
              recover.<br><br>Thank you for taking the time to read my lengthy post!</p>
