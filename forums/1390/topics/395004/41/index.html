              <p><br>Yes, both conditions combined will be within PES C range, with excuses such as RMJ and uniform.  Depending on the hospital specialist memos, the MO will decide on whether to recommend a permanent or temporary PES to the Medical Board for review on your case statement. Final decision lies with the Chairman of the Medical Board.</p>
              <p>Please also voice out your concerns and requests to the MO, when nessesary. If you don't voice out to the MO, the MO will not know since he cannot read your mind.</p>

              <p>
              </p><p>Hi all, </p>
              <p>May you guys provide some suggestions and advice if possible with some questions I have? thanks loads (:</p>
              <p>also, apologies for the long-winded post. I wanted to be as comprehensive &amp; clear as possible! </p>
              <p>I orded in mar 2010. I received notifications yesterday on my phone &amp; ns portal for a medical review. I do not have any unit and was placed on the holding list, with a temp downpes from b to c2l2 very near the end of my ns which covered me till i ord &amp; expired after 7 months.Checking ehealth revealed there is no active pes status.</p>
              <p>my down pes was a result of an operation for fracturing my metatarsal on my right leg whilst in tour in taiwan ( looked like this  ----I  I---- with a hole in the middle where the bone should be) </p>
              <p>I also have a heel spur that inflames the achilles tendon, discovered during bmt when i ran. I was offered laser surgery to prevent the tendon snapping but then i would have to stay in singapore ( was very fortunate to be given the chance to go taiwan, though my role was service &amp; support, so hardly any physical exertions etc)</p>
              <p>A by product of the operation was the flare up of a meniscus tear in my left knee when i started walking wobbly again (MRI had no idea how big the tear was since it was covered by cyst) I had physio therapy and it was very beneficial.</p>
              <p>I resumed jogging once a week sometimes replacing it with street soccer for at most 1 hour which causes my heel to hurt like hell, my left knee &amp; right foot to feel sharp pain 7 throbbing ache. This usually lasts a day or two over the weekend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) are these after effects from soccer/jogging a legitimate concerns I can raise in the MR? I'm literally limping around for a day before it recovers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) I hurt my left knee two weeks while i did a slight jump &amp; the physio at SGH A&amp;E said I probably tore the meniscus again though inconclusive via X ray without an MRI. He referred me to an orthopaedic specialist but the date is a few days after the MB. Will I be able to arrange another MB with them on this left knee because Im afraid without medical diagnosis from the ortho specialist they may dismiss it my concern something trival? I still cannot straighten that knee.</p>
              <p>3) My atopic eczema has outbreak &amp; flared up 3 times this year. May I still present a specialist report from NSC to them during the MR? I understand this MB is about my metatarsal,the heel &amp; even the left knee. I honestly did not know of the SOP on informing with no unit for me.</p>
              <p>"<em>NSmen must update their NS HRCs if they should develop any new medical condition or if their existing medical condition has worsened which might affect their ability to perform their duties during ICT</em>."  Until I read the guidelines from this forum yesterday.</p>
              <p>4) I'll be lying if I said I was not interested in what my pes would be like after this MR hahaha. what are the possible status i might receive?</p>
              <p>5) I'm a sig opr. If there is a permanent down pes this time round, will I be relocated vocation wise?</p>
              <p>My eczema has always been controlled to a few spots since I was a child. My 1st major flare all over my body for the 1st time was last year. NSC's  advice for me has been no exercise other than swimming, not allowed to perspire, cannot wear anything else other than cotton &amp; the main reason, cannot be stressful.</p>
              <p>Thank you for patiently reading up to this point! Any suggestions, advice or answers are much, much appreciated! (:</p>

              <p>Hello eac,</p>
              <p>I have a few queries which I would like to clarify with you...</p>
              <p>I have scoliosis which has given me plenty of aches whenever I carry heavy load over a period of time... What do you recommend for me to do? Should I bring this up to a specialist or just take painkillers to suppress the pain?</p>
              <p>Another issue I would like to ask which is regarding a skin condition I have. I have these white patches spreading on my skin which I believe is this condition called vitiligo. I haven't seen any doctors regarding this issue. I would just like to know if this issue is serious... Would it spread under sunlight or whatever?</p>

              <p>Hi all. </p>
              <p>I'm currently a NSF. I have patella subluxation on both my knees and am in PES C9L3 (perm). I've recently been slated to undergo lateral release surgery on both knee caps, thus i have some concerns about this matter. </p>
              <p>1. How long a MC would i probably get for this surgery? My colleges are rather concerned since their stay in duties would increase when i'm gone.</p>

              <p>MC is perhaps about half a year to a year long. The ligaments take about 3 months to repair itself. And after the surgery, the structure of the knees will be different. For the first few weeks, it is most likely you will be on cast. Next few months, most likely you will be on wheel chair. After that, you may walk a bit.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, you will be excused all lower limbs activites perm after this.</p>
              <p>I am not sure will you be down PES further. I think it is most likely not. Perhaps after the surgery, then you may consider for a change of your vocation.</p>
              <p>I think it is better for you do surgery on one leg first. This is to see whether operation is helping you. When you feel good about it, then you do the surgery on the other leg.</p>

              <p>Thank you for your reply Lokey. Really appreciate it. </p>
              <p>I have requested the doctor to do one knee at a time but he seems adament about doing both at one go saying that its better and he seems confident in his skills as well. He has also warned me that if i do not go for the surgery, i would have problems walking when im in my late 30s to 40s.  </p>
              <p>Also, I only have about 13 months left to ORD so will i have time to revocate after my MC is over since it may be half a year to 1 year long? Which vocations would i be qualified to revocate to? </p>
