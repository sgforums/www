              <p>You see. B2 is only talking about IPPT. That is excuse chip up
              and perhaps shuttle run (cose u need to pick up the
              stuff). You can still run 2.4 km, do sit up and standing broad jump
              (These are lower limb activities). The other part is the land
              deployment code, which determined your
              vocation. </p>
              <p>SAF expect you to do physio and fix the upper limbs. And not
              leave it unfixed. Anyway, fixing the
              limbs through surgery is the best and fastest option. NS
              is only 2 years, nothing compared to a unusable arm for 80 years?
              Believe me, unfixed shoulder join can lead to shoulder impingement
              syndrome -&gt; nerve impingement syndrome -&gt; finally lost
              of limb function at 30s to 40s. (if you dont fix it now)  </p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333;"> if it
              can recoup by itself" -  personally, I prefer to do surgery
              and walk around in camp with arm support for half to a year. Nobody
              will bother you then.  </span></p>

              <p>I understand that an upperlimp injury may seem to only effect upper limb, but please try to imagine how you would run if you weren't allowed to swing your arm. Again, with SBJ, how would you do it if your arms were tied to your body. The pain that spreads from swinging my arm, moving it constantly is actually quite painful, too the point where it's almost unbearable.</p>
              <p>Surgery right now would be pointless since the main reason why my shoulder joint is in this position is because having a higher than normal shoulderblade exposes more of my shoulder joint to friction from my bones. So if I were to get surgery now, it'd be pointless since the main cause, my shoulderblade, is still prevelant. So it'd be better to correct the solution in the correct order, rather than doing surgery and still have it get worse.</p>
              <p>I'm not trying to sound mean, but this is what my specialist has told me, hence why I'm asking for some experience people to tell me what I'm going to be looking forward too in my case, sorry if I wasn't clear before about my situation.</p>

              <p>I think you misunderstood.  What you are having is a temporary problem. For example, the person have leg fracture, broken completely. He surely cannot walk at all. So he is temp downgrade to E9L9 or excuse lower limb for half a year to 1 year. After a year, he heal back but cannot run. So he is still Pes B2 L 2 excuse lower limb activities.</p>
              <p>Your shoulder problem is a temp problem. I think you better get another specialist at SGH. From my understanding, there is a tear with your tendon in your shoulder. So this result inflammation and swelling which should subside with NSAIDS drugs. Then shoulder blade is actually tightening to pull to make room for the acromion region. So as long as the tear is present, shoulder will protect itself by pulling up itself.</p>
              <p>Anyway, u may get lower like C9L9, depends on how bad it is. </p>

              <p>Yea, so I need to bring my shoulderblade down to the normal position, which will alliveate the pressure it's placing on my joint. So that's why I said surgery as of now wouldn't help in the long run, only after I get my shoulderblade down will it make sense. And to do that I was told can take 6months to a year.</p>
              <p>But put aside the if's and buts, my pes will be temporary right? After how long will they decide to review my again? 3,6 months? a year?</p>
              <p>The swelling is caused by the irritation from moving my arm, since my shoulderblade is higher than normal, my shoulder joint doesn't have enough space, so it's constantly getting rubbed by my shoulder bones. Just wanted to clear that up. I'm on anti-imflammatory drugs, but it can only help so much. Need to get my shoulder blade back to normal before the swelling can completely stop.</p>

I have actually mentioned my anxiety issues with my psychologist before, but only just talked abit about it. I tend to get anxious easily and this makes me less capable than normal, and my hands tremble frequently. I have done thyroid test and other test for trembling hands and body but show nothing. I think it is because of my anxiety/anxiousness? When I get anxiety attacks, I get paralyzed with fear, as in I just freeze and not do anything with a blank mind. </p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I would like some advice on my situation.</p>
              <p>I'm going for my medical check up soon, and i wonder if my condition would lead me to a pes E or even pes F.</p>
              <p>I went through a brain tumor surgery about 2 years ago and the tumor was not completely removed. If it was completely removed, i will be blind as it is on my optic nerve. when i see things there will still be a bright spot in one of my eye preventing me to see properly. this also resulted in me losing my sense of smell.</p>
              <p>the medicine that i took made me have a history of seizures and my skin is allergic to dust and dirty enviroments, i have very sensitive skin, if dirty enviroments, i will have breakouts on my face. And also, i am very careless and sprain my ankles a few times, always the left leg. sigh.</p>
              <p>Is any one here able to give me a vague idea of which pes i'll probably end up in?</p>
              <p>thanks alot!</p>

              <p> Do you applied your deferment online? Then attached with your document in the email or faxed. And corresponding received a received sent notification. 
              I suspected that your CO may not received your supporting document in the first place. </p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I would like some advice on my situation.</p>
              <p>I'm going for my medical check up soon, and i wonder if my condition would lead me to a pes E or even pes F.</p>
              <p>I went through a brain tumor surgery about 2 years ago and the tumor was not completely removed. If it was completely removed, i will be blind as it is on my optic nerve. when i see things there will still be a bright spot in one of my eye preventing me to see properly. this also resulted in me losing my sense of smell.</p>
              <p>the medicine that i took made me have a history of seizures and my skin is allergic to dust and dirty enviroments, i have very sensitive skin, if dirty enviroments, i will have breakouts on my face. And also, i am very careless and sprain my ankles a few times, always the left leg. sigh.</p>
              <p>Is any one here able to give me a vague idea of which pes i'll probably end up in?</p>
              <p>thanks alot!</p>

              <p>I'm just wondering. I'm OOT from BMT and my batch is POPing soon. When they POP I will no longer be part of my company, and instead will be part of the BMTC HQ until they can post me to another vocation. But, I'm still awaiting my specialist review by the SAF. Am I right in saying that they cannot apply for my vocation until I am reviewd by both the SAF Specialist AND the medical board? And only when I recieve my new PES status can they give me a vocation? Or is there another way to it?</p>
