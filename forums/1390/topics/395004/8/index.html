              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I am a nsman currently placed in an infantry reservist unit. I'm given a temp pes C9L3 for some psychiatric issues, and this year i went to see a doc cos I have pulsatile tinnitus. <br><br>i went for a CT scan but it showed nothing, doc advise me to go for MRI scan but its really expensive so I'm delaying on that for the time being, though the wind sound in my ear is really annoying sigh but i don't think there's a cure. <br><br>the problem is, my unit apparently still send me to go outfield to do stores even though im c9l3, is that actually allowed? I thought L3 means I'm only fit for base duties? <br><br>An advance thanks to any who can help advise and answer my questions.</p>

              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>I'm PES C9L2 for scoliosis, 3 bulging discs, degenerative disc disease and narrowing of the spinal canal. I'm excused heavy loads and I am unable to even carry the LBV. As such, I did not do range in BMT and so am not arms-trained. At my current unit, my WO insists that I carry out a type of duty that involves me carrying SBO (helmet, LBV and weapon) for about half an hour a day during roll call unless activated. Due to the short duration and infinitesimal chance that I'll be activated my WO says its fine for me to wear the LBV and carry arms. I do not have access to directives so can someone who does or has a knowledge of them advice me on the legality of my WO's actions given my PES and excuses? Thank you.</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>Have posted this a new topic but here seems more appropriate. Sorry for the spamming.</p>
              <p>I am a NS man (service side) who has recently been downgraded from PES B to
                                      PES E1L9 perm due to psychological reasons after being excused from
                                      my last 2 ICTs by the MO and CO.</p>
              <p>Unit is in its 9th ICT while I have completed only 2.</p>
              <p>I did request to the medical board for posting out to a new unit
                                      as I am unable to function in my current one due to the
                                      environment. The MO told me that this is up to my unit as they are
                                      only dealing with the PES status.</p>
              <p>Prior to the downgrade, I received a call up for ICT in Nov and
                                      would like to know what is going to happen to me now as I have not
                                      received anything offical from the unit except the PES status from
                                      the NS Portal.</p>
              <p>I would really appreciate if anyone in similar shoes can offer
                                      some advise on:</p>
              <p>-Whether there will be any official documentation sent to you
                                      after the downgrade and what does it contain</p>
              <p>-Am I still liable for reservist and if so, can I request to be
                                      posted out and how I should go about doing this</p>
              <p>-What are the chances that I will suceed as truth to told, I
                                      cannot contemplate even the notion of attending this ICT given what
                                      happened to me during the last 2 ICTs (nervous breakdowns and panic
                                      attacks)</p>
              <p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

              i would like to ask for some advice. I had a hand injury in bmt and went for mri and ultrasound scans which states that i have a subluxation of the mcpj. Is it possible for me to get excused arms from this? Any advice is appreciated. Thx

              Hello Guys
              
              I was diagnose with severe Plantar faciaitis condition recently. I would know if I am eligible for medical downgrade for this.
              
              I have x ray, med documents &amp; specialist recommended downgrade letter. Do I need to go for MRI cos I heard MOs usually ask for MRI instead of X ray films if they are considering ur downgrade request.
              
              Appreciate any advises on this matter.

              <p>Hi People,</p>
              <p>I am currently in my 4th week in BMT. I recently got news that I have high BP and my GP wrote a letter to the MO requesting to downgrade me. The MO replied that he cannot do this unless a specialist from internal medicine had diagnosed me. I went to the specialist and my reading was 160/105 which he said was high. I was prescribed with hypertension medication and scheduled for a series of standard tests which I had completed. Although the tests on my liver, heart, lungs, kidney came out fine, I was still considered as having hypertension. The specialist wrote a memo for me just yesterday and I will be bringing it to the MO on monday. The letter states that I have hypertension and what medication I was taking. I read the '8 simple steps' and it seems like the words 'reviewing of PES' is quite crucial, but it was not included in the memo. Would the MO still consider me for downgrading? Thanks.</p>

I read the '8 simple steps' and it seems like the words 'reviewing of PES' is quite crucial, but it was not included in the memo. Would the MO still consider me for downgrading? Thanks.</p>

              <p><br>try 1st with this 1st specialist memo, no harm.<br>it should be sufficient as it's certified by a specialist.</p>
              <p>if camp doctor still say no, then u have to see specialist again, but the next time, pls try to request the specialist to write a strong-worded memo will do.</p>

              <p><br>just take your hospital specialist memo to the camp doctor and ask him, "Sir, how?"</p>
              <p>just let the camp doctor inspect your fingers, wrist and hand. e.g. some hand reflex test, rotation, which finger cannot bend, can grab, pull, push things or not...etc.</p>
              <p>to excuse arms and range, it has got to be the 'trigger finger', by which finger is used to pull the trigger to shoot the bullet.</p>

As he told me he wanted to sign on the Police Force after he ORD...Think he will be going through BMT soon. After BMT he will be reovcated to a RP. However, Given his abilities i think he is far more capable than being a RP. He has also expressed interest in joining more"chiong sua" units to spend his 2 yrs more fruitfully.  I have helped him ask our PC and OC but all said cant be done,Is there anyway in BMT he could voice out to his commanders for a chance to be revocated to other units?</p></div>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>Have posted this a new topic but here seems more appropriate.
              Sorry for the spamming.</p>
              <p>I am a NS man (service side) who has recently been downgraded
              from PES B to PES E1L9 perm due to psychological reasons after
              being excused from my last 2 ICTs by the MO and CO.</p>
              <p>Unit is in its 9th ICT while I have completed only 2.</p>
              <p>I did request to the medical board for posting out to a new unit
              as I am unable to function in my current one due to the
              environment. The MO told me that this is up to my unit as they are
              only dealing with the PES status.</p>
              <p>Prior to the downgrade, I received a call up for ICT in Nov and
              would like to know what is going to happen to me now as I have not
              received anything offical from the unit except the PES status from
              the NS Portal.</p>
              <p>I would really appreciate if anyone in similar shoes can offer
              some advise on:</p>
              <p>-Whether there will be any official documentation sent to you
              after the downgrade and what does it contain</p>
              <p>-Am I still liable for reservist and if so, can I request to be
              posted out and how I should go about doing this</p>
              <p>-What are the chances that I will suceed as truth to told, I
              cannot contemplate even the notion of attending this ICT given what
              happened to me during the last 2 ICTs (nervous breakdowns and panic
              attacks)</p>
              <p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

              <p>The MO is right to say that he can't do much in revocation or other stuffs. Go to NSHRC and tell them you have been downgraded to E1L9 due to what ever problem you have. You can email to NSPORTAL and they will forward to your unit. If you know who is NSHRC taking care of revocation ( chief clerk normally ). U can talk to that PIC. 2mth still enough to get things done and get you posted out if they don't want you. If your unit is a combat unit and u r not a clerk, most probably will get revocated. All the best to you.</p>

              <p>Call up your NSHRC and tell them you are E9L9. u didnt state what vocation are u. Or is your pes Status perm or temp. If it is perm and you are in a combat or service vocation ( other than clerk ), you can request to be posted out. Talk to NSHRC PIC on this immediately. If you go back to your camp with your pes status letter, tell them immediately of your status. Most units don't need E9L9 for ICT.</p>
