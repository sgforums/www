              <p>I have tried calling them. They told me they would inform my unit. One day later, I notice that an appointment slot suddenly opened in Sept, which is in the morning before my in camp activities. I booked that timeslot already.

              <p>Hi, I am here writing this to request for advice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was issued with PES F a few years ago. Due to some mental condition I was dianogsed with at that time, which the whole diagnosis was filled with misunderstand and loopholes. Also, I was totally fine for most of my life. I put it off a few years because I was still studying. About last year when I was completing my studies I decided that NS would be good for me, so I went to the hospital to get a note and send it to NS in hope to up PES to any other which I can serve NS. They arranged an appointment with their psychiatrist. During the appointment the psychiatrist spoke to me for less than 5 mins and seem uninterested. He branded my review failed, I went to see the MP for additional request but every request was greeted with "we are unable to acceed to your request."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is there anything I can do to salvage the situation? Is there anything I can do to see the doctor again and have a fair review? What steps should I do next?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>

              <p>Hi, I am here writing this to request for advice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was issued with PES F a few years ago. Due to some mental
                      condition I was dianogsed with at that time, which the whole
                      diagnosis was filled with misunderstand and loopholes. Also, I was
                      totally fine for most of my life. I put it off a few years because
                      I was still studying. About last year when I was completing my
                      studies I decided that NS would be good for me, so I went to the
                      hospital to get a note and send it to NS in hope to up PES to any
                      other which I can serve NS. They arranged an appointment with their
                      psychiatrist. During the appointment the psychiatrist spoke to me
                      for less than 5 mins and seem uninterested. He branded my review
                      failed, I went to see the MP for additional request but every
                      request was greeted with "we are unable to acceed to your
                      request."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is there anything I can do to salvage the situation? Is there
                      anything I can do to see the doctor again and have a fair review?
                      What steps should I do next?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>

              <p>I went to another appointment a few weeks ago with the hospital and explained all these to them. The doctor (a reputated one) said he was unable to change past records but has since updated the record now that I'm stable and has given me another memo and has sent it to the MP too, I am planning to meet him again tomorrow. Is it worth another try at this, and will this improve my chance of serving NS?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for your suggestion, sounds good but can I go CMPB like that without an appointment and get an interview with an officer? Also, which supporting document would you recommend? How are the chances of this method?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, what do you think my chances are to serve NS? Did a google and the dianogsis was Schizophrenia paranoia. Thank you really much for your time and effort, I really appreciate it.</p>

              <p>Hi, I need Dr. Eac and other experts in back problem to advise me. Thanks in advance. </p>
              <p>I had written earlier that I have a recent memo from a public hospital doctor for me to excuse heavy load (to be sent in during my medical review. In his memo, he wrote something about L4/5 problem with a disc bulge in the MRI. A week after that, I went for physio and after some testing, it seems that the parts that can be painful in the spine include parts below the L4/5 areas too! I know this because I heard the physiotherapist tell a student things about my L5/S1 and other parts. </p>
              <p>Then I recall in one of my early xrays 10 years ago, another doctor had commented that my spine did not have a good lumbar curve initially and it was after much treatment that it was better (something like that, i can't recall the exact words he said). Even the physiotherapist I saw a few days ago reminded me of that when I laid face down. He pushed my spine along all the parts one by one that I feel less tightness and several "clicks" and movement in the spine.</p>
              <p>So is the doctor's recent memo adequate then? Should I have asked for the physiotherapist to give a report too?</p>

              <p>I'm PES C9L2 due to ankle, knee and back problems. ORD in 2001. Currently a NS man going for NS training soon for the first time. I agree that the back muscles strength is important. So, back to my question:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Is the doctor's recent memo about my L4/5 disc problem enough to update SAF? Should I have asked for the physiotherapist to give a report too?</span></p>
              <p>Btw, I'm a CQMS who barely survived my NSF days because of my back problem and the need to carry stores with storemen... As for now, even weights of 3-5kg can bring pain to my back. So i do need help to present my genuine problem when I have to return to camp. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Your medical report should be sufficient for downgrade. But for some reason you are not being re-vocated to clerk. Did your memo for your disc problem recommend downgrade and re-vocation?</p>
              <p>Have you obtained the necessary memos for knee and ankle to recommend downgrade? If you do not have documentary proof, you can ask your MO to refer you to specialists on the basis of looking into your pain. Once there you can ask for medical tests and scans, and the specialist will write a memo to the MO recommending downgrade and re-vocation based on the results of this scan.

              <p>I was graded PES C9L2 pre-enlistment for knee n ankle. The knee and ankle were xray-ed many years ago, though the bone structure dun show anything, the knee still acts up very easily after running on hard surfaces. The ankle was diagnoise as weak and having "elastic ligaments" (so said my specialist in the late 1990s). Perhaps i shuld ask for a MRI on the knee.</p>
              <p>Yes, i did ask for revocation before during my nsf days but it was not granted. As for my memo, the doctor did write to excuse me from heavy load lifting and that the MRI on the spine reveals a disc bulge in the spine L4/L5. He was not willing to add more to the memo and preferred to see how the physiotherapy turns out. So i could only request that he add the line "undergoing physio" in the memo.</p>

              <p>Hi, I'm serving in PNS (SPF).</p>
              <p>Recently, I was diagnosed with Bilateral Chondromalacia Patella (CMP) and sent to physio after being referred to Orthopaedics by my camp MO. I gave him the ortho's memo/letter and was given 1 mth LD(light duty) and med board.</p>
              <p>Problem is, my condition deteriorated since the xray by ortho more than 1 month ago, as in the following:</p>
              <p>-Sharp snap sound in left knee followed by acute pain inside the knee cap. Occurred twice.</p>
              <p>-Wobbling in both knees when descending stairs, sharp and acute pain when ascending.</p>
              <p>-Just last week, both knees had sudden, extremely sharp pain, I could feel the rubbing of the bones against each other and the pain became unbearable to the point that I ended up limping.</p>
              <p>-Went to see A&amp;E twice requesting for MRI scan, A&amp;E rejected my request saying that decision lies with Ortho dept.</p>
              <p>-Went to see camp MO, gave only painkillers and excuse from RMJ when I already have LD. (Wtf?)</p>
              <p>I can't bend, squat, kneel, run, straighten my knees or do anything that places high stress on my lower limbs to avoid aggravating my condition. Simple stuff like attempting to straighten my knees and a sharp, acute pain follows after trying to do so. Standing for prolonged periods of time also causes the pain to increase in intensity.</p>
              <p>Now, I just suck thumb wait for board. My condition currently doesn't permit me to do any strenuous activity that may aggravate the pain in both knees and my LD is nearing expiry, so I may have to renew it.</p>

              <p>REST. Do nothing but light duty. Over time when your leg muscles shrink (due to a lack of excerise), the knee cap will automatically fall back into place. Eat the NSAIDs to reduce the inflammation at the knee cap.</p>
