              <p>Good Morning Eac,</p>
              <p>I suffered slip disc throughout my BMT, but was OOT/OOC.</p>
              <p>It occurred during Dec'12 and I continued with training with an undiagnosed condition while wait for appt in Feb'13.</p>
              <p>Scheduled for MRI scan on Mar'13 and results came out on Apr'13, the week that I will be POP-ing.</p>
              <p>I shown my medical memo to my OC/PC before proceeding to the MO. They were shocked that I'm able to undergo all those training with a slip disc, and they're unable to decide whether to OOT/OOC me as I have completed all activities for BMT.</p>
              <p>Together with my PC we reported to the Tekong Medical Centre and file up the Service Injury Report on 12 Apr 2013, the day before POP. The MO vet through the memo and deemed that my condition was serious and EXCUSE me from various activities which resulted in POC.</p>
              <p>Till now I have yet to heard of any news regarding to the status of the injury report, it have been almost 4 months.</p>
              <p>May I know how to you check the status of the submission of the report, I'm currently in unit and the report was submitted back in BMT at Tekong.</p>

              <p>I have already spoke to the unit S1 Branch Chief Clerk, he mentioned that he was not able to track down the records in the computer system. He refered me back to the Medical Centre, but to and fro when I ask the medic to please help me track the status of the report, medic said they're unable to do so as the MO only in charge of the Medical Officer's input section of the service injury report, and tai-chi ping-pong me back to S1 Branch.</p>
              <p>As this has changed from a medical case to an administrative one due to service injury report, it has to be the responsibility of the S1 Manpower Branch.</p>

              will teach recruits technical handling and marksmanship skills; a
              Battle Inoculation Course that simulates a real battlefield; a

              BMT programme for recruits with Body Mass Index (BMI) scores
              exceeding 27.0 will be 19 weeks. This BMT programme is designed to

              classification of our soldiers is consistent with their deployment.
              The new 9-week programme will include customised physical training,

              <p>Good Morning Eac,</p>
              <p>I suffered slip disc throughout my BMT, but was OOT/OOC.</p>
              <p>It occurred during Dec'12 and I continued with training with an
              undiagnosed condition while wait for appt in Feb'13.</p>
              <p>Scheduled for MRI scan on Mar'13 and results came out on Apr'13,
              the week that I will be POP-ing.</p>
              <p>I shown my medical memo to my OC/PC before proceeding to the MO.
              They were shocked that I'm able to undergo all those training with
              a slip disc, and they're unable to decide whether to OOT/OOC me as
              I have completed all activities for BMT.</p>
              <p>Together with my PC we reported to the Tekong Medical Centre and
              file up the Service Injury Report on 12 Apr 2013, the day before
              POP. The MO vet through the memo and deemed that my condition was
              serious and EXCUSE me from various activities which resulted in
              POC.</p>
              <p>Till now I have yet to heard of any news regarding to the status
              of the injury report, it have been almost 4 months.</p>
              <p>May I know how to you check the status of the submission of the

              <p>Hi, I thought that your case will be pretty straight forward....get a phone and call up your current camp chief clerk to arrange for a medical review....your case should be sent to Medical Board for downgrading....my former camp mate also had your same medical condition and was downgraded. Its unusual that they lost your medical file...I don't think its lost....Actually when they OOC you, they should follow up a medical review in some months time...</p>

              <p>What PES status are you now? Have they downgraded you? They should have a hardcopy of your medical file in your current camp. Ask your chief clerk to check the hard copy medical file (if they have it)...if I am not wrong, I think they must schedule you for medical board...while you wait for medical board, they will send you to a different unit (usually storeman/clerk/cook/admin) units...while you wait for the medical review...have they done this already?</p>

              <p>My excuse boots status is permanent but each time is extend to only 84 days, MO said excuse status renewed as and when necessary. Specialist letter was submitted but medical condition not listed under their pink book therefore such an arrangement was provided instead.</p>
              <p>Currently pes c2 L1, ICT report in civilian clothes. Never have to touch army boots again. Learned that excuse status more powerful than pes downgrade in my own case. The issue is in my unit, once excuse boots, need not go outfield. PC said deferment of overseas ICT is high chance due to my condition if going thru him, but if I were  to see the MO and he fails my overseas FFI, than there is another avenue should the deferment not be approved....</p>
              <p>P.S. has anyone seen a case during mobilisation that someone reports in full civilian attire without FBO, I am informed of mob in a few months time, and with excuse boots, isn't it pointless to bring FBO...you're already not in no 4...so why bring FBO?</p>

              <p>I think revocation depends on your unit's operational needs. I was downgraded 3 years back to C9L3. This year, I called my unit S1 to ask if it's possible to revocate me to a non-combat vocation.</p>
              <p>She replied me that it is impossible for me to revocate. The only solution now, according to her, is for me to inform the commanders during in-pro that I am now C9L3 so they can give me sedantry duties to do. </p>
              <p>I believe similar arrangement is also used in 02194's unit.</p>

              <p>yet to revocate, only recently got the excuse boots status, as for revocation, have yet to bring it up with S1...will check with MO....but off service, do you have any excuse status or perhaps what was the reason for your downgrade?</p>
              <p>During the reservist I had just last month ago, the regulars all commented how safety was a priority following the high profile deaths in the army, and MO are to permit all cases as genuine...which means that they want to remove the stigma of reporting sick due to even minor cases...commanders have also been ordered to task safety as number 1 priority. I think it is a step in the right direction considering how the older batches were treated...if you know what I mean...The regulars even commented that the saying among them is that Army is more like a child care center these days...</p>
