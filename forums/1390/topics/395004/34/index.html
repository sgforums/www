              No as long you pass ur PES C BMT, no need to go back.
              
              Lastime I could not take PES C BMT stress, the counsuellor told me pls pull through so that if my temp pes expires you can no need go abck PES A and B BMT which is more stressful.
              
              I was given Temp PES C.
              
              Although My pes got downgraded to PES E9L9 eventually. At least I pulled through my BMT which is encouraging enough for me.

              <p> <br>usually is the same as when you report sick during NSF time and gotten Att B status, which means still fit for light duties.</p>
              <p>and for your info, FBO is then considered heavy loads but SBO is not.<br>thus technically speaking, in worst case scenario, you may still have to cheong sua a bit in SBO mode (helmet, SBO and rifle) in activities such as route marches since excuse RMJ doesn't excuse walking, so to say. also, the remaining field pack can be loaded onto the tonner or whatever vehicle supporting the field exercises, if needed.<br><br>of course, if you know how to negotiable with your in-charge who might be easy-going enough to close one eye and let u be in "vest and slack activities" such as sai-kang stuff like help out with rations, water points, carry stores...etc which are grouped under the 'fit for light duties' activities, which is the same as report sick MC of Att B status.</p>

              <p>i am alrdy orded...recently i got a memo from my physiotherapist to recommend that i excuse from running while undergoing physiotherapy due to persist ankle pain(achilles heel) and knee pain from training from ippt.</p>
              <p>I am having a appt with SAF MO to endorse my memo this coming week. Do you think this <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">physiotherapist MEMO</span></strong></em> is sufficient to allow MO to excuse me temporarily from running for this year ippt windows? I will only be seeing my specialist this end of year, so i can't get the memo from the specialist before seeing MO. Is <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">physiotherapist MEMO tanamount to specialist memo?<br></span></strong></em></p>

              <p>Hi MO,</p>
              <p>i am alrdy orded...recently i got a memo from my physiotherapist
              to recommend that i excuse from running while undergoing
              physiotherapy due to persist ankle pain(achilles heel) and knee
              pain from training from ippt.</p>
              <p>I am having a appt with SAF MO to endorse my memo this coming
              week. Do you think this <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">physiotherapist
              MEMO</span></strong></em> is sufficient to allow MO to excuse me
              temporarily from running for this year ippt windows? I will only be
              seeing my specialist this end of year, so i can't get the memo from
              the specialist before seeing MO. Is <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">physiotherapist MEMO tanamount to

              opinions written in the MEMO or i ned waste more $$ to get a immediate specialist 
              memo? this is the only supporting docs i hav.</p>

              is important that you seek medical treatment on your own should you be
              injured or is medically unfit. The medical certificate that your doctor
              issued to you is recognised as valid medical excuse. <strong>However, you can
              only be exempted from the annual IPPT if you have a 6 months
              consecutive or 9 months cumulative of valid medical excuse within the
              same IPPT qualifying window.</strong> You are advised to contact your NS Unit to
              request for a medical review if you have more than 3 months of medical
              excuse for a particular injury that prevents you from taking your IPPT.<br><strong><br>Q2 What if my 6 months consecutive or 9 months cumulative medical excuse straddle across two IPPT qualifying windows?</strong><br><strong>You
              would be dealt with as an 'IPPT Defaulter' in the 1st qualifying
              window.</strong> Hence it is strongly encouraged that you should book your IPPT
              immediately after your qualifying window has started.</span></p>
