              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I am in a tricky situation now. I was attempting my Ippt this morning and i dislocated my shoulder while doing the chin-ups. I was brought to the Medical Centre immediately and they referred me to A&amp;E (TTSH) for an X-ray scan. FYI, my shoulder injury was a recurring one and now the doctor has arranged me to see a specialist on this. So now here are my questions:</p>
              <p>1) I am attempting this ippt in view of my promotion from 2lt to lta. In other words, i got to clear my ippt by this work year. The MO said that he is putting me up for a medical review to get me down pesed to Pes B2 on 22nd December. Judging at the time n space, i will definitely not be able to make another ippt attempt this year. Moreover, the MO from my base has excused me from ippt for 3 mths (till march 2012), hence my first question is, am i still eligible for my promotion (which is supposed to take place next year Feb)?</p>
              <p>2) I am not sure if i will be further down pesd after seeing the specialist, but let say if i am stuck at Pes B2 (excused chinup and broad jump for my case), will i still be able to get the incentive/monetary award for the ippt? And do they stil use this 'partial ippt' as a criteria for my promotion?</p>
              <p>3) Subsequently, if i choose to take the full ippt, what should i do? Do i cal the medical centre to ask for a pes upgrade?</p>
              <p>Thank you in advance!</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Hi MO,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I need help on an issue that had been troubling me. I have just enlisted into the army 2 month back and is about to pop soon as I belong to the enhanced batch. Every time I am holding my rifle in my hand, I got this overwhelming compulsion to pull the trigger. Sometimes the urge is so great that I cannot even concentrate on my drills and have to devote all my attention just to make sure I don’t unconsciously slip my finger onto the trigger. At the beginning, the urge is still manageable but it get worse each time, to a extent that I found it mentally taxing just to “struggle” against myself for control over my own hand. The compulsion gets even greater during live range and I nearly <span> </span>ND-ed(negligence discharge), my finger is ready to squeeze off but I withdrawn it quickly and try not to hold my rifle but instead neck-sling it. I know seriously this is wtf and it sounds ludicrous but I am genuinely having such a condition! I didn’t report it because I fear that it will jeopardises my chances of entering into command school. <span> </span>But on the other hand, this ****ed up mental obsessions is really getting to me. ? I seriously feel like it is a matter of time I would fire something off accidentally. Please advice! Do you think it is appropriate for mr to seek help? What do you think is wrong with me? Am I mentally sound? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Thanks! </span></p>

              Hi, recently i went to specialist and i had been diagnosed with pes planus with plantar fasciitis and was given an MC which excused me from lower limb,heavy load, rmj for 3.5 months. This would automatically put my out of course in pro term in scs due to my status. however i am still â€˜on courseâ€™ carrying on with activities (knowing that i will still be oocâ€™ed) except for running etcâ€¦but there is alot of walking and my arch hurts. is it possible to ask MO for downgrade of pes status due to this condition?

               Please get a hospital specialist memo to submit to camp MO.
               For mild type, it's within PES B1 to B2 range.
               For moderate and above type, it's within PES C2 to C9 range.
              -----------------------------
              does my MC slip from CGH be enough? (it has the excuses that the MO given me and the diagnosis of the condition). Is it compsulsory to have a memo?

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I need help on an issue that had been
              troubling me. I have just enlisted into the army 2 month back and
              is about to pop soon as I belong to the enhanced batch. Every time
              I am holding my rifle in my hand, I got this overwhelming
              compulsion to pull the trigger. Sometimes the urge is so great that
              I cannot even concentrate on my drills and have to devote all my
              attention just to make sure I don’t unconsciously slip my finger
              onto the trigger. At the beginning, the urge is still manageable
              but it get worse each time, to a extent that I found it mentally
              taxing just to “struggle” against myself for control over my own
              hand. The compulsion gets even greater during live range and I
              nearly <span> </span>ND-ed(negligence discharge), my
              finger is ready to squeeze off but I withdrawn it quickly and try
              not to hold my rifle but instead neck-sling it. I know seriously
              this is wtf and it sounds ludicrous but I am genuinely having such
              a condition! I didn’t report it because I fear that it will
              jeopardises my chances of entering into command school.
              <span> </span>But on the other hand, this ****ed up
              mental obsessions is really getting to me. ? I seriously feel like
              it is a matter of time I would fire something off accidentally.
              Please advice! Do you think it is appropriate for mr to seek help?
              What do you think is wrong with me? Am I mentally sound?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Thanks!</span></p>

              Hi All,
              
              I am a pre enlistee who had just went for my check up today. Wish to check with you guys what PES status i will be and what kind of vocation i will get. 
              
              Two medical Status:
              
              1) Slip Disc - seen 2 specialist, 1 gov and 1 private, got 2 memo both recomend down pes. 
              
              2) Discovered to have abnormal heart rate?? going for another appointment as said by CPMB.
              
              Before the MO knew of these conditions he stated that most likely i will be a PES B. But what about now?
              
              Personally dont mind to chiong sua as its two years anyway and i had hoped to be an officer before but know that realistically it might not be possible with my condition. So any advice on the PES Status and whether is it worth it to chiong? Hope to get some advice from you seniors. 
              
              Thanks!

              <p>Hi guys, new poster here but this thread has been incredibly helpful for me.<br>I'm a pre enlistee, originally set to PES B1 and enlisting on 31st of jan 2012, but right now I have a psychological problem that is resurfacing ( I would really rather not talk about it since it's quite personal, sufficed to say that I thought I had left it behind but I haven't and now I need to get a down PES )</p>
              <p>I SHOULD be getting PES E status, my problem now is that I'm enlisting in about a month. I have yet to get my full report from my psychiatrist ( It should take about 2 weeks more ) so what should I do now? I understand that I have to call cmpb etc but what will happen then?</p>
              <p>Will they delay my enlistment date temporarily to set my new PES status? <br>If my new PES status doesn't come in in time, will I have to go to tekong first THEN come out?<br>And if it does come out in time, what will I do then?

              <p>Hi <br> I went to the MO for my condition and he said that my condition from what the results I gave was alright (but he couldn't determine my back muscle problem and referred me to physio) and took away my 12 weeks excuse and gave only till the day I have my physio dates. Are they allowed to do that? and according to him he said that the CO for my school doesnt want them to OOC us. But if for those who really had medical problem isnt it doing overboard?</p>

              <p>Most likely, you sprained your back.See a chinese physician, may be he can help.</p>
              <p>Yes, they can do that.</p>
              <p>After your physio date, if you are unwell you can ask for excuse again.</p>
              <p>It is like flu. This week you got flu, you see a doctor get MC and recovered. Next week, you got flu again, you still have to see a doctor, get MC and recovered. You dont get perm excuse for having flu. </p>
