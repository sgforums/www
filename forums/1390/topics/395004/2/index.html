              <p>I was just going through the updated Pes C status descriptions on ns.sg</p>
              <p>It seems the wordings for L2 to L9 has been changed quite significantly, are you able to advise what are the changes because the new descriptions seems very vague.</p>
              <p>It almost seems like they can deploy you where ever they like, just like a Pes A or B.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

However since BP stands for B (pending), I wonder what will be my pes status after the medical review?

              <p>Hi, I am currently C2L2 perm due to flat foot. I was also diagnosed with chronic ankle instability and underwent a surgery recently to repair the ligament (brostrom repair).</p>
              <p>My specialist wrote a memo to my SAF MO recommending to downgrade me, which the MO sent the case to be boarded.</p>
              <p>My question is will I be further be downgraded to C9 etc, or will it will just remain at C2L2?</p>
              <p>And for the land deployment code L2, no direct combat? Does it mean we are not able to serve in a rifle platoon as rifleman?</p>
              <p>Thanks!</p>
