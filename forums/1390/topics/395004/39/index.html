              <p>I have a sesamoid bone fracture and its been 6 months, my current MO keeps telling me it takes 3-4 weeks to heal each time i see him even though i had a specialist memo to back me up, just asking what pes would i eventually be and can he actually just keep postponing me indefinitely? Aside, i recently seen a internal medicine specialist to be diagnosed with Essential Tremor, he referred me to a a neurologist. Just wondering, would i down pes because of this?

              <p>sesmaoid bone fracture? Hardly. Cose the fracture will heal up eventually. At most a temp Pes C9L9 for a year, then upgrade back to Pes B. Unless, you have undergone a surgery with added screw to hold the fracture in place.</p>
              <p>Tremor, most likely you gain excuse arms, you can be reposted to be a Pes B storeman. The tremor may be caused by an injury to the spine, or nerve somewhere (which is very hard to diagnosis.) If you have not been diagnoised with essential tremor as early as childhood, most likely it is cause by an injury which is temporary.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the prompt reply!</p>
              <p>It will be great if its an admin issue. However right before I ORD-ed, my unit CSM told me that C9L2 is definitely deployable in the frontline and I was asked to operate in a infrantry rifle section ("chiong sua like other Pes A and B")  during ATEC.</p>
              <p>So my concern now is whether my CSM is right in this matter? Especially since I got a infantry NS unit posting and I downgraded long before I ORD-ed and not after.</p>

              Thanks for reply. But my sitaution is this: Before NS Medical Checkup No G6PD, ORD FFI Blood Test G6PD Presents. My shortage of breath could be link to my lung, because my grandfather die lung cancer at 40 years old. Btw, does family history can be also include for down PES? My father side has this blood clot problem at hand that waking up in the morning unable to open the hand (usually on master hand and 5 fingers are too stiff and lock in position). I now PES B and cannot cope with IPPT and Infantry training. Thanks.

Taking the IPPT to me is waste of time as I will never pass and I don't mind go RT, got free handsome PTI act as instructor is bonus (although if inside aircon gym is better). If ICT is about going rifle range means got free money! I just don't like to run and stay in outfield overnight (I don't sleep on mud or with insects, unless they give us sleep on training shed).

              <p>I'm currently still on Temp Pes C2L9 as a NSman.</p>
              <p>Pes Status expiring in late June 2012 this year.</p>
              <p>I got a Memo from MO (SGH) for recommendation of DownPes in Dec 2011, which i took to MO in SAF to see.</p>
              <p>His response is that I'm still covered under Temp status and there's no reason for DownPes or to convert it to Perm Pes Status.</p>
              <p>My Medical Record: Degenrative Disc (Mild Slip Disc) - MRI Verified</p>
              <p>Knee Issues : X-Ray shows my knee cartilage is worn off even before I enlisted. (Frequent Knee pain from prolong standing in 1 position else sharp pain etc)</p>
              <p>NSF Excuse Status: From 3rd week of enlistment till ORD all excused.</p>
              <p>Question: So how do I get a permanent downpes?</p>
              <p>i got a Specialist appt with SGH this April 2012.</p>
              <p>So what do I do?</p>
              <p>Do i request for a rescan of MRI to validate my Spine issue.</p>
