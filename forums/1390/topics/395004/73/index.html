                  case statement is prepared for review
                  discussion at the monthly medical board meet (usually at

                  the Chairman (SAF Regular Medical Doctor of MAJOR

                  condition has worsened which might affect their ability to perform
                  their duties during ICT. Arrangements will then be made for them to
                  attend a medical review at the SAF medical centre to assess their
                  fitness for NS.<br> <br> The NSmen MUST bring along all investigation results and
                  memorandums from his external physician/specialist during the
                  medical review. Depending on the outcome of the medical review, the
                  NSman may be given a medical certificate to defer him from ICT, be
                  scheduled for a medical board to downgrade him if his medical
                  condition is significant, or referred to a restructured hospital
                  for further investigation. In the event that the medical officer
                  determines that the NSman’s medical condition will not affect his
                  ability to participate in the ICT, he will allow the NSman to

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I got a question.</p>
              <p>I am going for my first ever ICT (low key) soon since I ORD in year 2002 (which is like 13 years).</p>
              <p>I used to be super fit (PES A) however due to lately suffered GOUT issue, my PES status is PES C9L3.</p>
              <p>I used to be AFV Driver however I am not sure what is my vocation now. I am not sure if sufferring with GOUT could still drive but I know lately my gout still painful.</p>
              <p>I feel kind of lost in many things such as how to drive? lol. I never drive since I ORD. I also lost knowing of the commands.</p>
              <p>I understand PES C9L3 before and now got different, I also not sure where I would fall into.</p>

              <p>Medical screening is a series of medical tests done at the
              Medical Classification Centre (MCC) at <abbr title="Central Manpower Base">CMPB</abbr> (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/cmpb-map.png">location map</a>).</p>
              <p>The objective of these tests is to ascertain your medical
              condition and accord you a suitable Physical Employment Status
              (PES). Based on your PES, you will be assigned to a suitable
              vocation.</p>
              <p>Here are the various PES gradings:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>PES A</strong>: Fit for all combat vocations</li>
              <li><strong>PES B1</strong>: Fit for most combat vocations</li>
              <li><strong>PES B2</strong>: Fit for some combat vocations</li>
              <li><strong>PES BP</strong>: Fit for obese <abbr title="Basic Military Training">BMT</abbr> training</li>
              <li><strong>PES C</strong>: Fit for combat support vocations</li>
              <li><strong>PES D</strong>: Temporary unfit for grading and pending
              further review</li>
              <li><strong>PES E</strong>: Fit for administrative duties only</li>
              <li><strong>PES F</strong>: Medically unfit for any form of
              service</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Note that if you are given a <abbr title="Physical Employment Status">PES</abbr> D grading, it means that
              more time/tests are required to confirm your medical condition.
              This normally takes about 2-3 months. However, this duration may be
              longer depending on your medical condition.</p>

So I actually have a plan to travel on the 5th Sep 2015 to 12th Sep 2015. Does anyone have any further knowledge about how this goes about? I know that NS will give me a prior 2 month advanced notice. And also I know that I don't have to apply an exit permit because my travelling period is not more than 1 month. Just days before I book my flight, I called Mindef but there was no follow up. So any suggestion from you people? Thanks in advance.</p></div>

               Officers, Specialists, Other Ranks and Enlistees who are leaving the 
              country <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">for more than 14 days but less than 6 months</span></strong> are required to notify MINDEF Notification Centre (MNC) / Overseas Notification Centre (ONC) via <a href="http://www.ns.sg/nsp/web/esvcs/mindef/mnc/main">Notification of Overseas Trips</a> of their country of destination and a contact telephone or a fax number
               (can be local or overseas) at which they can be contacted or where 
              information of their overseas whereabouts can be obtained during their 
              absence. NSmen with valid Exit Permit are not required to further notify
               their overseas trips to MNC / ONC). <br><br> NSmen have given feedback on the MNC through focus group discussions 
              conducted by the Committee to Strengthen National Service (CSNS) and 
              various feedback channels. While NSmen understand the need for the MNC, 
              they felt that the process could be reviewed, since Singaporeans now 
              travel more frequently.
              <br><br> The CSNS has proposed that the MNC requirements be reviewed to reduce 
              the inconvenience to NSmen, while maintaining the operational readiness 
              of the SAF. At the same time, the CSNS recognises that Singapore's peace
               and stability cannot be taken for granted, and the security environment
               can change quickly. A strong and operationally ready SAF is needed to 
              deter would-be aggressors and meet a wide range of security threats. 
              After careful consideration, MINDEF and the SAF have decided to extend 
              the period of exemption from notification from one to 14 days. From 1 
              Jul 2014, only NSmen who travel overseas for more than 14 days but less 
              than 6 months will be required to notify the MNC. This will reduce 
              inconvenience for the large majority of NSmen, while still providing the
               SAF with information on those who are overseas for longer periods, to 
              support manpower and operational planning. The notification requirement 
              may be adjusted depending on the security threat assessment. NSmen in 
              units on operational manning are still required to seek approval from 
              their unit commanders before travelling overseas.
              <br><br> Based on similar considerations, the revised requirement will also apply
               to the ONC, which is the MNC equivalent for NSmen in the Police and 
              SCDF.</p>
