              <p><span><strong>Q1 What if I am injured or medically unfit to take my non-ICT IPPT during my qualifying window?</strong><br>It is important that you seek medical treatment on your own should you be injured or is medically unfit. The medical certificate that your doctor issued to you is recognised as valid medical excuse. <strong>However, you can only be exempted from the annual IPPT if you have a 6 months consecutive or 9 months cumulative of valid medical excuse within the same IPPT qualifying window.</strong> You are advised to contact your NS Unit to request for a medical review if you have more than 3 months of medical excuse for a particular injury that prevents you from taking your IPPT.<br><strong><br>Q2 What if my 6 months consecutive or 9 months cumulative medical excuse straddle across two IPPT qualifying windows?</strong><br><strong>You would be dealt with as an 'IPPT Defaulter' in the 1st qualifying window.</strong> Hence it is strongly encouraged that you should book your IPPT immediately after your qualifying window has started.</span></p>

              <p>I thk my birthday open after dec cos my birthday is on dec. But as mentioned, since my ord which is at June 2008 till now, i did not attend IPPT at all nor they ask me back for medical review. But ICT i already go back for 3 times alr. And also, whenever at ns.sg when i key in my particular under the book ippt/rt, it always show 'Your NRIC No is not found in the IPPT system', even till now is the same.</p>
              <p>So i am not sure what is going on now. Ask me back for medical review and suddenly tell me is cancelled. Specialist already ask me go MRI scan and wrote a memo to MO stating that he will see the MRI report before further discussing my issue. Now the memo is with me but tell me medical review is cancelled.</p>
              <p>Called ns hotline and they tell me they will send a request to my unit and someone will call me back within 3-5days.</p>
              <p>Dunno if will kana charge anot cos i really miss IPPT for very long.</p>

              <p>Hi, <br><br>I am enlisting on Sept 8th (Mono intake Selerang Camp PTP) 10AM. My schoolmate happened to be enlisting on the same day, same camp and same time as well. I would like to ask:</p>
              <p>1. Does that mean we will be in the same coy? (Cause' from what I know, some are reporting at 9.30AM, some at 10.30AM etc)<br>2. Am I right to say a coy has 4 platoon? A platoon has 4 sections? A section has around 14 people? (I know this is a classic question but would still like to confirm..) <br>3. Bunk, does they allocate us in birth date order? (I read some post, the user said in his camp, there are 4 floor and its sorted from the top youngest to the bottom oldest. Does that apply to mono-intake as well?) My friend and my birthday is only 6 days apart, same year somemore. High chance we might be same bunk too?<br>4. Do we get to learn swimming in PTP?</p>
              <p>Can anyone clarify my doubts? Thank you! :)</p>

              Hi,
              I need help to clarify my situation pls. I'm 37yrs old reservist and was told to go for medical screening 2 months ago in July. MO said he might downgrade me and he gave me excuse IPPT/ICT 3 months. Last week I received orders for ICT in March 2012. Today out of nowhere my unit called and told me I've been downgraded from PES B to PES E L9. The clerk told me this means no need IPPT. After reading some of the post here, it says PES E no need reservist. So I'm confused... will they discharge me? or will they review my vocation or posting? Do I still need to go for that ICT in March? Thank you in advance for any help.

              <p>They may not discharge you.</p>
              <p>By right they should review your vocation or posting. If they forgot, then ask them at a later date. Wait and see.</p>
              <p>If you are an officer than even Pes Z they would want you back. It is because at the commanding level, you dont really need to be that fit.</p>
              <p>Pes E is less needed for reservist. Rarely they call up a Pes E because why do they need to pay full salary to hire a guy to staple paper in the office.</p>

              <p>Hello</p>
              <p>I've been suffering from knee injury since the 2nd month of enlistment till now, which is roughly 3+ months. Went to the mo regarding the pain as it has gotten more severe, to which his reply was 'its normal', and gave me muscle relaxants and pain killers(they give it for almost everything._.)</p>
              <p>Recently went to a sports specialist at CGH and was diagnosed with pantellarfemoral pain syndrom/ illiotibial band syndrome. Which is essentially Runner's knee and isn't really down-gradable... However, the specialist explained to me my injury and whats the cause. Apparently it isn't to overuse which results in worn out cartilage.</p>
              <p>The pain is due to my knee being mis-aligned causing pressure on the muscle resulting in the illiotibial band syndrome, ie pain at the side of my knee.I have x-rays to document the mis-alignement, however it wasn't explained to me the severity of the mis-alignemnt. I've been recommended to go for physio and insole fitting.</p>
              <p>Most importantly, is my case down-gradable since its a bone being mis-aligned rather than wear and tear? The MO told me currently without the memmo or xrays, at most i'll be temporarily down pes, imo which isn't going to solve the issue.</p>
              <p>THANK YOU in advance! I don't know where else to get opinions. ):</p>

              <p>Hi guys. I posted here before.</p>
              <p>I was graded PES E (temp 6months) for Scoliosis, have already graduated from BMT. What are the chances that I can push to up PES?</p>
              <p>First of all, I have no produced any specialist letter during my CMPB Checkup. The MO graded me. Infact I only know I had Scoliosis after the check up.</p>
              <p>Secondly, MO didn;t further refer and update me to visit specialist to correct my scoliosis problem.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, how fast can I have my medical review?</p>
              <p>Fourth, whats the highest PES I can go up? (I kinda prefer C lol!)</p>
              <p>Fifth, if I will to visit a doctor to correct my scoliosis, how much will it be subsidised by 11b?</p>
              <p>Thanks in advance.</p>

              <p>Hi guys, after attending 1 ICT, I was downgraded to c9l9 from pes B. 
              Previously I was an Armoured Infantry Trooper. Will I still be suitable 
              for this vocation? If yes, what exactly am i excused from? If no, can 
              any officers or MO from armour unit advise what normally is the 
              company's arrangement for me? I was downgraded due to eczema and my 
              condition flares up when I wear uniform and do strenuous training with 
              my heavy weapons.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I had a couple of questions and I was wondering if anyone can help me out. I'm going to start off with a background on my situation.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I'm enlisting to BMTC HQ on November 24 for Obese BMT. I've been studying in the US for the last 3-4 years and had my education listed at "A-Level Equivalent". Apparently in the SG military system, they also logged that I requested deferment while I was still in school because I studied for a semester at Harvard. I did pretty decent in school and was president of a couple of societies. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">My questions are:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">1. Is the PES BP BMT going to be as chill as people make it out to be? -- what should I expect?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">2. Being a foreign student, I heard that I'd get a lot of shit from the commanders, how true is this? </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">3. What can I do during BMT to not get totally shit all over and marked for being a foreign student?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">4. Will my past record that is logged into their system play any role in determining if I get put through the "leadership" batch or not, despite being in PES BP?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Thanks and I really appreciate all the advice I can get.</p>

              <p><br>it's a myth...<br>they don't care whether it's temp or perm. it's just simply by 2 terms, namely combat-fit and non-combat-fit.</p>
              <p>1st, rank promotion is time-based and conduct-based.<br>e.g. combat-fit = minimum 7mths* for LCP, 12mths* + IPPT pass for CPL.<br>non-combat-fit = minimum 7mths* for LCP, 15mths* for CPL.<br><br>* = time starting from date of enlistment + passed BMT (PTE rank).<br><br>2nd, when under proper procedure and no admin lapse, the chief clerk will generate a list of personnel to recommend for promotion due to the above 2 criterias, then pass the work to the manpower clerk, then he email your supervisor-in-charge for approval.<br>3rd, if he approved, you promote. if he don't, you lan lan suck thumb.<br><br>so in the end, it's your supervisor-in-charge who's playing your rank, provided that there is no admin lapse from manpower branch.</p>

              <p><br><strong>more info, pls go read this:<br><a href="/forums/1390/topics/261979">http://sgforums.com/forums/1390/topics/261979</a></strong><br><br>1st, let's say that vocational postings are usually at random. the only thing you can do is this. when in tekong BMT, there's a monthly PC (platoon officer-in-charge) 1-to-1 personal interview to jot down notes in your personal military booklet. during that private interview, you can only <em>express interest</em> to him on the vocation/ formation you interested in, but please be informed that there's no guarantee/ promise whatsoever.<br><br>2nd, even if after tekong BMT finished, you may not be posted to guards unit immediately afterwards in the 1st instance. next,  you are usually randomly posted to any other vocational courses such as signaller/ combat medic/ technician/ transport...etc. courses. then during the vocational course, you still got chance to express interest again to be posted to guards unit after the vocational training since a guards unit needs medics, drivers, signallers, recce troopers...etc. to function as a unit too.<br><br>3rd, vocation postings is they choose, not you choose. final decision you have no say at all...</p>
