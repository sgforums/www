              <p>hi just need some advise on my situation.<br> <br> <br> im pes E9L9 and completed 2 years of service. but i disrupted to go
              studies and now have few more months left to serve. im about to be
              downgraded to PES F. im ok with that since its very disruptive to
              go back but im worried about future job prospects. i have uni
              education (ntu/nus/smu) and come from top school and i have work
              experience too including internship at govt linked places.
              ironically none of those places ever asked of my NS background
              then. just a small box asking for my status which i usually tick
              deferred and write pes E9L9, or sometimes i write exempted. no one
              even follows up on it and asks me whats wrong.<br> <br> <br> i saw some of the other postings and there are ppl saying its
              impossible to get job etc. is this true or just rumours? anyone
              knows of this happening first hand whereby someone with PES F is
              rejected for a job due to med condition? i would think with so many
              foreigners around no one really goes into details abt NS matters
              anymore. unless ur PES F is a very serious case. mine is actually
              due a form of anxiety disorder/social stress disorder. its not
              severity of it but rather SAF environment is not suitable for me.
              anyone who's served NS would know why. some advise will help.
              thanks.</p>

              <p>Like everyone else said, your boss will be interested to know why did you not serve Ns and what special reasons you have that even NS rejected you as a clerk. Since you have serve almost all of NS and left only few months. Why not serve it full ?</p>

              <p><br>Only SAF MO knows how to grade ur PES STATUS. Even outside specialist dunno how SAF MO grades ur PES status.</p>
              <p>But outside MO can advise the SAF MO, for example the patient should be excused from running/marching jogging permanently.</p>
              <p>For example my frenz doctor wrote a memo asking the SAF MO to excuse him from sweating due to skin condition,</p>
              <p>Another of my frenz excused firearms cos the outside psychiatrist said the patient is unfit for handling of firearms.</p>

              <p>(Can't seem to post in the Medical thread, thus posting here)</p>
              <p>Dear MO,</p>
              <p>I would like to seek advise from ex or current SAF MO. I am having lower back pain with the pain radiating down to my left leg (pain + a little bit of numb) and I have difficulty walking properly (without having to limp). I went to my camp MO to report sick and was given Light Duties till my appointment with my specialist at SGH. </p>
              <p>During the period when I was given light duties and as all of the NSFs know, would be made to do sai kang. I was made to use the ET Blade to loosen the sand on the SOC ground and also to carry dumb bells from the store to another place and everytime after that, the pain would be aggravated and my left leg would also be in pain. I still continued doing because my commander would sure think that I chao geng or whatever since loosening the sand all that is not "heavy duty". Therefore, I've to rely on Tramadol (Panadols don't work)  to stop the pain because if I don't take pain killers, I can't get to sleep at night as the pain is too intense.</p>
              <p>Fast forward, I saw my specialist at SGH and was told to have minimal bulging disc from L1/2 to L4/5. I've done a Lumbar MRI before I have my back injured due to some bladder problem. Hence, my specialist gave me another Lumbar MRI appointment and also a month MC.</p>
              <p>I went back to camp to endorse my MC but my MO didn't want to endorse the MC stating that he find that it is too long. The MO gave me a 5 days MC and told me to report back to camp and see him after that and he also said that he will talk to my specialist about my mc.</p>
              <p>Question 1) Is there any medical directive that the MO is allowed to over-ride the MC given by my specialist ? </p>
              <p>Question 2) If I report back to camp after the 5 days MC the MO gave me and the MO wasn't able to reach my specialist, is the MC given by my specialist still valid or is it nullified ?</p>
              <p>Please advise on what I should do as I think I really need the rest. I've been depending too much on painkillers when I am in the camp.</p>
              <p>Thanks in advance</p>

              <p><br>1) Yes, the Camp MO has the prerogative. After the MC period, he have the options to extend the MC period and also its subsequent renewal basis.<br><br>2) You can still use the same specialist memo and the accompanying hospital MC to get your camp MO to renew the MC extension.</p>
              <p>3) Please sound out when you have real medical case to your PC, since you are not malingering. Honestly tell your camp MO about the work you are doing now and thus request him to please give you temporary excuse status such as excuse heavy loads, excuse carrying heavy objects to further add on to your normal Att B (Fit for Light Duties) status. And just show your specialist memo to your PC to have his understanding on your medical conditions.</p>
