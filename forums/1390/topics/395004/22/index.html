              <p>Hi Eac</p>
              <p>Once again, thanks for the reply.</p>
              <p>I understand the effects quite well as I took it in the midst of BMT. It affected me quite badly and that was why I stopped it. However, my condition worsened and I have no choice but the take it again.</p>
              <p>I guess I will be seeing if the medication will be affecting me during my training. If there is I will be approaching the MO again.</p>
              <p>Do you think the MO will entertain me if the medication really affects me?</p>

              <p>Would like to ask...</p>
              <p>I'm a NSman and underwent an operation on the spine. And due to operation i have metal plates in my spine. I got a memo and went for medical review. During the medical review, the MO took out a A4 size thick book with pink coverpage. I think that is the much talk about pes bible. He looked at my memo and looked at the book. Took some time to think Then he said i can't be excused from reservist, but will give me mc to excuse me from several things. He also put me up for medical board. Think will have to wait few months for the result.</p>
              <p>The next week after the review i have to go for ict. Then i showed the memo to my unit MO. According to him, any op done on the spine will likely be down to prob pes e. IS this true? Any ex-MO here can verify this? What is the likely pes status for pple who done spine op? Is there anybody here done spine op before and got downgraded?</p>
              <p>Also according to my friend who is still in active NSF, he said there is a new directive that even L9 personnel need to go out field. From what i understand, L3 and below dun need. Is there such a new directive? Maybe his unit garang and some encik/officer smoke my friend.</p>
              <p>Thanks</p>

              <p>I went to see a government hospital specialist about a week ago regarding my long-term serious problem. I can't specifically say what severe condition I have here for confidential/privacy purposes. My specialist said that the highest I can obtain is pes E or if I can't take it, I'll be pulled out from army. Does this mean that army will give me the status based on the medical report he'll give them?</p>
              <p>Which one weigh more? Specialist words or army doctor's words?</p>
              <p>I may have another condition due to 2 ECG scan papers (polyclinic and hosp) and a strong family heart medical history. Currently I'm waiting for my heart specialist appointment. The earliest appoint I could get is the day before cmpb medical checkup. They have no earlier slots. If the heart specialist couldn't diagnose my problem and need to have another appointment, what will happen? Since my cmpb medical checkup is the day after my specialist appointment date.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, it's the most highly likely since there's a hospital specialist report to be given to the CMPB Doctor <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">even before</span></em> your date of enlistment. It's much more better and easier this way than to downgrade later while serving.</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, please just ask the cardiologist (heart specialist) to write a specialist memo to be given to the CMPB Doctor on the very next day.</p>

              <p>If i have been posted an enlistment date (may) but have a new condition that is backed up by a memo from a specialist, should i keep it till the first day of enlistment or head down to CMPB for a review?</p>
