I am just a little uptight about it, cos its really important that they in MINDEF can allow me to do my actions when I am affected by OCD. I really have to do these rituals even though they are senseless and take up lots of time. My obsessions are not just about cleanliness and germs. There are much more other stuff that distress me. I have told my doctor about it. Don't worry about me, I will take the medication and I do have a review again in 2 weeks. Thanks everyone. Btw I see a psychologist for therapy also.

              <p>if your vocation allows you to book out every evening without any recalls or anything, you should be able to study your part time degree while serving NS. but in any case, you may want to let ur superior know, so at least in any event, you are accounted for.</p>

              <p>Hi. I have question that I need answer.</p>
              <p>I have lung problem when I was newborn. I was hospitalised in SGH for 2 weeks. My heart-beat rate was abnormally fast during certain times of the day. They couldn't detect the problem with my lungs and wanted to hospitalised me longer. However, my mum couldn't take it anymore by seeing me get poked everyday and asked for the hospital to discharge me. My mum had to sign a "contract" which stated that if anything happen to me in the future, the hospital will not be held responsible.</p>
              <p>The question is:</p>
              <p>Does the hospital still keep record of my lung problem even after over 20 years?</p>
              <p>My mum did not get any medical letters or any form of papers that I had that lung problem because she discharged me during observation. I want to know whether they still keep record so I can show it to the MO during pre-enlist medical screening.</p>

              <p>Depends on which camp you are send to.</p>
              <p>Generally, you are expected to paperwork.</p>
              <p>If you are in a 'good' camp, that will be all that you do, and the rest of the time you will be at canteen, gym, on the computer ....etc. If you are in a 'not-so-good' camp, be prepared to clean up places, carry load, help out others from other vocations ....etc.</p>
              <p>Part time degree, yes. As someone said, it will be better to ask your 'boss' for permission first.</p>

              <p>one reason why maybe, when i went for my medical checkup, i only brought a diagnosis letter of my brain tumor, not a memo from my doctor. and my MO didnt even ask me anything, i was the one doing the talking, and all along, he was giving me the damn buay song face. </p>
              <p>my plan is to get all the memos as stated above and return to CMPB to get another medical classification. </p>
              <p>but i'm only afraid that they might upgrade me PES instead of giving me a PES F.</p>

              <p>well one thing's for sure, there's no GUARANTEED Pes F unless of course you have incurable diseases like AIDS or cancer (ur tumour shouldnt be cancerous right..)</p>
              <p>and yes, MOST MOs in the army have that buay song face, thinking they are all that superior just because they went to medical school and have 3 bars on their shoulders. pui. (like i said, MOST MOs so if you're not like that, just ignore me.)</p>
              <p>in any case i dont think they will upgrade your PES status, and even if they do, it'll most likely be in the PES C region and likely not to be combat fit.</p>

              <p>Hi I'm due for NS enlistment check-up later this year but recently (end of last year in fact) I injured my shoulder and after going through an MRI scan, the specialist stated that I got a labrum tear.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As such, I am scheduled to undergo surgery in a couple of weeks and the specialist said that he will have to write a letter asking for me to be excused from push-ups and pull-ups. What i would like to know is what PES will that qualify me as? Thanks</p>
