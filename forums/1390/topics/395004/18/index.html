              <p>Hi I'm due for NS enlistment check-up later this year but recently (end of last year in fact) I injured my shoulder and after going through an MRI scan, the specialist stated that I got a labrum tear.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As such, I am scheduled to undergo surgery in a couple of weeks and the specialist said that he will have to write a letter asking for me to be excused from push-ups and pull-ups. What i would like to know is what PES will that qualify me as? Thanks</p>

              <p>I thought NS will have the full check-up?</p>
              <p>I did asked my parents to send me for a full check-up but my dad said that there'll be ECG scan there and asked me not to worry because they'll detect my problem there. I have occassion chest pain problem during primary and secondary school. I only attended P.E lessons the first 2 years + in my life because of nausetic and chest pain problem. It carries on even to now which even climbing one floor up the stairs make me feel very breathless and my chest felt sharp pain with fast heart-beat. I don't want to go for hospital checkups because it's very costly. My parents talk too much about using up money which made me feel very discouraged to go for checkups. I'm relying on the health check-up that NS is giving to us.</p>
              <p>This isn't the only problem that I'm facing. I have other problems but I don't want to disclose here because I don't feel comfortable. I told about this problem to a couple of my trusted friends and they urge me to get a specialist memo asap. My sec 4 form teacher urged me to seek a specialist 5 years ago too. I have so much fear to approach a specialist. I don't even know if I can speak it to the MO. I have the tendancy to keep problems to myself and fear to speak out. There was one time I fainted during P.E lesson in lower secondary because I didn't declare I had fever the previous day. I'm in a dillemma right now.</p>

              <p>No the NS checkup is different. You have to get a specialist memo in order to down PES. To get that memo, you must find a specialist first....no way out. You must do something to help yourself....otherwise the one who suffers in the end will be you.....</p>

              <p>Prior to enlistment, all pre-enlistees have to undergo a thorough medical examination at the Medical Classification Centre (MCC) within the Central Manpower Base (CMPB). This examination allows the medical fitness of a pre-enlistee to be assessed and this subsequently determines his Physical Employment Status (PES).</p>
              <p><strong>Medical Screening Appointment Preparations</strong></p>
              <p>As part of the e-documentation, you are also required to select your preferred medical appointment date as well as to complete the medical questionnaire (e7F). You will need to go through the medical questionnaire form with your parents / guardian so that useful medical information about you is captured.</p>

              <p>1) Having a specialist memo in hand before going to the CMPB checkup is a value-added insurance. The rule of thumb is, "no specialist memo, no talk."</p>

              <p>Thanks eac and demon bane.</p>
              <p>I thought NS will have the full check-up?</p>
              <p>I did asked my parents to send me for a full check-up but my
              dad said that there'll be ECG scan there and asked me not to
              worry because they'll detect my problem there. I have occassion
              chest pain problem during primary and secondary school. I only
              attended P.E lessons the first 2 years + in my life
              because of nausetic and chest pain problem. It carries on even to
              now which even climbing one floor up the stairs make me feel
              very breathless and my chest felt sharp pain with fast heart-beat.
              I don't want to go for hospital checkups because it's very costly.
              My parents talk too much about using up money which
              made me feel very discouraged to go for checkups. I'm relying
              on the health check-up that NS is giving to us.</p>
              <p>This isn't the only problem that I'm facing. I have other
              problems but I don't want to disclose here because I don't feel
              comfortable. I told about this problem to a couple of my trusted
              friends and they urge me to get a specialist memo asap. My sec
              4 form teacher urged me to seek a specialist 5 years ago
              too. I have so much fear to approach a specialist. I don't even
              know if I can speak it to the MO. I have the tendancy to keep
              problems to myself and fear to speak out. There was one time I
              fainted during P.E lesson in lower secondary because I
              didn't declare I had fever the previous day. I'm in a dillemma
              right now.</p>

              <p>I had never heard of genuine cases go DB before. Unless that guy is fake and the memo state malingering. Just get memo from specialist see MO....</p>

              <p>Thanks again.</p>
              <p>I followed the advices in the forum here instead of my friend's advice. I went to polyclinic today because of the symptoms getting stronger through time. I went through ECG and xray. It was my first time in my life. The ecg result made me scared. The first thing I saw on the ECG paper was "-Abnormal ECG-". The sentences above that phrase has soome numbers and text which I don't understand. There's "something-elevation suggest acute pericar-something with many dots then complicated numbers &amp; words" and others along with this sentence. The doctor told me it's very concerning and he explained the curve in the red graph. He refered me to A &amp; E with "urgency: immediate". They did some tests and refer me to a heart specialist. It was quite a scary today, but I'm thankful to know it early. It was my first experience taking tests like this. I feel like I overcome my lifelong phobia of going checkups.</p>
              <p>My heart specialist appointment is after my army medical screening appointment. Can I give the memo to CMPB after my army medical screening date or must it be during the screening day?</p>

              <p><br>Good.<br>As mentioned above, it's better if you can get to re-schedule the specialist appointment before the CMPB checkup, and therefore submit the memo on the day itself for better and faster processing to determine your PES.<br>Otherwise, call CMPB @ <strong>6373 1340 </strong>to request another PES review <strong>(for Pre-Enlistees after CMPB Checkup).</strong></p>
