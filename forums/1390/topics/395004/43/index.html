              <p>Hi, may I ask what are the chances of a PES upgrade from temp E1 L9 under the following circumstances: (gonna go for a medical review soon)</p>
              <p>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Did MRI twice</span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>First MRI detected a problem (non-compaction of myocardium) which usually worsens as time goes by (based by the doctor) but will have to do another MRI a year later. The MRI was done during the period when I was pretty active in physical activities due to college PE.</li>
              <li>Second MRI discharged me as no problem was found. This MRI was done during the period when I was completely inactive in physical activities as I was told by my doctor that I should not do strenuous exercises after finding out that I have a heart-related problem.</li>
              <li>(I still experience breathlessness and chest tightness/pain occasionally, so should I see a different doctor from another hospital first before the medical review, or should I consult the SAF MO, and request a further review by a doctor from another hospital? I am kinda in a dilemma about this..)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tinea pedis (fungal infection on feet)</span></p>
              <p>
              </p><ul>
              <li>I declared this condition, but I told the MO it comes and goes, so it was not a major problem. However, it is worsening because I currently wear socks and shoes for a longer period of time (normal working hours) compared to the college times (morning till about 3 pm) and because of the weather which causes me to sweat but I still have to put on socks and shoes.</li>
              </ul>
              <p></p>
              <div>Side notes:</div>
              <div>1. Does (dangerously low [about 16]/high [about 38]) BMI affect PES?</div>
              <div>2. If one has a psychological problem like OCD and if it's declared to the MO, does the serviceman need to see a psychologist, or can the serviceman request not to see one because of social stigma?</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Thanks for the attention and looking forward to a reply!</div>

              <p>Correction. The MO will record the medical condition down accordingly. I think in your case it is not severe to be worthy of downgrading. It like the MO cannot downgrade some1 for having flu regularly.</p>
              <p>However, some people may have very severe migraine involving auras, loss of perception and more. They may also take drug regularly. These drugs will cause slowness, sleepiness, dizziness and hallucination. In such cases, downgrade for migraine is possible.</p>

              <p>My migraine is quite severee when it hits me, I am on several pain killers but I choose only to take them when my migraine has come, when i do not have migraine headaches i do not take them as i feel they are bad for me.</p>
              <p>at times the headaches are so pain that i cannot even lie down to try and sleep, i will become disoriented and walk around aimlessly pulling my own hair. the left side of my face, which is also the side which the migraine occurs, will also become swollen</p>

              <p>Hi, may I ask what are the chances of a PES upgrade from temp E1
              L9 under the following circumstances: (gonna go for a medical
              review soon)</p>
              <p>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Did MRI
              twice</span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>First MRI detected a problem (non-compaction of myocardium)
              which usually worsens as time goes by (based by the doctor) but
              will have to do another MRI a year later. The MRI was done during
              the period when I was pretty active in physical activities due to
              college PE.</li>
              <li>Second MRI discharged me as no problem was found. This MRI was
              done during the period when I was completely inactive in physical
              activities as I was told by my doctor that I should not do
              strenuous exercises after finding out that I have a heart-related
              problem.</li>
              <li>(I still experience breathlessness and chest tightness/pain
              occasionally, so should I see a different doctor from another
              hospital first before the medical review, or should I consult the
              SAF MO, and request a further review by a doctor from another
              hospital? I am kinda in a dilemma about this..)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tinea pedis (fungal
              infection on feet)</span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>I declared this condition, but I told the MO it comes and goes,
              so it was not a major problem. However, it is worsening because I
              currently wear socks and shoes for a longer period of time (normal
              working hours) compared to the college times (morning till about 3
              pm) and because of the weather which causes me to sweat but I still
              have to put on socks and shoes.</li>
              </ul>
              <div>Side notes:</div>
              <div>1. Does (dangerously low [about 16]/high [about 38]) BMI
              affect PES?</div>
              <div>2. If one has a psychological problem like OCD and if it's
              declared to the MO, does the serviceman need to see a psychologist,
              or can the serviceman request not to see one because of social
              stigma?</div>

              <p>1. You may get a strongly-worded specialist memo/ 2nd opinion memo from another specialist.</p>
              <p>2. Take off your shoes when sitting in your office workstation to air your shoes, socks and feet dry. Apply over-the-counter anti-frugal cream from any pharmacy. Also, you can spray shoe deodorant and powder your feet with the reliable potent SAF housebrand body and foot powder.</p>
              <p>3. Being skinny/ poor physique is generally PES B, while being obese is PES Bp.</p>
              <p>4. If you want to be well and treat your OCD effectively, you will be either be referred to a SAF phychiatrist or a public hospital phychiatrist. There must be 1 phychiatrist assigned to work together with the camp MO to treat/ manage your condition.</p>

              <p>Depends on the severity of schizophrenia , may be Pes B, C, E or F. When your mother have to bring you to CMPB for screening then surely you are Pes F. When you are unfit for screening (hospitalized), then double-confirmed it is Pes F.</p>
              <p>In your case, I certainly hoped that you would get a better Pes status, because it would affect your life dramatically.</p>
