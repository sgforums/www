              <p>Hi everyone, i’m currently a <span>JC2</span> student awaiting medical checkup. I have high myopia in both eyes. 1000 in right eye, 1200 in left eye. I’ve gone through two eye operations to seal tiny holes in the retina in my left eye because of a risk of retina detachment. I go for regular checkups at the Singapore national eye centre. I also have a history of asthma. What <span>PES</span> do you guys think I’ll be given?</p>

              <p>Hello, I'm new to sgforums so I hope this is the correct place to pose my question.</p>
              <p>I am currently a final-year poly student waiting for my ns medical screening. I have been diagnosed in SGH with synovitis, an inflammation of the lining of the joints in my right arm. This causes severe pain to shoot through my arm when I lift it above my head or when I bend my wrist and fingers. As a result, I'm prescribed strong anti-inflammatory drugs to relieve the pain. This condition seems very rare as I cannot find much info about it locally. What kind of PES status am I likely to get?</p>

              <p>Hello. I am an NSF currently in the rifleman vocation, PES B L1. 3 months ago in early May, I had an in-service injury, injuring my left shoulder causing strain, inflammation and interrupted sleeps daily. After 3 weeks of ex UL status, the camp MO gave me OOC status with 2 months light duties based on my specialist suspicion that I have a rotator cuff tear injury.</p>
              <p>However, during the month of June and half of July, I was made to become store party, ammo party and also follow the fighting fit to numerous outfield. Even worse, despite sounding out that I have to go for my first physiotherapy appt,it was postponed twice (worth 3 weeks).</p>
              <p>In July, during my first physio visit, my condition was very bad despite given the status of light duties.</p>
              <p>To make matters worse, I was chosen to be a temp storeman for my coy. Ex Upper limb n doing storework do not match.</p>
              <p>When my MRI scan results came out, the MRI report stated that I have <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">supraspinatus tendinous interstitial tear</span></strong>. The specialist letter stated "KIV downgrade, kindly consider ex UL, heavy loads". Hence the MO gave me 3 month status of ex rmj, HL, UL, overhead heavy objects but did not board me. However, this does not work. I m still a temp storeman.</p>
              <p>Just recently, my specialist says that i should not be doing store work. Hence he recommended clerical work. Eventually, the MO wrote a memo to my coy office saying that i only can do desk-bound duties.

              <p>Hello. I am an NSF currently in the rifleman vocation, PES B L1.
                  3 months ago in early May, I had an in-service injury, injuring my
                  left shoulder causing strain, inflammation and interrupted sleeps
                  daily. After 3 weeks of ex UL status, the camp MO gave me OOC
                  status with 2 months light duties based on my specialist
                  suspicion that I have a rotator cuff tear injury.</p>
              <p>However, during the month of June and half of July, I was made
                  to become store party, ammo party and also follow the fighting fit
                  to numerous outfield. Even worse, despite sounding out that I
                  have to go for my first physiotherapy appt,it was postponed twice
                  (worth 3 weeks).</p>
              <p>In July, during my first physio visit, my condition was very bad
                  despite given the status of light duties.</p>
              <p>To make matters worse, I was chosen to be a temp storeman
                  for my coy. Ex Upper limb n doing storework do not match.</p>
              <p>When my MRI scan results came out, the MRI report stated that I
                  have <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">supraspinatus tendinous interstitial
                  tear</span></strong>. The specialist letter stated "KIV downgrade,
                  kindly consider ex UL, heavy loads". Hence the MO gave me 3 month
                  status of ex rmj, HL, UL, overhead heavy objects but did not board
                  me. However, this does not work. I m still a temp storeman.</p>
              <p>Just recently, my specialist says that i should not be doing
                  store work. Hence he recommended clerical work. Eventually, the MO
                  wrote a memo to my coy office saying that i only can do desk-bound
                  duties. However i cant since my officer says that priority goes to
                  those already downgarded, hence still a temp storeman.</p>
              <p>Also, my physiotherapist says that my condition sometimes
                  improves and worsens because of store work.</p>

              <p>1. Should I visit the camp MO again?</p>
              <p>2. Should I see my specialist asap?</p>
              <p>3. If my camp MO decides to board me, what pes status will i
                  get? PES C2L2 or something else? Temp or Perm if I were to do
                  surgery  If you have shoulder pain ,</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>-Act stupid, if you have shoulder pain, see the MO and ask him what to do. Take it just like fever and flu. If you have flu today you see the MO, three days later , you have not recovered, MC expired, you see MO again, three days later you have not recovered again, MC gain. You do that for other diseases, why dont do it for shoulder injury? It is a fact that your shoulder has not recovered and you dont know what to do. So consult your nearest doctor.</p>
              <p>- Your specialist cannot help you, unless you want do a surgery or something.But he can recommend you downgrade or change of vocation.</p>
              <p>- You may have minor cuff tear, but if it is not serious, you may not need to downgrade, and rarer you are given a long rest. If you have a major tear, it should be C2 L2, excuse chin up for IPPT.</p>
              <p>- After you are downgraded, then the system will "officially " allow you to be posted out as other vocation.</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>My situation is as follows: I've been having chronic lower back pain for close to a year already. Seen the MO, who then referred me to an orthopaedic specialist. Did an MRI, for which it showed that I have a dessicated L5/S1 disc with a small annular tear and posterior central protrusion. No nerve compression was identified.</p>
              <p>As such, I'm wondering, will my condition warrant a down PES of any sort? Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hello, I'm new to sgforums so I hope this is the correct place to pose my question.</p>
              <p>I am currently a final-year poly student waiting for my ns medical screening. I have been diagnosed in SGH with synovitis, an inflammation of the lining of the joints in my right arm. This causes severe pain to shoot through my arm when I lift it above my head or when I bend my wrist and fingers. As a result, I'm prescribed strong anti-inflammatory drugs to relieve the pain. This condition seems very rare as I cannot find much info about it locally. What kind of PES status am I likely to get?</p>
