              <p>I got a Memo from MO (SGH) for recommendation of DownPes in Dec

              <p>His response is that I'm still covered under Temp status and

              Hi, i would like to know how long does it take for PES status to be reviewed?
              i had filled in the form for down pes and waited for around 1month+. Recently, i went to the MO and ask the coperal and he said that the computer will show 'pending' for my pes if i am on the process of pending down pes. however when he check the computer, he reveals that the computer shows my current pes (which is B1L1) instead of 'pending'. is it possible that i have been 'forgotten'?

              <p>I'm currently a unit clerk (temp PES E), and have not gone for my PES review despite my PES status expiring last month. My boss still wants to keep me in the branch till I ORD.</p>
              <p>I found this post in an older topic, may I know if it's still relevant? Will there be any disciplinary consequences (not from unit) or ORD implications? If the post still it is, then my question has been answered, and there shouldn't be any issues. Could anyone help me clarify this?</p>

              <p>Hi MO,</p>
              <p>             I
                                      OOCed from BSLC SISPEC in APR 07 due to Pneumonia. I got my 6
                                      months temp PES E9L9 status in MAY 07 and subsequently got posted
                                      out to another unit as a clerk. I have been doing well in my new
                                      unit and my performance is valued by my superiors.</p>
              <p>              
                                      However, the problem is that my temp PES E9L9 status had long
                                      expired in NOV 07. As I was also not called up for any PES status
                                      review, my superiors advised me not to go to any medical reviews as
                                      they do not want to risk losing manpower during this busy period
                                      and the unit is already short of hands. Thus, I forsee that a
                                      greater problem will arise when i ORD in NOV this year. I think I
                                      will be most probably upgraded back to PES A or B(usually for
                                      pneumonia cases from what i heard, is that true?)  when i go
                                      for my FFI before ORD. If that's the case, I will be most probably
                                      be posted to a combat unit for my ICTs. My concern is that I cannot
                                      assimilate with the new combat unit as I had only been through
                                      combat training for a mere 3 months of my NSF life. I am worried
                                      that I will be a liability due to the lack of combat skills and
                                      experience.</p>
              <p>              
                                      Please advise on what should I do, and is there such thing as
                                      remaining as a clerk vocation after being upgraded to PES A or B?
                                      Sorry for the lengthy post and hope you can enlighten me on the
                                      matter. Thank you very much.</p>
              <p>~Cheers and Regards~</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I'm currently a unit clerk (temp PES E), and have not gone for
              my PES review despite my PES status expiring last month. My boss
              still wants to keep me in the branch till I ORD.</p>
              <p>I found this post in an older topic, may I know if it's still
              relevant? Will there be any disciplinary consequences (not from
              unit) or ORD implications? If the post still it is, then my
              question has been answered, and there shouldn't be any issues.
              Could anyone help me clarify this?</p>

              <p>My friend was downgraded to a temp Pes, being posted as clerk. He was upgraded but he stayed in the unit. He completed his BMT later before he ORD as a clerk. During reservist, he was posted to be a rifleman and he had been in the unit ever since.</p>
              <p>The status will automatically upgrade, whether you like it or not. But it is best to make it perm if you are still unwell.</p>

              <p>Hi. I have a temporary PES status of C2L2, which started after I ORD'ed, and it's nearly 6 months(expiring) now.</p>
              <p>I'm still having the initial pains, so my knee is ruined by SAF probably for life. I'm not seeking a doctor here so unless anyone wants to know I shall not bore the rest.</p>
              <p>SAF hasn't contacted me about my ending temporary PES status so I wonder what I should do now, though I do have open date appointment with the specialist I went to.</p>
              <p>Perhaps I should call the specialist for an appointment?</p>

              <p>This is my problem actually. I had it since 2010 October, and I got my temp PES of C2L2 after ORD, 2011 August. I still have it now, so don't get too much hopes that it'll get better.</p>
              <p>It's very depressing really; if you don't run your heart gets weaker, and if you do the pain only gets worse.</p>
