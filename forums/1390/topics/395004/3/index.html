              Dear all,
              
              Just would like to enquire from you guys on something.  I am an NSMen and I had a recent callup from my unit again for an overseas ICT this coming Nov.  I have already been downgraded to Pes C9L2 last year due to my severe back problem with my slipped disc.  I understand that with this status, I'm still required to go back for ICT.  However, I'm not so sure about the purpose of being called up for overseas ICT.  I can understand the intention for local ICT and am ok with it but overseas ICT?  I have problems standing and sitting for too long as my back will hurt a lot.  
              
              Hence, I would like to seek your advise from you good guys to help enlighten me:
              
              1)Are there any grounds for my unit to recall me back for this overseas ICT? Could there be some slip ups in updating my medical status?
              2)Assuming that they did not screw up and indeed got my updated Pes status, can anyone help advise why would they want to recall me back for overseas ICT?  
              2) Is there anyway I can request for my unit to excuse me from this and subsequent overseas ICT?  Any make up for local ICT I'm ok with it.
              
              Fyi, I've been recalled back for the last 2 years to attend the overseas ICT but I had to defer due to my examinations. Not sure if this is the reason why they "die die" want to recall me now that my examinations has finished?  Just afraid of worsening my back as as of current, I already have a hard time standing or sitting in a position too long. Really do not want to aggravate it further.
              
              Pls kindly advise.  Thanks a lot in advance.

              Dear Dr eac,
              
              Thanks a lot for your reply.  Can I just seek your advice further whether are there any and on what grounds can I request to defer for this and subsequent overseas icts?  What should and can I do to highlight to my unit or medical centre of my concern?  Really cannot imagine how my back can take it for the overseas ICT.  
              
              Thanks very much in advance.
              
              cheers.

              <p>If there's a vehicle supporting your vocation, you can make some noise and there you will be sitting in the vehicle. e.g. jeep, land rover, land cruiser, humvee, tonner...etc.<br>Because the reason given will be that if let's say you are excuse heavy loads permanent, it's reasonable that all your belongings can just put in the vehicle and you just carry on with your vocation with your rifle and SBO, <em>which is already considered light fatigue gear.</em></p>
              <p>If you are asked to FBO on, just take out your <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">photocopied</span></em> Medical Board MC and show to the commander who asked you to FBO on. If he's not happy, ask him to see MO who is the Official Medical Authority, and question the commander with a Reservist's look that says, 'if I get injured again with the heavy loads, whose's responsible?'</p>

              Thanks so much for your advice, Dr eac.
              
              Pls correct me if I'm wrong but I heard that the list of PES C personnel will be forwarded to the camp MO for review on whether the serviceman is eligible to attend the overseas ict.  
              
              Can I ask if it's possible for me to request for a review discussion with the MO to go through my case prior to his decision on whether I am physically eligible to attend the overseas ict?  Just thought that I would like to discuss personally with him and further highlight my condition and concern to him for his assessment.  Conmsidering my back condition, may i have your views on what are my chances of the MO acknowledging and excusing me for the overseas ict?  Sorry for the further questions but hope you can help advice.  As always, thanks a lot for your help in advance. Very much appreciated.

              <p>Dear eac,</p>
              <p>I actually just posted the reply below on the BMT FAQs thread but after surfing the forum more I think this is a more appropriate place for the reply as it directly concerns issues arising from a PES status. Your help in this matter would be much appreciated.</p>

              <p>Hey guys,</p>
              <p>I am aware that much has already been said about what I am going to ask but please bear with me. What I would like to know is whether PES C9L9 personnel are automatically excused from field camp (L9: no field exercises) regardless of excuses one has or does not have. After reading some posts regarding this issue on this forum, it seems the answer to that is no. However I've also read posts on other forums which state that according to a medical directive C9L9 personnel are automatically excused from field camp as it is a form of field exercise. I hope that you guys can help clarify this issue. Thanks!</p>

              <p>There is something you have to be aware of is that the officer-in-charge may not be aware of your medical status, due to "medical in confidence" And it is stated in the handbook that it is your responsibility to inform them about your Pes status. Inform them in front of the platoon so that every1 heard that. And you are safe if anything goes wrong with you, you can claim insurances from the SAF then. And remind them occasionally in a tactful manner. </p>

              <p>Dear Lokey,</p>
              <p>Thank you for your advice! However, just to be absolutely sure, could you (or anyone else) give a simple "yes" or "no" to the next two questions :D Do C9L9 personnel require any specific excuse like "excuse outfield" to be exempt from field camp? Are C9L9 personnel, just by being L9, exempt from field camp? Thank you!</p>

              <p>Hi this is a repost as i just realised that i was on a wrong topic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hi Dr eac &amp; Forumers</p>
              <p><br> I have allergic rhinitis sensitive to dust mite 
              (+ve prick test)
                                      and mild atopic eczema (behind knee and groin 
              area).</p>
              <p>I also have a doctor memo from an ENT to 
              excuse me from dusty
                                      environment as my nose and ears are perpetually 
              blocked despite
                                      using nasal spray daily.</p>
              <p>However the MO (reservist) told me that my 
              condition could not
                                      be downgraded because rhinitis is very common 
              and my eczema is too
                                      mild.</p>
              <p>He prescribed me some cream. And that’s all.</p>
              <p>My concern is, I wouldn’t want to have ugly 
              scares before they
                                      decide to downgrade me.</p>
              <p>ENT doctor already advised me to avoid dusty 
              environment, but
                                      the MO feel that doesn’t warrant any status.</p>
              <p>How would you advice me going about that?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, I have been on topical Tretinion and 
              Differin for my acne
                                      problem. I tried oral anti-biotic previously but
               to no avail.</p>
              <p>I understand that while applying these 
              creams, one have to avoid
                                      sunlight as much as possible.</p>
              <p>Should I inform the MO, would he stop me from
               using it? Or would
                                      he downgrade me?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>After the checkup, he was given temp Pes D for 3 months pending an xray of his foot (he was diagnosed with a metastarsal fracture). But recently he went to see a doctor, who diagnosed him with sweaty palms and severe ezcema and referred him to the NSC.</p>
              <p>Since his pre-enlistee review is already over, how can he reflect his ezcema to MinDef again? </p>
              <p>Thanks! </p>
