              <p>Hi everyone! I'm new to sgforums.</p>
              <p>I have a few medical conditions: Dyslexia, ADHD, severe dust allergy, all backed up with medical reports.</p>
              <p>I also have a brother who recently ROD'd from NS with Pes E certification, Dyslexia, ADHD and a few other conditions I'm not too familar with.</p>
              <p>I'll like to know what Pes I'll be assigned to and how it'll be like for me, i.e. what I'll be assigned to do, any special arrangements, and etc.</p>
              <p>I'm currently doing my O-levels this year, and I just want to plan ahead.</p>
              <p>Please advise me on this. Thanks!</p>
