              <p>Medical screening is a series of medical tests done at the
              Medical Classification Centre (MCC) at <abbr title="Central Manpower Base">CMPB</abbr> (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/cmpb-map.png">location map</a>).</p>
              <p>The objective of these tests is to ascertain your medical
              condition and accord you a suitable Physical Employment Status
              (PES). Based on your PES, you will be assigned to a suitable
              vocation.</p>
              <p>Here are the various PES gradings:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>PES A</strong>: Fit for all combat vocations</li>
              <li><strong>PES B1</strong>: Fit for most combat vocations</li>
              <li><strong>PES B2</strong>: Fit for some combat vocations</li>
              <li><strong>PES BP</strong>: Fit for obese <abbr title="Basic Military Training">BMT</abbr> training</li>
              <li><strong>PES C</strong>: Fit for combat support vocations</li>
              <li><strong>PES D</strong>: Temporary unfit for grading and pending
              further review</li>
              <li><strong>PES E</strong>: Fit for administrative duties only</li>
              <li><strong>PES F</strong>: Medically unfit for any form of
              service</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Note that if you are given a <abbr title="Physical Employment Status">PES</abbr> D grading, it means that
              more time/tests are required to confirm your medical condition.
              This normally takes about 2-3 months. However, this duration may be
              longer depending on your medical condition.</p>

              Medical Screening</strong><br> <br> Prior to enlistment, all pre-enlistees have to undergo a thorough
              medical examination at the Medical Classification Centre (MCC)
              within the Central Manpower Base (CMPB). This examination allows
              the medical fitness of a pre-enlistee to be assessed and this
              subsequently determines his Physical Employment Status (PES).<br> <br> <strong style="font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit;">Medical
              Screening Appointment Preparations</strong><br> <br> As part of the e-documentation, you are also required to select
              your preferred medical appointment date as well as to complete the
              medical questionnaire (e7F). You will need to go through the
              medical questionnaire form with your parents / guardian so that
              useful medical information about you is captured.<br> <br> To ensure that your medical experience with us is pleasant and that
              the overall screening process is not unnecessarily delayed, we have

              <p>Ummm, hi &gt;w&lt;</p>
              <p>Well, I have been looking at this thread for a while (till it
              kinda closed few hours ago...), and I am very thankful and
              appreciative of all the information I have obtained and learnt
              here.</p>
              <p>However... I do have a rather simple question now, I wish
              someone could reply. &gt;w&lt; It's... like...</p>
              <p>I got my PES Status on the 26th, it is PESC9L3. So... the thing
              I wanted to ask is, will it... will my PES Status suddenly like,
              change? You know, become B or something outta sudden... </p>
              <p>Simplistically, will there be... like, another checkup? The
              doctor there did not indicate if this was a TEMP or PERM status (he
              left the columns unchecked), so I don't know. </p>
              <p>Any and all help much appreciated, once again!</p>
              <p>Thanks~ &gt;w&lt;</p>

              <p>It is likely to be permanent, since the doctor did not ask you to go for another check-up. </p>
              <p>Even if is to change, it is unlikely to jump from C9L3 to B, unless you are having some sort of temporary injury now.</p>
