              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I just went for my checkup at cmpb. I was given PES D for 3 months due to some shoulder and migraine issues still being investigated by the specialists. On my form, "CMO RM6 with MEMO" is written. Does anyone know what this means?</p>
              <p>Also, "lipids" was also written on the form and I was told to return to the blood-taking station. There, the person looked at the form and asked me whether anyone in my family had heart disease. I told him my mum has it. Then he peeled off one of the name stickers and pasted it on a sheet of paper and told me to return to the medical room. Does anyone know what this is all about? Thanks in advance.</p>

              <p>All enlistees who are joining NS this year, if you have any medical problems (genuine), please seek a specialist &amp; get a medical report from them ($150 &amp; above, Its worth it) then on the day of the medical checkup, throw the report to the MO.</p>
              <p>Its better to downgrade before enlisting rather than after enlisting. I downgrade 6 years after I ORD. Wasted......</p>

              <p>hi all, i have just been enlisted one month ago and was
              diagnosed with adaption disorder by SGH phych.<br> he had written a letter to my camp MO to refer me to MMI's
              phych.<br> do you guys think i should wait for MMI or make a trip down to IMH
              myself?(because i dun want this problem to drag on as it is
              affecting my daily life now.eg hearing voices of SGT forcing me to
              book in and stuff.)</p>

              <p>Its a form of psychosis....I suggest you go visit IMH by yourself asap. If your mental problem is genuine, the IMH doc will write a memo for you to down PES....deps on the severity of your illness, possibly downgraded to PES C2 or in extreme cases PES F.</p>

              <p>Hi there. As mentioned earlier, have Obssessive Compulsive Disorder. I went for my regular appointment in IMH, and I requested a letter from my doctor to write to army. I am supposed to book my medical screening appt next wednesday.</p>
              <p>My doctor wrote a memo to army mo stating that I have OCD, and also stated the medicines I am taking now. That is all that is on the memo. Is this sufficient to show to MINDEF? Or do I need to get medical report? My doctor says this memo will tell MINDEF I have this condition, and then MINDEF will write in to IMH to ask for medical report. Then, they will look and decide what to do. Is this true? Is the memo he gave me enough to support?</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>
