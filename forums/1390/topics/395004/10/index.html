              <p><br>Normally if you got gastric ulcers see if got chance of relapse or not, Then they re-instate your PES status to A or B. But best you consult a doctor because we don't know your chances of relapsing.</p>

              <p>most likely you will be back to pes B again. Ulcer like fever can be cured. It is just that ulcer take longer. just take that you are on a long MC. But may dragged to more than 1 year. The specialist might wait for a while before you are scoped again.</p>

              <p><br>1) On the day of the PES review, once your ulcers are cleared up as certified with a specialist memo, you will once again go back to your original PES.</p>
              <p>2) "What is the percentage? What are the chances?" is the same as the probability of striking 4D/Toto, so you go calculate yourself on this mathematical problem.</p>
              <p>3) Must be certified and supported by a hospital specialist memo.</p>
              <p>4) Get a hospital specialist memo.</p>
              <p>So, the morale of the story is, please go get a specialist memo during the appointment of a hospital specialist outpatient clinic.</p>

              <p>Were you from command school?</p>
              <p>If not, then you really shouldn't bother, since it is extremely unlikely for you to be able to sign on as an officer or spec. It is possible to sign on as a ME though.</p>
              <p>About up pes-ing, why were you down-pesed in the 1st place? If it is because of certain injury, you can get specialists to write memo to show that you have fully recovered, then call up CMPB and see if they will entertain you. </p>

              <p>Well, eyesight is no longer than important a thing given that there are so many people wearing specs. </p>
              <p>There are even those with 350~450 who entered commando, so it shouldn't be surprising that you get PES A. I have never heard of anyone with 600+ who entered commando/NDU, so you need not worry about that though, if you are aiming NOT to enter these units.</p>
              <p>However, 1000+ is a guaranteed PES B2 and below, to the best of my knowledge. </p>

              <p>Hi folks,</p>
              <p>I went to CMPB and declared that I had 2 cases of Spontaneous Pneumothorax (Lung collapsed) + supporting medical documents of x-rays and memos. </p>

The new 9-week PES B2 BMT programme will be conducted for recruits who are medically fit for deployment in selected combat and combat support vocations, such as signal operators, combat medics and naval system operators. These recruits will be given a new medical classification of PES B2, in place of the existing PES C1 classification. This is to ensure that the medical classification of our soldiers is consistent with their deployment. The new 9-week programme will include customised physical training, as well as basic combat training to prepare them for their combat and combat support roles. (Effective from June 2010 onwards)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Anyway, vocations is they choose for you, not you choose yourself. Posting order is an order. So just do your BMT 1st.<br></em>

              <br></span></strong> Enlistees who were PES C1 previously
              underwent a 7-week BMT programme. The new 9-week PES B2 BMT
              programme will be conducted for recruits who are medically fit for
              deployment in selected combat and combat support vocations, such as
              signal operators, combat medics and naval system operators. These
              recruits will be given a new medical classification of PES B2, in
              place of the existing PES C1 classification. This is to ensure that
              the medical classification of our soldiers is consistent with their
              deployment. The new 9-week programme will include customised
              physical training, as well as basic combat training to prepare them
              for their combat and combat support roles. (Effective
              from June 2010 onwards)</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I greatly appreciate this giant faq about pes statuses. But I am in quite a situation right now.</p>
              <p>I enlisted into BMT in early november 2010, and after the first two weeks I developed a progressively painful sensation in my left shoulder. It started out to be only when I lifted heavy weights or tried to put my arm above paralell to the ground. But now it has progressed into feeling pain with just about doing nothing ie. lying down, standing, sitting. What's worse is that the MO gave me excuse UL/HL and I was still made to carry full jerry cans, stand for the duration of the entire PT session, carry my field pack which made the pain increase. I can't even hold my rifle properly because my left arm can't take the weight.</p>
              <p>I reported to MO three times, 1st time he gave me panadol, 2nd he gave me physio, 3rd was to deliver my specialists letter. My specialist said that the bones in my shoulder blade are misaligned. I had no idea about this, as I've never experienced any pain or this sensation before in my life. I enlisted as PES A status, and now I can't even wear my black sling bag on my left shoulder without immense pain.</p>
              <p>I talked it over with my parents/friends/relatives and have come to a conclusion that screwing up a body part, which will most definitly be permanent if I continued BMT is not worth a life full of pain.</p>
              <p>I just completed my MRI a few days ago to make sure it's nothing worse then a bone misalignment, if it is then I'm SOL =\. The specialist said it will takes months of physio to reduce the pain significantly, and that it would be absurd to return to the safe physical level of activity. Over my short stay in BMT I also developed these rashes on my back whenever I slept, I suspect it's may be caused by a dust allergy. I'm planning on going to an allergist soon to get this tested. If it comes back positive, what will happen to me?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Summary:<br>Shoulder blade misalignment causes me great pain: Heavy weights, running, prolonged standing (5-10minutes), wearing iLBV, field pack, black sling bag), sleeping (woke up many times because of rolling onto my shoulder, or being on my back for too long).</p>
              <p>May have a dust allergy that I didn't know I had.</p>
              <p>If I had known about any of these conditions I would have presented them to CMPB during my medical check. I'd also like to know, since I've finished my college degree, what PES/Vocation is most likely for me to be assigned to?</p>

              <p><br>Supported with specialist memos and your MRI report, it should be within PES C range, with permanent excuse UL / HL / heavy loads / carry heavy objects.</p>
              <p>If so, you should be revocate to a PES C (combat service support) vocation such as service medic, logistic, admin clerk. Vocation assignment has nothing to do with your degree specialisation.</p>

              <p>Thank you for your response. I will need to retake/recourse BMT as whatever PES I can reassigned to right? But as pes C don't you have to pass your shooting/outfield to pass BMT? I can't even wear my iLBV or carry my rifle in any firing position without causing immense pain on my left shoulder. Will they even allow to to recover before posting me out to another BMT course?</p>
              <p>I had to miss my techincal handling test and IMT because I couldn't hold a rifle anymore.</p>

              <p>When I told the MO the first time that it hurt when I run, he told me not to swing my arms. When the specialist letter said it hurt when i run, he gave me 2 weeks RMJ. On a scale of 1-10, doing nothing (ie. lying down etc, it's a 6) but once they start making me move my arms around (marching, running, lifting) it goes up to 8-9 depending on the activity.<br><br>When I gave the MO the first letter and told him that I have an MRI appt and a follow up consultation he said to come back after that. So hopefully when I go back tuesday I'll be able to see the MO and give him my specialists diagnosis and recommended actions. The first letter my specialist had written already recommended to downgrade me. But when I told him I had an MRI and another appt coming up he hesistated and just said to come back after those were done.</p>
              <p>As of now, I know my body that if I were to stay in camp and make me do stupid work like they have in the past week, it WILL get worse. It already has. I just hope the MO has some decent sence, otherwise, kena screwed =\</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But depending on the length of time it takes to review my medical status, most likely my company will just ask me to do stupid work around company line right? Admin work, etc? Or will they actually allow me to recover properly? I'm assuming the former.</p>
              <p>And after the medical review, depending on my PES status I go for recourse or new BMT? Is there a difference between recourse and BMT?</p>

              8-9 depending on the activity.<br> <br> When I gave the MO the first letter and told him that I have an MRI
              appt and a follow up consultation he said to come back after that.
              So hopefully when I go back tuesday I'll be able to see the MO and
              give him my specialists diagnosis and recommended actions. The
              first letter my specialist had written already recommended to
              downgrade me. But when I told him I had an MRI and another appt
              coming up he hesistated and just said to come back after those were
              done.</p>
              <p>As of now, I know my body that if I were to stay in camp and
              make me do stupid work like they have in the past week, it WILL get
              worse. It already has. I just hope the MO has some decent sence,
              otherwise, kena screwed =\</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But depending on the length of time it takes to review my
              medical status, most likely my company will just ask me to do
              stupid work around company line right? Admin work, etc? Or will
              they actually allow me to recover properly? I'm assuming the
              former.</p>
              <p>And after the medical review, depending on my PES status I go
              for recourse or new BMT? Is there a difference between recourse and
              BMT?</p>

              <p>You can safely bet that they will ask you to do saikang. The only thing is what type of saikang only. Even if you say that your arm hurts when you swing it, if your MO does not write anything, you will still be expected to swing your arm.</p>
              <p>You can't entirely blame the MO, since there are plentiful of kengsters who keng left keng right. I am hoping the best for you though.</p>
              <p>As for re-BMT, it depends on a few factors. Since you just went in not long ago, I assume that you have not gone through field camp and range. Thus, if you get down-pesed, you will have to go for re-BMT of your new pes. </p>
              <p>Usually (but not always), re-bmt will be more slack. Many of those who go for re-bmt are going to ORD soon, so the commanders will not tekan them too much (Unless you have a sadist or garang commander).</p>

              <p>So what will the order of things be like? Will I first be asked to stay in camp and help out with stuff, then wait for revocation? Or wait for pes review first, then wait for revocation? Or do I wait for the new pes BMT?</p>

              <p>You will have to bear with the sai-kang for now till your appointment next Tuesday.</p>
              <p>After that you can try to ask the spec to help you out by writing you a MC. You must tell him/her your situation, otherwise he/she may not want to write you a MC. This is because there is actually no need for a MC by right, but since your commanders have already gone by left by forcing you to carry heavy load and such, you have not much choices left.</p>
              <p>After that submit any documents and memo from the spec to your MO. He will help you to bring it up to medical board for review, and allow them to decide your new PES.</p>
              <p>After getting your Pes, then will you be revocated. Currently you are not on Att B/C, so you are counted as a healthy soldier who is excused from certain stuffs. If your PES does not change, you will likely continue through BMT.</p>
              <p>As for the re-BMT, usually it will come at the end of your NS, just before you ORD. Note that there do are people who are slotted right into the re-BMT for another Pes soon after they are down-pesed. But that is because the timing is just nice, with the BMT of the other Pes starting during that period. </p>

              <p>I actually have MC right now till tuesday. I had a fever of 39C today when I went to get looked at by the doctor. So I get to rest for the next few days. Being sick like this makes everything hurt more.</p>
              <p>So the time between getting recommended for a pes downgrade and actually getting a pes downgrade varies right? 1month-3months? Between that time what will i be doing, sai-kang?</p>
