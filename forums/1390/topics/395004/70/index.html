              <p><strong>The
                   new NS IPPT Management system will be in effect from 1 Sep 2014. </strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong>Enhancements to the NS IPPT policies seek to ease administrative 
                  constraints to better support NSmen in managing their fitness and other 
                  commitments. The key changes are as follows:</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">a.   Extension of IPPT/IPT/RT windows to 12 months.<br> b.   Increase in monetary incentives for good IPPT performance.</p>
              <p>Concurrently, the SAF will improve IPT and RT fitness training in the Fitness Conditioning Centres (FCCs). From <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1 Sep 14</span>, all Fitness Conditioning Centres (FCCs) will be providing a greater variety of training and specialised fitness classes.<br> <br> As part of SAF's continuous efforts to review the fitness training 
                  system, a new IPPT format that is simpler to administer and simpler for 
                  servicemen to train for will be introduced. A pilot implementation 
                  involving selected Army NS and Active units (i.e. at least 3,000 active 
                  and NS participants from various age groups, vocations and gender) will 
                  be conducted from Sep to Nov 2014.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>THE ENHANCED NS IPPT SYSTEM</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>(With Effect From 1 September 2014)</strong></span><br> <br> <strong>Enhancements with effect from 1 September 2014:</strong><br> <br> 1.    Pictorial diagrams of the current and new NS IPPT management system are as follows:</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://lifestyle.www.ns.sg/image/image_gallery?uuid=17d97be3-67a9-4935-b8a7-0357c5816f6e&amp;groupId=10401&amp;t=1406197426269" alt="" width="400" height="257"></p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">a.    The IPPT window has been extended from 9 months to <strong>12</strong> months. In this window, NSmen must attempt and pass their IPPT test. 
                  Alternatively, they can volunteer for a 10-session IPT programme. They 
                  will exit the IPT programme if they (1) complete 10 sessions of IPT; or 
                  (2) meet their Personal Performance Targets. <br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example 1</span>:<br> <br> My birthday is on 1 January.<br>  <br> Old system: my IPPT window is 9-months long: 1 January 2015 to 30 September 2015.<br>  <br> New IPPT system: my IPPT window is 12-months long: 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2015.<br>  <br> b.    The RT window has been extended from 3 months to <strong>12</strong> months. In this window, NSmen must complete their 20-session RT 
                  programme. They will exit the RT programme if they (1) complete 20 
                  sessions of RT; or (2) pass IPPT during the stipulated RT-IPPT sessions.<br>  <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example 2</span>:<br>  <br> My birthday is on 1 January.<br>  <br> Old system: my RT window is 3-months long: 1 October 2015 to 31 December 2015.<br>  <br> New IPPT system: my new RT window is 12-months long : 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016.</p>
              <p>2.  
                    The quantum for the IPPT monetary incentives has been enhanced. The 
                  revised quantum is applicable to NSmen with birthday windows starting 
                  from 1 Sep 2014. For example, if your birthday window starts on 1 Sep 
                  2014, you will be eligible for $500 if you attain Gold award. However, 
                  if your birthday window starts on 31 Aug, you will still be subjected to
                   the old system, and you will receive $400 if you attain Gold, even if 
                  you take the IPPT after 1 Sep.</p>

              <p style="text-align: left;">3.    NSmen who do not perform IPPT and/or RT will continue to be disciplinarily dealt with.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Transition to new IPPT system</strong></span><br> <br> 4.    As at 1 September 2014, NSmen who are still in their IPPT window 
                  will enjoy an automatic extension of their IPPT window by 3 months. 
                  Those within their 3-month RT window will have an extended RT window 
                  (i.e. remaining RT window + next 12-month window).</p>

                  until 30 Jul 2015 instead of 30 April 2015. I will need to complete 
                  either my 10-session IPT program or perform at least 1 IPPT test.<br> <br> b.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example 4</span>: <br> My birthday is on 1 January and I failed my IPPT. On 1 September 2014, I am in my RT window.<br> <br> After extension, my new RT window will be from 1 September 2014 to 31 
                  December 2015 (i.e. remaining RT window + 12-months) instead of 31 
                  December 2014. I will need to complete 20 sessions of RT in this new 
                  window or pass an IPPT during a stipulated RT-IPPT session.</p>
              <p>5.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">One-time Reset of Default Offences</span>. 
                   NSmen with existing offences and charges are allowed a one-time 
                  opportunity to reset all offences by completing their IPPT requirements 
                  during this transition.</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">a.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example 5</span>:<br> My birthday is on 1 January and I failed my IPPT. I have defaulted my 
                  RT for my past 2 windows and have been charged. After extension, my new 
                  RT window will be from 1 Sep 2014 to 31 Dec 2015. If I complete my 20 
                  sessions of RT in this RT window, my 2 existing default counts in the 
                  system will be reset to zero. If I default my RT again, I will be 
                  disciplinarily dealt with.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">6.    Please refer to the advisory via the IPPT Booking System at NS Portal from 1 Sep 2014 onwards for your IPPT status.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NEW IPPT FORMAT AND SCORING SYSTEM</strong></span><br> <br> <strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br> <br> 1.    Fitness is an important element of soldiering. The SAF constantly
                   reviews our training system, including physical training regimes and 
                  physical fitness tests, to ensure that they are relevant and effective. 
                  Starting from 1 Sep 2014, the SAF will launch a pilot implementation of a
                   new and simpler Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) format, 
                  which will be accompanied by a new scoring system. The new IPPT format 
                  is expected to be fully implemented across the SAF in 2015.<br> <br> <strong>KEY FEATURES OF THE NEW IPPT FORMAT AND SCORING SYSTEM</strong><br> <br> 2.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A simpler three-station IPPT format to encourage personal ownership of fitness</span>. 
                   The new three-station test format will comprise a push-up test, a 
                  sit-up test, and a 2.4km run. These stations will measure the strength 
                  and cardiovascular fitness of our servicemen. This new and simpler 
                  format was designed to allow servicemen to train and maintain their 
                  fitness, without the need for specialised technique or equipment. 
                  Fitness is a personal responsibility. This simpler test format will 
                  further motivate our servicemen to take greater ownership of their 
                  fitness, and incorporate these exercises into their daily routine to 
                  maintain their fitness.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><span><img src="http://lifestyle.www.ns.sg/image/image_gallery?uuid=a497af9a-5830-4fa8-b146-3606a64e36c0&amp;groupId=10401&amp;t=1406250852346" alt="" width="400" height="125"></span><br> <span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Table 1.  New IPPT Format.</span></span></p>
              <p>3.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">New scoring system to motivate personal excellence</span>.
                   The SAF will also introduce a new scoring system to accompany the new 
                  IPPT format. Servicemen will be allocated points for their performance 
                  in each of the three stations. The maximum number of points servicemen 
                  may earn for each station are 50 points for the 2.4km run station, and 
                  25 points each for the Push Up and Sit Up stations. The maximum number 
                  of points a serviceman can achieve in the IPPT is 100. The points will 
                  be added together to form a final score, which will determine the 
                  serviceman's individual fitness standard. Similar to the current IPPT, 
                  servicemen will need to score the requisite number of points to Pass, 
                  Pass with monetary incentive, and to achieve the Silver and Gold IPPT 
                  awards. Active servicemen will continue to be held to a higher passing 
                  standard because fitness training is incorporated into their work and 
                  training routine. To ensure the high standards of our elite combat 
                  troops - Commando, Diver, and Guards will be held to a higher Gold IPPT 
                  standard.<br> <br> 4.    This new scoring system will encourage 
                  servicemen to do their best for each of the stations. The better they 
                  perform in the stations, the more points they will be awarded. The 
                  flexibility of the new scoring system will motivate servicemen to 
                  exercise greater ownership on how they will train for their IPPT, 
                  allowing them to tap on their individual strengths to do well.</p>

New IPPT Standards</span>.</span></p>
              <p>5.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shorter age categories for a better performance-to-age match</span>. 
                   As part of this physical fitness review, we will also shorten our age 
                  categories, from 5-year bands to 3-year bands. This shorter age 
                  categories allow us to better differentiate the different age groups of 
                  our servicemen, and is a better performance-to-age match. Instead of 
                  having to perform to the same standards in a five year age block, 
                  servicemen will perform to a new standard every three years. This 
                  shorter age category will be more sensitive to the effects of age on the
                   physical fitness of our servicemen.<br> <br> <strong>EXAMPLE</strong><br> <br> 6.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Age Group 3 Pass example</span>. 
                   For a 25 to 27 year old NSmen to achieve Pass he would be required to 
                  perform 16 Push Ups in 1 min (6 pts), 30 Sit Ups in 1 min (14 pts) and 
                  complete his 2.4km run in 12min 40s (31 pts). With this performance, he 
                  would accumulate a total score of 51 points, which would make him 
                  eligible for the Pass Award.<br> <br> 7.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Age Group 6 Gold Award example</span>.
                   For a 34 to 36 year old serviceman aiming to achieve Gold award, he 
                  would be required to perform 35 Push Ups in 1 min (20 pts), 35 Sit Ups 
                  in 1 min (20 pts) and complete his 2.4km run in 10min 40s (41 pts). With
                   this performance, he would accumulate a total score of 81 points, which
                   would make him eligible for the Gold Award.<br> <br> <strong>IMPLEMENTATION</strong><br> <br> 8.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pilot implementation</span>.
                   Army will conduct a pilot implementation from Sep to Nov 14 to

                  units will participate in this phase. At least 3,000 servicemen and 
                  servicewomen of different vocations and age groups will be represented 
                  in the pilot implementation.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Frequently Answered Questions</span><br> <br> <strong>What is the current NS IPPT Management System?</strong><br> <br> The current NS IPPT management system was implemented on 1 April 2011. 
                  Under this system, NSmen are required to pass their IPPT within the 
                  first 9 months of their birthday window. Those who fail or default on 
                  their IPPT have to attend 20 sessions of Remedial Training (RT) in the 
                  last 3 months of their birthday window. NSmen can also volunteer for 
                  IPPT Preparatory Training (IPT) in the first 9 months of their birthday 
                  window, and will fulfil their IPPT requirement for the year if they meet
                   their Personal Performance Targets (PPTs)<sup>1</sup>. Those who fail to meet their PPTs have to attend 8 sessions of RT in the last 3 months of their birthday window.<br> <br> <sup>1</sup><span style="font-size: 10px;">PPTs
                   are intermediate standards raised progressively at an annual rate 
                  towards an IPPT Pass. The PPT standard is derived from the results of 
                  the IPPT conducted during the first session of IPT.</span><br> <br> <strong>What are the key changes under the enhanced NS IPPT Management System?</strong><br> <br> With effect from 1 Sep 2014, NSmen will be given 12 months to attempt 
                  and pass their IPPT. Alternatively, NSmen that require help can 
                  volunteer for a 10-session IPPT Preparatory Training (IPT). NSmen who 
                  pass their IPPT or complete IPT will proceed to either IPPT or IPT in 
                  their next 12-month birthday window. NSmen who fail or default IPPT or 
                  IPT will be subject to Remedial Training (RT). They will be required to 
                  complete their RT programme within their subsequent 12-month birthday 
                  windows. NSmen who volunteer for IPT will be considered to have met 
                  their IPPT requirement for the year if they (1) meet their Personal 
                  Performance Targets (PPT) at any point in the programme; or (2) complete
                   10 sessions of IPT within their birthday window. NSmen on IPT are 
                  advised to attend training at least once a week continuously for 10 
                  sessions to obtain the benefits of the training regime.<br> <br> <strong>What are the specific changes to the IPPT Management System? </strong></p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">a.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extension of IPPT/IPT to 12 months</span>.  
                   The IPPT/IPT window will be extended from the current 9 months to 12 
                  months, to give NSmen more time to attempt and pass IPPT or complete 
                  IPT.<br> <br> b.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extension of RT window to 12 months</span>.   
                  Instead of the last 3 months in their present window, NSmen who default 
                  or fail the IPPT will be given 12 months in their next birthday window 
                  to complete 20 sessions of RT. This extension is to enable NSmen to 
                  better manage their other commitments so that they can meet the RT 
                  requirements. NSmen are advised to attend RT at least once a week 
                  continuously for the duration of his RT in order to obtain the benefits 
                  of the training regime.</p>
              <p><strong>What are the changes to IPPT Preparatory Training?</strong><br> <br> The IPT programme will continue to be available to NSmen who need help 
                  with IPPT training. Participants will be able to exit the programme upon
                   meeting their PPTs. To better recognise the efforts put in by NSmen to 
                  train for IPPT, with effect from 1 Sep 14, service pay for IPT programme
                   will be accorded to NSmen whose birthday windows start from 1 Sep 14. 
                  NSmen who complete the requisite 10 sessions of IPT within the IPPT 
                  window but fail to meet PPTs will no longer be subject to 8 sessions of 
                  RT. To motivate NSmen to participate in as many IPT sessions as they 
                  can, NSmen who default on IPT will be subjected to 20 – D sessions of RT
                   in the next window, where D is equal to the number of IPT sessions that
                   the NSman participated in, in the preceding 12-month birthday window.<br> <br> <strong>Is there a change in determining whether NSmen have met their IPT/RT requirement?</strong><br><br> NSmen who have failed or defaulted IPPT are liable for RT. NSmen who 
                  have defaulted IPPT will be liable for 20 sessions of RT during their 
                  12-month RT window (new system with effect from 1 Sep 14). To 
                  differentiate between IPPT failures and defaulters, under the new 
                  system, failures will be liable to 20-D sessions (as opposed to 20 
                  sessions), where D is equivalent to the number of IPPT/IPT attempts made
                   in the preceding window.<br><br> NSmen who volunteer for IPT will be 
                  considered to have met their annual IPT requirements if they (1) pass 
                  IPPT; (2) meet their Personal Performance Targets anytime during their 
                  IPT programme; or (3) complete 10 sessions of IPT during their 12-month 
                  IPPT/IPT window (with effect from 1 Sep). They will no longer be liable 
                  for 8-sessions of RT if they do not meet their Personal Performance 
                  Targets by the 10th session. This is to recognise that servicemen have 
                  put in their best efforts to train and meet their fitness targets in 
                  volunteering for and completing the 10-session programme.<br><br> <strong>Under
                   the enhanced NS IPPT management system are NSmen in RT allowed to 
                  participate in non-ICT IPPT that are not the stipulated RT-IPPT tests?</strong><br><br> In the new system, NSmen in the RT programme will only be allowed to 
                  participate in ICT-IPPT or RT-IPPT on the stipulated 8th, 14th and 20th 
                  RT sessions. NSmen are given sufficient time to attempt and pass their 
                  IPPT during the 12-month IPPT window. NSmen that are in the RT programme
                   are deemed to be servicemen that require help to train for and pass 
                  IPPT. As such, it is mandatory for NSmen in the RT programme to 
                  participate in at least 7 training sessions before they are allowed to 
                  attempt the IPPT. <br> <em><br>Monetary Incentive</em><br> <br> <strong>What are the changes in monetary incentive for IPPT performance?</strong><br> <br> To motivate personnel to do their best and maintain a high level of 
                  physical fitness, the quantum of the awards will be increased by $100. 
                  The new quantum will apply to NSmen with birthday windows starting from 1
                   Sep 2014; NSFs whose IPPT windows start from 1 Sep 2014; and Regulars 
                  for tests taken from 1 Apr 2015.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><span><img src="http://lifestyle.www.ns.sg/image/image_gallery?uuid=5868379d-8d8c-42f7-848a-1c949ab0de1b&amp;groupId=10401&amp;t=1406253962540" alt="" width="400" height="154"></span><br> <span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quantum for IPPT monetary incentives</span></span></p>
              <p><em>Disciplinary Framework</em><br> <br> <strong>Under the enhanced NS IPPT management system, what happens when NSmen fail or default their IPPT?</strong><br> <br> Currently, both IPPT defaulters and failures are subject to 20 sessions
                   of RT within the 3-month RT window. In the enhanced system, there will 
                  be greater differentiation between IPPT Failures and Defaulters. IPPT 
                  failures will be subjected to fewer sessions of RT in the 12-month RT 
                  window. NSmen who fail will be subjected to 20 – D sessions of RT, where
                   D is equal to the number of IPPT attempted in the previous 12-month 
                  birthday window. For defaulters, they will have to complete 20 sessions.
                   Within the RT window, servicemen will only be allowed to exit RT if 
                  they attain the Pass standard at the stipulated test sessions (i.e. 8th,
                   14th and 20th sessions).<br> <br> <strong>What is SAF doing to deter recalcitrant defaulters?</strong><br> <br> IPPT is an annual requirement for all IPPT-eligible NSmen. NSmen who 
                  default their IPPT will be subjected to disciplinary action. A new 
                  disciplinary framework will be implemented from 1 Jan 15. Currently, 
                  NSmen with three such offences or more will be subject to either a Fine 
                  or be sent to Detention Barracks. Under the new framework, NSmen with 
                  three such offences will be subjected to Fine and a five-day residential
                   In-Camp-Training (Physical Training) [ICT(PT)]. The ICT(PT) is a more 
                  constructive way to help NSmen to train for their fitness. The ICT(PT) 
                  focuses on teaching servicemen on the different types of fitness 
                  modalities and fitness habits.</p>
              <p><em>New IPPT format</em><br> <strong><br> What is the impetus for the new IPPT format?</strong><br> <br> Physical fitness of our servicemen is tested using the IPPT protocol. 
                  Prior to 2009, combat fitness was assessed using our Standard Obstacle 
                  Course and route marches. Since then, the Army has strengthened combat 
                  fitness training with the introduction of Vocation-Related Exercises and
                   Vocation Obstacle Courses to meet our new operational demands. With 
                  this in place, it is now timely to review our physical fitness test 
                  protocol and standards.<br> <br> <strong>Will the Home Team be implementing the new IPPT format? </strong><br> <br> Yes, the Home Team will be adopting the same IPPT format as the SAF. 
                  The Home Team has assessed that the new IPPT format would meet their 
                  needs for assessing the physical fitness of Home Team NSmen/NSFs. <br> <br> <strong>When will the trial for the new IPPT format be held?</strong><br> <br> The trial will be conducted by the Army Fitness Centre from Sep - Nov 
                  2014. It will involve at least 3,000 Active and NS personnel across 
                  different gender, age groups and vocations. NSmen from selected units 
                  will participate in the trial during their ICT.<br> <br> <strong>Will SAF make any more changes to the new IPPT format and scoring system?</strong><br> <br> SAF does not plan to make any more changes to the new IPPT format and 
                  scoring system. SAF continuously reviews our fitness training system to 
                  ensure that we maintain our high standards.<br> <br> <strong>Is it easier to pass the IPPT now?</strong><br> <br> Passing and excelling in IPPT will still require dedicated training and
                   effort by servicemen. However with the simpler and more motivating 
                  format and scoring system, servicemen will be more motivated to train. <br> <br> <strong>Why is there a need for a new scoring system?</strong><br> <br> The intention of the new scoring system is to motivate our servicemen 
                  to excel in all the test stations. We want to encourage everyone to 
                  train to their maximum potential.<br> <br> <strong>Why did SAF/HT move towards a 3-year age band?</strong><br> <br> We recognise that a 3-year age band will provide a better performance-to-age match compared to the current 5-year age band.<br> <br> <strong>How well will this new IPPT structure reflect fitness levels of our soldiers/HT NSmen/NSFs?</strong><br> <br> The 3 stations provide a good measurement of basic physical fitness as 
                  it focuses on the three main body parts. When viewed in totality with 
                  SAF's other combat fitness regimes such as loaded route marches, VRE and
                   SOC/VOC, it is reflective of the fitness levels of our soldiers.<br> <br> For the Home Team, the new IPPT structure is a good assessment of the 
                  basic physical fitness of Home Team NSmen/NSFs. In addition, Home Team 
                  NSmen/NSFs have to undergo certification and proficiency tests such as 
                  the Police Defence Tactics and Hazmat Rescue Certification Test to 
                  ensure that they meet the physical demands of frontline operations.</p>

              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>Family medical history of cholesterol since father have had a heart attack at 40 and a heart bypass was done. Uncle recently passed away due to cardiac arrest. Then my NS medical checkup at CMPB revealed that I have to take extra care to watch my health for having high levels of LDL (bad cholesterol) and total cholesterol.</p>
              <p>So my PES can be anywhere from PES A to E, right?</p>

                  the changes to your lifestyle, diet and
                  exercise?</em><br></span></strong><br> Firstly, you are strongly advised to eat oats (instant/ quick-cook)
                  as heavy breakfast, and greatly reduce eating fried foods and junk
                  foods. Eat at home and home cook food with canola oil. <br> <br> Secondly, please start cardio exercising.<br> Start from light to gradual to moderate.<br> e.g. brisk walking, then fast walking, then slow jogging, then
                  jogging.<br> <br> Thirdly, if you drink alcohol/ smoke tobacco, please quit.<br> <br> It's best that by changing your lifestyle, your BP will gradually
                  stablise and be within normal range. Doctors advise that to manage
                  BP effectively, it's optimal to change your lifestyle, next is to
                  reduce drug dosage, and finally be completely off medicine.</p>
              <p>That's why I strongly urge you to eat oats (instant/
                  quick-cook).<br> 3 big scoops (Chinese soup spoon) into a bowl.<br> Just add boiling water to 70% full.<br> Cover the bowl with a plate and wait 10 to 15 minutes.<br> Add water to 100% full, and consume at lukewarm.<br> Fast and easy-to-make breakfast.<br> <br> Never ever skip breakfast.<br> Start off the day by having a heavy breakfast.<br> Have lunch at 70% full.<br> Have dinner at 30% full. If still hungry, eat oats.<br> If possible, drink <span><em>Pu</em>'<em>er/ oolong</em> tea
                  (<em>without sugar</em>) daily</span>.<br> <br> Why I recommend you this?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi. I need help as well. I am currently PES BP but that was when I was just mild obese (BMI 26.6). Now I'm not in the obese range anymore (BMI 25.8) and I'm planning to lose more weight. Is it possible to upgrade pes, maybe to PES B1? If so, how should I go about doing so? I don't have my enlistment date yet as well. So if I'm planning to lose more weight, how long prior to my intake should I go about upgrading? I want to concentrate on my A Levels this year and I'm very much affected by my pes status. I don't want to go in early :(</p></div>

              <p>A RSN Navy man was told by a doctor that he may have prolapsed intervertebral disc/ spinal disc herniation ("slipped discs") in his lower back (lumbar). The doctor said that this will require a X-ray/ CT/ MRI scan for confirmation. Now he is worried that he may suffer this medical condition for a lifetime that he might get a downgrade and maybe no longer sea deployable (Navy PES Sea-Deployable Code: N1).</p>
              <p>So how would <span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">prolapsed intervertebral disc/ spinal disc herniation ("slipped discs") affect his N1 status</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">?</span></p>

              <p>Hey guys</p>
              <p>I'm going to be in 3rd year poly soon. I'm going to have an ACL Reconstruction Surgery around May/June. Let's say if I fully recover from this ACL Tear and during medical review I admit and with a specialist memo saying that I've fully recovered. Will I be able to have a PES of A/B1? Anyone who has an ACL Tear during/before army can enlighten me on this?</p>
