              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hi, I'm serving in PNS (SPF).</p>
              <p>Recently, I was diagnosed with Bilateral Chondromalacia Patella
              (CMP) and sent to physio after being referred to Orthopaedics by my
              camp MO. I gave him the ortho's memo/letter and was given 1 mth
              LD(light duty) and med board.</p>
              <p>Problem is, my condition deteriorated since the xray by ortho
              more than 1 month ago, as in the following:</p>
              <p>-Sharp snap sound in left knee followed by acute pain inside the
              knee cap. Occurred twice.</p>
              <p>-Wobbling in both knees when descending stairs, sharp and acute
              pain when ascending.</p>
              <p>-Just last week, both knees had sudden, extremely sharp pain, I
              could feel the rubbing of the bones against each other and the pain
              became unbearable to the point that I ended up limping.</p>
              <p>-Went to see A&amp;E twice requesting for MRI scan, A&amp;E
              rejected my request saying that decision lies with Ortho dept.</p>
              <p>-Went to see camp MO, gave only painkillers and excuse from RMJ
              when I already have LD. (Wtf?)</p>
              <p>I can't bend, squat, kneel, run, straighten my knees or do
              anything that places high stress on my lower limbs to avoid
              aggravating my condition. Simple stuff like attempting to
              straighten my knees and a sharp, acute pain follows after trying to
              do so. Standing for prolonged periods of time also causes the pain
              to increase in intensity.</p>
              <p>Now, I just suck thumb wait for board. My condition currently
              doesn't permit me to do any strenuous activity that may aggravate
              the pain in both knees and my LD is nearing expiry, so I may have
              to renew it.</p>

              <p>Not really. There is a gradient of CMP. Some people may require a surgery to repair or shaved off the damaged cartilage. Others, the knee cap is just slightly out of place.</p>
              <p>If you are having CMP recently, then it can be cured. 3 to 6 months can give good recovery results.</p>
              <p>I got an excuse for RMJ and all lower limbs activites perm for right knee CMP.</p>

              </p><p>Hi. I am a ns man and i had an injury during reservist 4 years ago. After MRI, it was found that i have central disc protrusion L4/5 and i was downgraded to C9L2. Recently, my lower back and leg pain got worse and i had urine problems as well. I went for another scan and MRI results shows severe deterioration, L4/5 prolapsed intervertebral disc with sequestration and cauda equina nerves compression. My specialist said my condition is quite bad and I was asked to go for decompression spine surgery which i just did and discharged, I was also given a memo for downgrade.</p>
              <p>Now, i have concern over my back condition. I do not think i will even be fit enough to help out with carrying stores, ration or jumping off the tonner with my current condition during in camp training which is coming up next few months. Any idea for this case will i be able to downgrade further or will they even upgrade me after this surgery?</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I am currently a pre-enlistee, just have a few questions to ask, hope you guys will help :)</p>
              <p>I have been diagnosed with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mild Hyperlipidemia</span> after several check - ups and appointment with SGH, and after submitting everything (Specialist memo, blood report), i've been graded <span style="color: #ff0000;">PES C2L3 for 6 months.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">First question</span>,PES C2L3 for 6 months, is it meaning that after 6 months, they will review my medical condition again? And if i am deem fit to up PES, i will have to go through BMT all over again ? Honestly i am fine with my PES status, but the 6 months seem very uncertain for me.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Second,</span> i also have an appointment with NUH during the end of August with a specialist to review about my condition as well, and if the specialist gives me a memo, is it necessary for me to bring it down to CMPB to further review my PES ??</p>
              <p>Would appreciate advice !</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks !:)</p>

              <p>In the initial phase, there may be inflammation at the knee cap. NSAIDs and rest can help to relieve the problem. </p>
              <p>Next is Physio, where you strengthen the imbalanced muscles. Buy a balancing board and stand on it.</p>
              <p>It take time to recover slowly. We are talking about years before you can run a marathon again. But to relieve the pain, it take about 3 to 6 months. </p>

              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>something i have been suffering from pains and cramps in my foot and went to specialist and they diagnosed  with flatfoot and have been going for physio for foot exercise and insoles. But non of these is helping much as the pain and cramp are still on going and get worse if i participate in sports. My specialist have written a memo for consideration of downpes but I was not able to book my mo appt due to slots being taken up till oct and the original mo there was out for overseas duties. Is there anything i can do? </p>
              <p>Also I had nasty swollen bites after mainly coming back from the field or sometimes the bunk and from the doctor i went to, he said that i have allgeries from the mosquito bites that is why bites from the mosquito to others is so much different to me and they are quite irritating as sometimes it takes few days to a week plus to heal and i have to see the doctor for medicine costing me a bomb. Any solution for this problem?Thanks</p>

              <p><br>You may call 1800-3676767 to request for an earlier appointment booking timing in September, but there is no guarantee.<br><br>Depending on severity of Flat Foot condition and the specialist memo, most flat foot cases are normally PES B/ B2 nowadays because it has become a common condition. Only severe type are within PES C2/ C9 range.<br><br>As for the mosquito bites, insect repellant products/ powder/ anti-itch cream will be in your bag wherever you go.</p>

              <p><strong>Strenuous exercise (especially running) may cause blood in the urine. It
               may due to the hopping that you keep on slapping your bladder when you 
              run.In fact, 1/5 of the marathon runners experience blood in the urine 
              after a run. </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only other causes are prostate, bladder or kidney cancer, which is rare for young boys. Even stones are rare for young boys. However, to be safe it is better to check it out. Blood in the urine is abnormal.</p>
              <p>Most likely. it is strenuous exercise that causes the problem.</p>
