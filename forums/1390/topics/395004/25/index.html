              <p>Hey guys, thanks for the feedback.</p>
              <p>I also was made to do the treadmill test which confirmed the fact that I have exercise-induced bronchospasm.  This is irrefutable.  Yet what seems to be the sticky issue here is whether or not my condition is "serious" enough to warrant a downgrade to C9L3.  </p>
              <p>This is where the effectiveness of Ventolin comes into play.  I was informed by my specialist that no asthmatic is completely immune to the relief that Ventolin provides. In fact, a key characteristic of asthma is it's response to Ventolin, in that it cannot be called asthma if it is completely unresponsive to the use of an inhaler.</p>
              <p>What I still do not understand is how it is determined if Ventolin is able to stabilize my condition to an acceptable level, and if so, what is this acceptable level?  Is this purely up to the discretion of the medical board chairman?  Or do further tests have to be run?  I understand that the guidelines are not terribly precise when it comes to this.</p>
              <p>Also, as with any drug, the use of the Ventolin inhaler may not always be effective in preventing the onset of EIA.  Especially for me, the use of the inhaler is really just a game of hit-and-miss.  Sometimes it works well for me, sometimes it doesn't and I get attacks all the same.  Furthermore, the use of Ventolin sometimes give me a slight migraine after inhalation - so it's use is not always completely viable for me.</p>
              <p>Would really appreciate some clarification on this matter.  This entire process has been pretty exhausting for me.  It's frustrating to be denied the proper medical attention just because of certain technicalities which are being nitpicked.</p>

              <p>Kalibre...i think only MO or ex-MO can ans your questions on what is acceptable level.</p>
              <p>My cousin had childhood asthma. He didn't have any asthma in his teenage yrs so it's considered like he outgrown from the childhood asthma. So he went for bmt and was selected for ocs. During his ocs training, he got a relapse of asthma. He fainted during training. That was when he was downgraded. Sometimes things like this happen then medical board take action. I hope you dun have to go thru this to get downgraded. Try pushing yourself to the point until ventolin doesn't work, then report sick and they use the machine to administer some gas for your asthma. I dun know what that is called but i had it before for v severe attacks. Take care.</p>

              <p>Hey guys,</p>
              <p>May I know what will happen once you submit your memo to your posted unit after BMT? Suppose there is a downgrade and you are excused from say Lower Limb , what will happen to you? Will you OOC like that in BMT and do Sai Kang (say storeman) until you get reposted? Can stay out if you do these kind of saikand? And typically how long will the reposting take?</p>
              <p>Sorry for asking so many questions..feeling very uncertain now since POP is arriving in a week. Thanks</p>

              <p>Depending on what's your current unit. If chiong sua unit, most likely do all the sai kang until your medical board, but whether will you be posted out of the current unit, it's up to your unit current strength in certain vocation which you maybe posted to.</p>

              <p>Well if the current strength of your future vocation is full, they most likely post you out, but how soon depends on cpc. So if you lobo, then most likely you'll do sai kang, but whether stay out or not depends on unit's policy on lobo. But of cos, your unit foresee someone going to ord on your next vocation then they can keep u there for the moment.</p>

              <p>You cannot stay out unless excused stay in permanently.</p>

              <p>Hi, im currently Temp PES E9L9. What happened was that the initial CPMB check up said my heart got prob, further NUH check up said there's no prob. But by the time, I'm already posted to Kranji Camp 3 at start of April this year.</p>
              <p>My Captain told me that i should wait until the end of this 1-month BMT, go to my new unit, and chiong the MO there, which would be faster as compared chionging CPMB now, and possibly get into the July batch BMT.</p>
              <p>Q1) I wana make sure that if i successfully up my PES and get to the july batch, will i finally be able to go to Tekong just like everyone else, with 19months of service remaining. Or it's possible for other bullsh*t to happen? Cannot take it liao....</p>
              <p>Q2) What's the minimum PES status one must have to be able to go for OCS or whatever other leadership stuff.</p>

              <p>Dear All,<br> <br> Bear with me with my history before my questions.<br> <br> I am an NS man. I have recently being downgraded to PES E9L9 perm

                  notified?<br> c) Would they consider my condition for my posting?<br> d) Got a ICT callup yesterday for 16 days on Oct @ Sungei Gedong
                  Camp,<br> anyone knows what's that about? My usual ICT is @ Khatib

              <p>a) Dependable on NS unit since clerks are needed for the NS unit to function and to be operational, the same as during NSF time.<br>b) Dependable on NS unit's S1 Manpower branch since it's an administrative issue. Contact unit @ 1800-3676767 on <a href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg </a><br>c) Yes, provided you take the initiative to call them and "fight" to put forward your case.<br>d) Dependable on NS unit's ICT workplan for the workyear. e.g. ATEC.<br>e) Dependable on NS unit. PES E clerks and storemen usually stay in if required by the NS unit's CO.<br><br>Hence, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>best, direct and official answers</strong></em></span> should be forwarded to your NS unit instead. If not sure, just pick up the phone and <strong>call them @ 1800-3676767.</strong></p>

              <p>Hi, im currently Temp PES E9L9. What happened was that the
              initial CPMB check up said my heart got prob, further NUH check up
              said there's no prob. But by the time, I'm already posted to Kranji
              Camp 3 at start of April this year.</p>
              <p>My Captain told me that i should wait until the end of this
              1-month BMT, go to my new unit, and chiong the MO there, which
              would be faster as compared chionging CPMB now, and possibly get
              into the July batch BMT.</p>
              <p>Q1) I wana make sure that if i successfully up my PES and get to
              the july batch, will i finally be able to go to Tekong just like
              everyone else, with 19months of service remaining. Or it's possible
              for other bullsh*t to happen? Cannot take it liao....</p>
              <p>Q2) What's the minimum PES status one must have to be able to go
              for OCS or whatever other leadership stuff.</p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>I have a question that needs answering very urgently.</p>
              <p>I've just returned from an overseas exercise to find out that i've been posted out from my unit. I was a clerk, now I'm becoming an ST. Thing is, I've been living with a stress fractured on my right metatarsal (2nd toe) and now I'm feeling the same type of sharp pain on my left big toe after many games of soccer. My PES was initially C2L9. Now it's been upgraded to B1L2, cos I've been medically boarded for my chronic lower back pain. </p>
              <p>This sounds like an awful lot of excuses, but they're there for a reason and I've never meant to chao keng. Ex heavy load, sit-ups, RMJ and stay-in.</p>
              <p>Since the ST course is combat in nature, will my existing excuses prevent me from going? Also, my S1 is trying to keep me from posting out too as he needs us around for high-key events coming up within the unit.</p>
              <p>Question: Will the MO be able to block the posting or does my S1 have any say in this?</p>

I also found out recently via blood test that I've thalassemia minor.</p>
