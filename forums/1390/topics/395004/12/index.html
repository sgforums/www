              <p>Most people after gall bladder removal, maintain a normal life. You may be fitter than you are previously. Ensure you have a low-fat diet. Even if you eat KFC, at most you have is a diarrhea. But it depends on people also. After the surgery, let the specialist evaluate your blood test results. You may developed IBS later. And most likely, you will be downgraded for IBS rarer than gall bladder removal. </p>

              <p><a id="IntroductionClinical" name="IntroductionClinical"> </a></p>
              <p><strong>Choledochal cysts and malignancies</strong></p>
              <p>Malignancies
               in choledochal cyst can arise from the distal CBD, the wall of the cyst
               (even after successful drainage at cystoenterostomy), or the 
              intrahepatic bile ducts. The risk of cancer appears to be related to the
               age of the patient; it is high (&gt;20 times) compared with that of the
               healthy population.<sup><a>12</a>,<a>31</a>,<a>32</a>,<a>7</a>,<a>2</a>,<a>33</a>,<a>34</a>,<a>35</a> </sup>The
               risk of detecting a biliary tree malignancy in a resected cyst is 0.7% 
              in patients who undergo surgery before age 10 years, 6.8% in patients 
              who undergo surgery at age 11-20 years, and 14.3% in patients who 
              undergo surgery after age 20 years.</p>
              <p>More than half of the cancers 
              arise from the cyst wall, even after successful internal drainage. Total
               cyst excision has not prevented the risk of malignancy in the remaining
               bile ducts. Malignancy can develop many years after excision of the 
              cyst and can develop in areas of the biliary tree remote from the cyst 
              such as the <a href="http://www.medscape.com/resource/gallbladder-biliary-disease">gallbladder</a> and terminal common duct, which is left behind after excisional surgery.</p>
              <p>Any
               type of cyst is susceptible to malignancy, but the greatest prevalence 
              is observed with types I, IV, and V. Factors thought to contribute to 
              the development of malignancy include prolonged bile stasis and chronic 
              inflammation of the cyst wall. Inflammatory and metaplastic changes 
              increase with patient age, and they are frequently observed in 
              association with carcinoma of the bile duct. The increased risk of 
              biliary tract malignancy, even after surgery, warrants close 
              surveillance in any case of choledochal cyst. ''</p>

              <p><br>Without any latest memo to update the camp doctor about the side effects you are having now, it's rather often assumed by the camp doctor that you are gradually on the road to recovery from the op. So without any latest memo stating the side effects you are currently having to update the doctor to either extend your temp PES or permanent downgrade, you can say that your temp PES of 6 months will ceased upon expiry and put you to PES B after you ORD. If you go see your camp doctor and just use mouth to say the side effects only, he will automatically shoot you with, "Soldier, where's your latest post-surgery specialist memo as supporting document? How do you expect me to justify your case statement to the Medical Board Chairman for a permanent downgrade? Where's your black and white (written evidence)?"</p>
              <p>So now, if you want a permanent downgrade / extension of the temp PES, it's on you to decide on whether you want to get a latest specialist memo or not...</p>

              <p><strong>Choledochal cysts and malignancies</strong></p>
              <p>Malignancies in choledochal cyst can arise from the distal CBD,
              the wall of the cyst (even after successful drainage at
              cystoenterostomy), or the intrahepatic bile ducts. The risk of
              cancer appears to be related to the age of the patient; it is high
              (&gt;20 times) compared with that of the healthy
              population.<sup><a rel="nofollow">12</a>,<a rel="nofollow">31</a>,<a rel="nofollow">32</a>,<a rel="nofollow">7</a>,<a rel="nofollow">2</a>,<a rel="nofollow">33</a>,<a rel="nofollow">34</a>,<a rel="nofollow">35</a></sup> The risk of detecting a biliary tree
              malignancy in a resected cyst is 0.7% in patients who undergo
              surgery before age 10 years, 6.8% in patients who undergo surgery
              at age 11-20 years, and 14.3% in patients who undergo surgery after
              age 20 years.</p>
              <p>More than half of the cancers arise from the cyst wall, even
              after successful internal drainage. Total cyst excision has not
              prevented the risk of malignancy in the remaining bile ducts.
              Malignancy can develop many years after excision of the cyst and
              can develop in areas of the biliary tree remote from the cyst such
              as the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.medscape.com/resource/gallbladder-biliary-disease">gallbladder</a> and terminal common duct, which is left
              behind after excisional surgery.</p>
              <p>Any type of cyst is susceptible to malignancy, but the greatest
              prevalence is observed with types I, IV, and V. Factors thought to
              contribute to the development of malignancy include prolonged bile
              stasis and chronic inflammation of the cyst wall. Inflammatory and
              metaplastic changes increase with patient age, and they are
              frequently observed in association with carcinoma of the bile duct.
              The increased risk of biliary tract malignancy, even after surgery,
              warrants close surveillance in any case of choledochal cyst. ''</p>
              <p>do you think the mo will look at this ? or even my specialist ?

              <p>IBS stands for irritable bowel syndrome. It can be frequent diarrhea, constipation or  diarrhea and constipation (altered).  The gall bladder stores the bile salt for digesting fats and many other stuff. So without a gall bladder to regulate bile secretion, if you eat normal diet, you will have problem with fat digestion, which will causes you to have diarrhea. It means that your stomach gets upset easily, for thinly little things. Which you will learn to alter your diet to cope with your "new" digestive system.</p>

              <p>When strongly supported by written medical evidence in black and white (memos from hospital specialist/ psychologist/ psychiatrist), you can safely say that you are guaranteed to be within PES C to E range.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, if you just declare by mouth that you have this or that, the CMPB doctor will still simply ask you to please go get hospital specialist certifying memos to proof and then come back another day for further review together with the memos.</p>
              <p>So in the end, as always advised, "No specialist memo, no talk" applies.</p>

              <p>Ok, so for the psychiatric issue, I do have a specialist agreeing to write a memo for me. What kind of language he will use (convincing or severe) I do not know, but definitely I can get. My doctor may just write a neutral letter saying that I have this disorder, and I don't think he will write anything more? By the way, I happen to saw my medical record in the system when the doctor was viewing it on his computer, I'm stated as "active" being diagnosed with "neurotic disorder". Will MINDEF look at our health records in the system? The system is accessible by all doctors from the govt polyclinics and hospitals.</p>
              <p>Regarding my lazy eye and flat foot, do I really have to see a specialist? These are very minor issues to be seeing a specialist. Lazy eye I have been to TTSH 10+ years ago for check but didn't follow up. Will it still be in the system, and will MINDEF go look at it? Cos I still have lazy eye now and its quite significant. For flat foot, can just declare without memo rite? Cos it dosen't warrant any specialist attention.</p>
              <p>Many thanks in advance and for the above replies. They have been helpful.</p>

              <p>Okay, an update from my previous case which I posted here a while ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have a tear in my abbrum smthsmth in my left shoulder, which basically means there's a tear in my left shoulder joint, which if not properly cared after can completely rupture which means going for surgery. At this point the swelling has not decreased and I'll be recommended to undergo injections to help relieve the pain and swelling if it doesn't improve over the next two weeks.</p>
              <p>I'm currently OOT from BMT and I'm awaiting my new posting. My BMT batch will be POPing in coming week, but I'm not entitled to my 10 day leave since I'm OOT. Instead, based on protocol I can only recieve 3 days of leave and I can choose whether or not to use it. In my case, it makes no sense to go back home overseas just for 3 days since tickets are fairly expensive.</p>
              <p>So in my case, I'm not going to use the 3 day leave, instead I've been advised to wait till my next posting and apply for overseas leave then. This brings up my question:</p>
              <p>My specialist review from CMPB is in mid jan, which means that they can only post me permanently to a unit after my medical review. So during my temp vocation, is it possible to apply for overseas leave from them? And what are the chances of them granting my leave so soon after joining the unit? Most likely I'll still be under my company until I get my permamnent posting, so can they grant me the leave? Or will I have to wait for my permanent posting to apply for overseas leave?</p>
              <p> Also I'm wondering what PES and Vocation will I most likely be posted to? I have three physio sessions a week with a bi-weekly specialist check up.</p>

              <p>Okay, an update from my previous case which I posted here a
              while ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have a tear in my abbrum smthsmth in my left shoulder, which
              basically means there's a tear in my left shoulder joint, which if
              not properly cared after can completely rupture which means going
              for surgery. At this point the swelling has not decreased and I'll
              be recommended to undergo injections to help relieve the pain and
              swelling if it doesn't improve over the next two weeks.</p>
              <p>I'm currently OOT from BMT and I'm awaiting my new posting. My
              BMT batch will be POPing in coming week, but I'm not entitled to my
              10 day leave since I'm OOT. Instead, based on protocol I can only
              recieve 3 days of leave and I can choose whether or not to use it.
              In my case, it makes no sense to go back home overseas just for 3
              days since tickets are fairly expensive.</p>
              <p>So in my case, I'm not going to use the 3 day leave, instead
              I've been advised to wait till my next posting and apply for
              overseas leave then. This brings up my question:</p>
              <p>My specialist review from CMPB is in mid jan, which means that
              they can only post me permanently to a unit after my medical
              review. So during my temp vocation, is it possible to apply for
              overseas leave from them? And what are the chances of them granting
              my leave so soon after joining the unit? Most likely I'll still be
              under my company until I get my permamnent posting, so can they
              grant me the leave? Or will I have to wait for my permanent posting
              to apply for overseas leave?</p>
              <p> Also I'm wondering what PES and Vocation will I most
              likely be posted to? I have three physio sessions a week with a
              bi-weekly specialist check up.</p>

              <p>I suggest you just do an MRI and sew back the torn tendon through surgery. This is because right now you are young so you may not find the impact yet. But this tear will get bigger. Eventually you may need to fix in using your own money, due to SAF's fault. So fix it now, even if it is one stretch. </p>

              <p>I can get pes B2 even if I can't do any physical activity? My specialist said that I can't do the following: Push up, pull up, situps (arms behind my head), running, carrying heavy load, handling rifle (puts strain on my shoulder). The tear is caused by my shoulder blade being 2 cm higher than normal, which im doing physio to correct.</p>
              <p>The MRI showed swelling of the joint coupled with the tear. My specialist said that as of right now there is no reason for surgery if it can recoup by itself, if not then it may be a possibility later.</p>
              <p>And the overseas leave is not to go to bahamas or whatever, it's to go see my family. I came from overseas to do NS, so wanted to see my family =(</p>

              <p>Ok, so for the psychiatric issue, I do have a specialist agreeing to write a memo for me. What kind of language he will use (convincing or severe) I do not know, but definitely I can get. My doctor may just write a neutral letter saying that I have this disorder, and I don't think he will write anything more? By the way, I happen to saw my medical record in the system when the doctor was viewing it on his computer, I'm stated as "active" being diagnosed with "neurotic disorder". Will MINDEF look at our health records in the system? The system is accessible by all doctors from the govt polyclinics and hospitals.</p>
              <p>Regarding my lazy eye and flat foot, do I really have to see a specialist? These are very minor issues to be seeing a specialist. Lazy eye I have been to TTSH 10+ years ago for check but didn't follow up. Will it still be in the system, and will MINDEF go look at it? Cos I still have lazy eye now and its quite significant. For flat foot, can just declare without memo rite? Cos it dosen't warrant any specialist attention.</p>
              <p>Many thanks in advance and for the above replies. They have been helpful.</p>

              <p><br>Bring along any medical documents to support your existing medical conditions.</p>
              <p>If you think that the psychiatrist memo is good enough, then just bring that and declare those minor ones by saying.</p>
              <p>But if you think the doctor will patiently and slowly take his own sweet time to view your online record when there are hundreds of boys waiting in line to have their checkup, then you are just trying to play with your luck.</p>

              <p>You see. B2 is only talking about IPPT. That is excuse chip up and perhaps shuttle run (cose u need to pick up the stuff). You can still run 2.4 km, do sit up and standing broad jump (These are lower limb activities). The other part is the land deployment code, which determined your vocation. </p>
              <p>SAF expect you to do physio and fix the upper limbs. And not leave it unfixed. Anyway, fixing the limbs through surgery is the best and fastest option. NS is only 2 years, nothing compared to a unusable arm for 80 years? Believe me, unfixed shoulder join can lead to shoulder impingement syndrome -&gt; nerve impingement syndrome -&gt; finally lost of limb function at 30s to 40s. (if you dont fix it now)  </p>
              <p>"<span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333;"> if it can recoup by itself" -  personally, I prefer to do surgery and walk around in camp with arm support for half to a year. Nobody will bother you then.  </span></p>
