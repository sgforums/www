              <p>Hey EAC, this was alot of help to me actually.  I have the
                              exact same condition, severe allergic rhinitis and concurrent
                              bronchial asthma.  It's causing me alot of grief, having to
                              sleep in the bunks in camp.  I'd like to ask whether downgrade
                              for this is based on a case-by-case basis or is there a directive
                              on this which allows immediate, no questions asked downgrade?</p>
              <p>Where specialist memos are concerned, I already have a positive
                              exercise-induced asthma test, positive methacoline challenge test
                              and positive skin prick test with pretty strongly worded memos.
                               Am I in good shape in this case?  My medical board is
                              soon and I really would like to know as much as I can before I go
                              for it as I dont want to waste anymore time and continue suffering
                              in the meantime.</p>
              <p>Also, is the board allowed to approve excuse stay-in for this
                              condition?</p>

              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What is a Medical Board?</strong></span></em><br>        <br>A Medical Board is a session conducted to evaluate the medical condition of a serviceman and to decide on an appropriate PES grading.<br><br>A serviceman is required to undergo a Medical Review prior to a Medical Board. This allows the Unit Medical Officer to prepare a Statement of Case and gather sufficient information (e.g. specialist medical reports, investigation results etc) so that the Medical Board is able to make a decision on the PES status. Depending on the complexity of your condition, more than one review may be required.<br><br>Medical board appointments can only be made by a medical officer when your medical information is complete and all investigation results are back.<br><br>You have the option to either be present or absent at your medical board. For your convenience and in clear-cut cases, your medical officer may give you the option of not being present for your medical board (i.e. having a Board-in-Absentia). You can however still choose to be present during your medical board in such cases.<br><br>However, for complicated cases, you are required to be present during your medical board (i.e. Board-in-Presence).</p>

              <p>Hi guys any idea what grade of pes i will get if i have all 3 of the following conditions?</p>
              <p>1) Allergic rhinitis ( quite severe, dust gets caught in my throat causing me to choke and wake up often at intervals at night often preventing me from even eating properly.)</p>
              <p>2) Allergic sinus ( nose runs like free.. non stop causing tension headaches and breathlessness even when not doing any activities )</p>
              <p>3) Deviated right nazal septum with inflammed turbinates causing lack of proper oxygen intake. ( advised to undergo operation and skin prick test etc.)</p>
              <p>I already visited a specialist and have submitted a memo requesting to downgrade me along with my diagnosis. My case has been submitted to the board by my unit MO already. Im just curious to know roughly wad range of pes i will be getting.</p>

              <p>Any real MO can reply to my complicated problem??</p>
              <p>I was actually PES B1 L1 in J2 and when i went back again after As they said i had a heart problem but didn't specify. They referred me to TMX but after that there were no followups and i was left hanging in nowhere. My initial tekong date and time were canceled and i went to pes E bmt. </p>
              <p>Because of my interest in combat vocations I went for a senior consultant cardiologist in Changi Hospital. She did a heart echo test and i was asked to run on a threadmill (which is more specific than the TMX).There were no problems with my heart and she said she could overwrite the MO's initial decision to put me into PES E. But how true is that? Can i really up pes to my original PES B from E? I've don't know whether to go for review and medical board or not... Someone help me</p>
