              BMT</span></strong><br> This 9-week programme trains combat-fit recruits in the basic
              military skills to prepare them for advanced vocational training.
              The programme includes weapon training with the SAR 21 rifle which
              will teach recruits technical handling and marksmanship skills; a
              Battle Inoculation Course that simulates a real battlefield; a
              Field Camp which develops basic survival skills; progressive
              training to complete a 24-km route march which builds combat

              BMT</span></strong><br> As evidence has shown that obese recruits are able to achieve
              optimum fitness levels and weight loss in about 19 weeks, the new
              BMT programme for recruits with Body Mass Index (BMI) scores
              exceeding 27.0 will be 19 weeks. This BMT programme is designed to
              help obese recruits improve their physical fitness progressively
              while equipping them with basic soldiering skills and
              knowledge.</p>

              programme. The new 9-week PES B2 BMT programme will be conducted
              for recruits who are medically fit for deployment in selected
              combat and combat support vocations, such as signal operators,
              combat medics and naval system operators. These recruits will be
              given a new medical classification of PES B2, in place of the
              existing PES C1 classification. This is to ensure that the medical
              classification of our soldiers is consistent with their deployment.
              The new 9-week programme will include customised physical training,
              as well as basic combat training to prepare them for their combat
              and combat support roles.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES C

              programme will include light physical training and vocational
              training to prepare them for combat service support vocations, such
              as service medic, and those related to logistics and
              administration.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES E

              <p><em>What are the changes to your lifestyle, diet and
              exercise?</em><br> <br> Firstly, you are strongly advised to eat oats (instant/ quick-cook)
              as heavy breakfast, and greatly reduce eating fried foods and junk
              foods.<br> <br> Secondly, please start cardio exercising.<br> Start from light to gradual to moderate.<br> e.g. brisk walking, then fast walking, then slow jogging, then
              jogging.<br> <br> Thirdly, if you drink alcohol/ smoke tobacco, please quit.<br> <br> It's best that by changing your lifestyle, your BP will gradually
              stablise and be within normal range. Doctors advise that to manage
              BP effectively, it's optimal to change your lifestyle, next is to
              reduce drug dosage, and finally be completely off medicine.</p>
              <p>That's why I strongly urge you to eat oats (instant/
              quick-cook).<br> 3 big scoops (Chinese soup spoon) into a bowl.<br> Just add boiling water to 70% full.<br> Cover the bowl with a plate and wait 10 to 15 minutes.<br> Add water to 100% full, and consume at lukewarm.<br> Fast and easy-to-make breakfast.<br> <br> Never ever skip breakfast.<br> Start off the day by having a heavy breakfast.<br> Have lunch at 70% full.<br> Have dinner at 30% full. If still hungry, eat oats.<br> If possible, drink <span><em>Pu</em>'<em>er/ oolong</em> tea
              (<em>without sugar</em>) daily</span>.<br> <br> Why I recommend you this?<br> My parents have HBP since first known 2 years ago.<br> And now, their BP is well-maintain with this 1st step in a simple
              change in diet/ lifestyle.</p>

              <p><em>Mr Chua Tiat Beng, 55, who suffered a heart attack
                   in 2009, is now doing all he can to keep his cholesterol in check. He 
                  exercises twice a week, has cut his intake of cholesterol-rich food and 
                  has reduced the number of cigarettes he smokes. </em></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE - Singaporeans appear to be taking better care of their heart health, recent national figures suggest.</p>
              <p>For
                   instance, cholesterol levels have improved, particularly levels of 
                  so-called "bad" cholesterol, or low-density lipoprotein (LDL).</p>
              <p>The
                   National Health Survey 2010 showed 15.2 per cent of Singapore residents
                   aged 18 to 69 years had high levels of LDL in 2010, down from 20.3 per 
                  cent in 2004 and 29.1per cent in 1998, after adjusting for an older 
                  population as an ageing population would see higher rates of 
                  cholesterol.</p>
              <p>It may be one of the reasons that the rate of heart 
                  attacks per 100,000 people has fallen, from 230 in 2008 to 217 in 2011, 
                  after adjusting for an older population, according to the Ministry of 
                  Health.</p>
              <p>High cholesterol is one of several risk factors for 
                  cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death worldwide. In 
                  Singapore, it accounted for one in three deaths in 2010.</p>
              <p>There are
                   other reasons as to why heart attack rates may have dropped, noted 
                  Dr Raymond Wong, a consultant at the cardiac department at the National 
                  University Heart Centre, Singapore.</p>
              <p>The National Health Survey 
                  2010 showed the prevalence of hypertension dropped from 32.5 per cent in
                   1998 to 23.5 per cent in 2010, after adjusting for an older population.</p>
              <p>However,
                   other risk factors for cardiovascular disease - obesity, diabetes, 
                  smoking and lack of regular exercise - have all gone up between 2004 and
                   2010.</p>
              <p>These figures show that it is very likely the drop in 
                  cholesterol and hypertension rates are the main contributors to the fall
                   in heart attack rates, said Dr Wong.</p>
              <p><strong>Dangers of high cholesterol </strong></p>
              <p>Cholesterol
                   is necessary for the formation of healthy cells but it also contributes
                   to atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of many cardiovascular 
                  diseases.</p>
              <p>In atherosclerosis, excess cholesterol in circulation is
                   deposited into cells in the artery walls and gradually forms a fatty 
                  deposit called plaque.</p>
              <p>Atherosclerosis restricts blood flow through the narrowed artery, leading to symptoms of chest pain called angina.</p>
              <p>When the plaque ruptures, a blood clot will form which may completely block blood flow in the artery.</p>
              <p><em>LDL
                   cholesterol transports cholesterol from the liver to tissues of the 
                  body. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol - "good" cholesterol - 
                  removes excess cholesterol from the tissues and brings it back to the 
                  liver for removal from the body.</em></p>
              <p>What the national survey does not
                   show is how many people with hyperlipidemia, or high cholesterol 
                  levels, have lowered their LDL levels through taking 
                  cholesterol-lowering drugs, said Dr Wong.</p>
              <p>So it could well be that those already diagnosed with the condition are keeping it under control with medication.</p>
              <p>Still,
                   doctors are encouraged by the trend, which they feel is a sign of a 
                  population becoming more health conscious and aware of how to achieve 
                  good health.</p>
              <p><strong>While obesity, diabetes and high cholesterol all 
                  require a person to adopt healthier lifestyles, some lifestyle changes 
                  are easier to achieve than others.</strong></p>
              <p>Dr Wong pointed out that 
                  obesity is probably the hardest risk factor to manage, since there is no
                   "magic bullet or drug" for one to lose weight.</p>
              <p>Dr Tong Khim Leng,
                   the chief of cardiology at Changi General Hospital (CGH), has observed 
                  more people <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>being aware of the importance of regular exercise and a diet
                   low in saturated fat.</strong></em></span></p>
              <p>And more people are finding out their 
                  cholesterol levels because of regular health screenings offered by 
                  company health insurance policies, said Dr Tan Chong Hiok, a senior 
                  consultant at Parkway Heart and Vascular Centre.</p>
              <p>He said: "We are 
                  able to treat these patients earlier and data has shown that treating 
                  them with statin results in a relative risk reduction of up to 50 per 
                  cent in preventing cardiovascular disease."</p>
              <p><strong>Target cholesterol levels </strong></p>
              <p>Doctors
                   say routine screening for cholesterol should start from 40 years of 
                  age, and even earlier for people with heart disease or multiple risk 
                  factors.</p>
              <p><em>A person's target cholesterol level is dependent on his 
                  risk of cardiovascular disease, based on well-known risk factors such as
                   age, ethnic group, smoking status, cholesterol and blood pressure. This
                   can be calculated with a local version of the Framingham risk score.</em></p>
              <p>The higher a person's risk, the lower will be the goal level for LDL cholesterol.</p>
              <p>For
                   instance, a high-risk patient, such as one who has heart disease, will 
                  need to keep his LDL cholesterol under 2.6 millimoles of cholesterol per
                   litre of blood (mmol/L), compared with a low-risk patient whose target 
                  LDL cholesterol is under 4.1mmol/L.</p>
              <p>Adjunct Assistant Professor 
                  David Foo, the head of the department of cardiology at Tan Tock Seng 
                  Hospital, said diabetes and smoking, coupled with high cholesterol, 
                  raise a person's cardiovascular risk because they damage blood vessel 
                  walls and make it more likely for blood clots to form.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Patients 
                  will always be advised to make lifestyle changes - lose weight, exercise
                   regularly, stop smoking and drink alcohol in moderation.</strong></em></span></p>
              <p><em>If these do not improve their cholesterol levels enough, medication is prescribed, said doctors here.</em></p>
              <p>Statins
                   is the most common class of cholesterol-lowering medication, said 
                  doctors, with seven or eight out of 10 patients being put on statins.</p>
              <p>In
                   April 2009, businessman Chua Tiat Beng, 55, was behind the wheel of his
                   car when he broke out in cold sweat and felt a tightness in his chest.</p>
              <p>The
                   father of two went straight to a general practitioner, who recognised 
                  the signs of an impending heart attack. At Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Mr 
                  Chua underwent an emergency angioplasty to unclog a blocked artery. 
                  While in hospital, he learned that the first health screening he had 
                  been to just a week before had picked up high cholesterol levels.</p>
              <p>As he was also a smoker and above 45 years old, he was at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>He said: "When people are not sick, they never heed good advice."</strong></em></span></p>
              <p>He
                   now smokes less, watches his diet, jogs twice a week and takes 
                  cholesterol-lowering medication and aspirin to prevent clots from 
                  forming around the stent. A blood test last December gave him a clean 
                  bill of health.</p>

              <p>Singaporeans could do a little better when it comes to making good food choices.</p>
              <p>The National Nutrition Survey 2010 showed the mean cholesterol intake for adult Singapore residents was 341mg per day.</p>
              <p>According to the Health Promotion Board, a person's intake of cholesterol should not exceed 300mg daily.</p>
              <p>More than half, or 54.9 per cent, of respondents met or surpassed their recommended daily intake.</p>
              <p>A plate of oyster omelette chalks up 350mg of cholesterol, while a teaspoon of butter contributes to 40mg.</p>
              <p>Cholesterol
               in the body comes from two sources: 80 per cent of it is made in the 
              liver and the rest comes from a person's diet. So people should watch 
              their dietary cholesterol, which is contained in food such as eggs and 
              shellfish.</p>
              <p>In addition, two to three out of five to seven servings of carbohydrates eaten daily should come from wholegrain products.</p>
              <p>These
               are good sources of soluble fibre which have the ability to bind 
              cholesterol in the gut, reducing its absorption and increasing its 
              excretion.</p>
              <p>Also, not all fats are equal or equally bad. Eat 
              saturated fats, found in dairy products and meat, sparingly as it 
              increases low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and the 
              corresponding total cholesterol levels.</p>
              <p>Avoid trans fats, made 
              from the hydrogenation of vegetable oil, which lowers high-density 
              lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and increases LDL cholesterol 
              levels.</p>
              <p>The best fats to consume are unsaturated fats as well as Omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
              <p>What are the top five things one can do to have a cholesterol-lowering diet?</p>
              <p><strong>Know your meats</strong></p>
              <p>Choose leaner cuts of meat, such as loin or breast meat. Avoid sausages, Chinese sausages and luncheon meat.</p>
              <p>Limit
               intake of red meat, such as beef, lamb, duck and goose, as they are 
              higher in fat than white meat such as chicken and pork.</p>
              <p>Remove skin and visible fat from poultry.</p>
              <p><strong>Choose healthier oils</strong></p>
              <p>Choose
               healthier oils for cooking, such as canola, olive and sunflower oils. 
              Avoid tropical oils such as palm oil and coconut milk. Replace coconut 
              milk or coconut cream used in cooking with skimmed milk or low-fat milk.</p>
              <p>When eating out, ask for no or less oil to be added to food.</p>
              <p><strong>Be aware of cooking methods</strong></p>
              <p>Adopt
               healthier cooking methods such as steaming, boiling, grilling, 
              roasting, baking and stewing, instead of deep frying. For example, it is
               healthier to eat grilled fish and baked potatoes instead of fish and 
              chips.</p>
              <p>Use a non-stick pan when cooking to reduce the use of cooking oil.</p>
              <p>Scoop out the layer of solidified fat on top of chilled stews, casseroles and soups before heating up and serving.</p>
              <p>When
               eating out, choose soupy dishes instead of fried dishes. For example, 
              opt for beehoon soup instead of fried beehoon. Also, choose boiled 
              wantons (dumplings) instead of fried ones.</p>
              <p><strong>Limit cholesterol-rich food</strong></p>
              <p>Eat animal organs, such as pig liver or kidneys, no more than once a month and even then, in small portions.</p>
              <p>Consume egg yolks no more than thrice a week. Have seafood, such as shellfish, prawns and crabs, not more than twice a week.</p>
              <p><strong>Be a wise shopper</strong></p>
              <p>Choose
               products with the Healthier Choice Symbol as they are lower in total 
              fats and saturated fats compared with other products in similar 
              categories.</p>
              <p>These products also have no trans fat or negligible amounts of it per serving.</p>
              <p>Read
               the ingredient list to identify products that contain vegetable 
              shortening and hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils, as they are 
              high in saturated and trans fats. Choose these products less often.</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I am a PES B NSMan who developed a severe case of eczema after I ORD-ed. I've already went for a medical checkup; the MO told me he has recommended me for a medical board review, but I do not need to be present for it. I have also been given an excuse IPPT/RT/Physical Training for 84 Days as I wait for the Medical Board to redetermine my PES Status.</p>
              <p>The thing is, I have an up-coming ICT mid June. Generally how long is the medical board review going to take and will I know of my PES Status before the 18th? If I do get downgraded successfully, who do I contact to confirm if I still need to attend ICT?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>A Medical Board is a session conducted to evaluate the medical condition of a serviceman and to:<br>a. review his PES grade;<br>b. recommend a change of vocation or restriction of duties on medical grounds;<br>c. endorse his extended-period medical certificate; or<br>d. determine permanent disability if he has sustained service-related injuries.<br><br>A serviceman is required to undergo a Medical Review prior to a Medical Board. This allows the unit Medical Officer to gather sufficient information (e.g. specialist medical reports, investigation results) so that the Medical Board can make a decision on the PES grade. Depending on the complexity of your condition, more than one review may be required.<br><br>Medical Boards cannot be booked using the eMedAppt module. Medical Board appointments can only be made by a Medical Officer when your medical information is complete and all investigation results are back.<br><br>You have the option to either be present or absent at your medical board. For your convenience and in clear-cut cases, your Medical Officer may give you the option of not being present for your medical board (i.e. having a Board in Absentia). You can however still choose to be present during your Medical Board in such cases. However, for complicated cases, you are required to be present during your medical board (i.e. Board in Presence).</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>A Medical Review is a medical consultation convened whenever a serviceman has a change in the status of a current medical condition, or if he develops a new medical condition, which may affect his ability to fulfill his NS liabilities. A medical review can either be initiated by the individual (known as Self-initiated) or by the NS Unit (Unit-initiated).<br><br>Situations whereby the individual initiates a Self-initiated medical review include:<br><br>    He develops a new medical condition (e.g. slipped disc, high blood pressure, surgery for a medical condition). In such situations, he should bring all relevant medical documents for his medical review by the SAF Medical Officer. The SAF Medical Officer can then assess the condition, and recommend a medical downgrade, if appropriate.<br><br>    He has a long-term medical excuse for the same injury and the period coincides with a NS activity that he is unable to attend. He should see the SAF medical officer to document his medical excuse, and ascertain whether he is fit to attend the NS activity.<br><br><br>Situations whereby the unit makes a Unit-initiated medical review include:<br><br>    Serviceman has a temporary PES status that has expired and he is due for a medical review by a SAF Medical Officer.<br><br>    Serviceman has a service injury requiring a medical review to prepare for a Permanent Disability Board.<br><br>    Serviceman has a medical condition necessitating a medical review to prepare for a Medical Board.</p></div>
