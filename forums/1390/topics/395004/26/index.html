              <p>Hey guys, I posted earlier about my present situation, but I was wondering if it was possible to get more input on a few things.  </p>
              <p>I'm wondering how serious asthma has to be to warrant a downgrade.  I have been experiencing worsening symptoms of bronchial asthma, made worse by the fact that I have have severe allergic rhinitis. This makes it very difficult to sleep in the bunks at night and I have asthma attacks pretty often because I'm consistently exposed to the triggers.  Is this enough to warrant a downgrade?  I am also looking at the possibility of excuse stay-in, which my unit has been unwilling to grant me due to cohesion issues.</p>
              <p>Will the best option to be to go to the medical board, which I have already been boarded for, and ask them for a downgrade and excuse stay-in? Or perhaps even a revocation if my unit is so adamant about not granting me the relevant medical concessions I require. Need some input on this.  </p>
              <p>Also, what if the medical board cannot downgrade or give me any sort of relief for my issues? What is my next course of action then?</p>

              <p><br>If you are not satisfied with the current result of the Medical Board (usually held with you in absence), you can visit the medical centre again and request the MO to let you have the option to attend the next Medical Board meeting in presence, for which you can explain in person to the Medical Board chairman to argue for your case. It's just like going to the court to defend yourself with your own explanations and supporting documents such as specialist reports/ memos or some even have a 2nd opinion specialist reports/ memos.<br><br>For Medical Board, it's no choice and no other way around. It's always need evidence/ proof to justify the case. If you think your case is rather complicated, therefore please get more supporting documents to justify.<br><br>For revocation, it's more of an administrative issue, so it's better to seek assistance from your S1 Manpower branch. This is so because Medical Board can only recommend revocation to a suitable vocation. In the end, the official actual final decision still lies with the S1 Manpower branch. e.g. Chief Clerk/ S1 Manpower Officer.</p>

              <p>Well normally they need to review your case but most likely your unit did not monitor your pes status. If already expired, maybe you should call them up whether it went back to B or maybe they BIA for you and you got a new perm status.</p>

              <p><br>Permanent or Temporary, it depends on the Medical Board.</p>
              <p>With the support of hospital specialist memos, these 2 conditions combined will be within the range of PES C. If the memos state them as severe types, they can be within PES E range.</p>

              <p>Hey guys. </p>
              <p>I would like some advice here. I am currently in Pes B1L1 but i have breathlessness problems and it is currently investigation in CGH. I am supposed to enlist on May 6 but my report will only be out in the 2nd week of may. Furthermore, I have a memo from the specialist that states that I am currently undergoing check up for breathlessness in CGH. So what should I do? should i submit the memo and show the MO at cmpb my medical appointment card. Will my enlistment be delayed and will i be downgraded to Pes D temporary? Because i really do not want to enlist too late but neither do i want to enter BMT only to OOC because of my condition.</p>
              <p>so some advice please?</p>
              <p>Thank you so much</p>

              <p>Hey guys. </p>
              <p>I would like some advice here. I am currently in Pes B1L1 but i
                  have breathlessness problems and it is currently investigation in
                  CGH. I am supposed to enlist on May 6 but my report will only be
                  out in the 2nd week of may. Furthermore, I have a memo from the
                  specialist that states that I am currently undergoing check up for
                  breathlessness in CGH. So what should I do? should i submit the
                  memo and show the MO at cmpb my medical appointment card. Will my
                  enlistment be delayed and will i be downgraded to Pes D temporary?
                  Because i really do not want to enlist too late but neither do i
                  want to enter BMT only to OOC because of my condition.</p>
              <p>so some advice please?</p>
              <p>Thank you so much</p>

              <p>You can give it a try by calling CMPB at 1800-3676767 asap. But now, you should know that because of the administrative issues given the short period of
                                          less than 3 weeks, it's quite a rush of time for CMPB.</p>
              <p>After calling CMPB, if it says cannot and just enlist as per normal and then once there, immediately report sick at Tekong Medical Centre to submit the specalist memos, then please do so. Your health is important than worrying about OOC.</p>

              <p>Hey EAC, this was alot of help to me actually.  I have the exact same condition, severe allergic rhinitis and concurrent bronchial asthma.  It's causing me alot of grief, having to sleep in the bunks in camp.  I'd like to ask whether downgrade for this is based on a case-by-case basis or is there a directive on this which allows immediate, no questions asked downgrade?</p>
              <p>Where specialist memos are concerned, I already have a positive exercise-induced asthma test, positive methacoline challenge test and positive skin prick test with pretty strongly worded memos.  Am I in good shape in this case?  My medical board is soon and I really would like to know as much as I can before I go for it as I dont want to waste anymore time and continue suffering in the meantime.</p>
              <p>Also, is the board allowed to approve excuse stay-in for this condition?</p>
