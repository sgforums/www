              <p><br> No PES status can be 3 months, 6 months or 1 year temporary
                  downgrade. Yours if gt expiry date means temporary PES status. When
                  expires if condition never recover bring memo most likely get
                  Permanent PES grading. When ur pes status expires get a specialist

              <p>I checked in the Ns.sg, it says my C2L9 temp pes status  expiry is early july 2012, but my RMJ &amp; H/L status expires late june 2012.</p>
              <p>Does that means i don't need to take IPPT &amp; RT at least for the time being until my RMJ &amp; H/L status expires?</p>
              <p>And to make my status permanent, is it a must for me to consult Private Specialist to write a memo for recommendation of permanent down-pes due to my medical condition or will Public Hosptial Specialist memo be sufficient when the time comes?</p>
              <p>Btw: Do H/L factor in Arms as well, since it's quite heavy too, I don't want to to worsen my spine injury if they do ask me to go back reservice. Or I still have to take arms during reservice?</p>

              <p>Hi guys would like to seek some advice here, been having knee pain for 3 - 4 years now. Finally one day after running
               2 km my knee was extremely painful and I limped back to rest. 
              Subsequently I had difficulties standing for long period or even go to 
              those toilet that is squatting ones as the knee would feel pain and 
              tightness... When I try to extend my legs and contract, /i can feel 
              cracking in my knees....<br> <br> Recently went to MRI and X-Ray result out today but were negative! And 
              worse thing is that yesterday I just went for a bodycombat class in 
              Fitness First for the first time, they asked us to do kicks and I 
              couldn't due to knee pain.... <br> <br> Very frustrated now because my unit is a ops ready unit and I don't want
               to get myself injured while doing my service but I can't down PES now 
              with the negative result.... Worse thing is I can't run and train for my
               IPPT.....<br> <br> Any bro's here has any idea what else I can do?? Went to CGH and was 
              terribly disappointed, they doc just said everything is fine, and ask me
               if I want to do physio and said it might be due to a weak thigh 
              muscle.... I mean come on, I am a sporty person, got best PT 3 times how
               weak can my thigh muscle be to be creating knee problem?? I don't even 
              understand how could thigh muscle be a cause??</p>

              <p>I dont have a similar issue but I can tell you what will happen.</p>
              <p>Duration of recovery. In first few weeks, you may not even lift up the arms, on support. Next few months, may be u can lift up the arm abit. Strength will recover gradually in half to about a year time.You need to do regular physo to gain the function back to 100% at the time before the operation. It will take 10 to 20 years to recover back to 90% before you injured. Most likely you are not able to do a 360 degree full rotation permantly.</p>
              <p>The effect after the operation is the joint would become more stable. You will have less frequency of dislocation. Strengthwise, a bit better than before. The idea of the operation is to prevent further trauma.</p>
              <p><strong>If you are rich, do the operation when you are young, recovery will be faster.  <br></strong></p>
              <p>It is a day operation. You can go back home immediately. You can work tomolo, if it is not your master arm. Else, it is good luck.</p>

              <p>Oh! Book an ENT specialist in goverment hospital and do the operation to correct it. You cannot downgrade because of this. But you will rest, MC for a while.</p>
              <p>OOTs loh. It is affecting you, that why you go and see a specialist. So now you got a problem, then you are going to do nothing about. If so then why bother to see the doctor in the first place? Who cares about upcoming problem? solve the current one now.</p>
