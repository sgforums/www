              <p><br>Since the MO has already explained to you, then it's ok. If you don't think it's fair, then please get a strongly worded specialist memo.</p>
              <p>Of course. The Medical Board has to read your medical case statement before making a decision.</p>
              <p>Underweight is a standard PES B (by comparsion, obesity is a PES B<em>p</em>).<br>Minor slipped disc is within PES B2 to C range, depending on severity and specialist memo.</p>
              <p>So it's fairly acceptable.</p>

              <p>Landcode only restrict some vocations like combat roles or place of deployability.</p>

              <p>But L3 means non-comabatant vocations.</p>

              <p>Just to check with you guys.. before NS i did a hernia operation and when i went to CMPB for checkup the doctor gave me pes B. I injured my ankle and these hole inside and going for operation and the
               specialist wrote a letter to my MO to downgrade me . I went get my RMJ statues cause i'm still waiting for Medical Board for my ankle and doctor said i'm downgrade to C9L1 perm due to hernia operation but not my ankle.  But i waited for 3mth after signing the Medical Board paper but still no update at all.. how long more do i need to wait? Anyway do you guys know what PES will i downgrade if go Medcial Board?</p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>I'm a newbie here. I have just gone for my medical checkup at CMPB and was told that my EKG was abnormal - referred to heart specialist &amp; confirmed I have some problems with the heart, on top of the asthma which never left me since childhood days. I am now put in PES E9L9  I am not sure when I will be enlisted yet though.</p>
              <p>Anyone did the 4-week BMT for PES E? What do you do for BMT? What vocation will I be posted to? I know it will be clerical but where can I be posted to? I heard that band is impossible because there is marching involved :(</p>
              <p>Appreciate some light on this. Thanks!</p>

              <p>the new 4-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES E recruits. This programme will focus on, vocational training as well as National Education, SAF core values, regimentation and discipline.</p>
              <p>usually only clerical vocation is available for PES E and you can be posted to any one of the camps and bases since all of them each has an office for clerks to work.</p>

              <p>Don't worry, PES E9L9 is relaxing BMT and your vocations after your 4 week BMT will be either storeman or clerk.</p>
