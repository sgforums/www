              <p>Hi, im new here, </p>
              <p>i just got down graded to B2L3 for vasodepressor syncope. and my
              subsequent followup with the cardiologist confirmed that the
              condition is malignant and another CT scan showed that i have a
              ventricular septal defect that is 4mm wide. the specialist wrote a
              memo to the MO, do u think theres a chance for me to go down
              further? if not what are the vocations that are usually associated
              with B2L3? i am an OOC from SCS and i have no vocation yet. and i
              have 5 months to ORD</p>

              <p>You need to update the SAF on whatever medical matters. Not everything is for downgrading but is for the purpose of recording.</p>
              <p>You may need some special diet for the recovery period. It may cover some excuses.May be you have to eat congee for every meal, until you can eat solid food.</p>

              <p>Hello im enlisting in august under PES BP</p>
              <p>I told them i have history of visual hallucination, and the MO
              during the checkup said i would be sent for couselling/follow up
              with the sight MO in camp. When will this be done? Is it
              troublesome?</p>
              <p>Will this affect my PES status? Can i still get into airforce
              with PES B?</p>
              <p>I heard that education background is taken into account, does it
              mean if i have studied aerospace related course, i have a better
              chance of getting into airforce?</p>
              <p>Also, being a technician at airforce don't need to sign on

              <p>Im in reservist already. Just did my 1st ict weeks ago.</p>
              <p>Have been fighting acne (scalp, face and back) since secondary sch days. </p>
              <p>Excuse uniform, headwear - Have gotten several during army days as they are all severe. On specialist treatment then. Specialist even offered to put me on accutane treatment but i declined due to side effects.</p>
              <p>All have became better significantly with tons of scars after ord except back which is very acne prone even currently. Uniform wearing is okay but with LBV or load can worsen my back acne alot.</p>
              <p>Able to get excuse outfield perm or down pes ? Im PES A currently (HQ in combat unit) but still eligible for outfield.</p>
              <p>Right now, im waiting for my back acne to get better slowly after ict. Army have really destroyed my face and back and scalp with acne and scars.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, for severe acne problems, you may be able to downgrade to PES B1/ B2, coupled with some permanent/ temporary excuses from certain activities that worsen your condition. It all depends on <em>how</em> the specialist memo is written. Therefore, please request your hospital specialist to write as strongly-worded as possible.</p>
              <p>Please submit the hospital specialist memo to the camp doctor to
                                          assess and process.</p>
