              <p>hi just need some advise on my situation.<br> <br> <br> im pes E9L9 and completed 2 years of service. 
              but i disrupted to go
                                      studies and now have few more months left to 
              serve. im about to be
                                      downgraded to PES F. im ok with that since its 
              very disruptive to
                                      go back but im worried about future job 
              prospects. i have uni
                                      education (ntu/nus/smu) and come from top school
               and i have work
                                      experience too including internship at govt 
              linked places.
                                      ironically none of those places ever asked of my
               NS background
                                      then. just a small box asking for my status 
              which i usually tick
                                      deferred and write pes E9L9, or sometimes i 
              write exempted. no one
                                      even follows up on it and asks me whats wrong.<br> <br> <br> i saw some of the other postings and there are 
              ppl saying its
                                      impossible to get job etc. is this true or just 
              rumours? anyone
                                      knows of this happening first hand whereby 
              someone with PES F is
                                      rejected for a job due to med condition? i would
               think with so many
                                      foreigners around no one really goes into 
              details abt NS matters
                                      anymore. unless ur PES F is a very serious case.
               mine is actually
                                      due a form of anxiety disorder/social stress 
              disorder. its not
                                      severity of it but rather SAF environment is not
               suitable for me.
                                      anyone who's served NS would know why. some 
              advise will help.
                                      thanks.</p>
