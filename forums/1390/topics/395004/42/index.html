              Hi Guys, 
              
              I finally received my PES Status. I'm graded C9L3 due to my slip disc which I have a MRI to show for. 
              
              My only concern is that the notification stated "NIL" for excuses. 
              For my case, am I suppose to be excuse from anything or is this the norm? 
              Asking as I wish to get everything in black and white before I enter army. 
              
              Thanks for clarifying my doubts!

              <p>Hey guys, I recently downgraded to B2L2 perm due to past elbow injury. I've gotten a perm excuse for push up's and chin up. I'm currently in rifleman as my voc, would like to know if it's possible to change posting/revocate within the same via unit, do I contact S1 branch or talk to my commanders.</p>
              <p>I've also recently endorsed a memo regarding my asthmatic problems, did the EIA test,skin prick test and nitric oxide test, came out positive that I had exercise induced asthma and also allergy to dust and dust mites. But I heard from the MO that he could not ensure me a down pes confirmation to C9L3 unless my FEV1 was below 80percent which mine was slightly above it. But it was still sent to the MB for KIV and will most likely be out at the end of this month. My asthma has been getting from bad to worse since BMT days, recently I've gotten an asthma from anxiety attacks when being tekaned to FBO on and everything out downstairs given a short amount of time. Sudden attacks have caused me to feel tightness in breathing in the lungs and also hyperventilate after which cause a slight migrane after resting, felt the urge to vomit and felt giddy at the same time.</p>
              <p>My commanders told me that B2L2 is still fit as a rifleman whearea's my specilist wrote that I should be revocated if possible. The MO told me to talked to my commanders about my problems regarding revocation as it's not done by the them. As I'm currently on status, I do not do much physical activities but when it comes to punishments, I still have to fit in with the rest as one platoon. Need help regarding my condition as I've no idea what to do, it's either I stay as a status and sai kang for the rest of my NS life or something right?</p>

              <p><br>Your MO is correct to say that your request for a change in vocation (Revocation) is an administrative issue, that's why you must speak to your Company OC and S1 Manpower Officer/ Chief Clerk.<br><br>Meanwhile for the medical issue side, you may request for a MC to excuse you temporary for a few weeks from any activities that may cause exercise-induced asthma attack episode.</p>

              Hi, I'm wondering what my PES status would be. I am suffering from Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder since age of 7. I've panic attacks even when engaging in daily activities for about 4 years. I'll vomit at least twice a week to assuage the uneasiness and panic. I'm unable to do drill since age of 15 because I'll vomit everytime when I fall in, in the parade sqaure. 
              
              Coupled with asthma, I have not taken NATFA for 3 years. Asthma has also caused my panic attacks to be more intense too.

              Dear MO,
              
              I am a pes b nsman having my 4th ict this year.
              
              I am diagnose with bilateral plantar fanscitis. It is very painful to walk run wear boots. My specalist sent me for physio and tried insoles both doesnt work very well.
              
              My doctor gave me 6months cumulative excuses and a memo to recommend me a TEMP downgrade. 
              
              May I know my chances for a perm downgrade and what pes grade does my condition normally warrants.

              <p>Hi, im wondering what PES status i will get if im partially color blind. I have read some of the threads abt ppl having the same problem, but the answers they recieved are all very different, some say its a PES E str8, some say PES B/C... </p>
              <p>And I also have a rather serious allergy to dust/dust mites (still have it now) as well as allergy induced asthma since I was a child (though i haven't got any asthma attacks since secondary 2, so im not really sure if i still have it now (haven't gone for any checks since P5) o.O but i still wheeze occassionally when i get irritated) Btw, is it necessary to get a memo/proof from a doctor to prove your case, or will they actually test for allergy/asthma during the health check. Will this situation further downgrade my PES status?...Im hoping for a B to have a chance to get into OCS :) Also, im wondering if you will get exposed to alot of dust/dust mites during bmt at tekong?? if not, maybe i won't even bother to report that im allergic to dust mites.... Thanks a lot</p>
