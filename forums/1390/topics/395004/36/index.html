              <p>there is a reason why they never revocationalise you... Cos once they revocationalise you, they will have to find some vocation suitable for you and maybe have to send you on course (eg CQ course etc). so as to fit you into that new vocation and they might have to transfer you out.... and for those reservist, do you think you are willing to attend these course which may last one or two month?</p>
              <p>So for the higher command, they will just simply retain you as the same vocation/unit, but since you are C9L9, you will be excuse from the major exercise etc.... So when your buddies go chiong sua or live firing, you will most likely be sitting inside the office helping to do some paper work or helping out somewhere else, or helping in some admin job at range/live firing area etc... Just go back to ICT and tell your officers that you are now C9L9 and you will be excused from those training... So basically just idle in the camp or helping out in some admin job.. So even if you are still infantry soldier, you will not be joining the training etc...</p>
              <p>One of my platoon mates got Downgraded to Pes E perm (from Pes B) and he also never get revocationalised. He still report for the ICT but since he is Pes E, he is only helping in the admin job in the office most of the time... When we go for training, he sit inside office surf net, read newspaper etc... and everyday he got to go home...</p>

              <p>Hi, will appreciate it if anyone can help me with this.</p>
              <p>I am a final year poly student and i have been diagnosed with scoliosis when i was still in secondary school. So with my medical check up date coming nearer, i decided to go back to the hospital for another visit and have some new x-rays taken to see if there were any changes to my spine.</p>
              <p>1) The specialist gave me a letter stating that i had three scoliotic curves with a total Cobb Value of 33 degrees, is that serious and if so any idea what pes status will i be?</p>
              <p>2) Also, he also stated in the letter, recommending that i be downgraded and excused from strenous activities (eg. lifting heavy objects) as well as IPPT. How high are the chances of the doctor from the army agreeing with him?</p>

              <p>L9- Able to bear firearms and <strong>protect themselves, others and
                                      property</strong>. Can be deployed in Combat Support vocations in <strong>Main
                                      Support Area</strong>, and/or Combat Service Support vocations of <strong>Brigade HQ
                                      and above</strong>.</p>
              <p>Firstly, "Brigade HQ" is not a building in camp, it is a military concept. It may be a mobile forward command post, furthermore an entire town or location hosting a Brigade CP is called a Brigade HQ. A Main Support Area is of similar geographical scope.</p>
              <p>It is (supposedly) further rearwards, safer and moves less often than a Battalion HQ. L9s can be put on guard there and have no less chance of getting into firefights there in modern war.</p>
              <p>Secondly, a PES B is worth more than an L9 in war. It's fair for L9s to stand guard and let infantry rest.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, this is not a casualty-sensitive country. There is no need to minimize L9 deaths, since the people are stupid enough to be bluffed to accept anything up the rear end.</p>

              <p>Once a Pes status has been given, it is very hard to change. The adminstration involved is alot.The specialist's letter must be within 3 years in order to be valid.BUT, it will be your fault if you dont submit the medical information to them. So you must submit, depsite, there may be no change to your status.</p>
              <p>Most likely, the MO will just let you make the insole for free. And that's it. Unless, you have shown REAL damage in the ankles and knees (such as worn off, and tear).</p>
              <p>It is not like in the past, NSF with flat fleet is given pes C. Now, they let  you make the insole first means that you are "cured."</p>

              <p>Thank you for your opinion. But like I said above I do already have insoles made which are recent but they do not help. So wouldn't that be kinda redundant making new ones?</p>

              <p>Thank you for your opinion. But like I said above I do already
              have insoles made which are recent but they do not help. So
              wouldn't that be kinda redundant making new ones?</p>
              <p>I am going to get a more recent letter before I go back to CMPB.
              Not expecting pes C but maybe B2 with excuse from certain
              things.</p>
