              <p>yet to revocate, only recently got the excuse boots status, as
              for revocation, have yet to bring it up with S1...will check with
              MO....but off service, do you have any excuse status or perhaps
              what was the reason for your downgrade?</p>
              <p>During the reservist I had just last month ago, the regulars all
              commented how safety was a priority following the high profile
              deaths in the army, and MO are to permit all cases as
              genuine...which means that they want to remove the stigma of
              reporting sick due to even minor cases...commanders have also been
              ordered to task safety as number 1 priority. I think it is a step
              in the right direction considering how the older batches were
              treated...if you know what I mean...The regulars even commented
              that the saying among them is that Army is more like a child care
              center these days...</p>

              <p>I think revocation depends on your unit's operational needs. I
                  was downgraded 3 years back to C9L3. This year, I called my unit S1
                  to ask if it's possible to revocate me to a non-combat
                  vocation.</p>
              <p>She replied me that it is impossible for me to revocate. The
                  only solution now, according to her, is for me to inform the
                  commanders during in-pro that I am now C9L3 so they can give me
                  sedantry duties to do. </p>

              <p>For the last 2 years, my unit has been actively posting men with non-combat PES to other units within the formation / camp. I guess they are only choosing those who are trained in their vocations, e.g. medics, drivers, storemen, etc.</p>
              <p>Truth is I'm also the only few non-combat PES NSMen (other than HQ drivers, clerks) in my company, probably that's why they won't really be bothered.</p>

              <p>Hi eac,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hoping to get some opinions and advice from you and fellow forum users about my situation. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Previously in BMT, my allergic rhinitis started flaring up as I moved on to BMT phase. (I'm PES BP and there's two phases to BMT, the PTP phase followed by military training) I went to a polyclinic and was subsequently referred to the ENT specialist at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. After going through an allergy panel test, I was shown to have a pretty bad allergic reaction to dust, smoke, small pests I.e. dustmites and the like, as well as moderate to semi severe reaction to pollen and grass. I requested my specialist to write a memo as per directions to get a medical review. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Upon return to PTMC, I presented the relevant documents but the MO merely skimmed a look and told me he could do nothing for my condition saying that allergic rhinitis is a B1 class condition and he gave me an excuse smoky and dusty environment. This status too was disregarded by my commanders who pushed me through field training and field camp, which I completed with tremendous difficulty, sneezing every other few minutes. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In my new current vocation, my condition has taken a turn for the worse, with high humidity adding to my triggers. My condition now also causes giddiness, headaches, chest tightness and pain, and loss of focus. I still have my panel test results and the previously mentioned memo and am seriously hoping to be able to request a review and preferably downgrade my PES status as my condition interferes with training very badly. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Could you offer me any advice on my next course of actions? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you very much.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I've been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism this year and my first reservist is this week itself.</p>
              <p>My hyperthyroidism is permanent as the doctors told me I have to be on medication for the next few years.</p>
              <p>What would my PES status be? I've read similar cases online and they got a PES E straight.</p>
              <p>Also, while waiting for review, will they make me stick around and stay in camp? </p>
              <p>Thanks loads. </p>
