              <p>Hello people,</p>
              <p>I have a question.</p>
              <p>What are the chances of enlisting into mono intake for a poly dropout ( O level cert ) overweight enlistee ( BMI 31.4 , moderately obese ) but currently a PES D pending a heart checkup?<br><br>I got diagonised with depression and anxiety which i reported to the CMPB MO. Does this mean that i will kena PES E? No chance of holding the rifle? Any chance to go PES BP?<br><br>Mono intake obese enlistee got special training programme or train like normal with the rest? <br><br>Thank you</p>

              <p>As you are now PES D for the impending further tests, hence everything and anything is possible and tentative, so there is no definite answer. It is a guessing game for all with all the maybes and perhaps. </p>
              <p>Therefore, please get the confirmed and finalized PES before coming here to ask than to wait and play the guessing game. </p>
              <p>To expedite the process, please call the 24/7 NS hotline at 1800-3676767 to speak to a customer service officer to get it as soon as possible. </p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>i was just wondering i had already done my medical checkup long ago and everything was fine. However, i was diagnosed with psoriasis (a skin condition) recently and i wondered if this would affect my PES status so i went to cmpb today to get a re check up. The affected areas are my face, hairline, back, ears and chest. When i went there the doctors report said it was less than 20% of my body. However, this condition really acts up when i am under the sun as it gets very itchy for me to bear. The MO at CMPB told me to get a back check up at a later date but did not tell me anything about my skin condition. Has he overlooked the skin condition? Because i really cannot tank when i am under the sun so i usually do my workouts at night. Do you guys have any advice for me? Thank you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: my skin condition does not allow me to get any cuts or bruises, as when i do it gets easily infected at those areas. Please help. Thanks</p>

              <p>Hi, I enlisted in May this year under the enhanced leadership batch. I have been having a knee condition since birth where i have an extra bone on my knee which hurts when I do physical activities and place stress on the knee. I have been tanking the pain for quite a few years and didn't report my condition to CMPB during my medical screening because I was interested in entering command school. Hence I enlisted as pes b1 l1. However it has been getting bigger and worse over the past 1-2 years so i told my mo during bmt and I was just recently placed out of course and posted out as a clerk.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I want to down pes because my condition doesn't allow me to participate in any form of physical activity since the bone is quite painful. I was just wondering if I will down pes to pes e because of this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So I have 2 questions</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1)Will I likely down pes to pes e, and if so, how should i go about doing it?</p>
              <p>2) I'm planning to go for surgery probably next year, so usually how long mc will I be given to recover?</p>

              <p>Hi all, I am a NSman/ reservist. <br><br>Just a sharing session here... <br><br>Lesson learnt is that even if you have a hospital specialist memo for any medical condition, it is not always a guarantee that you will PES review due to pending the general PES directive book. The MO doctors apparently have slight variation of standards to decide if to put the case statement up for Medical Board meetings. <br><br>So here goes my story: <br><br>I get the fainting/ dizzy spells, always. I did not ever passed NAPFA in schools or IPPT in NS as I will gonna puke if I ever over-exert myself during 1.6km run during primary school and 2.4km in post-primary schools thereafter. In some cases, I remembered that I had even blacked out. Blacking out were not fun. It's not like sleeping. You see everything turn monochrome, black/ white, then blurred vision out. It's like you won't feel anything, so it's more scary than you can imagine. <br><br>I had always thought that maybe this was because I wasn't fit enough due to poor physique or heat exhaustion kind. As I didn't have money to consult a hospital specialist before NS enlistment, I was assigned PES B2L3 due to the pre-existing conditions of lazy eye plus excuse rifle range. I served my NS and ORD. I learnt a lot from NS, even though I probably didn't really enjoy it much of the time.</p>
              <p>But while serving NS, I did blacked out in camp after PT. After evacuation, the MO issued me 6 months light duty (Att B) and only then was I referred to a public hospital specialist. Apparently, there is something going on with my blood pressure and blood circulation system. It's like low blood pressure kind, I guessed. So the specialist gave me a memo noting to specifically excuse me from "prolonged standing" activities and to "squat if I feel giddy". Next, I gave the memo to the camp MO and he gave me a 84 days' MC. <br><br>When going to ORD that time, because I never pass IPPT and so there goes my 3SG NS rank. Given that I won't ever pass IPPT unless I gradually and progressively train myself to a healthy, wellness and fitness conditioning/ optimal state and also that I don't really want to go for any IPPT/ RT/ IPT after I ORD to transit to a NSman/ reservist status, I went to submit the specialist memo again during the ORD FFI clearance just prior to ORD administrative paperwork. But alas, the MO reply given was, "Somehow, according to the PES directory book, it's actually not so medically enough to warrant a PES downgrade." <br><br>I am very sure that during IPPT /RT/ IPT, the medical centre is always on standby with at least 1 x safety ambulance, 1 x MO and a team of medics. Why are the MO doctors so law-by-law according to the PES directory book for Medical Board meetings?</p>

              <p><em>Extract from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/nsmen"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">www.mindef.gov.sg/nsmen</span></span></a>:</em><br> <span style="color: #008000;">It is crucial that you update your NS
              HRCs if you develop a new medical condition or if an existing
              medical condition has worsened, which may affect your ICT
              performance. This is so that arrangements will be made for you to
              attend a medical review at the SAF medical centre to assess your
              fitness condition for NS.<br> <br> You <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MUST</span></em> bring along all your investigation results and memorandums from
              your external physician or specialist during your medical review.
              You may be given a medical certificate for ICT deferment, be
              scheduled for a medical board to downgrade you if your medical
              condition is significant, or be referred to a restructured hospital
              for further examination depending on the outcome of your medical
              review.<br> <br> If your medical condition is deemed suited for ICT participation by
              the medical officer, you will then be allowed to attend
              ICT.</span></p>

              <p>Is there any reason why you are asking me to refer to the 'Service Injury in BMT' link? What are the pointers you might want me to take note and look out for?</p>
