              <p>Hi there, </p>
              <p>This is my first time using this forum, hopefully I'm posting in the correct place.</p>
              <p>Currently I'm in pes BP, took my medical check up at April. I was over weight by 3-4kg and they advice me to lose some weight. I took their advice and manage to lose those 3-4kg but was busy to make my way down and retake my weight. I'm going to enlist on 28 Nov, so is it worth to retake my weight and change my pes now? As I heard many different version of stories, some saying pes BP is normal while others saying that it's bad. Hopefully you guys could provide me an accurate version. </p>
              <p>Thanks. </p>

              <p><br>Well, your PES <em>should</em> remain unchanged.<br><br>When your PES is due expiry, you will be called back to medical centre for PES review.</p>
              <p>And later, even if you have ORD already, you will be called back to camp for a 1-day medical review at the medical centre for PES review. This is covered with a SAF100 notice (ICT) issued by the camp.</p>
              <p><strong>Therefore, you are strongly recommended to submit the hospital memo ASAP before ORD if you really want to ORD in peace.</strong></p>

              <p>Hi there. I have posted here. I had submitted my letters from the orthopaedic doctor as well as the psychiatrist a few months ago. I was told to wait for medical board. I opted for board in presence but ... here's what happened ... (sorry for the long post...)</p>
              <p>Recently, I called up my NS unit's medical centre and I asked the medic on the phone whether a date has been fixed for my medical board. He said I have been medical boarded already and a new PES status has been given. That is puzzling cos i thought i had opted for board in presence n no one had informed me. I asked for details, "Was the medical board just for my back injury or does it include my letter from the psychiatrist?" The medic said it was for my back injury. I asked when will my other memo from my psychiatrist be handled for medical board. He said, "You have to call the medical board IC next week and ask him. He's not around today"</p>
              <p>I called a week later. The medical board IC answered the phone and I asked abt my medical board. He took down my particulars and said confidently , "You have already been boarded with a new PES status. That is final already." I told him, "But when I called last week, another medic told me that medical board which is over is just for my back injury, and not my other memo from the psychiatrist."</p>
              <p>He replied, sounding shocked and a little louder, "Who told you that?!" I told him I dunno the medic's name. After he checked my documents again, he changed his tone and sounded more eager to please, "Sometimes we have backlog of medical board appts and so things may get delayed... " To cut the long story short, he said the earliest possible medical board / appt with the SAF specialist for my psychiatrist's memo is probably in Jan.</p>
              <p>So.... what should I do now? The medical board IC's answer seem to show some things are not done right and my letter from the psychiatrist has not been handled for more than 3 months.. Should I just wait to see if he will really fix up an appt for my medical board/review by the SAF specialists? :S</p>

                      for board in presence n no one had informed me. I asked for
                      details, "Was the medical board just for my back injury or does it
                      include my letter from the psychiatrist?" The medic said it
                      was for my back injury. I asked when will my other memo from my
                      psychiatrist be handled for medical board. He said, "You have to
                      call the medical board IC next week and ask him. He's not around
                      today"</p>
              <p>I called a week later. The medical board IC answered the phone
                      and I asked abt my medical board. He took down my particulars and
                      said confidently , "You have already been boarded with a new PES
                      status. That is final already." I told him, "But when I called last
                      week, another medic told me that medical board which is over is
                      just for my back injury, and not my other memo from the
                      psychiatrist."</p>
              <p>He replied, sounding shocked and a little louder, "Who told you
                      that?!" I told him I dunno the medic's name. After he checked my
                      documents again, he changed his tone and sounded more eager to
                      please, "Sometimes we have backlog of medical board appts and so
                      things may get delayed... " To cut the long story short, he said
                      the earliest possible medical board / appt with the SAF specialist
                      for my psychiatrist's memo is probably in Jan.</p>
              <p>So.... what should I do now? The medical board IC's answer seem
                      to show some things are not done right and my letter from the
                      psychiatrist has not been handled for more than 3 months.. Should I
                      just wait to see if he will really fix up an appt for my medical
                      board/review by the SAF specialists? :S</p>

              <p>I see. Thanks for the quick reply!</p>
              <p>In the first place, it was odd that they boarded me quietly for my back injury and did not tell me anything though I had given time my address etc to keep me informed of medical board results... . When I log in to ns.sg then i see my newer current PES status reflected there...</p>
              <p>Anyway, I do have my NS unit's main email address. I do know that ns.sg takes a few weeks to process a request to my NS unit and a direct email to the NS unit can be sent much faster... . But i dunno if the NS unit can do anything abt the delay in the medical centre. So ... I guess it is still better to inform ns.sg first.</p>

              <p>I have posted here before abt my medical board problems. Months ago, I was boarded for a slipped disc problem with PES C9L9 and excuse heavy load permanently. After my last medical board with my memo from the psychiatrist, I have been boarded PES E9L9 permanently. </p>
              <p>Then I notice that the "excuse heavy load" permanently has disappeared from my status in the ns.sg website. With my latest PES E9L9, does that mean I dun need the "excuse heavy load" medical excuse?</p>

              <p>Oh. I have been a supply supervisor (CQMS) with a 3SG rank since my NSF days. That would be a problem.</p>
              <p>Among a few problems, my psychiatrist has certified me as OCD, which can cause me to have extreme anxiety with stores, filling up forms, locks, switches, etc. The OCD condition is already affecting my daily life so I am concerned about how I can survive my ICT with the rituals and obsessions I need to do when handling locks, filling up of forms, switches, etc. My certified slipped disc doesn't really help too. </p>
              <p>I have been reading the past posts of this forum thread of those with PES E9L9. Someone advised them to request for post out. Someone else advised them to ask for revocate. As for myself, I have been frustrated and distressed with the way I had to write multiple emails to my NSHRC just for a chance to speak with my NS unit's CO during a NS briefing. I also had to endure some seriously ridiculous admin lapse just for the chance to be put on medical board. It seems that the active personnel of the call-up unit/NS unit are unsure of how to handle my case properly...</p>
              <p>I have questions to ask... though I know they may sound rather noob, but I feel unsure and would rather ask them:</p>
              <p>Can anyone advise on the outcome if I ask my NSHRC for post out or revocate? With the admin lapses i had to endure with my NS camp, does sending my request to post out / revocate to ns.sg work better? With my 3SG rank, do people in ICT look at you differently and expect more even though I am PES E9L9?</p>

              <p>Hi all I do have some queries and hopefully someone could enlighten me</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firsty, while PES A states that one is fit for all vocations and PES B is for most, which are the vocations that PES B personnel are actually not allowed to go? I'm very sure its not commando since I'm a PES B cdo having just ord.</p>
              <p>Next, is it possible for individuals to upgrade from PES B to PES A? For example, one may wanna be a regular so he or she go for the check up. Supposedly he's a pes B, can he upgrade to PES A although the difference is not much?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>THANKS!</p>
