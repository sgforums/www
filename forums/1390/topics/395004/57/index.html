              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>My son is a pre-enlistee graded B1L1, and just receive notice to report for enlistment on 11Dec (PTP BMT). Recently he consulted an orthopedist for suspected shoulder injury and the specialist memo said that clinical exam showed positive O'Brien's test, suspected SLAP tear and recommended MRI to further investigate. My son will be bringing the specialist memo to see the MO at CMPB tomorrow. I have a couple of questions on behalf of my son</p>
              <p>1) If MO recommends MRI investigation, will my son's PES be temporarily changed to D pending the MRI results?</p>
              <p>2) if no change of PES, and if MRI appointment is after the original scheduled enlistment date! will CMPB change the enlistment date?</p>
              <p>3) is it better for him to go to private specialist to get MRI scan first, then see the MO with the MRI results?</p>
              <p>4) assuming SLAP tear is confirmed, will his PES be downgraded?</p>
              <p>As my son's BMT is less than 2 months away and my ultimate concern is that he does not go into BMT with possible shoulder injury /risk of further injury, would very much appreciate if EAC or some others with experience of CMPB process can help answer the above questions. Thanks,</p>

              <p><em>Please note that pre-enlistees can only be assigned to an enlistment intake after being 
                          certified medically fit for a PES for enlistment at the pre-enlistment medical 
                          screening. </em></p>

              <p><strong>What is Medical Referral Management System (MRS)?</strong><br>        <br>The Medical Referral Management System or MRS is designed for the pre-enlistee to perform some of the medical services prior to the completion of his medical investigation. In particular, the pre-enlistee can update the outcome of his medical appointment, apply for a Letter Of Identity (LOI), be reminded of any outstanding actions that have to be undertaken by the pre-enlistee and find out his latest PES status.<br><strong><br>What is a Letter Of Identity (LOI)?</strong><br>        <br>It is a form that is issued to the pre-enlistee for every appointment. Upon presentation to the hospital, it would waive payment up to the point of diagnosis. It is to note that any appointment made for purposes of treatment would NOT be paid for and shall be borne by the pre-enlistee.<br><br><strong>What is a Further Reporting Order (FRO)?</strong><br>        <br>The pre-enlistee is to note that under the Enlistment Act, specified in the FRO, he is obliged to attend all appointment as required. Under no circumstances is he to default any appointment. <br><br>The FRO also serves as a reminder to the pre-enlistee the details to his medical appointment and specify the documents that are issued to him or important instructions that he is to take note of.<br><br><strong>What is a Progress Report on Patient's Medical Status (PR)?</strong><br>        <br>This form when completed by the attending doctor at the hospital and accurately transcribed onto the electronic version on MRS would facilitate MCC in deciding if the pre-enlistee has completed his hospital medical appointments.</p>
              <p><strong>I have been referred to the hospital after being seen by the Medical Officers at Medical Classification Centre. What are the things that I have to take note of?</strong></p>
              <p>You are expected to be punctual and attend your appointment. The Letter Of Identity (LOI) is to be presented at the point of registration and Referral Letter must be submitted to the attending doctor. The doctor is to complete the Progress Report on Patient's Medical Status (PR) and hand it back to you after every consultation.<br>Please refer to the Further Reporting Order (FRO) for a list of other documents that you have to bring to the hospital.<br><br><strong>I have attended my hospital medical appointment. What do I have to do next?</strong><br>        <br>You are to log onto you MRS account and validate the LOI (confirm the attendance of your medical appointment). You can do so by either clicking the "Validate LOI" button on the menu bar or the row specifying the appointment that you are going to confirm. <br><br><strong>What am I to do with the Progress Report on Patient's Medical Status (PR)?</strong><br><br>For every follow-up appointment, you would be issued with a Progress Report through MRS. You are to bring with you to the hospital appointment and get the attending doctor to complete. You are to translate this onto the PR that is available in MRS before you can apply for a new LOI (if necessary).<br><br><strong>I have another hospital appointment to attend. Can I apply for a new Letter Of Identity (LOI)?</strong><br>        <br>Yes you can apply provided the appointment is only for investigations up to the point of diagnosis. The LOI is not applicable for any appointment that allows you to seek treatment. <br><br>To apply for a LOI, you must first complete the Progress Report on Patient's Medical Status. <br><br>MCC reserves the right not to pay for any of your appointment should it be found to be for other causes other than for investigative purposes.<br><br><strong>What do I have to bring when I attend my hospital appointment?</strong><br>        <br>After you have successfully applied for your LOI, the system would generate a list of documents for you to print. Of these, you are to bring with you the Letter Of Identity (LOI), and Progress Report on Patient's Medical Status (PR). <br><br>The LOI is to be presented to the hospital at the point of registration. The PR is to be completed by the attending doctor and handed back to you.<br><br><strong>I have completed all hospital appointments and MRS informed me that MCC would request for medical report from the (hospital) doctor and review my medical status. I am to login in 2 months time to check on my final PES status. Why does it take so long?</strong><br>        <br>MCC would need to request for the medical report on your behalf from the hospital. This would take some time, including time for MCC medical officer to review the report and determine if the investigations done would affect the final outcome of your condition and PES status.<br><strong><br>I have been referred by MCC to the hospital for medical investigation(s). Who would be paying for the hospital expenses?</strong><br>        <br>The initial referral would be made by MCC. You are required to update the outcome of your appointment and apply for a new LOI through MRS. This LOI, when produced at the hospital, would waive all medical expenses for you up to the point of diagnosis. The hospitals would then bill MCC directly for payment of your appointment.<br><br>MCC reserved the right not to pay / reimburse you for your medical expenses if you are found to have not updated your status via MRS or referral is not made for the conditions that you have undergone investigations/ treatment.<br><br>This would be considered on a case-by-case basis.<br><strong><br>What should I do if I have developed new medical conditions after I have been assigned a PES status?</strong><br>        <br>You can request to see the medical officers at MCC. To facilitate them in further understanding your medical condition, you are to produce any medical report that would provide further insight to your condition.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Dear Dr eac,</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">I am currently enlisted in the PTP batch. Before enlistment at the CMPB MCC, I was being referred to SGH specialist (last asthma attack back in sec 4). At the review, I took the spirometry test and was prescribed Salbutamol inhaler and graded PES B1L1.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">However, first week into enlistment, I started having shortness of breath &amp; tight chest while doing PT, quick march with field pack or running around with SBO. On most occasions, I experienced numbness throughout my body &amp; giddyness. I reported my condition to the PTMC MO and was given a month of light duties &amp; specialist review at SGH again. The review will be on the upcoming week and I do have 2 questions in mind:  </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">(1) What to request / expect at the specialist review? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">(2) Will I get down PES or OOT? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Thank you for taking time to read this, much appreciated.</span></p>

              <p>By June 2013, the <em>National Electronic Health Record (NEHR)</em> system will be implemented in all public hospitals, specialist centres,
               polyclinics, as well as some community hospitals, nursing homes, and 
              general practitioners.</p>
              <p>We are now at the next phase of implementation to
               rollout more functionalities to more healthcare providers. Access to NEHR has also been provided
               to the Agency for Integrated Care, some GPs, and long term care 
              providers, with more nursing homes to follow.</p>
              <p>Providers can share information such as patient diagnosis, lab 
              results, medications, and discharge summaries. MOH will next work 
              towards enriching the system’s functionalities, including case 
              management and shared care plans.  With information shared across 
              providers, we will have a system that is better connected, better 
              coordinated, and better able to provide good care to each and every 
              patient.</p>

              <p>1. At present, I find myself unfit to carry on my daily life, let alone ICT.</p>
              <p>2. Given my condition, what will I be doing what I normally do in ICT? </p>
              <p>3. As I've been roll over from my previous unit due to work overseas, I'm apprehensive about what my new unit will assign me since they are not aware of my limitations.</p>
              <p>Thank you for your constant guide towards our questions towards medical issues in the army. As NSMen we are often very unsure what to do with our medical issues especially since we are all getting on in age.</p>

              <p><br>1. On the very 1st day of ICT, you are to report sick to show the MO the memo to get an excuse chit (MC) for the ICT period. For example, Att B (Fit for Light Duties only) throughout the ICT period.</p>
              <p>2. It is strongly recommended/ advisable to sound out (voice out) to the officer-in-charge (OIC). You can speak to him one-to-one in private/ confidential. If he is not helpful, next is to just follow the chain of command to the next higher officer.</p>

              <p>The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) is a 2,000-bed acute tertiary
              psychiatric hospital situated on a 25-hectare campus at
              Buangkok Green Medical Park. Set amidst serene surroundings,
              IMH offers a comprehensive range of psychiatric, rehabilitative and
              counselling services for children, adolescents, adults, and the
              elderly.</p>
              <p>IMH’s tradition of care started in 1928. We were the first
              mental hospital in Singapore, starting with some 1,000 patients.
              Since then, many advances have been made in treatment, training,
              and research. Our treatment integrates evidence-based therapies,
              supported by the departments of clinical psychology, nursing,
              occupational therapy, and medical social work, to provide holistic
              care for our patients. IMH is equipped with modern facilities, with
              50 wards for inpatients and seven Specialist Outpatient
              Clinics.</p>
              <p>IMH was the first mental health institution in Asia to receive
              the Joint Commission International Accreditation in 2005, a highly
              coveted international accreditation for healthcare
              organisations. </p>
              <p>Over the years, IMH has gained a reputation for quality
              research. In 2008, the Ministry of Health,
              Singapore, entrusted IMH with a S$25 million research
              grant to implement translational and clinical research into the
              causes of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.</p>
              <p>IMH also plays a key role in training the next generation of
              mental health professionals in Singapore. We train psychiatrists
              and mental health professionals through the NHG-AHPL Residency
              Programme for psychiatry and through collaborations with the local
              tertiary institutions.</p>

              <p><strong>What is Medical Referral Management System
              (MRS)?</strong><br>        <br> The Medical Referral Management System or MRS is designed for the
              pre-enlistee to perform some of the medical services prior to the
              completion of his medical investigation. In particular, the
              pre-enlistee can update the outcome of his medical appointment,
              apply for a Letter Of Identity (LOI), be reminded of any
              outstanding actions that have to be undertaken by the pre-enlistee
              and find out his latest PES status.<br> <strong><br> What is a Letter Of Identity (LOI)?</strong><br>        <br> It is a form that is issued to the pre-enlistee for every
              appointment. Upon presentation to the hospital, it would waive
              payment up to the point of diagnosis. It is to note that any
              appointment made for purposes of treatment would NOT be paid for
              and shall be borne by the pre-enlistee.<br> <br> <strong>What is a Further Reporting Order (FRO)?</strong><br>        <br> The pre-enlistee is to note that under the Enlistment Act,
              specified in the FRO, he is obliged to attend all appointment as
              required. Under no circumstances is he to default any
              appointment.<br> <br> The FRO also serves as a reminder to the pre-enlistee the details
              to his medical appointment and specify the documents that are
              issued to him or important instructions that he is to take note
              of.<br> <br> <strong>What is a Progress Report on Patient's Medical Status
              (PR)?</strong><br>        <br> This form when completed by the attending doctor at the hospital
              and accurately transcribed onto the electronic version on MRS would
              facilitate MCC in deciding if the pre-enlistee has completed his
              hospital medical appointments.</p>
              <p><strong>I have been referred to the hospital after being seen by
              the Medical Officers at Medical Classification Centre. What are the
              things that I have to take note of?</strong></p>
              <p>You are expected to be punctual and attend your appointment. The
              Letter Of Identity (LOI) is to be presented at the point of
              registration and Referral Letter must be submitted to the attending
              doctor. The doctor is to complete the Progress Report on Patient's
              Medical Status (PR) and hand it back to you after every
              consultation.<br> Please refer to the Further Reporting Order (FRO) for a list of
              other documents that you have to bring to the hospital.<br> <br> <strong>I have attended my hospital medical appointment. What do I
              have to do next?</strong><br>        <br> You are to log onto you MRS account and validate the LOI (confirm
              the attendance of your medical appointment). You can do so by
              either clicking the "Validate LOI" button on the menu bar or the
              row specifying the appointment that you are going to confirm.<br> <br> <strong>What am I to do with the Progress Report on Patient's
              Medical Status (PR)?</strong><br> <br> For every follow-up appointment, you would be issued with a
              Progress Report through MRS. You are to bring with you to the
              hospital appointment and get the attending doctor to complete. You
              are to translate this onto the PR that is available in MRS before
              you can apply for a new LOI (if necessary).<br> <br> <strong>I have another hospital appointment to attend. Can I apply
              for a new Letter Of Identity (LOI)?</strong><br>        <br> Yes you can apply provided the appointment is only for
              investigations up to the point of diagnosis. The LOI is not
              applicable for any appointment that allows you to seek
              treatment.<br> <br> To apply for a LOI, you must first complete the Progress Report on
              Patient's Medical Status.<br> <br> MCC reserves the right not to pay for any of your appointment
              should it be found to be for other causes other than for
              investigative purposes.<br> <br> <strong>What do I have to bring when I attend my hospital
              appointment?</strong><br>        <br> After you have successfully applied for your LOI, the system would
              generate a list of documents for you to print. Of these, you are to
              bring with you the Letter Of Identity (LOI), and Progress Report on
              Patient's Medical Status (PR).<br> <br> The LOI is to be presented to the hospital at the point of
              registration. The PR is to be completed by the attending doctor and
              handed back to you.<br> <br> <strong>I have completed all hospital appointments and MRS informed
              me that MCC would request for medical report from the (hospital)
              doctor and review my medical status. I am to login in 2 months time
              to check on my final PES status. Why does it take so
              long?</strong><br>        <br> MCC would need to request for the medical report on your behalf
              from the hospital. This would take some time, including time for
              MCC medical officer to review the report and determine if the
              investigations done would affect the final outcome of your
              condition and PES status.<br> <strong><br> I have been referred by MCC to the hospital for medical
              investigation(s). Who would be paying for the hospital
              expenses?</strong><br>        <br> The initial referral would be made by MCC. You are required to
              update the outcome of your appointment and apply for a new LOI
              through MRS. This LOI, when produced at the hospital, would waive
              all medical expenses for you up to the point of diagnosis. The
              hospitals would then bill MCC directly for payment of your
              appointment.<br> <br> MCC reserved the right not to pay / reimburse you for your medical
              expenses if you are found to have not updated your status via MRS
              or referral is not made for the conditions that you have undergone
              investigations/ treatment.<br> <br> This would be considered on a case-by-case basis.<br> <strong><br> What should I do if I have developed new medical conditions after I
              have been assigned a PES status?</strong><br>        <br> You can request to see the medical officers at MCC. To facilitate
              them in further understanding your medical condition, you are to
              produce any medical report that would provide further insight to
              your condition.</p>
              <p><strong>What are the types of potential medical appointments
              that I may have to go?</strong><br>        <br> There are 2 types of medical appointments that are available to
              you.<br> <br> Internal medical appointment refers to those that you have to MCC
              to complete your investigations.<br> <br> External medical appointment refers to those that you have to
              complete your investigations at a location other than MCC. They are
              usually done at the (restructured) hospitals or Military Medical
              Institute (MMI).</p>

              <p>Good day, I was previously diagnosed with Osgood Schlatter Disease (OSD) by the MO in tekong and was downgraded to PES C2L2 with perm excuse RMJ. </p>

              <p>Is this because my down PES application was not filed in with a specialist letter or does the severeness of my condition does not warrant for the PES status and excuse. </p>
