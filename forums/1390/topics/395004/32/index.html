              Need some help guys.
              
              I'm going in Aug 3 8.45 am. 9-week MODIFIED basic military training.
              
              But I'm confused. My PES status is PES B1 L1. And I haven't pass NAPFA. My friend said that I'm suppose to go to PTP batch. Did they got it correct? or they messed up? Will they push me to the PTP batch which I heard is in September. If not, it's next week already..
              
              At my first Medical Checkup I declared a minor thing and they gave me PES B2 L2. Then they asked me to come for another medical checkup and then they graded me as PES B1 L1.
              
              So if I'm B1 L1, I'm supposed to go for PTP batch right? coz i Havent pass my NAPFA. 
              
              I'm confused uh. Need someone to clarify for me before I call. I just noticed it recently. Didn't read the letter since the first time I saw it few months ago.

              <p>The point is this shoulder injury is like flu, fever, twisted ankle. In medical point of view, you are supposed to go for physo, then they somehow 'cure' you and you recovered as per normal before the injury.(Back to Pes B)</p>
              <p>So you should get a home MC for like 3 months after the injury/operations. Then later excuse ALL upper limb activities (include typing) for 1 year. Then continued to excuse for another 5 years until it is recovered. Meanwhile get "cured" by  physo.</p>
              <p>Shoulder injury/dislocation is usually Pes B2 (previous C1) L1/2/3 excuse IPPT chin up. You can get perm excuse upper limb activities, heavy load and overhead limb activites (no grenades).</p>
              <p>Tips: get referred to neurologist to see if there are any limb weakness. Usually, certain trauma may also damage the "strength" and "agility" of the limb.</p>

              <p>Runner's knee is very common, very hard to downgrade. You might just get an excuse RMJ for 3 months and that's it. You are expected to be "cured" by physio therapy in the meantime. Cose runner's knee can be recovered, like flu and fever.</p>

              <p>usually is confirmed excuse guard duty as well.<br>but let's say if your superior/ CSM make noise, just show them the excuse letter where you will get it a few weeks later by the medical centre. after the medical board day, just walk in to the medical centre and ask the counter medic to print one for you.</p>
              <p>since your case is clear cut, the MO just need to submit your application to the medical board for a simple approval process can already.</p>

              It has to be approved by medical board.
              
              Did he excused you from firearms and guard duty as well?
              
              I don't think any depressed people should handle firearms.

                                  <p>Sorry new here, but in april this year, i went for to see the MO
                  and after seeing my doc's letter, he told me downgrade me to E8L9.
                  But up to now, i check my status still not updated. i ask my unit
                  why they say the medical centre still trying to arrange for me a
                  medical board. freaking 4 months plus already. </p>
                  <p>Now my question is what the heck is E8L9 and i have an ICT
                  coming up. Go back and do what? Any bros can help me with this
                  question?</p>

                  Army really screwed up organisation. 4 months havent approve medical board.
              
              You tell ur unit u are pending medical downpes so ICT be clerk/storeman.

              <p>It is weird. C2L9 should not go for ICT at all in the first place. </p>
              <p>L9 - Suitable for peacetime sedentary duties at bases. Sedentary means no physical activities at all. This means only clerk work is allowed. Even storemen should not be deployed with L9. At bases, means no outfield at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not fit for operational duties even in Bases. Operational duties refer to ops.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What is your vocation? SAF really ask you to back camp to staple paper? You should check with SAF that they deployed you correctly in the first place. </p>

              <p>You should email to contact@ns.sg to ask. If they have deployed you correctly in the first place. It sounds weird, but under the mindef directives, it is YOU who volunteered for NS. And it is not up to them to check out what you are fit to do. So your boss may not even knew that you are Pes XX so and so. His concern is how to deploy his men only for exercise.</p>

              As long as you have specialist memo, they will review your case.
              
              If haven't recover then perm PES. 
              
              You should get a memo fast and give to the MO in camp during your medical appointment with him.

              <p>Hi, I am a singaporean currently studying in an overseas boarding school. I have done my medical check up and will be back by mid november to begins my national service. I have so far been graded as B1L1 and was wondering if it was possible to be upgraded to PES A. I figured that since I am quite into sports and having to spend 2 years in the army, I might as well make the most out of it and aspire to be placed in a physically demanding vocation. </p>
              <p>I figured I was put into B1L1 either because I'm classified as 'mildly obese' (170cm, 75-80kg) or because of my eyesight (3.75, 3.25). Could anyone clarify why I was classed as B1L1 and if it is possible for me to be upgraded to PES A? I would also like to know if it was possible to enter OCS being B1L1. Thanks</p>

                  <p>in short, PES A &amp; B are eligible for command schools (OCS/
                  SCS), <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>provided
                  if</strong></em></span> selected and recommended by the BMT
                  officer-in-charge.</p>
                  <p>generally speaking, both PES A and B are no difference at
                  all.<br>
                  PES is medically fit; physically fit is another thing
                  altogether.<br>
                  so train up, lose weight, trim up.</p>

              1) One question is whether a PES B2 (liable for IPPT) can get discount if he passes, since if he fails there is no PTP for him.
              
              2) PTP get 17 weeks BMT and obese get 19 weeks BMT- another question is whether PTP get a 2 week discount or if their service is still 2 years in total.
              
              Eg I was a PTP. I enlisted 2 months earlier but since PTP was 6 weeks, I got 2 weeks disruption between my PTP and BMT.
              
              3) PES C and E are treated the same- 2 years total regardless of length of BMT.

              <p>I was initially enlisted with a PES of E9L9 Temp 6 months.</p>
              <p>And I managed to siam the review till this week (17 months after enlistment and the start of my PES E9L9), when my S1 sent a mail to my direct superior, asking them to make sure I go for my review.</p>
              <p>So no choice, I went for review with my already-prepared doc's memo. Then the MO was quite friendly, chatted with me, then read his bible, then entered "MBIA PES E1L9 PERM blah blah blah" into the system and then got me to sign the MB form.</p>
              <p>Here are my questions:</p>
              <p>1. When is the MB conducted every month?</p>
              <p>2. Usually will the MB approve the PES recommended by the MO for most of time?</p>
              <p>3. Since I am technically up-pes-ed from E9 to E1, will there be any difference? I'm assuming since both are E, there are no difference since I'm an ASA.</p>
