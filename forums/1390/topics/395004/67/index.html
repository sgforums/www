                  sustained an injury during your NS training, it may be considered
                  as attributable to service only when service is the cause of
                  injury. If you sustained an injury during ICT, you are required to
                  report immediately to your unit’s Medical Officer and unit S1. This
                  is so that your unit can arrange to attend to your injury, and
                  document your injury sustained in your medical docket.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"> <br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"> Before MINDEF determines that an injury is attributable to service,
                  you are responsible for bearing all medical expenses. Treatment for
                  your injury must be sought at government or restructured hospitals
                  at your eligible ward and referred to by a government or SAF
                  Medical Officer.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"> <br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"> In the case of permanent disablement due to service injury, a
                  medical board will be convened. Eligibility for disability
                  compensation will be based on the degree of residual permanent
                  disability as endorsed by the SAF Medical Board.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"> <br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"> If your service injury requires continuous medical or
                  hospitalisation leave beyond your ICT period, you are eligible for
                  a stepped-down compensation as a form of ex-gratia payment.
                  Compensation will be based on your civilian pay or an equivalent
                  regular serviceman’s pay (whichever is higher) if you do not
                  receive any income from your employers. This ex-gratia payment is
                  compensation for your loss of income during this period. Payment
                  will cease when you are no longer on medical/hospitalisation leave
                  or when disability compensation is paid, whichever is
                  earlier.</span></p>

                  serviceman make a claim for the medical costs incurred for service
                  injury?</strong><br> <br> The PMC (Personnel Management Centre) will issue all serviceman
                  with the SI (Service Injury) Card if their injuries have been
                  approved as attributable to service by the Pensions / Awards
                  Officer. The serviceman must produce this card to be eligible for
                  fully-subsidised medical treatment at the government / restructured
                  hospitals.<br> <br> If the SI Card is not produced when seeking treatment, the
                  serviceman will have to pay for all the medical cost first and seek
                  reimbursement via the respective PMCs with the following
                  documents:<br> <br> a. the original medical bills and payment receipts<br> <br> b. a memorandum from the attending doctor to prove that the
                  treatment received was for his service injury.<br> <br> The serviceman is required to notify his PMC immediately when he
                  loses his SI Card. There will be an administrative charge of $15
                  for each replacement of lost or defaced SI Card. He will need to
                  make the payment via MINDEF Cashier / Internet and submit the
                  receipt to the unit PMC before he will be issued a new SI
                  Card.<br> <br> While waiting for the SI Card to be issued or replaced, the
                  serviceman may approach the respective PMCs for the issuance of the
                  SI Memo (a temporary identification document) for the
                  fully-subsidised medical treatment.</span></p>

              <h2>NS BMT Enlistment schedule</h2>
              <p>Pre-enlistees will be required to complete pre-enlistment
                  procedures and medical screening before they are scheduled for
                  enlistment.</p>
              <p>They will be scheduled for enlistment into the respective
                  enlistment intakes based on numerous considerations such as the
                  medical &amp; physical fitness and educational qualifications of
                  the individual, as well as the manpower and operational
                  requirements of the various intakes.</p>
              <p>In general, pre-enlistees from the same 'A' level/International
                  Baccalaureate (IB) or polytechnic cohort are enlisted over two
                  intakes due to capacity constraints at the NS training schools. For
                  example, 'A' level/ IB holders who graduate in Nov/Dec are
                  typically enlisted in the Dec and Mar quarterly intakes.
                  Polytechnic diploma holders who graduate in Mar/Apr are typically
                  enlisted in the Jun and Sep quarterly intakes. ITE certificate
                  holders and pre-enlistees with other qualifications are enlisted
                  throughout the year.</p>
              <p>Pre-enlistees can only be assigned to an enlistment intake after
                  being certified medically fit for enlistment at the pre-enlistment
                  medical screening. Pre-enlistees will receive Enlistment Notices to
                  notify them of their enlistment date about 2 months before their
                  scheduled enlistment.</p>
              <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
              <p>Pre-enlistees who are graded PES A/B1 and who attained a NAPFA
                  Silver or Gold award in the 12 months before their enlistment date
                  will be enlisted for their 9-week BMT directly. Pre-enlistees with
                  PES A/B1 but who have not attained a NAPFA Silver or Gold award in
                  the 12 months before their enlistment date will be enlisted into an
                  8-week PTP prior to the commencement of their 9-week BMT.</p>

              <p>Im 20 this year, finishing NS soon. Having a minor hearing lost on one side of my ear( high pitch ringing once in a while. Maybe 2 twice a day?). Hep B carrier ( dont really know why hep B carriers can be combat fit. ).</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">On long term medication for my facial and body acne. </span></p>
              <p>Have requested a memo from my skin specialist for the past few appts. As i have cystic breakouts after wearing my lndividual load bearring vest (iLBV). And for all 3 appts. She has given me a 2 week excuse from iLBV and any extension of excuse will be up to my MO to decide. The cysts are painful to touch. And will burst when force is applied. (Unable to squeeze out anyway as it is too painful. ).  </p>
              <p>I dont want to continue scarring myself with all these acnes and there must be something that can be done?? Im quite lost frankly. </p>

              <p>Just for info, my unit NSHRC called and I'm very surprised by their replies. According to them, C9L3 is still a combat fit status as we are still able to carry arms and thus "can do whatever we are told".</p>
              <p>If that's their interpretation, according to the PES classification, doesn't it meant that even PES E are combat fit since they can hold arms too?</p>
              <p>Their explanation, in my opinion, defeats the purpose of PES classification, especially if able to bear arms translates into combat fitness.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SAF Health Screening Programme</strong></span></p>
              <p><br> With effect from 30 May 2011, “IPPT-FFI” was incorporated into the revised<strong> SAF Health Screening Programme</strong>,
                   which is the compulsory medical examination for all IPPT-eligible NSmen
                   35 years of age and above. There is no need to do a separate "IPPT-FFI"
                   if you have already completed the SAF Health Screening Programme for 
                  that year.The SAF Health Screening Programme review should be initiated 
                  by your NS unit administrator once your IPPT window, i.e. your birthday 
                  window is open. <br> <br> If you are IPPT-eligible, 35 years of age and above, you are required to
                   complete the SAF Health Screening Programme every year before your IPPT
                   attempt. The aim of this medical screening is to detect any medical 
                  conditions which may make you unsuitable for the IPPT.Note that if you 
                  have not completed your SAF Health Screening Programme requirements for 
                  the year, you will not be allowed to take your IPPT. You will be issued 
                  with a certificate once you have completed your SAF Health Screening 
                  Programme requirements. The certificate is valid for 30 days until your 
                  next birthday; i.e. if you are 35 years old, this certificate will be 
                  valid until (and including) the 30th day after your 36th birthday.</p>
              <p><strong>Applicability</strong><br> The annual IPPT is applicable to all PES A, B/B1, B2/C1 NSmen and DXO 
                  with NS liability, till age 45 and 40 years old for Officers and WOSPEC 
                  respectively. The NSman's IPPT annual requirement commences on his 
                  birthday immediately after his NSF Operational Ready Date (ORD) and ends
                   when he is posted to MINDEF Reserves (MR), or medically downgraded to 
                  PES C2 and below.</p>
