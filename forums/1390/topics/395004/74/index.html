              <p>Because NS life is different from civilian life before enlistment, there are many adjustments you need to make.</p>
              <p>A good way to cope is to get support from your buddy and 
              fellow recruits. They are going through the same tough training as you, 
              so talking to one another will help relieve some tension.</p>
              <p>In most evenings during your leisure time, you’ll also 
              have some time to call your family or loved ones to talk. They can give 
              you emotional support during NS.</p>
              <p>You can have a one-on-one interview sessions with your 
              officer to highlight any problems you may have. If you have a personal 
              or family problem that need to be addressed, do let the officer know—he 
              may be able to give you some advice or time off to settle your problems.</p>
              <p><img title="Orientation Officer" src="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/officer.jpg" alt="Orientation officer giving advise to recruit" width="400" height="300"></p>
              <p>You will also have access to Orientation Officers who may be able to help you if the need arises.</p>
              <p>We also have counselling hotlines for you to call if need
               arises. The counsellors are experienced professionals. You can call 
              them at the following counselling hotlines:</p>

              <p>You are required to standby for practice and actual 
                      mobilisation. Mobilisation can occur anytime and requires both you and

                      transform ourselves from a disciplined and well-prepared force in peace 
                      time to an effective fighting force in war time. To maintain this 
                      efficiency of operational readiness, you must report to your 
                      Mobilisation Centre immediately once you are mobilised. <br> <br> <strong>(B)    Mobilisation Systems</strong><br> Every NS unit has a mobilisation plan and you will be briefed on your 
                      role in the mobilisation exercises. Once you are mobilised, you are to 
                      report immediately to your Mobilisation Centre in your uniform with your
                       personal equipment.<br> <br> Mobilisation systems can take place in 2 forms:</p>

              <p>NSmen are required to apply for an Exit Permit for overseas 
                      trips of 6 months or longer. NSmen who go overseas for more than 14 days
                       but less than 6 months must notify MINDEF of their overseas trips 
                      through the MINDEF Notification Centre (MNC). The possession of an Exit 
                      Permit or the notification or the notification of MINDEF Notification

                      duties when required.<br>  <br> During mobilisation manning period, NSmen <strong>can still travel overseas but are required to seek approval from their unit to be exempted from mobilisation prior to departure</strong>. Failing which, disciplinary actions will be taken.<br> <br> <strong>(C)    Mobilisation Manning</strong><br> Before you ORD or your first operational manning, your unit will brief you on the following:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Your <strong>unit code words</strong>. Stickers with your code words will be given to help you and your family members remember the code words.<br> </li>
              <li><strong>Mobilisation Centre location</strong> to report during mobilisation.<br> </li>
              <li><strong>Mobilisation Means</strong>. This could be through telephone, SMS, fax, email or written notices and orders.<br> </li>
              <li><strong>Frequency of Operational Manning</strong>. Manning occurs about twice a work year during which you are liable for mobilisation exercises.<br> </li>
              <li><strong>Special arrangements</strong>. If you are performing emergency 
                      service, or your immediate absence from your work place may be critical 
                      or hazardous to life, you need to inform your NS unit and report as soon
                       as your functions are satisfactorily handed over.<br> </li>
              </ol>
              <p>During mobilisation exercise, your NS unit may be required to move 
                      out for field exercises after the normal reporting is done. Being 
                      mindful of your varying commitments, the SAF will make every effort to 
                      minimise disruption to your civilian careers when mobilisation exercises
                       are held.<br> <br> <strong>How can my family support my mobilisation?</strong><br> You are encouraged to keep your family members informed of your 
                      whereabouts especially during your Operational Manning Periods. They 
                      should also be informed of how and where they can contact you to 
                      facilitate your speedy mobilisation.<br> <br> Your family members should also know your NS unit's code words and be 
                      prepared that you are required to remain at the unit for a longer period
                       if the mobilisation should involves field exercises.<br> <br> If you have any family members that are 16 years of age or above, they 
                      can acknowledge any call-up notice serve at your residence. Upon 
                      receipt, they must contact you immediately.</p>

              <p>Hi Dr eac. My family have a history of diabetes(type 2) and high blood pressure. My mom got HBP and my dad got diabetes. </p>
              <p>I discovered that I had diabetes(type 2) when I was 13 which is currently under control. Now just recently the doctors discovered that I have HPB too. I am currently not taking any medication for both HPB and diabetes because my diabetes is under control with lifestyle modification. But my HPB problem is going to be decided after I go to a polyclinic. </p>
              <p>I went to CMPB for checkup today and at station 6(meeting with MO) I gave the letter written by the doctor to certify that I got HBP and diabetes. I took a look at what pes MO  gave and got a shock coz it was B1L1. Even the staff at the medical counter was shock. 1 of the staff asked me"Did the MO read the letter?" "HBP very dangerous". So I got a question, is the B1L1 perm or is there a review? If it is perm is there anyway to change it? I am not trying to chao keng. I just want to play it safe. </p>
              <p>Thanks for the reply!</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MINDEF Reserve
              (MR)</strong></span><br> <br> MINDEF Reserve consists of NSmen who have completed their NS
              training cycle but have yet to reach the statutory age. They are no
              longer called back for In-Camp Training (ICT) but are still liable
              for NS.</p>
              <p><strong><em>What happens after I completed my NS Training
              Cycle?</em></strong><br> The minimum requirement for completion of NS Training Cycle is 7 HK
              and 10 ORNS years (8 HK and 13 ORNS years for Key Appointment
              Holders). However, you may be asked to continue your service as a
              Reservist On Voluntary Extended Reserve Service (ROVERS) to ensure
              fulfillment of operational requirements. Some ROVERS may even
              continue to serve beyond the statutory age of 50 and 40 for
              Officers and WOSE respectively as VOLUNTEERS in higher operational
              appointments.</p>
              <p><br> Once you have completed your NS training cycle and/or standdown as
              ROVERS/VOUNTEER, you will be posted to the MINDEF Reserve (MR) List
              at the end of the work year. However, you may still be activated
              during operational exigencies and remain liable for NS up to the
              respective statutory ages.</p>
              <p>Note that you are to disregard your previous unit’s mobilisation
              codewords as you are no longer required to report for mobilisation
              activation for your previous units. A new codeword will be assigned
              to you accordingly should you be mobilised while you are in MR. If
              you are travelling overseas for 6 months or more, you are still
              required to apply for Exit Permit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> <strong>1. What is meant by no longer liable for National
              Service?</strong><br> Under the Enlistment Act, Chapter 93, NSmen will not be liable for
              NS call-ups when they reach the statutory age limit of 40 for
              Warrant Officers, Specialists and Enlistees (WOSEs) and 50 for
              Officers. In other words, personnel reaching the stated statutory
              age limit will no longer be liable to be called up for any NS
              activities such as ICT, IPPT, mobilisation etc.<br> <br> <strong>2. What should I do to my SAF personal equipment now that I
              have completed my NS liability?</strong><br> You may dispose the items in the normal ways as long as the items
              do not end up in an unauthorised usage.</p>

              <p>1. Please check current PES and its expiry with the counter medic
                          at the medical centre. The medic can readily see your PES on the
                          computer just with your NRIC number. Simple. Then kindly request ask medic to print it out to show S1 Manpower Branch, Coy Office and to whom it may concern.</p>
              <p>2. Revocation/ Post Out matters are none of medical centre
                          business. Medical centre can only <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">recommends</span></em> a revocation/

                          matters are all handled by the NS unit's S1 Manpower Branch.
                          Therefore, please go to check with S1 Manpower Officer/ DyS1
                          Officer/ Chief Clerk. </p>
              <p>3. Temporary PES downgrade is to let the person to rest, recover
                          and recuperate well enough with sufficient time period for health
                          conditions/ injuries deemed temporary. As simple as that.

              <p>Hi, need some advice here. Am an NSman and got downgraded in 2011 to C2L2 with excuse RMJ permanently. Went for 1 ICT before that and was assigned as sharpshooter. After downgrade I was deferred due to studies and called back again this coming ICT. Inquired with unit to see if there was revocation but unit said no, kenna rifleman. I would have thought that C2L2 is field deployable only with unit HQ or the rear? Can someone please advise me? Thanks...</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Also, what sort of activities fall under excuse RMJ? I find it odd that the unit revocated to rifleman which basicall means can chiong... but my PES status and excuse status suggest otherwise?</span></p>

              <p>Thanks for the very quick reply :)</p>
              <p>Yup I did explicitly state that my excuse RMJ is permanent plus C2L2. However the guy at the other end was quite rude and adamant that can still go outfield, blah blah blah etc. I just found the whole thing very odd and that they are trying to play punk, despite having excuse and lower pes status permanently. </p>
              <p>In the event they refuse to entertain my request (which i think is quite unlikely), is it possible to request for revocation, with the support of specialist memo? And bring this memo on the first day of ICT?</p>

              <p>Medical screening is a series of medical tests done at the
              Medical Classification Centre (MCC) at <abbr title="Central Manpower Base">CMPB</abbr> (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/cmpb-map.png">location map</a>).</p>
              <p>The objective of these tests is to ascertain your medical
              condition and accord you a suitable Physical Employment Status
              (PES). Based on your PES, you will be assigned to a suitable
              vocation.</p>
              <p>Here are the various PES gradings:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>PES A</strong>: Fit for all combat vocations</li>
              <li><strong>PES B1</strong>: Fit for most combat vocations</li>
              <li><strong>PES B2</strong>: Fit for some combat vocations</li>
              <li><strong>PES BP</strong>: Fit for obese <abbr title="Basic Military Training">BMT</abbr> training</li>
              <li><strong>PES C</strong>: Fit for combat support vocations</li>
              <li><strong>PES D</strong>: Temporary unfit for grading and pending
              further review</li>
              <li><strong>PES E</strong>: Fit for administrative duties only</li>
              <li><strong>PES F</strong>: Medically unfit for any form of
              service</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Note that if you are given a <abbr title="Physical Employment Status">PES</abbr> D grading, it means that
              more time/tests are required to confirm your medical condition.
              This normally takes about 2-3 months. However, this duration may be
              longer depending on your medical condition.</p>
