              Hi, I would like to know what range of PES will I probably get. I have Asthma (referred to SGH after Spirometry for specialist checkup but still ongoing), Flatfoot (totally flat, jutting out from the side), possible Orthostatic Hypotension and have also seen an Internal Medicine specialist at SGH for frequent calf and neck cramps (although no further blood tests have been done due to high cost). 
                      
              I have a classmate who was recently graded C9L3 due to Asthma without even being referred to an Asthma specialist. So what probable PES status will I be getting? Thanks!

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I was graded PES C9L2 (back in 2003 pre-enlistment) Perm due to Mitral Valve Prolapse and Marfan Protocol (Hyperextension on elbow joint + physique [arm spans longer than height] just to simplify description here.)</p>
              <p>For Mitral, Pulmonary and Tricuspid valve are all showing signs of regurgitation trivia/mild. With the MV showing prolapse toward the anterior coordinate.</p>
              <p>In 2004 during BMT, I was excused firearms by MMI's PCC (or bearing of firearms) + excuse grenades and explosives due to a psychological problem.</p>
              <p>Fast forward to 2011+2012, I served my first+second HK ICT in a Combat Service Support Battalion HQ which had field training.</p>
              <p>I recently saw my reservice NSman MO who saw my profile and he suggested to apply for a medical review to re-assess the PES and Land deployability code. He was in consultation with a NSF MO who said that the fact of NOT being able to bear firearms could possibly result in a E1 L9 status.</p>
              <p>As far as I am concern, I am not concern about the C9 or E1 status (although I do have newly developed cardiac conditions that have yet to be verified clinically by a cardiologist)</p>
              <p>My question is:" Under the 'Excuse firearms, granades and explosives', can it be clear-cut enough via the WY2010 PES criteria for a L9 deployability code?"</p>
              <p>Many thanks.</p>
              <p>P.S Please feel free to use clinical terms to aid clarity in your response.</p>
              <p>Kind regards.</p>

              <p>Hi, I would like to know what range of <span>PES</span> will I probably get. I have Asthma (referred to <span>SGH</span> after Spirometry for specialist checkup but still
              ongoing), Flatfoot (totally flat, jutting out from the side),
              possible Orthostatic Hypotension and have also seen an Internal
              Medicine specialist at <span>SGH</span> for frequent calf
              and neck cramps (although no further blood tests have been done due
              to high cost).</p>
              <p>I have a classmate who was recently graded <span>C9L3</span> due to Asthma without even being referred to an
              Asthma specialist. So what probable <span>PES</span> status will I be getting? Thanks!</p>
