              <p><br>For your present PES and exact time period it covers, you will have to ask the camp MO or any medics in the camp medical centre to help check it in their medical information system, and print it out for reference, just like a MC.</p>
              <p>For your vocation and administrative matters, you will have to ask the Chief Clerk or S1 Manpower Officer at the unit's S1 branch.</p>

              <p>By right, you should go to see the doctor again for a new updated on your illness. Then bring the memo to your current unit MO for review whether to up/down graded. Now you NSman, I don't think SAF will send you letter for review.</p>

              <p>Uhm, hi guys &gt;&lt;</p>
              <p>I'd just like to ask a simple question. I am posted to C9L3, and I am going in very soon. The thing is, well, I think my cousin's kinda pranking me, but do I have to go through the weird stuff he does? Like, Routemarches, and staying outside in the forest. I mean, routemarch is fine, but I think I'll fall ill if I am left out in the forest. (I sound like an animal for that sentence... &gt;&lt;) but yeah. Just... really curious.</p>
              <p>Thanks :3</p>

              <p>Migraine is really a headache to treat and diagnose. It can be caused by chronic sinus infection, hypertension, shoulder pain, slipped disc and many other reasons. Depends on different cases, some people can have migraine to the extend that he cannot open up his right eye; some people cannot function without taking drugs every single day.</p>
              <p>But if you really have a migraine problem, you should have been seeing a specialist since secondary school. Just get him to write for you a letter loh!</p>
