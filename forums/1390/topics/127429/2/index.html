After all, i dun really care if they die surprised or not and i do not really want to go in SWAT style. These are soldiers, not policemen.

Now they shouldn't just enter that room because enemies might be beyond the doorway with a grenade ready. That is where i think the ball-camera comes in. You throw it into the corridor, enemy will very likely think its a grenade, so their first reaction will likely be to take cover. Enemy will then have to recognize that the ball is no grenade, afterwhich they will have to either move into another room, or destroy the ball. All these will take, imo about 10 seconds. That is more than enough time to provide good intelligence.  Even if the enemies moves into another room, what you now have is a cleared corridor/room. That kinda narrows down the location of the enemies.

It seems that it will be good for a "look see look see" kind of situation, then plan and attack. However the rifle with the 90deg scope seems useful enough to survey and allow us the shoot at the enemies without exposing much of our body. my 2cents worth.</div>
