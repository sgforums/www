            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">The Army has taken yet another bold step in its efforts to transform into a third-generation (3G) force. Charlie Company from the 3rd Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment (3 SIR), has been named the first Urban Operations-capable company in the SAF. PIONEER finds out why it is necessary to build up this capability.</span><br><br>The enemy thinks he is well hidden in the room. But 40 metres away in another room, LTA Mohammed Sofian can see exactly where the target is.<br><br>Despite the thick smoke pouring in from the corridor, LTA Sofian's eyes do not fail him. In fact, he can even 'see' through walls.<br><br>No, LTA Sofian does not possess X-Men-like vision. He is armed with new equipment that enhances his ability to operate in an urban environment.<br><br>With a skilful flick of the joystick, a remote-controlled car zips around the corner and heads towards the room where the enemy is hiding in.<br><br>Back in the 'safe' room where LTA Sofian (left) and his men have stationed themselves, the commander checks the live images that are being sent from the camera mounted on the remote-controlled car.<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/cyberpioneer/images/cover_apr05_img1.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/cyberpioneer/images/cover_apr05_img2.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/cyberpioneer/images/cover_apr05_img3.jpg"><br>Lower risks to soldiers' lives, higher situational awareness achieved: By using a camera-mounted remote-controlled car, soldiers can view what is unfolding in other locations on a hand-held monitor.<br><br>As the vehicle enters the enemy's room, LTA Sofian spots the target on the screen. He also notices some innocent civilians crouched in the background.<br><br>With a clearer picture of his area of operations, LTA Sofian is better informed of what has to be done to take out the enemy without putting the lives of the innocent civilians and his soldiers at unnecessary risk.<br><br>A scene taken from a movie? For LTA Sofian, a Platoon Commander from Charlie Company of 3 SIR, this mode of operations could well be a reality soon. After all, he is from the Army's first Urban Operations (UO)-capable company.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Urban evolution</strong><br><br>Last August, the 9th Singapore Division merged with the Infantry Formation to form 9 Div/Inf.<br><br>One of its new tasks was for the Army to experiment with more efficient ways of operating in an urban environment.<br><br>Since December, soldiers of this 'C' Company have been testing out new equipment suitable for UO.<br><br>For example, besides using the camera-mounted remote-controlled surveillance car to 'see' further to get a clearer picture of the area of operations, soldiers are experimenting with the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and camera-mounted robots.<br><br>Soldiers are also trying out tools like sledgehammers and battering rams to gain quick access through locked doors and into rooms (To find out more about some of the equipment currently on trial with 3 SIR, see box story on the right).<br><br>Officer Commanding of 'C' Company, CPT Alvin Tan (right), revealed that new doctrines and operations in an urban landscape were also being worked out.<br><br>He said: "We first started training a few individuals, working out how soldiers should stand, where they should position themselves and how to handle their weapons in UO."<br><br>"Next, we explored how soldiers should position themselves when operating in larger groups, from a section, then a platoon, and finally up to company level."<br><br>Within a platoon, soldiers could also be re-structured to form smaller teams.<br><br>CPT Tan rationalised the need for this, explaining that this configuration was more suitable for UO: "The area of operations is more confined, and soldiers need to perform concurrent tasks, say clearing more than one room at a time, to overwhelm the enemy. "<br><br>He added: "Breaking the sections into smaller teams further empowers each soldier. He takes more ownership in the mission as he becomes more aware of his role and responsibility. Team dynamics is definitely enhanced."<br><br>In late February, a UO demonstration was put up to showcase some of the equipment and processes tested. And while CPT Tan stressed that these processes were still under trial and training was still in the formative stages, he was excited about these new ways of operation.<br><br><strong>Urban: Complex</strong><br>According to Commander 9 Div/Chief Infantry Officer, COL Winston Toh (left), UO poses many challenges but is something the Army should prepare itself for.<br><br>"Urbanisation is occurring rapidly world-wide. In time to come, the urban terrain will become the conventional terrain and UO becomes the conventional fight," said COL Toh.<br><br>"From past conflicts and even with the current situation in Iraq, you can see that UO is a very complex operation and soldiers are faced with far greater challenges."<br><br>" In UO, walk through a few unfamiliar alleyways and you can become lost. With so many walls around, communication signals can also be unclear," he added.<br><br>"In addition, the psychological demands on soldiers are high. The enemy can pop up from many places, like the window, the roof, even sewage pipes, so soldiers must be very alert."<br><br>"Civilians are also usually present in the theatre of operations. We do not want to put these innocent people in harm's way. Hence, soldiers need to positively identify who is the enemy and who is the civilian," said COL Toh.<br><br>CPT Tan said: "While the basics of infantry operation apply, in UO, you must be enterprising, adept and use what is available in the landscape to your advantage. So, for instance, soldiers can use drains to approach the objective."<br><br>With so many factors to manage, soldiers must be properly equipped and organised, to give them greater situational awareness to make informed decisions.<br><br>Hence the experiments that are currently going on in 3 SIR.<br><br>COL Toh explained that the aim is for greater situational awareness that enhances the troops' confidence, preserves forces and reduces collateral damage.<br><br>Fighting in built-up areas (FIBUA) is not new to our soldiers. So how is that different from UO?<br><br>"FIBUA is conducted at a more tactical level, where we<br>teach soldiers basic drills or procedures to clear a room,"<br>said COL Toh.<br><br>"In UO, it is not just the Infantry's presence. In a UO battlefield, combined arms are involved, including elements of intelligence, information operations, communications, civil-military relations, combat support...It is a much more complex and integrated operation," he added.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The new urbanites</strong><br><br>According to COL Toh, the plan is for 3 SIR to become a UO-capable battalion by next year. Along the way, UO processes will be shared among soldiers in other sectors of the Army.<br><br>And going by the feedback from soldiers on the ground, it certainly indicates that they are excited by, and support, the direction the Army is heading.<br><br>CPL Terence Leong, a Weapons Specialist with Headquarters, 9 Div/Inf, who is involved in the testing and evaluation of some of the UO equipment, said: "Operating in an urban environment is quite new to most soldiers. Hence it is good that the Army sees the importance of operating in this landscape, and is adapting processes to it, to equip soldiers to tackle the situation better."<br><br>LTA Sofian (left) feels that adapting to UO sends out a strong deterrence message. "When others see us suited up in full gear, complete with bullet-proof vests and UO equipment, it sends out a strong message that we are well-trained and prepared," he said.<br><br>Another soldier from 'C' Company, 3SG Toh Chin Jie, admitted that initial apprehension of using new equipment quickly gave way to curiosity and enthusiasm.<br><br>"In conventional operations, the equipment is normal. But in UO, it is new and refreshing! I don't think many of us in 3 SIR ever thought we would have the chance to use these new equipment!" enthused the Full-time National Serviceman (NSF).<br><br>CPT Tan is happy to note the positive feedback from his soldiers. "They are excited about the new equipment. They often see such technology on television, and now they have it in their hands. Morale is high, and they are proud to be able to use the equipment."<br><br>He added: "Taking this technology-savvy approach is right. After all, soldiers these days are very comfortable using such equipment; it is almost intuitive for them. Thus, the UO concept is becoming a reality for them and they are interested to see how it will play out."<br><br>In fact, some soldiers have even suggested possible technologies and processes to explore, including heat sensor, more wireless and lightweight communication devices and even penetrating radar.<br><br>Reflecting on the progress made in UO, COL Toh said: "From FIBUA to UO, it has been quite a big leap. Changes now are not limited to the Infantry and that highlights the entire Army's emphasis on UO."<br><br>"We hope to continue with this pace of development, to move our soldiers closer towards the goal of being a 3G force. It is important for them to use and train with some of the equipment because they must see and feel this 3G force coming. And with the progress made by 3 SIR, they are now seeing the 3G force in operation."<br><br><strong>FIBUA vs UO: What is the difference?</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/cyberpioneer/images/cover_apr05_img14.jpg"><br>In FIBUA, soldiers learn only basic drills, like how to clear a room tactically.<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/cyberpioneer/images/cover_apr05_img15.jpg"><br>In UO, much more integrated elements like intelligence (with the use of UAVs and surveillance balls) and communications (using new wireless communication devices and technology) are involved. Hence situational awareness is greatly enhanced.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I doubt these guys are supposed to do Hostage rescue. As such i think equipment like the ball camera is a pretty good idea.<br><br>Iraq has exposed the shortcomings of normal FIBUA tactics. Grenades do not always work against an intelligent and determined enemy. This is esp so where the buildings have multiple rooms. Thus, as seen in the BBC documentary of the Marines in Iraq, you see the Marines basically leveling enemy held buildings.<br><br>I can therefore see the utility of the Ball-camera; Soldier believes that he has seen enemies in building, he lobs a ball through the window to confirm, and then calls in heavy firepower. The ball clearly has some advantages over a mirror or a fibre-optics camera in that the ball can be deployed over a greater range.<br><br>The use of the remote control car is a little far-fetched, but then there should be no comlpiants about having it as an option, ya?<br><br></div>
