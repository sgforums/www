              <p>This is just my personal opinion from my personal experiences. Men, i mean boys doing NS in the army became self-absorbed people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Experience 1:</span> Very good friend of mine, well not any more. Initial as NR. He was someone who listens when you are talking and responsible. After joining NS, he became very self-absorbed. Always talking abt himself. Being proud is good, but he's more arrogant. In any situation, there would always be something about him that he would share. And more, he became quite irresponssible. Mind you, he's an MOPA. Yet, he is very irresponsible, never return calls and smses, never pass official letters that he is supposed to pass. He became a Jerk! Likes to put people down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Experince 2:</span> A friend. Initial FM, he listens to people and always have a two way conversation. Now, he only talks about himself. Likes to put people down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Experience 3:</span> Another friend. Initial SK. Same case, always talks about himself.</p>

              <p>Blame the heavy indoctrination process where boys are exposed to situations that are difficult or tough in nature and forced to complete them by all means neccesary. Exposed to people who are very assertive and very confident in their behavior and they are the leaders and commanders that train/lead us. With continous training they are able to endure and overcome these difficult times.</p>
              <p>Good for self-confidence and leadership matters etc. But some do overdo it once they leave the force. Some use the NS experience as a motivation where nothing is impossible or "i've been through worse, what the hell does this compare to" when dealing with certain things in the civilian world.</p>
              <p>But i still think there is more tougher things in life than NS.</p>

              <p>As a current NSF, all I cay say is the range of NSFs out there are varying. There's no point attempting to draw a correlation between NS and behavioural changes that may occur due to other factors, not only due to NS alone.</p>
              <p>No, I am not defending NS, but it's downright unfair to sweepingly generalise the entire population based on a few examples. Just put it this way, you wouldn't want people to label Singapore as a nation of robbers if he/she is just unforunate enough to be robbed twice.</p>
              <p>There are various types of NSFs out there. Those who never grow up, those who remain bitchy, those who just wayang, those who relac-jack, those who happy-go-lucky, those who siam arrows, those who let their not-very-high ranks go to their head, those who know how to take care of their subordinates and colleagues, those who do anything to climb etc etc.</p>

              <p><br>politically correct answer xD....</p>
              <p>anyways, its more of a matter of how easy a person is to hold on to his own beliefs n principles or how easy a person gets swayed by opinions n behaviours of others. humans naturally need each other n influence each other as we r social beings. whether we r strong believers in ourselves, or followers to other's lead.</p>

              <p>Surely you've met guys who have not changed for the worse after going through NS. Why judge men based on just three experiences alone?</p>

              <p>Changes can be both good and bad. I have seen guys who were previously the "guai" types took up bad habits such as smoking, excessive swearing,hardcore wayanging after go through NS. On the other hand, changes can be beneficial as well, as  we might become more mature, more apt at handling soclai day to day relationships after entering NS. I mean, surely you have met outstanding people in army right? Hopefully their good points can rub off on you. The best is to take in the good things you have learned in NS and resist the bad then can "grow up".</p>
