              <p>Time to intensify your training.</p>
              <p>Small tips :</p>
              <p>-Dashing 100m then walking 100m for a total of 2.4km is a better way to train than slow jog for 2.4km.</p>
              <p>-Your own weight is one thing, but for SBJ, you will need to lift some weights ( pun intended ) and/or do frog hops ( if you are not worried about your knees)</p>

              <p>Hi January, </p>
              <p>it seems that you have managed to cut your 2.4km run timing by 2 mins within a few weeks, and thus as long as you continue to train regularly, I am sure that you will be able to cut down to the required timing. </p>
              <p>Your main concern now should be your Standing Board Jump though, as I know from when I was JC back then that it is much harder to make it improve within a short period of time. But please don't worry, you still have two months, as long as you do more squats regularly, you should be able to meet the passing mark.</p>
              <p>Cheers</p>

              There are some useful tips in the Mindef website that you may want to explore.
              
              To speed up your improvement you need to achieve a combination of Frequency (how many times a week), Intensity (how hard is your training) and Time (spent on training). This is commonly known as the FIT formula. 
              
              For your running, do a combination of Fartlek, 400m/800m/1200m Intervals at the track, tempo run. these exercise would help you push the limit and overcome your treshold. 
              
              For your chin-up, doing a lot of push up WILL NOT help much as push up targets your chest and shoulder muscle wheres Chin Up uses primarily your lower back and biceps. Train in the gym using the Lat Pulldown, Seated Row and assisted Chip Up station. You can also do multiple sets on chin up bar at the track. Alternatively, work on you chest too for balance othwise you will have strong back but weak chest.

              <p>Hi January,</p>
              <p>training with squats in the gym will definitely help in your SBJ. Knowing the techniques will further enhance your jump. With strength, weight is not much of an issue to get 5 points in SBJ.</p>
              <p>For me, I'm 78kg (so I need to cut to run faster), but I can jump 243 cm after a year of discplined squatting (with explosive squats training). But for starters, do not do any plyometric (explosive) training. Just body squats might be sufficient, or perhaps, Hindu Squats.</p>

              <p>thanks for all the tips... i have scanned through your advices and though i may not implement them due to preferences, i am grateful still. i also find the idea that push up may not help so directly to pull up agreeing.</p>
              <p>basically my strategy is quite standard now.. just practise the stations and then rest for few days until muscle recovers and then practise again, this is my belief. now the focus is on standard broad jump and sit up practise and 2.4 . sbj is now about 2m. sit up is doable but i need to be able to do faster in under 1 minute. For some people, sit up is really not easy maybe because i have not sit up for about 2 years already.</p>
              <p>I am currently hovering around 64.5kg and is trying to push down a few more kgs. i am not tall person so i think its a fine weight to push down to near 60kg.</p>

              <p>actually another reason for improvment, just to share is weight loss. I have lost about 20kg in 3months. This loss is too rapid though, therefore it is dangerous. As a result, my solution now is to ensure that i do not over exercise cos i do not eat alot anyway... so recently this past week and following, my idea is to practise test and rest few days for each station.</p>
              <p>i lose weight mainly by choosing healthier food and eating 1 meal to 1.5 meal a day. Its very tough to be hungry everyday, a word of caution.</p>

              <p>Hello people, update again,</p>
              <p>Bad news after today IPPT test, the results were much poorer than i calculated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>situp-30 OK 2points</p>
              <p>Jump-207cm (target 212cm) but still i expect this result anyway 1 point</p>
              <p>Shuttle run- 11 seconds(use leg cross line method, did not expect such slow timing.  2nd attempt-10.8(use stretch out my hand to touch line method)   2points</p>
              <p>Chin up - 2 OK 2 points</p>
              <p>2.4km - never complete.. feel tired during the run, at 5th round, my upper body got pain, so i jog slowly liao.. come back at the end of 5th round already 13min 49secs. feel breathless and leg no power during the run, unlike my self test run i did myself (but self test run is conducted without static stations, i guess this is part of reasons)</p>
              <p>2nd reason - run is conducted at about 5 pm for my turn.. sun is still out and abit hot also the track temperatue...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I saw some information at the kabhit camp which talks about weight loss, nutrition and also on how to test some individual stations.. anyone can direct me to these information online . thanks a million.. my netizen pals...what a unexpected day... when i feel that i am quite light at 62.5kg already and also got some training.</p>

              <p>I am the kind of guy during NS time i barely pass and in reservist i got award from IPPT...strange as ever. anyway my thoughts are :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe you should take a step back and look at the overall....</p>
              <p>there are 2 areas you are trying to acheive at the same time.. loose weight and improve your physical performance on IPPT. You are probably at the physical level where u need to eat to improve but you don't want to gain weight.</p>
              <p>You also need to understand there are bone density weight gain vs body fat weight gain.   </p>
              <p>Look at multi Vitamin supplement to maintain energy level.  I think target weight at 57.5 kg and maintain muscle and bone weight.  </p>
              <p>I think <strong>you should NOT</strong> do 1.5 meal a day....but you might want to look at what you eat. The first order of the day is not to EAT White RICE or white flour.....but Brown Rice.  Why because enriched white rice convert into sugar and store as body fat....</p>
              <p>Full breakfast - Ceral - oakmeal/ fruits / Nuts..(not peanuts)</p>
              <p>Full lunch -- Subway (wheat bread) 6 inch.</p>
              <p>Half Dinner. - lean protein/ veg / brown rice. (no pork, no lard) or Fish/chicken are good (no chicken skin fat)</p>
              <p>suppliment proteins -- Nuts, and Avocado these are really really Good proteins....(it help you to stop craving for meat.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Excerise 3 times a week should be enough.But review your goal...i think at training your target should be higher .....rather than aim at 2 point achieve 1 point...but aim at 5 point for all stations and achieve 2 point average...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For sit up i think you should target towards 40 sit up/ miniutes. The increase torso excerise would help in both 2.4 k running and standing broad jump.</p>
              <p>increase intensity of your 2.4. don't just run 2.4 exactly you always want to run slightly longer distance like 3k.m so that it helps to compensate the actual IPPT because during IPPT there is a tendency to start up by running faster as a group because all are nervous...</p>
              <p>standing broad jump typically i don;t look at 2,12 mark to jump i focus on a far target and coordinate my armed swing momentum and my leg movement.</p>
              <p>So adjust your target....mind over physical constrain...    </p>

              <p>your 2.4 is only 1 minute to passing mark.. keep training hard! very soon that 1 minute will shorten and shorten until you pass your 2.4km.</p>

              <p>Hi january,</p>
              <p>To cut down your 2.4km run timing by 14 seconds in about a week is a very good thing. If you continue training at this rate, you should be able to pass your IPPT within the next two months. All the best to you.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
