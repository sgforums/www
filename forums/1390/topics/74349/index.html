            <div class='col-md body'>Ehz, actually what can be said to be true is that while there are avenues for soldiers/sailors/airmen/marines to go from "green to gold" (Enlisted to Commissioned) in the US Military.<br><br>The main forms of Officer Ascension programs in the US Military are still the Service Academies (USMA, USNA, USAFA - Each Cadet/MIDS taking four years to earn his/her dip+degree+commision[US citizens only]), Officer Candidate Schools(much shorter, I'm not certain of the length) and ROTCs...(not sure about the Arti officer part though)<br><br>An Enlisted, if having proven him/herself can actually join any of the above (less ROTC)to earn their commissions together with other Cadet/MIDS who are fresh (no previous military experience..)<br><br>With all due respect, such arrangment ensures a steady mix of experience within the junior ranks of the officer corp but I suppose time is a luxury we can't afford..

            <div class='col-md body'>To be a Specialist is harder in a social and interpersonal context.Being an officer is merely about having fitness and some basic navigational quality which can be gained through lectures and training Ops.To lead men , much more is needed, especially the ability to lower yourself humbly to your men's level and see life throught their eyes before you can lead them and get them to listen to you.Humans are not sheep, they only respect and follow people who think are able and can lead them to greatness.If a young punk is given his bars , will his men respect him or merely fear him?An incompetent or arrogant officer's rank gives him the authority, not the moral standing to give a command.Is fear the best motivating factor in leadership?I think not.<br><br>In fact, I feel Specialists are the ones who get most of the brunt of the work, caught between demanding and childish NSF officers and their men.Its tough to juggle both being a subordinate and a leader, and it actually opens his eyes much wider than those officers.You realise you can't throw your rank at them and get them to do things, and they can make your life a living hell too.Im totally for the idea that officers have to come from specialists who are appraised highly through their work, at least for those who will become combat officers or holding important appointments.<br><br></div>
