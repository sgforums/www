              <p>It is a very bad idea for the SAF to allow such organizations, even informal ones that exist outside its command structure/ hierarchy.</p>
              <p>We now have a Christian Army Officers Association. Next the Muslim officers will also want an officers association of their own, followed by Catholics, Hindus, Buddhists, Taoists.... etc.</p>
              <p>Each of these sub cliques will further its own agenda and this will be highly divisive, especially in times of war. </p>
              <p>All SAF officers should regard themselves as officers of the Singapore Armed Forces, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>not</em></span></strong> <em>Christian </em>officers of the Singapore Armed Forces, or <em>Muslim</em> officers of the Singapore Armed Forces etc.</p>
              <p>If these officers are compelled to join a religious society, they are free to join a Christian (or Muslim, or Hindu, or Buddhist etc.) Association, but not a Christian <em>Army Officers</em> Association. </p>

              <p>Given the sensitive race and religion issues that may well be the crux of any conflict in South East Asia, such a group would be extremely unwise, to say the least. Even in a more homogeneous (religiously speaking, at least) military like the US Army, the issue of religion, and evangelical Christianity in particular, is a perpetual bugbear, with non-Christians being ostracised. In Singapore, the situation would be even worse. For reasons such as these, there should never be any official recognition or support for such an organisation.</p>
              <p>Still, what people do in their private time is their own business, within limits. Such an organisation, privately founded and privately run, would be hard to argue against unless there could be demonstrable proof that it was detrimental to the interests of the military. I hope the leaders of this organisation are aware of the dangers that the organisation poses to the stability of the military and society as a whole, and always tread tactfully. In my personal experience, anybody who tries to promote a religion will definitely step on other peoples toes. Given the big hoo-hah about Christian nurses trying to convert patients one or two years back, any attempt to bring the works of these organisation into military life would be heavily frowned upon, as it would undermine the ideals of our military, and our society as a whole.</p>
              <p>Shotgun: Would you have the same reaction if you heard that there was a Muslim Army Officers Association? Obviously not right?

              <p>I disagree strongly with your statement about 'melding the interests of religion and the military'. In a multi-religious society like ours, there is no way that religion can be brought into the military, regardless of the numerous historical and present day precedents, which, I might mention, happen in more religiously homogeneous populations. The stance of the SAF therefore is that religion is your own private business, and, given the circumstances we are in, this is the best stance to take in my opinion.</p>

              <p>I am not narrow minded about religion. Every Singaporean citizen (be they officers or not) are entitled to practice their religion in their own personal capacity. But the SAF is an extension of our secular government, so it should strictly be irreligious.... lest we start to have a group of civil servants forming a Christian Civil Servants Association, followed by another group forming the Muslim Civil Servants Association... ad infinitum. Do you really want to live in a country like that?</p>
              <p>It would only be unconstitutional to limit a person's practicing his choice of religion <em>in his personal capacity</em>. Religion is a personal thing. By all means, practice your religions, but not at the expense of national unity. </p>

              <p>I would fully support a "SAF Muslim/Christian/Buddhist Officer's Association."  I believe in the freedom to form associations. </p>
              <p>Perhaps melding was not the best of words.  If we look at the various religions and their take on violence and bloodshed, we realize that it puts a religion and the military at odds.  If such associations under careful supervision is able to deconflict the interests of religion and the military, I do not see why they should not be encouraged.</p>
              <p>There are needs that the religious servicemen that cannot be met by the SAF as a neutral organization.  Such associations can be a  "gap" filler in officially addressing a soldier's religious needs. </p>
              <p>I find it hard to see how various religious associations formed to address the needs of servicemen will cause "national" disunity. ( we are not even discussing this on a national level. )  If this country is able to have churches, mosques, temples operating side by side in a neighbourhood, have its people attending it live in harmony and mindful of sensitivities, it will also be able to implement "religious associations" within a SMALLER organizational structure such as the SAF.  A military organization with even stricter guidelines should have even lesser problems.</p>
              <p>With regards to evangelical Christians servicemen, as long as they are sensitive, non-intrusive with their evangelism they should be able to stay out of trouble.  Besides, if they do step over the board, complaints can always belodged for necessary disciplinary actions to be taken.  That is one thing that doesn't happen outside the military. =D</p>

              <p>Agreed that the SAF cannot meet the religious needs of servicemembers, thus all these organisations are acceptable given that it is on private time and discreet. The incident raised by Unknown_X would be pushing the limits already because it is using SAF resources to distribute Christian material. My whole discomfort with the issue is from the fact that because religious restrictions are not always clearly defined by the SAF that evangelical groups of any denomination would try to 'play the system' as has already happened. Also, religion and race are closely interlinked in our part of the world, and anything that disturbs the status quo needs to be closely watched-- as I said before, if there were any hint of discrimination in the SAF based on religion, the whole house of cards may just come down.</p>
              <p>Finally, as you said yourself, some tenets of religion are not compatible with the military, or indeed, society as a whole-- our modern society functions because we sidestep,ignore or re-interprete those tenets. In fact I am sure that all those who have done BMT within the past few years would have done a questionaire that asks you whether you would place loyalty to your religion above loyalty to your country.</p>
              <p>From the website of the MCF:</p>
              <p>"<strong>In the following 2 years, attempts were made to
                  register the group with the Registry of Societies but these efforts
                  failed.</strong> We then faced the prospect of being disbanded.</p>
              <p>Upon knowing our situation, the Fellowship of
                  Evangelical Students (FES) formed the Armed Forces Committee (AFC) on 8
                  July 1972, and we became affiliated to FES as the AFC."</p>
              <p>The fact that this MCF is not allowed to be an official society, but must go through loopholes and establish itself as adjunct of a previously approved society, shows that the official stance would still be to disallow such societies.</p>
              <p>Also, one of the links of the MCF is to the OCF, which is an organisation for American Christian officers. In the first place, such a link to another military would be inadvisable due to security issues. Also, the OCF is the very organisation that has lead to such reports of discrimination against non-Christians in the US Army and Marines.</p>
              <p>For these reasons I would be disinclined to think that the MCF is a good idea.</p>

              <p>I wouldn't see why having the MCF would be a problem. It is a fellowship, meaning that its role is not just to evangelise (which must be done with tact), but for the spiritual well-being of Christians in the SAF. They will support one another spiritually.</p>

              <p>Sorry, my edit function doesn't work so sorry for the double post but,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believe that evangelism should be kept to a personal level. It is not a good idea to mate God with the military as an organisation, but it is perfectly okay to mate God with military personnel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Evangelism can take many forms. A lot</p>
              <p>of it is one-to-one which can turn off some people, but that's where evangelists have to be tact. Maybe the organisation should set up some guidelines on evangelism in SAF? (When, where, appropriety of occasion?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, such groups should not use SAF resource to spread their word. (I have some MCF tracts. By right, they aren't affliated with SAF and printing is done through FES)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As long as SAF does not endorse it, there won't be much of a problem as it does not support any such group.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am a Christian posting this up, so if there is any problem with my statement, pls let me know. I'm trying to keep my postings as sensitive to others as possible so if you feel offended by my posting, again let me know.</p>

This issue has already caused a difference of opinion in this small community of SG forumners. If such military religious organizations are allowed to prevail there is no telling what kind of divide and damage it can cause.</span></p>

Its very existence (especially if endorsed or recognized by the SAF itself) will compromise the cohesiveness of SAF as a fighting organization. </span></p>

We all know that reporting accountants must be independent and objective in their conduct. Hence, the code of ethical conduct for many professional accounting bodies will require its members to “…be, <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and be seen to be</span></em>, free of any interest which is incompatible with objectivity and independence.” (Acid test: Would you believe a reporting accountant if he certifies that the Renci hospital is free of any financial and accounting irregularities, if the said accountant is also a student of Ven. Shi Ming Yi?) Likewise, the existence of military-religious organizations (regardless of their mandate) can be seen as compromising the secularity of the SAF, and by extension, our secular government.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "> </p>

I agree with you that there won't be much of a problem as long as SAF does not endorse it. However, I am concerned that the MCF is using SAF resources to further its own agenda. As explained above, this may be perceived as SAF giving tacit support to the MCF. </span></p>
