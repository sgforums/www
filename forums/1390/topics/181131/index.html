The range isn't fantastic plus when the bearing spread out, you'll probably end up injuring not just the escaping convict but probably his pursuing officers too.  Its probably some older model sniper rifle 'cos I doubt they need the firepower of say that latest sniper rifle SAF just acquired.</div>
