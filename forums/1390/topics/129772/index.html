            <div class='col-md body'>Wuming, i'm surprised you weren't exposed to a Learning Army or Learning Organisation (call it whatever you want) package during CTC, esp since you were there in 2003... seeing how Hd SAS and his predecessor being strong advocates of this. Or perhaps you meant no previous experiences in a seminar or forum, anyway, its not impt  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>What's the right or model answer? I suppose many SAF personnel interpretation of a "thinking soldier" is pretty similiar to yours and is a compliment in a sense that you have not brushed it off as nonsense. Certain elements in the SAF recognises the increasing intelligence of our NSF/NSMen and thus the concept of a "thinking" soldier was born.  After saying that, many still struggle with the concept of being questioned and this culture will take some time to set in. And i fully agree with you that in peacetime, let's take time to explain things, etc. But when war happens and the button is pushed, no questions asked!<br><br>Previously, leaders only have 2 tools, the carrot or the stick. You either entice your men with benefits/offs or you beat the crap out of him to get him to toe the line, the latter being the favoured one. This concept and notion of a "thinking soldier" and its associated thoughts are simply another way of motivation and leadership.<br><br>In an ideal situtation, BOTH the soldier AND the leader must want to be "thinking soldiers" and i have seen first hand of this happening. I have also seen first hand experiences of soldiers (be it NSFs, NSMen or Regulars) who DON'T want to be motivated and the only option is the stick.<br><br>I think this topic has been debated and discussed over and over at the height of this campaign, and STILL no one could fully answer all the questions. So i think i might just end it off here!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
