              <h2>Support the National Blood Programme</h2>
              <p>The aim of the National Blood Programme is to collect sufficient quantities of blood to meet the needs of patients in Singapore. <br><br>The<a href="http://www.redcross.org.sg/"> <strong>Singapore Red Cross (SRC)</strong></a> was appointed the national blood donor recruiter in April 2001. <br><br>The SRC focuses on 3 main functions in the National Blood Programme:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Recruitment and retention of blood donors: <br><br>In
                   order to ensure a healthy and constant supply of blood at all times, we
                   need to increase the current number of regular blood donors from 1 to 2
                   per cent of our total residential population by 2010; <br><br></li>
              <li>Promotion and education to increase public awareness on the importance of blood donations: <br><br>SRC
                   seeks to inform and educate the public on the importance of a constant 
                  supply of blood to help ease or prevent acute shortages during festive 
                  periods, school breaks and also in times of emergency; and <br><br></li>
              <li>Organisation of mobile blood donation drives in the community: <br><br>SRC
                   works with various corporations, civic and religious organisations as 
                  well as community centres to organise mobile blood drives, thus making 
                  it convenient to for the community to donate blood. </li>

              <h2>Why We Need More Donors</h2>
              <p>Blood contains many life-saving components that can help to treat 
              different illnesses and injuries. For many people, blood donors are 
              their life-line. <br><br>Your blood donation could help save the life of
               an accident victim, a patient with severe anaemia, a person undergoing 
              major surgery or even a newborn baby. <br><br>The platelets found in 
              blood are used to treat leukaemia patients. A single patient often needs
               platelets from 10 or more donors, all within a short period of time. 
              Add to that the short 5-day lifespan of donated platelets, and you can 
              understand why there is a constant need for platelet donors. <br><br>Every
               hour of the day, 15 units of blood are used in Singapore. We need to 
              collect at least 350 units a day, as a whopping 100,000 units are needed
               in a year, just to meet the transfusion needs of patients in Singapore.
               <br><br>And with an aging population and more sophisticated medical procedures, the demand of blood is increasing. <br><br><strong>Find out <a id="/content/hsaportal/en/health_services/blood_donation/what_to_donate" href="http://www.hsa.gov.sg/publish/hsaportal/en/health_services/blood_donation/what_to_donate.html">how you can help</a>. </strong></p>

              <ul>
              <li>Less than six hours after a unit of blood is donated, it can be
               processed into blood products to treat a variety of medical conditions. </li>
              <li>Modern processing techniques mean that a single blood donation,
               when separated into its components, can help at least three different 
              patients. </li>

                                    and the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) said injured Navy serviceman 
                                    Jason Chee is well supported by the National Blood Programme.<br><br>In a joint statement, they assured well wishers that there is sufficient blood for his surgeries.<br><br>The
                                     statement revealed that the <strong>Singapore Red Cross has already been 
                                    recalling donors who are due for donation and blood donors of O+ type to
                                     ensure sufficient stock.<br><br>SRC and HSA thanked donors who have been prompted by Mr Chee's incident to come forward to donate blood. </strong><br><br>They
                                     clarified that directed and replacement donations -- where families and

                                     used by the patient -- are not practised in Singapore.<br><br>The statement said blood collected at the blood banks is available to all patients who need it. <br><br>It added that voluntary and non-remunerated blood donation is key to the safety and quality of Singapore's blood supply.<br><br>It
                                     noted that because of the regular contribution of donors, there was 
                                    sufficient blood for Mr Chee and others when they needed transfusions.<br><br>Mr
                                     Chee, a regular serviceman, was injured on Monday after he got caught 
                                    between a motorised winch and a rope on Landing Ship Tank RSS Endeavour.<br><br>His elderly father has been shaken by the news, and has been taken care of by relatives.<br><br>Mr Chee is the family's only child and sole breadwinner.<br><br>He recently lost his mother, who was a kidney dialysis patient.<br><br>Mr
