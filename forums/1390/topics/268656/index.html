Yep..i tink that NS is a unifying experience for all sons of Singapore. Even when you are abroad, you can relate to another Singaporean simply by talking about yr NS experiences. Although NS might be let you see the darker side of human natre, you will be able to learn and carry the experiences with you. In short, have a goal when you start your NS life..make friends so that come 10 to 20yrs time...you will start be able to look back at these 2yrs with fond memories.<br><br>2. You will usually be required to stay in if you are in a combat vocation or in a combat unit. Combat vocations such as section commander,guardsman and rifleman. This is due to the natural of their training and role as they are usually in active battalions which requires staying in.<br><br>Stay out would usually occur in non-active units,training schools or Higher HQ such as Divisions and Brigades. As most of these places doesn't require any fuction for it's staff after working hours, the NSFs posted there would be able to stay out.<br><br>However, it must be noted that even if you are a clerk or a driver (svc voc), it would not grant u immunity from staying in. Clerks and other support staff like storeman in active battatlion are usually required to stay in as the Battalion HQ is considered part of the active unit.<br><br>Lastly, i tink it is subjective to say that staying out is much better. If you are posted to camps in LCK and Mandai and you are staying in places like Bedok or Pasir Ris then it would be pretty much a hassle to stay ou everyday. Staying out is a bit like working, where you knock off after 5pm go home and don't see your friends. However, when you are staying in, the experience of being in the army is much more genuine, where you live and breathe with the rest of your other friends. The experience after two years would contrast greatly from staying out. I'm a stay in personnel for my entire two years in the army and i spend my time fruitfully in camp, from training IPPT with my friends in the evening to watching the Tiger Cup together in our bunks and playing football and basketball in camp until the sun set. Thus, even you stay in, life can be much more fufilling than going home and rot and playing with MSN all the time. A person has to leave his comfort zone from time to time to know how fortunate one is<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello, p4rad0x. Welcome to the brotherhood ~lol~ Oldtimer here. I've tried to qualify my responses where applicable, having finished my NS &amp; reservist commitments in 1988 &amp; 2001 respectively. But the basic rationale behind NS "composition" remains the same as old, even though we're sorta in a transition phrase right now. (To refresh, 2004 saw the reduction of NS to a standardized 2 yrs, as well as the implementation of a 5-day workwork. 2006 saw the commencement of the transformation to a so-called 3G SAF. The first batches who served under these measures have only just entered the reservist ranks, at best.)<br><br>You also left some important details out of your profile, so I'm assuming your overseas education ended in Grade 12 (i.e no diploma) &amp; that your current age is 17 (at least). Note too that you may end up doing your NS in the SPF (Police) or SCDF (Civil Defense) too, something which this SAF forum doesn't cover in topic scope.<br><br><blockquote>1. When I report back to Singapore, and go for my Medical check-up, when will my entry date in NS most likely be?</blockquote>Officially, at the first opportunity once you turn 18. (Yes, you can apply for early enlistment, under the VEES scheme. Look for the applicable form at the NS portal site.) Keep in mind that Tekong traditionally recruits their BMT intakes in quarterly clusters; hence its December/March &amp; the June/September batches are known as "A-Level" &amp; "Polytechnic" batches respectively.<br><br>In my time, about 40% of enlistable personnel would head to Tekong first, earmarked as future junior commanders or combat-support troops. The other 60% were posted to either SBMT (future combat-service troops), to the unit itself ("mono-intakers "), or to the SPF or SCDF. Assuming you're enlisting based on your HS qualifications, methinks there's a chance you may do your BMT in either of the latter three routes instead. Be nosy &amp; see what PES medical status you obtain during your medical checkup; it won't confirm anything but can nonetheless logically exclude you from certain deployments.<br><br>I suspect today there's a higher percentage of Tekong recruits, since the old SBMT has been remodelled &amp; re-sited to the island itself.<br><br><blockquote>2. After getting my Medical check-up will I still be able to return to Hong kong?</blockquote>Yes, you can. But, at the same time, you'll be subject to stricter exit-control measures, esp. pertaining to passport validity, exit permit &amp; parental bond (bank guarantee).

Any tips for someone who has never lived in Singapore but is a Singaporean Citizen? I think Im going to have problems adjusting and fitting in,</blockquote>With NS itself, you should be able to get by as long as you can speak English. The de facto "working" language, esp. down in the combat unit itself, tends to be Hokkien, although the lingo has become more &amp; more adulterated with the passing of time (plus better-educated troops). Singlish, in other words.<br><br>Still, non-Hokkien speakers like the Malays &amp; Indians were ultimately able to pick basics of the dialect even in my time, so I don't foresee any problem here. Instead, I sense your biggest hurdle with communication will likely be with the drill commands (which are in Malay). Google around for the various such lists posted online by school uniformed groups, so as to familiarize yourself with the pronunciations.<br><br><blockquote>4. While serving NS will I have any free time apart from Weekends? </blockquote>Depends on where you're posted. But, other than BMT, you can get nights off whenever there's no training or duties scheduled. If you "burn" a weekend due to field exercise or something, then you're owed a "off-in-lieu" &amp; can take (mostly ordered to take) the day off once the training timetable permits so.<br><br><blockquote>1. If I am entered into NS this year, 2007, will my projected date of completion be 2009? </blockquote>No need to project. Just mark out 2 calendar years after your date of enlistment, then sing (to the tune of It's a long way to Tipperary): "Only X days to my O-R-D / only X days to go / Only X days to my O-R-D / To the sweetest day I know / Goodbye my Platoon PC / Farewell R-S-M / Only X more days to my O-R-D / Then y'll can kiss my a$$" ~lol~<br><br>I believe you can disrupt early for tiertary studies, though. They used to have a minimum-time served (24 months for those serving 2.5 yrs) before one can apply -- no sure what's the policy now, since everyone's serving 2 yrs. The other guideline was that one could disrupt one week (local vasities) or two weeks (overseas vasities) before his new school-term began, over &amp; above the minimum time served.<br><br>Whatever it is, it's assessed on an individual basis, after one applies through the unit. (Note that "to disrupt" &amp; "to defer" means different things in NS.)<br><br><blockquote>2. What is the difference between stay-in camp vocations and out? </blockquote>Not so much vocations, but more the unit one's posted to. In operational outfits, even rear-echelon personnel like storemen or clerks must reside in camp (together with the combat troops). Stay-in basically means you can go for nights off during weekdays whenever there's nothing officially on, but must report back again before midnight (2359 hrs). The majority of conscripts will stay-in. Those who stay-out can leave after office hours, usually 6pm after last parade (where the next day's routine orders are read out &amp; any other instructions also passed down). But the commute to &amp; from home can be expensive &amp; a grind, if you live far away.<br><br><blockquote>3. When I am serving in National service, will I be able to leave the country during weekends or holidays?</blockquote>Yes, but unlikely. NS is full-time duty, after all. The first six months or so (3 months BMT, 3 months vocation training) is pretty regimented for almost everyone, longer if posted to do a leadership course too at SISPEC (6 months of NCO/vocational training) or OCS (10 months of officer/vocational training).<br><br>Thereafter, those who're in ops-ready units or in training schools tend to have their entitled leave &amp; days off tightly controlled, totally dependent on organizational needs.<br><br>To travel to, say, Malaysia for the weekend, a full-time NSF must still tell his unit his whereabouts prior too. (Used to need an exit permit to go overseas for 24-plus hrs, but that was in the old days.) It doesn't mean a blanket ban, however, unless he's doing mob manning &amp; is a key personnel. By all means, take advantage of a long weekend to fly to HK; just keep your immediate commanders informed &amp; then return promptly. If it's any consolation, reservists are subjected to this obligation too.</div>
