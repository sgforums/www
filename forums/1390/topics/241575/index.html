We are not as fit and probably not as disciplined as some other countries but we know some lessons that our neighbour's guys take for granted e.g. We travel at night and as much as possible we keep off roads. Sounds simple but many of our neighbours don't follow these rules. A road-bound infantry who travel in the day are easy targets. The reason they don't follow these rules are lack of Night Fighting Equipment, lack of Navigation equipment (GPS) and basic navigation training for non-officers.<br><br>In times of real war, the Guards and Commandos will be "blazing forth first" but their job is to maneuvre and fly around or behind the enemy and attack them from the flanks or from behind. It will be the Infantry and Armour that maintain and fight the bloody battles at the Frontline. The infantry will move in to secure terrain, get Infantry Pioneers to take out mines and other obstacles and let the Armour move through. Infantry will bear the brunt and we will do the dirty work and yes, we are the most vulnerable but we are also the most needed. The enemy can kill off the Guards and Commandos and we'll still survive, but if they kill the Infantry, the front collapses and it's Game Over.</div>

Firstly, I think now for the infantry battalions, they are trained in both heli-ops and naval insertion ops, so I doubt this is anything special for Guards. The GDS orbat and the INF orbat also the same, from manpower all the way to weapons &amp; equipment too. I think ATEC also same. My NSF pay is definitely the same as my frens from INF. So sometimes, I wonder why SAF still wants a GDS formation.<br><br>Hmmm.........Guards is "glamarous" you got to be kinding with me. From my conversation with others, bothe male and female. The female will definitely know wads is infantry and she will not know wad is GDS. For the male, the typical response is "..........so, how is the feeling of standing at the Istana like?"</div>

Heck, we are toying around with camera balls, SAR-21 with LCD screens............., yet our servicemen are deprived of decent NVGs. Besides, NVGs are nothing special or high tech.
