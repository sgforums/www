              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Motive behind misreading of book on SAF</strong></span><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>by David Boey</em></span><em> @ Feb 14, 2003 Friday</em><br> <br> BILATERAL ties between Singapore and Malaysia have gone through a
                      bad patch<br> lately, with verbal spats turning distinctly belligerent. Malaysian
                      Foreign<br> Minister Syed Hamid Albar said on Dec 31 last year: 'Singapore has
                      two choices:<br> If it refuses to compromise, go to war.'<br> <br> Adding to the strain were reports in Malaysian newspapers that used
                      extracts<br> from a book by British academic Tim Huxley, titled Defending The
                      Lion City: The<br> Armed Forces Of Singapore, out of context.<br> <br> Dr Huxley supervised my master's dissertation on Singapore's
                      defence policy<br> when I studied at the University of Hull in England several years
                      ago. The<br> preface of his contentious book cites a Singaporean journalist who
                      'contributed<br> substantially to my knowledge of the subject'.<br> <br> I am the journalist mentioned. I will point out later how his book
                      has been<br> misread. But first, some comments on Singapore-Malaysia
                      political brinkmanship.<br> <br> A similarly tense period occurred in 1991 when Malaysia and
                      Indonesia staged<br> joint military manoeuvres, code-named Exercise Malindo Darsasa 3AB,
                      on<br> peninsular Malaysia from July to August. This was then the largest
                      military<br> exercise between Malaysia and Indonesia.<br> <br> The highlight of the exercise involved dropping paratroops in
                      southern Johor,<br> just 18 km from Singapore's border. The airborne landing site was
                      just minutes<br> away by car from the Causeway.<br> <br> From Singapore's perspective, the exercise was seen as a deliberate
                      ploy to<br> test how the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) would react to a
                      large-scale military<br> exercise on its doorstep.<br> <br> And lest Singapore's defence planners missed the message, the
                      airdrop was<br> codenamed Pukul Habis (Malay for 'Total Wipeout'). It was also
                      executed with<br> unprecedented proximity to Singapore on Aug 9 - Singapore's
                      National Day.<br> <br> <strong>MOBILISATION</strong><br> <br> SINGAPORE responded by launching an Open Mobilisation Exercise at
                      5.30 pm on<br> National Day eve. In those pre-Internet days, the exercise was
                      widely<br> publicised on Singapore's television and radio news on Aug 8 and
                      received Page<br> One treatment in local newspapers on Aug 9 - the day on which the
                      Pukul Habis<br> airdrop took place.<br> <br> Fast forward to Sunday, Jan 26, 2003. The SAF conducts its second
                      Open Mobex<br> for 2003. This was barely a fortnight after the year's first Open
                      Mobex on Jan<br> 11.<br> <br> Since Singapore's first Open Mobex was held on July 8, 1985, there
                      have been<br> only two instances when Mindef held such exercises twice in the
                      same month - in<br> June 1987 and in May 1988.<br> <br> The latest mobilisation was notable as it was held one day after
                      Foreign<br> Minister S. Jayakumar made his landmark parliamentary speech
                      on Singapore-Malaysia relations.<br> <br> The drill also coincided with Malaysia's apparent bid that same
                      weekend to hike<br> up military activity in Johor. After weeks of provocative talk, the
                      Malaysians<br> used a Malaysian Armed Forces (MAF) career expo in Johor to display
                      some of the<br> MAF's firepower.<br> <br> The SAF rarely mobilises troops on a Sunday. And when it accords
                      full media<br> coverage for the exercise, one can sense that Singapore's Ministry
                      of Defence<br> (Mindef) wants its deterrent message heard loud and clear.<br> <br> The Open Mobex publicity, when augmented with moves to quietly
                      enhance the<br> SAF's defence readiness, represents a carefully-controlled,
                      measured approach<br> to warn outsiders of Singapore's readiness to deal with
                      military contingencies.<br> <br> Singapore cannot allow itself to be desensitised to bellicose talk
                      or hyped-up<br> military activity close to its border. If it chooses not to respond
                      to such<br> unneighbourly activity, Singapore risks sending a signal that
                      war-like remarks<br> will be tolerated - or worse, that the city-state has been cowed
                      into silence -<br> everytime the tone of language used breaches accepted behaviour
                      among erstwhile<br> friends.<br> <br><strong> Now back to Dr Huxley's contentious book.</strong><br> <br> The book is not new. It was published in early 2000 and has since
                      gone through<br> five print runs of 2,000 copies each. When it first hit the
                      bookshelves, it<br> attracted hardly any attention in the Malaysian media or academic
                      community.<br> <br> Defence watchers should also note that the Johor scenario - that
                      the SAF would<br> invade Johor and defeat the MAF in a matter of hours - is not new
                      either. Dr<br> Huxley first published his thoughts on this scenario way back in
                      1991 in an<br> article in The Pacific Review titled 'Singapore and Malaysia: A
                      Precarious Balance?'.<br> <br><strong> MISCHIEVOUS MOTIVE</strong><br> <br> IT'S fine to trawl up a two-year-old book to give a fresh spin to
                      articles on<br> Singapore-Malaysia defence relations. But when a critical point in
                      the analysis<br> is glossed over, one cannot help but start to doubt the motives of
                      the writers.<br> <br> That critical point concerns the SAF's strategy of
                      deterrence.<br> <br> At no point in the book did Dr Huxley conclude that the SAF would
                      be used as an<br> occupation force in a war of conquest.<br> <br> To suggest what the author has not intended, or to perceive
                      something that the<br> text clearly does not say, is mischievous and intellectually
                      dishonest.<br> <br> If this is the way Malaysian commentators react to what I and
                      others think is<br> an impartial study on the SAF, then Singaporeans should brace
                      themselves for<br> more fiery, yet lop-sided diatribes when new additions like AH-64D
                      Apache<br> attack choppers, 155mm self-propelled heavy artillery and stealth
                      frigates are<br> added to the SAF's arsenal in due course.<br> <br> In his book, Dr Huxley spells out the strategy of deterrence
                      clearly. He says:<br> 'The key to understanding Singapore's strategy, though, is that the
                      SAF's clear<br> capability to inflict severe damage on Malaysia (by implication,
                      creating<br> serious political and economic repercussions for Singapore) is not
                      intended to<br> be used. The capability is a deterrent - a sort of regional
                      'doomsday machine'<br> intended to manipulate Singapore's regional threat environment by
                      forcing<br> neighbouring states to treat the city-state with a degree of
                      respect and<br> caution which might otherwise be absent.'<br> <br> It is ironic that the kinship Singapore values with Malaysia, which
                      is perhaps<br> best underscored by the Malayan Tiger sharing pride of place with
                      the Singapore<br> Lion on Singapore's Coat of Arms, has been so taken for granted in
                      the frequent<br> games of political brinkmanship.<br> <br> <em>The writer is a Business Times correspondent. He contributed this

              <p><strong>What
               does a Southeast Asian country do when it is small but has a big air 
              force? In Singapore's case, it disperses its planes and, indeed, some of
               its ground forces as well, to many different places around the world 
              for training.</strong></p>
              <p><br> Singapore has by far the largest and most potent air force in Southeast 
              Asia. It is part of the government's longstanding 'poison shrimp' 
              defence strategy, which is intended to warn any larger country that 
              trying to swallow the island state would be painful.</p>
              <p><br> Singapore carries a big stick, but chooses not to flaunt it. One reason 
              the government keeps a substantial part of its military force abroad is 
              to avoid alarming or provoking its neighbours, particularly Malaysia and
               Indonesia. Yet in a crisis, the aircraft could be ferried home within 
              days.</p>
              <p><br> As a prosperous island state in the middle of an increasingly turbulent 
              region, Singapore has long maintained a strong defence force. But 
              keeping it well-trained and combat-ready is a constant challenge.</p>
              <p><br> With a total land area of just 660 sq km, Singapore has correspondingly 
              small airspace, making it impossible to give air force pilots any 
              extensive training or flying experience within national boundaries. The 
              pilots must turn into a narrow transit corridor that takes them to one 
              of only two relatively extensive training areas available.</p>
              <p><br> One, over the Indonesian island of Sumatra, is the result of an 
              agreement with the Indonesian government. The other, over international 
              airspace in the South China Sea, is jointly administered with Malaysia. 
              But in 1998 - in one of a series of spats between the two countries - 
              Malaysia alleged that low-flying Singapore military planes were spying 
              and banned them from its airspace.</p>
              <p><br> Singapore's airspace is also congested because it is a busy civilian 
              aviation hub. Such factors, combined with erratic tropical weather 
              conditions, are severe constraints.</p>
              <p><br> As a result, at least one quarter of Singapore's force of about 150 
              planes and helicopters is stationed abroad at any one time, mainly in 
              the United States, France and Australia.</p>
              <p><br> Short-term training for its military pilots  is done in Indonesia, South Africa, Bangladesh, Brunei, New Zealand and Canada.</p>
              <p><br> Faced with competing demands for land for industry, business, housing 
              and recreation in Singapore, the 50,000-man army and 300,000 reservists 
              are also being squeezed out.  They, too, have to train and exercise 
              overseas regularly, mainly in Australia, Brunei, Taiwan, Thailand and 
              New Zealand. Singapore is developing closer military ties with India and
               is expected to seek an agreement this year for its forces to train 
              there.</p>
              <p><br> The costs involved in transporting troops and equipment over such long 
              distances, and of paying for the foreign training rights, are a 
              significant part of Singapore's annual defence spending of some S$8.3 
              billion  (HK$38.1 billion), or about 5 per cent of gross domestic 
              product.</p>
              <p><br> The need to move the army and air force regularly over long distances 
              has also been cited by officials as one of the main reasons for getting 
              new equipment, including four locally built, missile-armed naval 
              transport craft,   and four long-range KC-135 tanker aircraft from the 
              US. They can refuel all types of fighter jets in the Singapore air force
               while they are flying.</p>
              <p><br> Military ties with the US are especially close. The Singapore air force 
              has five separate training detachments at different American bases.</p>
              <p><br> Two are for its F-16 fighters, and once each for its CH-47 Chinook 
              heavy-lift helicopters, its Apache Longbow attack helicopters, and its 
              KC-135 tankers.</p>
              <p><br> Stationing forces abroad is designed to improve their training and 
              enhance their ability to operate with partner nations. In a crisis, of 
              course, they could be flown back to Singapore. This was shown for the 
              first time in October 2002, when five of Singapore's F-16's and two 
              KC-135 tankers stationed in the US flew home, via Hawaii and Guam, for a
               joint exercise with the US in the South China Sea.</p>
              <p><br> To take advantage of better weather and extensive flying space, 
              Singapore some years ago shifted its entire basic jet training unit to 
              the Australian air force base at Pearce, near Perth in Western 
              Australia.</p>
              <p><br> Around the same time, it reached a separate agreement with Australia to 
              station 12 of Singapore's Super Puma helicopters for 15 years at the 
              Australian army base of Oakey in Queensland.</p>
              <p><br> 'Increasingly close defence relations with the US, Australia, New 
              Zealand, Britain and France have helped to anchor these friendly powers'
               regional security presence in Singapore, improving the city state's 
              security by complicating the calculations of likely aggressors,' said 
              Tim Huxley, senior fellow for Asia-Pacific Security at the International
               Institute for Strategic Studies in London and author of a book on the 
              Singapore military.</p>
              <p><br> Eighteen of Singapore's 50 upgraded A4-SU Super Skyhawk fighter-bombers,
               along with nearly 400 Singapore air force personnel and family members,
               are stationed at the Cazaux air base in southwest France. The planes 
              and crew rotate every two years.</p>
              <p>The deployment, which the French government has agreed to continue at 
              least until 2018, was first agreed in 1998. Singapore is the only 
              non-member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to be allowed to undertake long-term military training in France.</p>
