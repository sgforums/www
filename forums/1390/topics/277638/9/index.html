            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SpecOps87:</div><div class="quote_body">Well...he can't be charged with illegal possession of a firearm because under Chpt.13 of the Arms and Explosives Act, states that:<br><br>Exemptions from operation of this Act<br>3. Â—(1) Subject to subsection (3), nothing in this Act shall apply to Â—<br>c) any of the following persons or their equipment while in the course of their duty or employment:<br><br>(i) members of the Singapore Armed Forces and of any visiting forces lawfully present in Singapore<br><br>So he's not in illegal possession. Because the weapon was issued to him for duty purposes of protecting the camp. </div></blockquote>Wrong. He was not on or in the course of duty or employment once he left the camp - because his duty/employment does not allow/require him to take the rifle home or to orchard road without authorisation.<br><br>This is not analagous to soldiers to who carry weapons and walk along the high way in say Lorong Asrama. That is incidental to duty/employment and hence will probably be covered. I think ultimately it is a matter of degree and I do not thin what he did will fall on the legal side of the line.<br><br>Also people talking about him not being in unlawful posession because he was issued the weapon - again, that interpretation is too simplistic and very likely to be wrong. He was issued the weapon for a particular purpose - once he stepped beyond the boundaries of that consent or permisson, I think arguably he can be said to be in unlawful posession.<br><br>Can't really be bothered to do reasearch on the area but confident that my interpretation is along the right lines.</div>
