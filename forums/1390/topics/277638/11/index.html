I did not have a chance to finish reading the whole blog, so I cant comment on that much. But as I had said, if you cant stand the way someone treat you badly, why not end the r/s earlier?<br><br><blockquote>20070412 Its all over..I know, i'm the one who broke up and caused all these. But seriously, i cant take in anymore. I've reached my limits, i'd rather both of us get hurt now, then dragging this pain any furthur. <strong>Being with you all these years, i really loved you</strong>, but then again. The bad memories triumph over the good, so whats the point?<br><br><strong>I loved you.<br><br>What am i to do? Never will i fall in love again</strong>.</blockquote>This was what she posted on her old blog, althou it was taken down, but still can see it thru google cache. She said she still love him and would never fall in love again. But within a week or so, she got together with a girl and proclaim that she love her.<br></div>
