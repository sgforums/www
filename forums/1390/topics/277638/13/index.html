LOL!<br>What I was doing is to provide an alternative view to this case. My hypothesis is that he may have been brought up in a different environment and culture so his understanding of SG society and societal norms is limited, thus he may have did it out of a moment of folly. Eg. in PRC BB guns and guns replicas are allowed, so if he was an ex-PRC citizen he may have thought that stealing the rifle is not big deal as long as he returns the rifle after threatening his gf with it.<br>I really pity the other guy. Think of it this way, if you know your friend is mentally unstable and he has a rifle with him on the spot.... Do you think it is prudent to tell him you gonna call the cops? No right? If not he might just load rifle and finish you off. Who noes it might be the guy that persuaded him all this while not to use the firearm against anyone.

Whether a local born or ex-PRC citizen, any SAF serviceman knows how serious it is to take a loaded weapon out of camp without authorisation. There is no grounds for throwing aspersions on foreign-born citizens in this instance.<br><br>It would be silly for the other guy to say that he was going to inform the police. There is no need to. Just call the police on the mobile phone. If Teo had used the weapon to injure or kill innocent civilians, Ong would be been equally guilty of conspiracy to murder.</div>
