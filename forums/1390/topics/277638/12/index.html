Many foreigners do not understand the severity and consequences of some actions. For example, going to ORD liao, I believe whatever grieviance or unhappiness can be settled outside after ORD as most ppl won't want to do things to jepordise the ORD. But for foreigners, they may not see this. In other countries, ppls are more willing to let their voices to be heard and do things in a more extreme manner. Example, most have read news before of construction workers killing their counterparts or wounding them due to arguements after a drink or gambling game. Perhaps, fighting or violence is acceptable means to settle problem, so they do not know that it is an offence here. So I think the CPL may belong to this group.

And Teo would think that there were no manhunt for him ?<br><br>Before Teo absconded, he must already pre-empted that he will be hunted. Therefore, he went to some obscure hotel to avoid detection.<br><br>The story line would have been very different if he has shot someone before the Police caught him.<br><br>I still think that the Police should have warn the public at the earliest opportunity and this may lead to his earlier arrest.

The man was carrying a SAR-21 around town. What's his motive for doing it? Why did the SAF allow such incident to happen? What if he had used the gun and hurt not only the gal, but also innocent bystander? Do u know that more tears, more questioning and more discussion would erupt if that happens?<br><br>He was being irrational in not thinking straight, and quite simply he was blinded by love/hatred to do the thing he did. God knows what he was planning to do. While I pity the guy, the thing is, he had to be punished to serve as deterrant to others. And his punishment will not be light, I can assure you. That is unless he can prove that he was of mental unsound when he carried the rifle out of camp. Even then, he would still be charged under military law. In the end, he ruined himself, the media and us talking about this matter did not.</div>
