She went down with her parents to complain to the police. She felt bad for doing it cuz she didn't want to ruin the life of his parents and grandparents. But I guess they were forced to act. I don't know what he was thinking cuz I haven't seen his blog.<br><br>Come on la. The kids these days use the word like nothing. I was teaching in a sec school before. And every kid proclaims it from the rooftops, in their friendster, on their msn, in their blogs about how much they love the guy. And the next thing you know, they've changed bfs. It's the culture nowadays.<br><br>I think she made it clear to him that they were no more. And she changed her blog because she wanted to get rid of all that "I love you" stuffs.<br><br>But she's got that much "I love you"s on her new blog for her newfound love. Heh :p<br><br></div>
