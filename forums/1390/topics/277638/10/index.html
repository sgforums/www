            <div class='col-md body'>Ok so what the they are bf &amp; gf relationship last time. For whatever reasons ... they broke off . As mention he is a nut case that call &amp; SMS to control her movement. You got this nutcase who did not want to let her go ... go to the house of the GF to kick a fuss a few times, and threaten to kill the whole family ...!!!<br><br>Then out of the blue - one night police when you happy at chalet then police all you - that your ex have a gun maybe out looking to shoot you and family ....<br><br>If you are the ex-girl friend ? what you want her to say !!! I would say tell the guy to die !!!<br><br>As for limelight - as the ex-girl friend - why not isn't it the best time to tell the whole world what an horror this guy is - after he come to house to make trouble and threaten to kill whole family .... you put yourself in her shoe ... it would be the best time to tell the whole bloody world , she got nothing or want to have nothing to do with a nut case like him.<br><br></div>

I read through her old blog too. Never in her blog did she mentioned that he was possessive, called her 5 times a day, sms, etc. Instead, she kept saying how much she missed him, etc., for example, when he was away in Brunei.<br><br>Now why the sudden change of heart? Yes, this guy may be nuts.. but what I think a respectable and responsible ex-gf should do at this point in time is to keep her mouth shut instead of shooting off this one-sided story to the press.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i just think cpl teo's ex gf just wanted to be famous as some forumers have said. typical people will protect the rights of the detained (cpl teo) but she decided to spill the beans so early. trying to reveal so much will mean she wants everyone to knw she is a 'victim'.<br><br>however on cpl teo's side, we also know he has commited grave offences liable to army and civilian law. could be because he treated her badly which is why she wanted to spill the beans and cause more damage?</div>
