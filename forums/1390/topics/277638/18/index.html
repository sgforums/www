His disappearance while on guard duty on Sept 2 at Mandai Hill Camp triggered a 20-hour islandwide manhunt that ended with Teo's arrest the next day at Orchard Cineleisure shopping mall.<br><br>According to the minister, Teo is believed to have left the camp premises by climbing down from the second floor of his guardroom. There is a 3-metre drop from the concrete parapet outside the second floor of the guardroom to the public carpark outside his camp.<br><br>The windows on the second storey of the two-storey guardroom have since been secured with aluminium grilles.<br><br>Mr Teo said the incident involving Teo, which is now before the Courts, resulted in a thorough review of the incident by a High Board of Inquiry to assess how it could have taken place.<br><br>This was complemented by a a security review of SAF military installations to plug weaknesses in the design of existing camps to ensure military personnel cannot sneak out.<br><br>The SAF also reviewed current procedures that govern how arms and ammunition are handled by SAF personnel.<br><br>Teo faces three charges: for carrying a firearm in the Orchard Cineleisure toilet where he was arrested, unlawfully possessing eight rounds of rifle ammunition, and possession of a 40cm knife in public in April.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A more detailed look at what went wrong..<br><br>Three lapses in the SAF's systems and procedures have been identified (from the CNA article)<br><br><strong>1. Implementation and supervision of guard room procedures at Mandai Hill Camp on that night when Corporal Teo slipped out.</strong><br><br>- Guards on patrol duties are also required to make situational reporting to the guard room at half-hour intervals but these were not enforced properly or Corporal Teo's absence would have been detected earlier.<br><br><strong>2. There was a flaw in the physical construction of Mandai Hill Camp that enabled him to escape without being detected.</strong><br><br>- Investigations showed that Corporal Teo did not leave by the camp gates but absconded by jumping the far corner of the second-floor parapet of the Guard Room onto the carpark outside the camp premises, which was out of the visual scope of the other guards.<br><br><strong>3. Mismanagement of the post-incident reporting procedures which require quick reporting of all serious incidents including missing arms and ammunition.</strong><br><br>- For serious security incidents such as those involving missing arms and ammunition, the unit's Duty Operations Officer is required to report the incident to the Army's General Staff Operations Centre within 30 minutes.<br><br>However, in this case, Corporal Teo, together with his firearm and ammunition, was only discovered missing by the Guard Commander at 11.59pm on 2 Sept but the Army's General Staff Operations Centre was only informed of this incident at 3am the next day.<br><br>The Military Police were alerted at 3.30am and when their preliminary investigations showed that the missing firearm and ammunition were no longer on the camp premises, the Police were contacted at 5.45am.<br><br>--<br>Full Article below<br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/300336/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/300336/1/.html</a><br><br>The turnaround timing for reporting to GSOC should not have been published, IMHO.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMO Too much conflicting public info to ascertain whatever his plans was, for now. Sure looks like he had something in mind, though.<br><br>When the news broke, CNA TV &amp; then its tabloid reported a Thai woman had earlier booked the Geylang hotel room Teo would spend the early hours on Monday morning in. But ST reported that Teo had booked it himself "for 4 nights -- starting last Friday." They later clarified that it was done "in the name of a Thai woman -- although Teo signed for the room keys &amp; paid the $30 per night room rate. It is believed that the Thai woman, who signed in as 'Kanjama' in the hotel records, has also been picked up by police."<br><br>Funny design, today's guardrooms (two-storey buildings). Is the escape route illustrated in the pix correct? Viewed literally, it means the ground-floor door opens OUTSIDE of the camp. If so, how to securely turn out the guards? Or is it meant to imply that the other side of the building (hidden in the picture) also has the same window ledge?<br><br>Hmm, what's with the 4-hour shifts? That means, with 12 guards &amp; two pairs always on duty (sentry &amp; prowler), the others get to rest for EIGHT hours. Granted, it was a Sunday, but that's a very long rest period.<br><br>Methinks the duty DO may also be charged, but will probably kena only a reprimand or a fine.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: Three lapses in the SAFÂ’s systems and procedures have been identified concerning the recent incident where a fullÂ—time national serviceman walked out of Mandai Hill Camp with his rifle and ammunition during his guard duty, said Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean.<br><br>20Â—yearÂ—old fullÂ—time national serviceman Corporal Dave Teo, who was serving as an infantryman in the First Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment (1 SIR) has been charged with illegally carrying a firearm after escaping from his camp on the night of 2 September and was caught at Cineleisure on Orchard Road after a 20Â—hour manhunt.<br><br>Speaking in Parliament on Monday, Minister Teo said the SAF had convened a Higher Board of Inquiry (HBOI) to determine how the incident took place and while it reviewed that the SAFÂ’s current systems are sound, they rely on people for effective implementation.<br><br>In this case, the first weakness the HBOI identified was the implementation and supervision of guard room procedures at Mandai Hill Camp on that night when Corporal Teo slipped out.<br><br>It also revealed that there was a flaw in the physical construction of Mandai Hill Camp that enabled him to escape without being detected.<br><br>The third lapse was the mismanagement of the postÂ—incident reporting procedures, which require quick reporting of all serious incidents including missing arms and ammunition.<br><br>On 2 September, Corporal Teo was assigned patrolling duty and its procedures require it to be conducted on twoÂ—hour shifts and in pairs.<br><br>Guards on patrol duties are also required to make situational reporting to the guard room at halfÂ—hour intervals but these were not enforced properly or Corporal TeoÂ’s absence would have been detected earlier.<br><br>The campÂ’s physical security is also in question as it has been designed to prevent unauthorized entry and not unauthorized exit.<br><br>Investigations showed that Corporal Teo did not leave by the camp gates but absconded by jumping the far corner of the secondÂ—floor parapet of the Guard Room onto the carpark outside the camp premises, which was out of the visual scope of the other guards.<br><br>Before doing so, he dismantled his rifle and concealed it in his field pack.<br><br>This incident has also brought to light a significant breach of reporting standards.<br><br>For serious security incidents such as those involving missing arms and ammunition, the unitÂ’s Duty Operations Officer is required to report the incident to the ArmyÂ’s General Staff Operations Centre within 30 minutes.<br><br>However, in this case, Corporal Teo, together with his firearm and ammunition, was discovered missing by the Guard Commander at 11.59pm on 2 September, but the ArmyÂ’s General Staff Operations Centre was only informed of this incident at 3am the next day.<br><br>The Military Police were alerted at 3.30am and when their preliminary investigations showed that the missing firearm and ammunition were no longer on the camp premises, the Police were contacted at 5.45am.<br><br>When Corporal Teo was arrested, his firearms and eight rounds of ammunition were recovered. All five rounds of 5.56 ammunition which were issued to him for guard duty on 2 September were retrieved.<br><br>However, investigations revealed that additional three 5.56 millimetre tracer rounds were used during a section live firing exercise that he participated in two weeks earlier. The police and the SAF are still investigating exactly how he acquired those three tracer rounds.<br><br>Minister Teo stressed that concrete action by MINDEF and the SAF have been taken to rectify the three lapses.<br><br>He added that following this incident, the SAF has audited and reviewed the camp guard security of all SAF camps to determine if such nonÂ—compliance of orders or procedures exists in other camps.<br><br>However, Mr Teo said that the audit revealed that this was a problem localised to this unit.<br><br>Nonetheless, the SAF has stepped up the frequency of security audits of all SAF camps and will continue to focus on effective training and supervision to ensure that servicemen at all levels know the procedures and how to implement them.<br><br>Personnel found to have been negligent in their conduct of duties in this case will also be punished.<br><br>During an interview with his Platoon Commander in June this year, Corporal Teo admitted that he was stressed over relationship problems with his girlfriend.<br><br>The criminal case against Corporal Teo is pending.<strong></strong></div>
