            <div class='col-md body'>Manouvering a 3ton/5ton is way tougher than a civilian car and have you ever drove a 3ton at more than 50kmph.

The landrover is not even tested on. I can only assume its because they take it as a given that being able to handle a class4 vehicle means u can handle a class3 just as well or even better.<br><br>You don't ask people taking Class2B license to take Class2A license 1st do you?<br><br>Doesn't it show that they no confidence in the military license holder that it can handle a vehicle outside.<br><br>Anyway, Dual-Vocat do go for class3 and class 4 license.

My vocation is transport sup. As you  know, transport sup don't go on details much except on overseas ex. I ORDed with only 2000km ++ mileage.<br><br>How much do you fall short from the required 7000?<br><br>Also, before i orded, i heard they are going to implement more changes to make a drivers task of converting to civi license harder. One accident nowadays and there goes your civi license. They are also going to implement a tracking system and new points reduction system to totally screw up drivers/transport sups more. IMTL west and east are going to implement it first.<br><br>Why all the fear? Here's a good suggestion to SAF. Employ DXO drivers who already owns a civi license as the complete package new SAF driver. Employ transportation companies' management people as our MTOs/MT warrants. [sacarsm]After all, we all know NSFs can't be trusted with anything[/sacarsm].</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>military license lousier than civilian license? nah, i believe you drive better than those that just got their license from driving centres today. but, why are you not given one then? reason being you did not clock enough mileage to be given a license just like that. in order to receive that civilian license from the SAF way, it is already very clear cut.<br><br>but you started comparing your skills/experience/drive-tonner to a civilian who drives only in a saloon car in the school circuit and its surrondings. that's where your frustration comes. just think positvely that the SAF has already given you an edge to get that civilian license with your driving background.<br><br>comparing things like this is not healthy lah. coz the example above can be applied to thousands of unfair cases in life. last time i serve 2 and half years, now people serve 2 years. so how? ask government to compensate my 6 months?? or say not fair, ask them the keep to 2 and half years?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
