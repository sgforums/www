There is no need to specially create them for the SAF. Where do you think the SAF gets their equipment made from ? Cheap made-in-China copies of originals from equally cheapskate suppliers.<br><br>For example, the hydration bags. Now they issue some cheap and leaky stuff. All they need to do is allow CamelBak and some other Brands to qualify their product against the SAF specifications (modified from Camelbak anyways) and then allow soldiers to choose between various Brands using their credits in the eMart.
