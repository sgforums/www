              <p>hi everyone in sgforums, im new to this i just joined.</p>
              <p>i have a few questions actually regarding NS. im 16.5 years old so i know im eligible for it already.</p>
              <p>actually ive been wanting to go overseas to study,for about say a year. then after that id be able to go to uni. or even 2 years. but bottomline is i wanna go overseas and study and ive talked to my father and relatives overseas about this.</p>
              <p>so im thinking,is it a good idea for me,to actually do my NS first, then leave for wherever i want to study after im 18.5-19 ? i would really like to know if u or ur friends have done something like that before.</p>
              <p><br>another option is i could go overseas first,and come back,after i give a bond of 75k or half my parents income. regarding this,my dad doesnt seem to trust the gov. on the deposit thingy,so it worries me a little. he said he knows a friend who sent his son overseas for a year and a half or something, and what his son did was he came back every 3 months to visit so he didnt have to pay a bond, ( but obviously the air tickets were where the problem lies - although i really dont mind it ).</p>
              <p>so please give ur suggestions on what i could do,and i want to remind all of u that i have no intention of CHAOING or SKIPPING NS. IM ready to do my NS , i want to be a cricket player actually so i wanna go overseas,study first,come back early in 1 year or 1.5,then do ns and go to england to train or something ( if u wanna know about my history in cricket u can pm or something im very determined to achieve my dreams ) .</p>
              <p>the reason why i say i could even do NS NOW,at 16.5 years old, or 17 (by enlistement) is cuz when im free,ill be 19,a young age still to train right? so ya,please help me out guys,and dont hate on me im not chaoing ns :) and i respect what i have to do to pay back this country for the socio-econ benefits and what not.</p>
              <p>help me out guys,and thanks for listening as i said im new to this forums and i look forward to asking more about such things here in future ( mostly regarding NS i think hahahaha :P ).</p>

              <p>Well, I went overseas but after A levels.</p>
              <p>If you go to NS at 16.5 years old, you're deemed to be uneducated hence siphoned to be man. Second, the govt is much richer than your father, so he doesn't need to worry about the govt 'cheating' or even bother to gian peng his measly $75k. It's not even enough to pay the one year salary of my friends in their mid 20s on govt payroll..and I assure they have a lot more ppl to pay and more things to spend on like fighter jets and Bionix and the money doesn't come from cheating your dad's measly $75k.</p>
              <p>There was an incentive to do your NS after sec school before JC or poly in the past because NS was 2.5 years for diploma/A level grads and 2 years for O level holders and below. This incentive disappeared ever since they scrapped this.</p>
              <p>My friends and I discussed at length last time over beer the pros and cons of doing NS first then study or the other way round.  So here are our two cents. Most did their NS first, though not all by choice. Some couldn't afford the security deposit. The PSC scholars (OMS, SAFOS) get automatic deferrence but the parents-funded students and the other scholars like SGS and stat board ones don't. if parents-funded students want, they to apply on their own and pay the deposit. Roughly less than than 2 in 10 Singaporean males in the US are studying first before doing NS. <br><br>The biggest pro of studying first is that you enjoy the momentum. you do your NS first, you hit the books again, you generally don;t do as well. in uni, those who get to disrupt tend to have better grades than those who did their NS. I mean you lose touch with academia for 2 years so that's inevitable. You need to take some time to get the momentum back. Thats why the girls also did better than the boys *chuckles<br><br>The biggest pro among those who did their NS first is that they got it over and done with. I did think of doing my NS before flying off, because that would free me to really embrace my new life overseas and so psychologically I won't have to have this cloud hanging over me: the NS liability and having to come back after 4 years to do it. Those who got it over and done with were also free to apply for jobs overseas and try to get a work permit *chuckles*.</p>

              <p>I know of a couple of fellas who enlisted early so that they can study overseas in peace.</p>
              <p>If you're already mentally and physically prepared for NS, then I suggest you might as well just do it now and get it over and done with.</p>

              <p>No one I know did this, come back every 3 mths to evade paying the bond. As someone who was happily away for close to half a decade, I can tell you that when you're there, you won't want to come back every 3 mths.</p>

              <p>Do note that you are not allowed to go uni until you complete NS even if you can go uni before the age of 20 since MINDEF does not allow deferment for uni studies. Only As or Poly studies allowed until the age of 20.</p>
              <p>If you area ready, you can of course enlist early. However early enlistment will result in you being sent to mono-intake mostly into combat units with no chance of command school.</p>
              <p>If you don't mind being a men and feel you won't have problems mixing around most of the mono intakes which are usually ITE, O's or poly halfway dropout students who some people find issues being around with, by all means go for early enlistment.</p>

                      until the age of 20.</p>
              <p>If you area ready, you can of course enlist early. However early
                      enlistment will result in you being sent to mono-intake mostly into
                      combat units with no chance of command school.</p>
              <p>If you don't mind being a men and feel you won't have problems
                      mixing around most of the mono intakes which are usually ITE, O's
                      or poly halfway dropout students who some people find issues being
                      around with, by all means go for early enlistment.</p>

              <p>It is most certainly allowed and very common for Singaporeans to go overseas to UK, US, Canadian and Australian bridging colleges and universities before they turn 20, right after O levels or after A levels. They only need to declare to Mindef and put the security deposit.</p>
