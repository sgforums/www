            <div class='col-md body'>I think i got a funny incident. Just remembered. But dunno funny or not la.<br><br>I was bored in camp and decided to follow a clerk to do house recce. He was in no3 carrying a clipboard. Private rank.<br><br>So when we reach a block... we got out of the vehicle and there was a group of bangla workers. Immediately when they saw him, they stood up and bow and greet "good morning sir".

            <div class='col-md body'>I think one of the reason is because in the countries where these foreign workers came from, the military is quite big and need to give face to them. Examples are the PLA in PRC, Myanmar and Thailand(recently) being ruled by the military. In Bangladesh, the government is weak and relies on the military to keep the country together.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
