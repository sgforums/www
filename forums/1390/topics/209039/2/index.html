Its like every time for the guards to have inspection and briefing by DO they also have their own 'parade'. When the guards go prowling they will follow as well. When the guards finish their duty the next day these dogs will disappear and will only return in the evening. Its good to have companions while prowling as my old camp is quite big and quiet.</div>
