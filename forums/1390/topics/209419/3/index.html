            <div class='col-md body'>Hi! I an NSF currently and have some advice for ur fren. Ask her not to bother with joining the Army, its just not worth it. I'm speaking from my own experiences only, no offence to others who have differing NS lives.<br><br>If ur fren wanna experience the process of forging ties, i would say that there are better ways of doing it. I believe that females can only become regular and NOT NSF...I estimate a maximum of 1yr (3mth BMT + 9mth OCS) where she gets to experience outfield training like route marches, trench digging and casualty evacuation etc....And its only this time when female OCTs bond, after that they will get posted to various units as different vocationalists. OCS graduant minimum Platoon Commander. Usually, man and commander [esp PC] hard to communicate IMO, somemore ur fren female, the more awkward if she is pro-active in bonding with her men. The above scenario is if she chooses a combat vacation, which i've seen only a few.<br><br>Majority will choose non-combat vocation like Logistics and Manpower. True, you make friends, but you also 'lose' them when your NSF surbordinates ORD. These vocationalists seldom chiong also and have less chances to do wat they did in OCS and BMT [if this is wat your friend wants]. Effectively, your friend spends 1yr forging ties with ppl who eventually will be in different units, so no point joining the Army in the 1st place.<br><br>If she wants to have the experience of enduring hardships and in the process build bonds, she is better off picking up team adventure sports as a hobby/passion. I'm sure there are such sports/events available in Singapore.<br><br>The above is if your friend were to pursue a career in the Army. I dun noe about the 2 other services, Navy and Air Force, can someone shed some light on these services?? Please, ask your friend to consider very hard before committing otherwise she'll regret it. Time lost cannot be replaced...<br><br>Something to add on, if your friend signs on, ask her to be careful of the people she mingles with. Some people are outright incompetent, extremely selfish in getting things their way, while others backstab. <strong>I'm surrounded by these decrepid people in my camp.</strong> I can say this is not a good feeling when your friend have to endure for more years than i do...Cheers!!</div>
