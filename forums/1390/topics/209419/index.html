            <div class='col-md body'>Allow me to give you a more comprehensive answer...<br>1) <strong>There is no such thing as a female citizen volunteering for National Service. </strong>At the present time, females are not required to enlist under the Enlistment Act for National Service and neither will the SAF accept such a volunteer. The only way a female can enlist is as a Regular Servicewoman who has signed a contract with the SAF as a career. As far as I know, no female volunteers for National Service have ever been enlisted into the SAF.<br><br>2) Even if your friend wants to sign on with the SAF as a career, she will need her parents to sign a statement as part of her contract if she is under 21 years old.<br><br>3) Future civilian pay will not be affected since as a female citizen, she is not eligible for NS or required for NS mobilisation etc.<br><br>4) There is no such thing as a "female NS OCT". However, Regular female OCTs do participate in the same Commissioning Parade as their male counterparts.</div>

Go and get a good degree first and then you start on a better pay scale, and better prospects. If you sign on the dotted line now, it is really up to SAF to release you for your studies (non-scholarship). Scholarships are a different thing altogether.<br><br>Why ask to enlist on NS terms for a low allowance, when you can get a salary for doing the same thing ? If she is interested only in serving for 2 years, then don't waste time. Go train and climb Everest, you get a better sense of achievement, even if you do not make it to the top. Because she (female) will also not make it to the top of SAF in her lifetime.</div>

Most female regulars I know in the SAF are in artillery, signals, armour or logistics. Very few are actually amongst the front-line combat troops, I believe.</div></blockquote>we are not even sure whether the girl in question here knows anything about the army and its various formation, vocation etc.<br><br>it might well just be a sudden impulsion, like impulsive shopping when one buys something but only to regret it later. but the different is, when u buy something and u don't like it later, u can just throw it aside. but if u sign on and regrets, u cannot simply just walk out of it. so think through this carefully.</div>
