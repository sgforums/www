              <p>Content of petition :</p>
              <p>National defense is important for Singapore. However, we should 
              review our approach to make sure that the budget and resources are 
              effectively used to produce the desired outcome.</p>
              <div><br>Our defense
               budget is high as a proportion of GDP in relation to other countries. 
              We also require our male citizens to spend two years full time for 
              military training and to be called back for reservist training over a 
              period of up to 15 years.</div>
              <div><br>Two years is too long. In many countries that have conscription, they are able to achieve their training within 12 months.</div>
              <div><br>Many
               conscripts said that the actual military training could be completed 
              within 12 months. They spend a large part of the remaining period 
              idling, doing general cleaning, being involved in National Day Parade 
              preparations, and waiting to be discharged. Their effectiveness would 
              not be compromised, if they are discharged earlier.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><a href="http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/petition-to-reduce-national-service">http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/petition-to-reduce-national-service</a><br></div>
              <div><br>Some 
              conscripts are selected to be trained as officers and need to spend more
               time on their training. These conscripts should have to serve an 
              additional 6 to 12 months, but they should be paid a higher allowance to
               make it worth their time.</div>
              <div><br>If there are insufficient NS 
              men who are keen to be selected as officers, this role should be 
              performed by career soldiers. It is costly to train an officer and this 
              investment can get better results when they are given to career 
              soldiers.</div>
              <div><br>We also need to review the regular call-up for 
              reservist training. This is a heavy strain on the work and family life 
              of the NS men. It is also a disadvantage to them, when they have to 
              compete for jobs against non-citizens who do not have to be called up. 
              Many employers do not like to see the disruption to their work schedule 
              and prefer to employ non-citizens.</div>
              <p><br>We also need to review 
              the remedial training (RT) that NS men have to do for failing the 
              physical proficiency (IPPT) test. It is unfair that non-regulars have to
               meet the same passing requirements as professional soldiers. 
              Professional soldiers use working hours to keep fit but the non-regulars
               cannot ask their employer to give them time within working hours to 
              keep fit.<br>CALL TO SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT<br>This is a call to the 
              Singapore Government to reduce the duration of full time conscription 
              from 24 months to 12 months, and to reduce the call-up for reservist and
               remedial training</p>

              <p>In the last few months, we held Focus Group
                                                  Discussions (FGDs) where different people came together to share
                                                  their experiences with NS, the strengths of NS and areas to be
                                                  strengthened, as well as their aspirations for NS. We thank our
                                                  participants for taking the time to share their ideas and
                                                  experiences.</p>
              <p>We will go into more specific

                                                  juggling NS duties with other commitments. Juggling In-Camp
                                                  Training and IPPT can be challenging. Some have also shared their
                                                  worries about falling behind in terms of education and when they

              <p>SINGAPORE – About two-thirds of Singaporeans surveyed said they
              are receptive to first-generation Permanent Residents (PRs)
              contributing to national defence as volunteers.</p>
              <p>This survey of 1,251 citizens, which was commissioned by the
              Committee to Strengthen National Service, found that more than 43
              per cent of respondents felt that first-generation PRs should serve
              two-year full-time National Service (NS); and more than 60 per cent
              agreed that PRs could serve in a professional role in the defence
              of Singapore or as a volunteer at NS events.</p>
              <p>“There is strong endorsement for that. Seventy-seven per cent
              said first-gen PR should be allowed to contribute to defence as a
              volunteer,” said Dr Leong Chan-Hoong, the Institute of Policy
              Studies researcher behind this survey on attitudes towards NS.</p>
              <p>The survey, which was conducted between July and September, this
              year, also probed attitudes on women in NS. Over 70 per cent of
              respondents – both men and women – support having women serve in
              the defence force in a professional role and/or having women serve
              as volunteers to help out at national events.</p>
              <p>Overall, 35.8 per cent of women said that women should serve NS
              and nearly one out of 10 of the women said they will take up a
              voluntary two-year NS option themselves.</p>
              <p>“Interestingly, among the women, the endorsement for the four
              different options (on how women can contribute to NS, whether in a
              two-year full-time capacity or volunteering at ad-hoc events) are
              quite similar to the men,” said Dr Leong. “If you look at just
              women who are below 30 years of age … its 13.6 per cent who said
              they would serve a two-year full-time NS themselves.”</p>
              <p>While most survey findings were positive – showing that
              Singaporeans believe NS is necessary for Singapore to develop and
              prosper, and that there is strong public support for NS as an
              institution – the ability of NS to improve one’s civilian
              employment prospects ranked the lowest out of 10 benefits of the
              NS. Overall, respondents would like to see better matching of
              servicemen’s personal skills and abilities to NS vocations. This
              would lessen the perceived opportunity cost of serving two-year
              full-time NS, according to the researchers.</p>
              <p>“Issues relating to employment prospects, relating to how your
              skills are used, whether they can be applied in NS vocations,
              whether you can actually learn something from your two years of
              service – I think those kind of items tend to score lower compared
              to the rest of the basket consistently,” said Dr Leong. “At least
              from that point of view, that is something that is worth looking
              into.”</p>
              <p>Over eight in 10 (84%) of those surveyed felt that the current
              two-year duration of full-time NS is “just right” in fulfilling its
              defence mandate – a sentiment that cuts across socio-economic
              class. Only 15 per cent of respondents think that NS is too
              long.</p>

              <p><span>National Servicemen can expect new measures to better
              motivate, support, and recognise them, as well to help them balance
              their NS commitments with their family and career
              commitments.</span></p>
              <p>These aims were revealed by the Committee to Strengthen National
              Service on Wednesday, after it held its first meeting at the Basic
              Military Training Centre on Pulau Tekong. Over the next six months,
              the committee will gather ideas from servicemen and the public
              through focus group discussions and town hall sessions.</p>
              <p>The public may also air their views on a new website <a title="www.strengthenNS.sg" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.strengthenNS.sg">www.strengthenNS.sg</a> or through e-mail at <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:strengthenNS@starnet.gov.sg">strengthenNS@starnet.gov.sg</a>.</p>
              <p>The 20-member committee is chaired by Defence Minister Ng Eng
              Hen, and includes Members of Parliament, senior military personnel,
              employers, and NSmen. It was set up during this year's Committee of
              Supply Debate in March, which saw robust debate over how to better
              recognise National Servicemen in light of continued immigration and
              the need to preserve a Singapore core. In recent months, members of
              the public have responded to the news by calling for greater
              monetary incentives, including subsidies for transport, education
              and health, and time-off to rest after reservist in-camp
              training.</p>
              <p>Over the next six months, Singaporeans will be asked for
              feedback on how to beef up National Service.</p>
              <p>The Committee to Strengthen National Service, announced in
              March, will lead focus group discussions and town hall sessions
              while also conducting online consultation sessions via a new
              website, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/strengthenNS/index.html">www.strengthenNS.sg</a></p>
              <p>The Committee meeting for the first time today, expects its work
              to be done within a year.</p>
              <p>Made up of 20 members, including Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen,
              Members of Parliament,military top brass and private sector
              employers, the committee will use the feedback gathered to
              recommend measures to enhance National Service as a critical
              institution for Singapore's continued survival and success.</p>
              <p>The measures are meant to motivate servicemen to give their best
              in serving, help them balance their duties with family and work
              commitments, enhance support from families, companies, new citizens
              and the broader community, and promote recognition of servicemen's
              efforts.</p>
