But I am not saying you can't take up either.<br><br>What I can suggest is work with your unit for 3 to 6 mths first to get a feel of the working hours, duties, work load, etc. Maybe you can then plan out the time to do, if possible.<br><br>Finally, if you do wish to proceed to take up such course. Better check with your immediate officer or S1 first.<br><br>Cheers!<br></div>
