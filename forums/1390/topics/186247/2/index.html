Another way you can do is sign on police and break contract... so your NSF is served in Police... expensive.<br><br>But then, no harm trying to write them a letter... seriously, i dun think the letter will go far.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was helped by an MP to appeal change of unit from Police to army. A lady from cmpb called me on 18 April 2006 as a response. She said that "she" is rejecting my application for change in unit from police to army because she "Thinks" im more suitable for police as police need "Combat" person like me for "leaders" despite having excellent records in NCC and schools. All the while thru the conversation, her tone was never serious and she was laughing. I'm refering her to my MP as she is giving me the impression that she is taking my future the easy way and laughing at it like it is some kind of a joke? I am serious on a career with the SAF and she can "think" that im not suitable? I mean who does she think she is to "think"?</div>
