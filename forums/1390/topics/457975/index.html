The only postive thing is should girl join NS, it will mature their mindset and stop their "nagging" for a change. </p></div>

              <p>One argument that many females have, is that their way of serving the nation is giving birth. I disagree with this as they can't see the distinction between nature and legal obligations. Come on, cats on the street give birth, so are the patriots as well?? No right?! It is natural for women to give birth, having kids has nothing to do with contributing to the nation. </p>

She was pissed of with us, and complain to our reservist officer.. In response to her complain, we told her why? We are in our early 30s, where she is in her early 20s. During an IPPT, she cant run in pace with half the battalion. we told her, we are not recruit that fear ranks, we repect the ranks. And what make us respects the ranks is that an officer not only can keep pace with us or even better. and not an officer cannot carry the load we carry, and run as fast as us..</p>
              <p>We need an officer to lead us, not an officer for us to wait for... she diam diam, and we dont see her for the rest of the 10days of my ICT..</p>

              <p>WTF. At first I thought it was just one "girl" on the left but then I realised all of them are females. I thought introducing female NS would destroy good order in the SAF but I was wrong. Pathetic.</p>
              <p>This is how it is done:</p>

              I know of a Malaysian MIO who served with the British Army at the height of the Malaysian Emergency from the mid 1950s, than with the Malaysian Army during the Confrontation with Indonesia during the 1960s, before fighting the Communists Terrorists (CT) again during the 1970s.  
                                                  
              CTs were both male and female, with female CTs fighting in the thick of battle in the jungle, as well as leading them.  He told me that of all the CTs, the female CTs were usually more deadly than the male CTs.  As a MIO, part of his duty were to crack CTs as well as to turn them in order to gain intelligence about CT activities.  He said that it was almost impossible to crack or turn a female CT.  It was possible to crack or turn a male CT, given time and certain incentives.  However, in his experience, try as they might, they could never seem to crack a female CT.  They were prepared to die for their cause, no matter what you did to them.  And he said no matter what!
                                                  
              He told me of a time he lead a patrol which ambushed a CT patrol in the jungle.  Amongst the CT, was a heavily pregnant CT female.  She charged a Malay soldier who froze because he never expected that a heavily pregnant female could do that.  Luckily for him, he manage to get off a shot which knocked her down.  But she got up and tried to charge him again.  The MIO had to finish her off with a shotgun blast!
                                                  
              In his opinion, female soldiers were as good as male soldiers, perhaps better because they could be more focused and utterly ruthless, as his own experience had shown.  He also told me that female Vietcongs were some of the most effective fighters during the Vietnam War.  This was related to him from the American soldiers that he helped train during the course of the Vietnam War.
                                
              Just to add, he had an interesting connection with Singapore.  When fighting during the Confrontation, he was actually serving as an officer with the Malaysian Infantry Regiment at the time Singapore became independent.  He told me that every officer was given a personal request by the Singapore Government to stay on the with the Regiment, with the promise of increased benefits and faster promotion.  However, he and a number of other officers, decided not to.  My impression was that they refused because they wanted to continuing serving in a combat role (Confrontation only ended in 1966).

              <p>Yes is possible they are more effective. As normally female base on feel and emotion while male of logic... as such, what you define maybe be true, as emotion tell them they suppose to behave this way.</p>
              <p>Also is more effective as any soldier with morality still within, will sure hesitate in killing a female... is also because of this hesitation makes the female more effective...</p>
              <p>Likewise to morality, any soldier who fights along side female troops high chance will see these female being kill, torture.. and also this will break a male soldier and is male instint to wish to protect and guard the female.. and is this instint mentally torturing to see their fellow female being killded.. chances they will end up feeling if the cant even protect the female beside them, who are they fighting for...</p>
              <p>Because of all this mental issues, many countires hesitate to put female in front line..US front line soldier was debate long time before they are allow to, and only in certain units and not open to all combat units...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On top of all, the trouble needed in camp and in field to cater to female is terrible.. any one who went out field with female before will know....</p>
