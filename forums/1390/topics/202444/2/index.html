It just make recruits hate the seargants even more.<br><br>However i do encounter some reasonable seragents or higher rank ppl who dont really scold vul but instead teach properly n clearly. ANy  mistakes they will correct it instead of scolding. I find i learn better n i believe other Rec also learn faster this way.. Why cant those AP seargents learn from these ppl?</div></blockquote>1. <strong>RECRUITS </strong>need to wake up their f---ing idea that they are in the ARMY now.<br><br>2. <strong>RECRUITS</strong> are the <strong>lowest </strong>lifeform in the SAF, not counting those <strong>vermin</strong> locked up in DB.<br><br>3. these <strong>RECRUITS</strong> must learn that they have to follow orders quickly, to the best of their ability and then some.<br><br>4. the scolding and all the f---ing is <strong>good</strong>. imagine that the <strong>RECRUIT</strong> wet his pants when kenna f--- by the sergeant, wtf would he do when he is under fire? how can the Republic of Singapore depend on <strong>turds</strong> like that to defend the homeland in times of war?<br><br>5. these undisciplined <strong>little monkeys</strong> will climb over the sergeant's head if he is nice to them. remember, <strong>RECRUITS</strong> are still the <strong>lowest</strong> lifeform and must be dealt with as such.<br><br>6. the sergeants in BMTC are considered very humane. a few vulgarities doesnt make one a beast. if u even imagine that it does, then u r the problem.<br><br>7. discipline must be instilled in the <strong>RECRUITS</strong>, all of whom would be real soldiers one day.<br><br>8. the sergeants must drill into the <strong>RECRUIT</strong>'s foggy brain (recruit blur blur) to keep the finger away from the trigger when not firing.<br><br>_____________________<br><br>wat i've gotta say about this shotgun vs Advante_101 issue is:<br><br>when zhuo bo, zhuo bo la... wayang for wat? not regulars leh, and for regulars, just buy the high ranking ppl drinks in the mess la~~<br><br>btw, wat are your vocations ah?<br>shotgun = storeman?
