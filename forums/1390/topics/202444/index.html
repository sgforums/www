If you are still worried maybe you can have a talk with your PC. Well BMT it the time where boys become a grown up men, well I guess other forumites might have some suggestions.<br><br>Good luck to you &amp; try your best.</div>

Some people are just plain irritants.Try to have some confidence in yourself, do somethings which you are really good at to boost your confidence so that they won't pick on you.<br><br>And the sergeants yelled at you, while at the range as they are worried bout themselves too. You're armed, with LIVE ammo, one oversight, one wrong action and you might cause someone to lose their son, their boyfriend.Its important that all safety instructions are observed.If anything happen, you can't just yell,"Cut, retake"Thus the emphasis on safety.<br><br>As for your bunkmates giving you problems, I suggest that you should open up to one of them, talk to them about your problems.make sure they do not take advantage of you yeah.<br><br>Thats all I can advice you on.Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am sure that what you have encountered is part and parcel of NS life. Personally, i have endured much worse during my time in NS, now you are only in BMT, things will only get worse should you proceed on in your training. Therefore i suggest you adapt to this new life. No one can help you unless you want to help yourself.<br><br>I am sad to say this but i observe that the younger generation is weaker both in the body and mind, anyone else share the same sentiments?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Somehow the problem may lies in your own introvert personality and not the training especially it involved live range here. You do have a good mentality from the onstart towards NS as an avenue to toughen you up physical but as I can see, shouldnt you also work on strengthening your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">self confidence</span> and starts learning what <span style="text-decoration: underline;">interpersonal-relationship</span> are about too. Grasping these well wil certainly place you in a good stead in your future employment.<br><br>At forum level, I can only advise you to seek out a few friends first, those who you can really relate to in the platoon. Do not feel pressurise that you are not accepted by the majority at this point in time as acquaintances do take some time before the next stage as friends. You mentioned that your platoon mates like to 'kajiao' you and presumely no bullying techniques are involved, then why dont you instead of taking it too seriously, try to play along. Sooner you could be speaking their language and friendship can sparked of from there.<br><br>Should anytime you feel uncomfortable, do not be afraid to initiate a talk with your SC or PC. They don't bite but be smart to check out the friendlier ones first.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
