Realistically though, what kind of solutions do you hope to get? You can only endure til you POP and hope for a fresh start in your new unit.<br><br>Also, based from your post, you should understand one thing. While it is possible to be a senstive new age guy in the civilian world, it is not possible in the barbaric bmt environment. If you do not want to be makan-ed, toughen yourself up. Get yourself immune to the insults or whatever your platoon-mates are doing to you. Easier said than done of course, but you still have to try.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeap, i suppose u can consider me as "Storeman."  Had to look after a couple of those in my NSF days.  Its not a totally slack vocation as most people are led to believe.  There's nonsense such as LRI, and internal audits to be concerned about.<br><br>Then theres the o'seas exercises.  Total headache... and finally, SAF's most famous operation, OFE.  During that period, I dare say it was the logistics dept of our unit and sister unit that did bulk of the work effectively and without complaint.<br><br>We had a bunch of "ah bengs" and less qualified men in our logistics section, people who'd find time for a python snack every once in a while, but when we were activated, it was these guys who lasted days after days with minimal rest. To tell you the truth, we respect the guys who are "combatants" and have to do the work at the front.  Its just sad, that these guys don't seem to be able to have the same attitude for us.<br><br></div>

N when scolding some of the seragents have to wake up n investigate before hurling vulg.<br><br>N some of the sergeant give those kaobei look and attittude that really cause ppl under him to hate him. How do u expect ppl to learn effectively. N most of this attitude prob seragent dono never go school or fail school or wad, cant speak proper n clear Eng n expect us to knoe everything.<br><br>N some sergeant also cant be bothered to do their job well. Some speak so softly, some are simply too lazy. There was this sergeant conducting 1 section of the 1st aid test. He was sitting down benidng down, looking on floor n we are ordered to gather around him. Throughout the test he was looking at floor n he just mumbled his instructions so softly while looking on floor. IF some sergeant are not displined enough to just speak clearly n look at us while talking , wad u expect the "lowest lifeform in SAF to do?"</div></blockquote>ok. "disciplined to speak clearly n look at u". that isnt "discipline". this is so sad. u dun even know wat u r talking abt still wanna complain abt your BMT sergeant's english. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>oh, and only the worst specs/malay specs go to BMTC. good specs go to good units, better ones dun become infantry specs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>last but not least, cry me a river. u cant adapt, u cant change things... all u can do is to b1tch abt it all day long over here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> wat a freaking joke!</div>

Had to look after a couple of those in my NSF days.  Its not a totally slack vocation as most people are led to believe.  There's nonsense such as LRI, and internal audits to be concerned about.<br><br>Then theres the o'seas exercises.  Total headache... and finally, SAF's most famous operation, OFE.  During that period, I dare say it was the logistics dept of our unit and sister unit that did bulk of the work effectively and without complaint.<br><br>We had a bunch of "ah bengs" and less qualified men in our logistics section, people who'd find time for a python snack every once in a while, but when we were activated, it was these guys who lasted days after days with minimal rest. To tell you the truth, we respect the guys who are "combatants" and have to do the work at the front.  Its just sad, that these guys don't seem to be able to have the same attitude for us.<br><br></div></blockquote>too bad... those ppl who feel that their jobs are more important than yours would look down on your vocation (storeman), naturally. myself included, of course. im only human. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>however, not having at least minimal respect for a fellow soldier in the same army wearing the same uniform, ...not to mention b1tching about the same kinda food..., is just sad. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>of coz, not to say that storemen sux, i know quite a few who are cool.</div>
