              Hi all, i receive a letter from the Navy asking me to go for a vocational assessment.
              
              Can anyone give me more information about this assessment so that i can be more mentally prepared? I am not exactly a good swimmer by any measure so...
              
              Also, the letter said that i met the preliminary selection criteria for the vocational assessment. Does anyone know what the preliminary selection criteria is? 
              
              Thanks.

              <p>I dont remember the details. It has been many years and I have already throw away my lecture notes.</p>
              <p>blood test, lung volume test, height and weight, x-ray. I dont know do you need to go for dry dive? The most important is to check if you are fit to dive on the medical aspect.</p>
              <p>But anyway, dont worry, it is nothing strenuous. Just perform as what you are.</p>
              <p>Being a men, dont ask questions, dont ask why, you will make a good diver then.</p>
              <p>Good Luck.</p>

              Thanks guys, Lokey in particular. 
              
              Lokey, actually i would really prefer to do land training. Do you think it is adviceable(sp) if i just go on that day and tell them that? I dont want to waste everybody's time.

              <p>NDU is good. It is one of the unit that give you a free diving license. It cost a thousand plus to get one as a civilian. And almost immediately after  you ORD you can apply for diving instructor and later start teaching diving. One of the most siong but useful vocation.</p>
              <p>If you are Pes A and you are fit, and since you get selected, you should be honour.</p>
              <p>Even if you do tell them that you are not interested, they will not bother you as it is they who select you and not the other way round.Even if you tell me that  you are not interested I dont have a place to write in my form at all. Unless... you are not medically-fit, Of course.</p>

              <p>Just to clear up some misinformation here:</p>
              <p>1. It does not cost over $1,000 to get 'diving license', it costs about half of that to be certified as an open water diver, unless you intend to travel to expensive locations to do your 5 qualifying dives. If you want to do more advanced training later on it will of course cost more.</p>
              <p>2. Even as an NDUdiver you will need to do the full divemaster or dive control specialist course  before you can be trained as an instructor.</p>
              <p>3. Recreational diving is different from the kind of diving NDU does, and there is a slight variation in the gear as well. hence the need to be re-trained under the recreational diving agencies such as PADI, SSI etc.</p>
              <p>4. I know this because there were a bunch of guys who did their NS as Navy divers doing their dive control specialist training together with me.</p>

              <p>You dont feel anything when you go for chamber dive. There is some poping in the ears and clearing of the airway, other than that, It is normal like normal as in now.</p>
              <p>But a sudden ascent will let you to have decompression sickness, which also known as diver's disease. But this one you will get it even in recreation dive.</p>

              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>Question : Is it possible to be a commando if I'm going for the NDU VA? I'm interested in CDO but not NDU.</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>Well this <em>might </em>not necessasarily hold true. In another thread I recall someone getting a VA letter for NDU too but he wasnt too keen, so he called up CMPB to inquire the possibility of going for the CDO VA instead and soon enough he received another letter for the CDO VA.</p>
              <p>And if you really dont wanna go for NDU and switching to CDO isnt possible- from what I read from other threads and according to one of my current CDO friends; they wont actually charge you if you skip the VA.</p>
              <p>But then again its always good to play it safe and besides- its an honor to be called up for a VA, and even more so to be accepted into NDU/CDO :)</p>

              <p>Just to clear up some misinformation here:</p>
              <p>3. Recreational diving is different from the kind of diving NDU
              does, and there is a slight variation in the gear as well. hence
              the need to be re-trained under the recreational diving agencies
              such as PADI, SSI etc.</p>
              <p>4. I know this because there were a bunch of guys who did their
              NS as Navy divers doing their dive control specialist training
              together with me.</p>

              erm I just received the letter from the Navy asking me to go for a vocational assessment.
              
              If I fail my physical test BUT I express interest in joining them, will I still stand a high chance to get in NDU?
