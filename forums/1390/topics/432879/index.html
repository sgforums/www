              hi all, I would gladly love to cut my story short and go straight to the point, so pls do not be skeptical about my ailments. I was facing the downest period of my shitty ns cycle ( being 1 year and 4 mnths into service) I went to the lj m.o my camp has to offer only to be referred to KTPH's psychiatrist. he diagnosed me with depression on the initial consultation followed by major depressive disorder and a medical downgrade to c9l9 on the subsequent visit. some memos were passed to my m.o to be followed up by him for some action eg,counselling ,stay out/post out to be taken but heck , they were as good as old news paper given the nonchalance my bastardice m.o as a doctor is. soon after the pressure in camp adds on and before I know it I was warded in imh fr a short shitty period of time. I went back to pass the m.o the memo from the doc, but again, they were as good as toilet paper, he even insinuated I was well, I just didn't want to come to camp! wtf?! as a doctor he could
              make such comments?? I knew, from that day on nothing is ever gonna work through him, so I decided to see a pte shrink, who scheduled a counselling session at cmpb for me thru my OC's command to the m.o. only then was I given this privilege! now, the Qn is, why, despite referral from imh to refer me to SAF ward, I wasn't sent there? and i was sent to KTPH instead of mmi despite being diagnosed with major depression? kindly enlighten me please, for I need all your wise opinions. I do not wish for unkind comments pls as I have enough drama in the real world already.having it in the virtual world as well would be just as bad. thank you all for your time :)

              I prefer not to disclose which unit I'm in, but currently my vocation as it is has to make contact with people, and these people are shitty social retards whom simply put, are a bunch of monkeys.
              
              threatening to kill myself isn't the way out, because I will risk being punished for it, this is Singapore afterall! furthermore, people who want to kill themselves won't tell others they are gg to do so. 
              
              at the rate of how things are sailing, I might just end up gg insane faster than I thought I would. laying low might help to a certain extent, but it won't resolve the issue bugging me
