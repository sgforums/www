The retirement age really depends if your worth more than the 45 yrs old limit. My Wind Comd retired at 50 yrs old as he was aked to stay on which he did. I am not too sure whats is he doing now as i'm in australia studing and i missed his retirement gathering last yr.Think u better ask wuming78, his a regular,so he knows the fianacial part of SAVERS better than i do. i may be wrong here.<br><br>3)Even if u are revoc, chances your going to be with the cadets, hows that for a start, and a officier trainee, i think your arrows , more likely spears will come hard and fast.Then your instructors are mostly warrent officers and LTAs. If your a Honours Grad, lagi more interesting, your going to get your CPT and be a trainee.<br><br>4)If u do make it, ur PC tour,OC TOur, and Staff Tour will definintely be in an Armour Unit, so at least 1+1+2= 4 yrs in LCK .i'm pretty sure u don't want to be posted to an infantry unit for your OC or staff tours, just like why some Guards or Commando Officers are posted out of their formation.<br><br>hope that helps !!<br></div>

If you are able to promote to at least a LTC, the govt will most likely arrange you to work in some govt related sector after retirement.<br><br>When I was on course 11 years back, there are 2 infantry officers coverting to become Armour officers, one as AI, the other is a tankee. They are holding the rank of LTA while the rest is OCTs.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My brother signed with the RSAF after getting his NTU Honours degree, after serving as a QM when active. He's now a LTC. I believe he had to go through the equivalent of the Service-Wing &amp; Professional Terms again (despite being comissioned), though in your case it should be only the lesser latter training, or some 23 weeks, with the School of Armour.<br><br>As for gratuity, I think the Personnel Service Centre is a better source to brief you on with. But I'll say the SAF pay itself will be much better compared to the civil-service equivalent, with your headstart (as a commissioned officer) &amp; a more rigid military hierarchy. The negative side for regulars is that you must perform enough to progressively climb in rank, or be labeled as "condemned" if you cannot get promoted so-&amp;-so by a certain age.<br><br>You'll probably make at least COL if you last that long into service-retireable age. Yes, there's some GIC-linked appointments that should be available but any viable job switch isn't 100% guaranteed (depending on circumstances &amp; resume). You can always to choose strike out on your own, eg. heading NGOs rather than private sector.<br><br>Once you attain MAJ, you'll probably be eligible to attend SCSC courses (&amp; also do a Masters degree on your own) to prepare you for staff-level appointments at the BGE or DIV level. LHL wasn't always stuck in Artillery, neither was George Yeo in Signals - though albeit they're SAF scholars. Even if you're posted to Sungei Gedong, you'll probably be rich enough to afford a car as a signed-on CPT, lah.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A word on future employment prospects for ex-regulars:<br><br>The thing is once you survive into staff-officer training/appointment stage, your professional strength will be centered around planning &amp; organization. Thus, any planned postgrad academic courses should bolster that, i.e. do Masters in Public Policy/Management/Admin (instead of in Marketing or Finance).<br><br>That way when you leave the service, the NGOs &amp; such headhunters will be receptive to your acquired skills. But you gotta decide early if this is your desired career orientation in the 1st place, cuz it'll be fooling yourself if you come out &amp; plan to go into business or insurance or the ilk. The latter route would render you a complete novice to begin with, whatever your age.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks guys.. I actually applied for Intelligence at first but was unsuccessful. I found the job of an IO pretty interesting although I hardly know much about it. The next best thing I wanted was to be an Armour Officer. I am a degree holder but not an honours holder. I have served 2 years and 4 months.
