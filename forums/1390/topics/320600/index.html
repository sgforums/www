              <p>Hi. I was wondering if anyone could give me a fairly unbias picture of sergant life in an infantry/ guards unit. I just got started with my ASLC course and I am demoralised. </p>
              <p>  My only hope  was that I would go to 6 SIR. But now, all that is gone cause the CO already told us that there wouldn't be anymore intake for 6 sir and that the batch has filled it up. But there are still rumours going around that 6 sir still has intake as they take about 4-5 batches of ASLC each time. Could someone confirm this for me please?</p>
              <p>    I think if we're gonna eventually end up in the likes of 1 sir or 1st guards ( got intake) to chionsua daily, I think it's going be realy siong.  Hence I hope someone can tell me what unit life is like to prepare myself, and possibly help me to weigh the pros and cons better.</p>
              <p>  For ASLC it isnt so much a physical chore, but rather the mental part is tormenting. A lot of us can't take the stress and I'm no exception. This is why:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1&gt; I can't take this 'rush-to-wait, wait-to-rush' lifestyle anymore</p>
              <p>2&gt;I cannot identify with the things I do such as the platoon habouring drills, route marches, the regimentation part, the shouting, the "discipline"etc</p>
              <p>3&gt; I find no meaning and purpose in carrying on in this lifestyle; it'll only get worse in units.</p>
              <p>4&gt; I dont want to be at a position where i have to keep shouting and punishing my men in the future ( based on what i see in infantry schools)</p>
              <p>5&gt; Don't wish to be sandwhiched by officer and men (very evident for infantry units).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6&gt;Battling with unessasary mental stress.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would really appreciate any response of any kind. Thanks in advance.</p>

              <p>what makes u so sure that u will go to 6sir? what's so good about it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>during course time, it's usually the most jialat part of NS life (at least that's what i heard from people, i'm a clerk)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2, 3) u r a spec, supposed to be a level above those men. that's y u have to go through more of this crap than those men. believe me, at the end of your 2 years, u will learn to appreciate all these as they make u a better person. i personally believe that everything we experience at different points of our life is to make us a better person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) don't be disheartened, once u have pass out, unit life awaits u. it's during unit life where u will really create that bond with all your commanders and men. u can always choose to be a spec who don't scold and bark orders u know? it's how u choose to live and the legacy u leave behind when u ord.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) this one all depends on your commander and men already. but u can always talk nicely to them. patience goes a long way. ;)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6) NS is mandatory. u think most of us wanna serve? but we suck thumb and try to make the best out of a bad situation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>7) stress is self inflicted one. if u can look beyond the things u r going through now, u can make it.</p>

              <p>1) its everywhere in saf. if you become men, it becomes more evident.</p>
              <p>2) i believe there are lesson plans for you to go through. even if you are a man, you'll still need to know and go through it. in exchange for a spec rank, i think its worth it.</p>
              <p>3) you haven't been through it how you know its worst?</p>
              <p>4) shouting and punishing are part and parcel of military life. but you can choose not to shout. use the same tone for everything. that makes your men fear you because of uncertainty. you can don't punish if you don't want also.</p>
              <p>in fact in unit, its different from schools. in schools because its always a new batch, there's a need to drill in the fundementals to the trainees. whereas for units, once they catch hold of the basics, it won't be like what you see in schools anymore. in fact you bond closer with your men.</p>
              <p>for 6 and 7 point, i agree with Unknown_X.</p>

              <p>ya, even when i was in the army as a clerk, the WOs and Offrs always arrow the sgts to take note of our behaviour and other stuff. they talk to us nicely, say coporate together. we found them to be nice, so we listen and follow, except for the few rebellious ones. but in the end, they have no friends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>after about 8 months in my unit, i was assigned a 3sg workload and i had to work with alot of higher ups. it definitely wasnt easy and i can understand how those sgts feel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>during my last few months of service, i was locally promoted to 3sg. had to conduct 1st and last parade for my office. at that point of time, there were quite a few spoilt brats. just talk to them and advice them. if they dont listen, let them be. they will get it from the others if they sabotage the whole group. ns is a time where everyone of us guys learn to face hardship(physical or mental) and think more maturely. to be responsible and emerge as a better person in life.</p>

              <p>This is definitely not true. Shouting at your men is only one of the many ways to make your men work. Try to be in a position where most of your men are Pes C and below, excuse this and excuse that. And yet you need manpower to do store cleaning, shifting, maintainence, etc. You think raising voice, yelling at them would make things move? Think again. =)</p>
              <p>Even punishment, you think signing extras is the only punishment meh? Try asking your bor tak cek soldier to write a 1000-word essay to explain what he had done wrong, why he had done wrong, how he could prevent the same wrong in future. He would probably tell you, "Eh Sir, give me 3 extras and forget about writing lah!"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5&gt; Don't wish to be sandwhiched by officer and men (very evident for infantry units).</p>

              <p>4&gt; I dont want to be at a position where i have to keep shouting and punishing my men in the future ( based on what i see in infantry schools)</p>
              <p>This is definitely not true. Shouting at your men is only one of the many ways to make your men work. Try to be in a position where most of your men are Pes C and below, excuse this and excuse that. And yet you need manpower to do store cleaning, shifting, maintainence, etc. You think raising voice, yelling at them would make things move? Think again. =)</p>
              <p>Even punishment, you think signing extras is the only punishment meh? Try asking your bor tak cek soldier to write a 1000-word essay to explain what he had done wrong, why he had done wrong, how he could prevent the same wrong in future. He would probably tell you, "Eh Sir, give me 3 extras and forget about writing lah!"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5&gt; Don't wish to be sandwhiched by officer and men (very evident for infantry units).</p>
              <p>Even as an officer...I also got my HOD to report to ah. No matter which position you're in the army, you're sanwiched, unless you're a recruit lor.</p>

              <p>6&gt;Battling with unessasary mental stress.</p>
              <p>If you're taking things with a negative attitude, unnecessary mental stress will just manifests on its own.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Spec ... depending on if u go in as 1st yr Spec or 2nd yr spec ...<br>1st yr, easier to bond with the men, ... taking them for BMT, AIT/GCC(for gds?) , perhaps even their turn ops parade. Some (men) will understand ur role as a spec n the need to be harsh with them, but some will not and probably will never (Yes, they might be an uneducated lot, but they aren't brainless). <br><br>For 2nd yr, likely events are ATEC stage 1 and 2, where u lead ur section to 'die' or glory. Depending on the time u post in, they might not listen to ur orders/instructions straight away. U need time to understand their pattern, and slowly make them listen to u. But if u do the right things during ATEc n their other outfield, the men feel u care for them ... it will be easier. Of course, in the unit timeline, there may be alot of other shit like NDP or wat secret shit ...  so good luck. <br><br>As for being sandwiched, that does occurs sometimes. Some PC will understand, some think they are big shots and some, are scared of specs. Because, spec have this hidden power to revolt and have his men with him. <br><br>So it depends on who are the people on top of u, and who are the people below you. Life will not be so bad, in unit, unless u keep fugging things up. As for life in SISPEC, endure for awhile longer (course just started huh?) and u will soon miss it. <br><br>It is the mental part that needs to be trained, because, in war ... after that kilometres of tactical walk and at the objective, ur mind still need to be fresh to take out the enemy ... <br>(In simpler explantion, u need to be alert after 25km of walk and choing up tt hill with ur men, u die, u sianz, ur men die, u also sainz ...)</p></div>
