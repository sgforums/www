            <div class='col-md body'>well,i would think that with the more recently frequent reported death of NSF (as compared to last time where few such cases reported),it may have made some parents (particularly mothers who are more ignorant of NS stuff)to become more "aware" that the army is now dangerous and thus getting their unwanted worries rising.<br><br>But anyway hope those who still worry so much that they try to keng will get punished,NS now is already such a good life still want to keng,might as well go change gender to be a girl<br><br></div>
