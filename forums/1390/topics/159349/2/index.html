Recently there is this friend of my mum who even went to the point of caliing CMPB to ask them if they can exempt her son from NS just because her son don't seem to be able to take hardships! I have also heard and seen many cases where people fake some illnesses or injuries during their pre enlist medical checkup. Oh god isn't NS should be a growing and learning experience which everyone should and must go through? NS grooms an individual to cultivate a certain level of independence and tolerance for hardships. Shouldn't this group of people reflect on themselves a little? Ns should be a learning experience for all, it should be the most significant phase in our life which we must go through, and in the midst make certain positive turning points in our life before we become a man from boy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  what we should do is take it like a man and go through NS with positive mindset,afterall it is just 2 years but lots can be learnt and achieved thorughout the process which can help us to do wonders in the later part of our life  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Do you guys agree?</div></blockquote>First off, alittle paragraphing would help alot.<br><br>Secondly, i share similar sentiments with you =D<br><br>However, we all must also understand that everyone is brought up differently with different values. Some may see NS as a chore and a complete waste of 2 years of their prime life. Others, like us, look forward to it as a time to learn. I agree that people who chaogeng throughout their NS life should reflect. If they MUST do NS, why not use it as a time to do their best and to live life to its fullest.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that the army has progressed from being a huge tekan session to a professional and task-oriented one where there is less emphasis on breaking the soldier but rather building him up and giving him proper support to fulfill his duties properly.<br><br>I don't think there is anything to be afraid of. I was nervous, anxious and yes, a little excited. And we all went through it together. It was a lot of fun. When I received my posting to 30SCE (field combat engineers), my mother cried because her hairdresser told her it was one of the worst vocations. But we all survived, didn't we? A few scratches here, some insect bites, rashes, etc and bruised ego from all the tekaning, but really, we all came out better for it.<br><br>Remember, what can they do to you? Tekan you? So what? They can't kill you! (especially after the recent spate of deaths, there are more precautions to prevent more mishaps). If you think a certain order given to you is needlessly dangerous or will result in serious injury or death, bring it up to your superiors.<br><br>In short, be smart, but have fun. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity! Guys in other countries don't even have a chance to hold a rifle. You have an opportunity to shoot lots of rounds, throw real grenades, fire grenade launchers and rockets, learn martial arts, get fit, blow things up and get paid for it!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
