Or at very least, gave me time to pump some iron so that i'd be more appealing to the chicks.<br>At the end when we took over, i didn't get a post (thankfully) and just spent my time doing my weekend homework in the store, or at the grandstand with my other slacker friends from other uniform groups. I tell you that was the best year of my ncc life, which ironically, had nothing to do with ncc. Just spend 5 hours every sat fooling around or doing work. This might be what you become.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wah haha i wan also conned into NCC... in acs i must join 2 CCAs one sports one uniform.... so no choice lor.. then NCC air was quite attractive to me ... can sit in those planes.. carry rifles.. wah song sia. then 1st training in sec 1.. was treated like dogs sia... PT ask us to run ard parade square like dogs...song song ask us to knock it down and do 10 push ups..then continue runnning...after PT everyone started puking and turning white.. well tats my first impression.. but ok bah.. after getting used to it for 2 yrs.. all the shit stuff do be4, kena pumpings like crap.. CLTs dunnoe how to count, 1 min later = 1000 seconds= 1000 pumpings...boots must dig... haiz... but then when u turn look back and reminisce the daes in sec 1 and 2 .. quite interesting... esp when everyone bonded together.. after all NCC abit the waste of time.. but at least i noe wat NS gonna be like but much worse.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for me ncc bonded me with my friends a lot leh.<br><br>sure got a lot of boring drills and scoldings as though those scolding us have the experience or what.. but all those crap we did, now graduate le.. look back.. its just great fun.<br><br>the bond i feel is much greater than compared to people in say, library or chess club CCA?<br><br>Cos during NCC, when friends are all tired, dirty and muddy and shag, you can really see real character of people, those who are selfish, or helpful in difficult times.<br><br>Sure, you can experience that in NS years later, but such exposure, for me, is a real eye opener at such a young age. Rather than sitting in air con room playing musical instruments or arranging books as cca its much more fulfilling.<br><br>My thinking is, NCC is not a waste of time if you have the passion, interest and is open to learn new things out of your comfort zone. Same thing with everything else in life. If I'm in BAND, i'll also say its a waste of time because I have no interest in music at all, right?<br><br>NCC no doubts help one prepare for NS. As for those who claim CLTs or ex-NCC people hao-lian in BMT, I feel its their own personal character and not NCC's fault as an organisation. Sure enough, some ex-NCC cadets have gone on to hold high ranking positions. NCC has changed these few years. Will it continue to inspire boys to become high ranking officials? Have to wait a few more years to see.<br><br>I am sure MOE, NCC and Mindef are constantly reviewing policies on UGs. As I said before, many are unhappy to join UG, most are forced out by other CCAs (unless in estab. units like say SJI etc). Hence, no passion -&gt; no motivation -&gt;lousy cadets -&gt; public view ncc as a disgrace (maybe?) and it goes on.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
