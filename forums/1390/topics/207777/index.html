            <div class='col-md body'>Contrary to eveyone else in this thread so far...<br><br>I think joining NCC can be fun.  You need to take an ECA anyway right?<br><br>If you are the outdoorsy kind, don't mind roughing it, why not?  You get the opportunity to climb Mount Sophia, go parachuting, canoeing, Outward Bound School, shoot a M16, etc.  No other ECA will give you as many opportunities.<br><br>And some of the training will give you some preparedness for your NS.<br><br>However...  Just don't think NCC is the army and the uniform you put on makes you part of the army.  Even if you become a WO or CLT, that is still lower than a private in the army.</div>

It was quite senseless to make CCA COMPUSLORY. And then, all those bloody sissies started joining rough sports and Uniformed groups. Go home complain say tekan like siao. Which is y now UG... looks very sissified, cos u can't reallu pump and carry out EFFECTIVE punishment...<br><br>I think that's a reason why u guys would say joing NCC/NPCCC is a waste of time. However, i beg to differ, the so-called 'prepare for NS life" is the part where u see the bloody NCOs f-up, then backstabbing, wayang, etc , etc ...<br><br>But then, at sec 1, who knows so much???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
