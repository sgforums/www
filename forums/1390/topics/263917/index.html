If you still think you stand a chance, go ahead and apporach the recruitment officer but be prepared to be disappointed.</div>

You called them rephrase 1 and 2 though its supposed to be Quote. Duh.<br><br>If you have an ITE technical cert or good cert (I don't care if its very good cert), it is not a degree. No matter how you justify it that its a higher technical degree. A degree that SAF wants is from a recognized university. You don't get a degree in ITE.<br><br>If you understand what I am saying, than let me tell you what everyone of us is saying. Do you have a poly diploma? No. Do you have a university degree? No. I'm sorry but you can become an officer only in your dreams. No offence but its the harsh reality. Even if by some sort of miracle or luck you managed to be an officer, you will not progress up the officer ladder fast. The SAF is very practical. The better your degree, the faster you climb. The SAF scholars all climb fast. Officers with a poly diploma climb slower than those with a university degree. I've seen it happen.<br><br>I hope you will stop dreaming about becoming an officer. Anyway, army life may not be for you. Why not experience it first before deciding? You can always become a specialist. However, as with that of the officer, you may climb slower too.<br><br>Thats reality. Thats our SAF.</div>
