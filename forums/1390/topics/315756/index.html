              <p>i think u just got ur license n can't wait to show off ur skills to some girls...<br><br>for military, no such thing as desk bound. yes, for permanent staff, they give u a desk for u to do some admin work. else, even during office hrs, half the time u r not there blowing air-con. only the DXO (non-military working in camps) scheme is highly desk bound.<br><br>yes, u may be financially stable since its a govt job, but i can't say for others like time, emotional, mentally, psychologically...etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>u even haven't gone thru BMT yet... dun sign on for the sake of money. as if like u want money, borrow from ah long, then later no money to even pay interest. ("money 1st, talk n pay later" mentality)</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the poly or ite scheme is just a fish bait lure for flesh blood. think thrice b4 signing the dotted line. saf contract is harder to break than typical commencial contracts.</p>

              <p>I've been through NS,I urge you VERY STRONGLY, THINK before you sign on.Do NOT sign on for the money because you WILL regret it.If you have an interest,fine,if you have the passion fine,but do NOT sign on just because you want the money.</p>
              <p>There are other jobs outside in the private sector that you can take and actually have an interest in,working part-time while going to unii.You can also take a student loan from the bank or negotiate with your parents to use CPF to pay for your education.</p>
              <p>Entry level pay in SAF is high,yes,but rises slowly and plateaus out after some time. In private sector over the long term you can make more money but your entry-level pay is shit and lifestyle is definitely more hectic.</p>
              <p>Furthermore,do you really need a car?As it is,road tax and ERP are so high,a car will be an uncessary drain on your money,not to mention instalments you'll need to pay with interest + COE.Public transport in Sg is crowded but still affordable and fast.Just make the effort to wake up earlier and get there on time.It's a matter of discipline.</p>
              <p>You'd better have your priorities clear before you decide to enlist professionally.They'll psycho you alot in BMT as well,don't fall for it.</p>
              <p>I would like to sign on because I enjoyed aspects of the life but disliked a lot of the other bullshit they had.But I'm always rechecking my reasons to make sure.</p>
              <p>Go in and ensure you know what you're doing before losing 3 years of your time to a contract.You can always make money elsewhere.It the SAF easy money?Yes,for a while,but the SAF doesn't treat it's normal personnel well enough,not like the scholars.</p>
              <p>Ultimately,its up to you,but talk to people who know what's happening.Otherwise,I wish you the best</p>

              <p>btw TS, being a regular is good and you have many career prospects. i too am a regular and i find life is good provided you have discipline and the flaming passion in the sacred task of protecting our nation. I suggest you go down to the ARC and have a better look at the ARMY life, it's good. You get good food, lodging and even medical benefits! Not to mention the pride of wearing the no.4!</p>

              <p><br>TS, pls dun be fooled by this siao-on regular who had sold his own soul to the devil. nonetheless, TS has decided not to sign on already.<br><br>without the scholar tag on ur files, u will be more than less given the golden handshake n a good pat on the back upon contract expiry. n ARC is as expected for show display (wayang). they didnt get a soil tank, give u shovel, n ask u to dig a shell scape or fox hole or even a firing trench in it on the spot do they... haha.<br><br>good food? if there is, then i dun know y food awards didnt goes to army cookhouses, instead to restaurants outside. haha.<br><br>medical benefits is even better for civil servants in other ministries, no less as still under govt.<br><br>as for lodging, even a university hostel room is better than a typical bunk.<br><br>and.... the regular sucker is just a trainee now. neither obtained a airbrone badge nor the ranger tag yet... so neither here nor there.</p>
