              <p>Dear bro Deep56sea</p>
              <p>Look deep into your contract under 
              Termination Clause and seek for possible loopholes on termination. If 
              not, spend some money and consult lawyer rather than surrender and 
              compensate back to the Navy.</p>
              <p>Prepare for the worst and find 
              another career. Sometimes life is not a bed of roses, ones has to 
              persist and search for a way out to success. I always believe that the 
              kind of situation that you are in could be due to god's will. Who knows 
              that you may find even better success in other career. Things happen for
               a reason. </p>
              <pre>If a man has done his best, what else is there?<br>	General George S. Patton</pre>

              <p><br>hi fren , its inside the contract if u are downgraded , you have to pay liquidated damage. I have a fren who cannot passed out as Navy Officer due to medical issue .He worked it out with SAF on compensation by means of instalment .He clear it after a few years .SAF isnt a loan shark , you can work something out with Defence Finance Group Counsellor.</p>
              <p>Try not to hanker on it .Every Organisation have its accountability to their operation readiness</p>
              <p>If u cant work in Navy , dun feel sad .There are greener pasture out there.</p>
              <p>I ord from Navy as a Regular after 6 years .now i might not go back reservist as active due to degenerative knee problem .</p>

              <p>So whoever sign the contract as a regular must be idiot. Navy training such as diver training make you do so much dangerous things. Anytime, an incident or accident might happened, whether it is your fault or not. You might be downgraded accordingly.</p>
              <p>So now TS is down with a perm physical or medical damage which is not his fault. If he is not academically inclined, he have to do physical job but now he cannot. On top of that he loses his SAF regular job. There is no high insurance coverage compare to outside. And worse he have to compensate SAF for their loss. What is the logic!?</p>

              lol. outside insurance dont cover military training. So regulars, NSF and during reservist we are not covered and we have to depend on SAF's insurance for us. I think the only thing that covered us is the NTUC's Pioneer policy

              <p>There seems more than meets the eye about this case. If it's a service injury, then the SAF should foot the bill and revocate the serviceman to a more suitable vocation, rather than just terminating his contract &amp; asking to pay back for his poly studies, stipends, etc. At least he gets to stay till the end of his contract.</p>
              <p>Thereadstarter should be more open &amp; transparent, in order for others to appropriately advise him.</p>
