            <div class='col-md body'>It wouldn't hurt to go overseas. You could get exposure to another culture, language, etc.  Some folks have to pay big mulah for that, and if you can get it semi-free from the SAF, then I'd go for it.<br><br>While I was in the U.S. Army, I had the chance to stay overseas at a military base in Germany and later in Italy.  It was the best experience ever, since I had never lived outside of the hick town in Michigan where I'm from.  It was a little weird at first, because I am Asian and a woman, but it after awhile, you learn to assimilate to the culture.<br><br>So, yeah...if I were in your shoes, I'd take the offer!<br><br></div>
