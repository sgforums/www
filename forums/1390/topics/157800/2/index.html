            <div class='col-md body'>Let's just say this:<br><br>In NS, a positive mindset is one of the best assets you can ever have. Much better than having the ability to do 30 chin-ups and run 2.4km in 7 minutes... though I don't mind having those either.<br><br>With a positive mindset, you can pretty much cope with anything that NS wants to throw at you. I went into NS wondering about whether I could survive all those sergeants screaming in my face (it's not just you who gets screamed at in the face, by the way), surviving all those tekan sessions and extreme PT (by my benchmark) and so on and so forth.<br><br>I went in with a negative mindset, and I suffered as a result. My appetite suffered, and I got frequent chest pains. I would have difficulty falling asleep, and when I finally did, I would have terrible nightmares about things like getting charged by my superiors and wake up in cold sweat in the middle of the night.<br><br>In the end, I realised that I was only hurting myself by thinking so negatively all the time. Most of the bad things which I thought were going to happen didn't actually happen. It took a while, but I made the effort to see the bright side of things. And things did actually seem better after a while.<br><br>The bottom line is, you're in there for two years. Live with that fact, and make the most out of it. Look at your ORD date and tell yourself that no matter what, the SAF can't keep you in there any longer than that date. Two years may seem long right now, but believe me, the day will come when you'll look back and wonder how those two years passed so quickly.<br><br>Good luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My take on my bmt life.  It was a torture going thru.  Learning all those things that seemed sooo irrelevant.  Whole day only hear the words "knock it down."  At first I thought I didn't get along with my platoon mates and section mates either.  I reported sick quite often too...<br><br>Everybody thot i was some super kengster.. which i probably was.  But heck, when u're sick, u're sick, don't hold back on reporting sick cos ppl would label u.  Ur obligation as a soldier and as ur mother' son is to take care of urself.  If u have chronic backpains, see ur Doc or MO. U may not be a combat fit soldier, but can still serve ur NS in non-combat roles.<br><br>As for OCS and sispec, if u think u have the ability to lead, then go for it.  But somehow I do no think so, since u are quite isolated from the rest of ur platoon.  A leader has to be a team player.  If u don't get to OCS or sispec, no worries, it does not make u any less a person.<br><br>Really, get to know ur section mates well at least.  I'm glad i did. Tho i was sick like half the time in BMT, i chipped in wherever i could to help my section mates.  These are ur BROTHERS in BMT.  People whom u should turn to for help.  They may not give u the best advice all the time, but at least they know what u're thinking.<br><br>Til today, I still go out with my section mates.  We hang out, eat dinner, n play games together. (Aka Section Movement Outings) I'm glad to have been known them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm well it tough when your bmt mates don't get along with u i also don't know whether this advice of mine is good or not lah but since you have a back problem just keep reporting sick and ignore what everybody say lah don't care about what others say,u r sick means u r sick loh n if possible try to get a family doc to get u to see specialist outside,try to get a dowgrade loh then u can leave tekong as an ooc personel lah to unit directly although u still have to recourse but that time u lao jiao liao ,more experience liao will know what to do one loh.<br>But i find it quite funny leh when u say u want to apply what u study in NS,I tell u it not possible one loh ,maybe NCC LOL.<br>As for your peers not getting along with u,aiya human are like that,imagine u are on the other side of the grass,u are in the middle of some xiong training and one fellow backpain or whatever go rest never train,sure will aim the one that fall out early one lah jealous mah can rest early,they will not care how pain u are loh.i not trying to encourage u to keng lah but in the army to survive regardless of tekong lah ,units lah,u want to garang by all means garang all the way ,u want to downgrade,by all means downgrade all the way,once u downgraded no one can force u on anything loh.<br>what some friend say early on is very true,think about your parents,they raise u for18-20 yrs???u r a man now don't let them worry for you,think positive loh,last time tekong IPPT must pass lah etc etc now IPPT no need to pass somemore now five days week in most unit liao not bad liao leh n reduce to 2yrs instead of 2 and a half yr,think about good things lah try to occupy yourself in tekong so that times fly faster don't think about bad things loh.<br><br>Good luck Endure.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok i do have a very short memory so cant really reply to all posts.<br><br>generally i did try to talk to 1 section mate by chance and he told me ppl are frustrated etc. but i didnt really take his answer for it because his answer focused only on specific problems and not the general situation.<br><br>then as for my back aches, chiropractors open on weekends ?<br><br>actually i am quite confused whether do i want to go ocs or not. then during this EI survey i gave a half yes answer to whether i want to go ocs and a yes answer if i wanted to go sispec instead of serving in a combat unit.<br><br>i spoke to my 2IC by chance when my OC wasnt in and later to my OC regarding the vocations thing and i felt quite demoralised and down because they said there's nothing i can do expect to note it down during the EI survey. it surprised me to an extent because duing an OC dialogue, he mentioned that we were free to talk to him abt vocations and the possibility of serving in a vocation of relevance to the dip.<br><br>i do know that getting along with platoon mates is important but it appears that some see me as trying to keng when i request to fall out due to problems with frequent sharp pains in my heart and joints. another thing is that i do admit i have problems learning the rifle drills and stuffs and i can tell they were quite frustrated to teach me. this frustration seems to overflow to daily activities and some of them simply love to tekan me.<br><br>i am not expecting them to be as patient as poly lecturers or anything but it's just tht they seem to be ' forced' to teach. (there isnt an issue here)<br><br>even my so called buddy(technically assigned by the system) thinks on day 1 i look cock up.(prior to doing anything) and even when talking to him he replies half heartedly but i dont really care. what ppl say abt the wide diversity of ppl in NS is really true, possibly wider than what i've seen and experienced before.<br><br>field camp's next week and i can feel my buddy is fearing...me.<br><br>to wuming: i am not frustrated over the fact i cant call soldiering skills and work skills. from the ' 1 min everything in, 1 min everything out", stuffing everything in a tiny field pack, i can probably pack things better than a seasoned traveller. haha<br><br>rather i am slightly disappointed by the fact i cant put my dip into use despite the fact that i've gone thru the 3 years unhappily. at least something is useful.<br><br>to deportivo, i am not isolating myself due to my thoughts on where i am going for vocation during quiet time on my own.<br><br>gordonator, actually i've tried to learn the rifle drills etc but why i still make mistakes is something i cant really explain. perhaps i have weak motor skills and i have only myself to blame. i did try to get help from a friendlier section mate and to 1 to 1 tutor me during free time and i do appreciate their help.<br><br>i feel only my OC and OO are ppl that i can at least talk to, esp OO. OC seems quite distant to me thought he's quite friendly to us. the rest, csm, section cmdr, PS, sgts etc. all seem either way too distant or just leaders u dont feel like sharing yr personal problems with.<br><br>perhaps waht others say abt life starting in unit is true but tht's still a some time away from now. seriously i do feel that once i pop, i may not have to see them again.<br><br>somehow i am confused whether to even see the a specialist or not. i mean, so waht if he gives me a letter to excuse me from xxxx things and tekong MOs certifies it and i get the excuse? i end up missing this and that activity and risk recourse. plus it doesnt help that my platoon will just think i am trying to keng again.<br><br>another thing my OO mentioned was true. cross the river and demolish the bridge. my platoon mates.<br><br>i have no idea how to survive field camp. mainly emotionally.<br><br></div>
