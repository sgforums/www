            <div class='col-md body'>1) Seriously u need to get along with you bmt mates,  i had fun in bmt because of them and u need to think positive, doing shit work with a positive attitude is much more fun that doing shit work in a negative attitude<br><br>2) Its ur body go for it<br><br>3) Pls do not even try to bother apply ur diploma skills to your ns life, what u need is social skills, physical fitness and fast thinking brain (if u are a commander) or just follow order mentality (men). It is extremely rare to be able to use ur skills in civillian life in NS. AFter passing out from comd school, u might still get to combat unit<br><br>4) starting of bmt, ur commanders will tekan, but if u platoon and coy gel up, see how they will get more lax with u @ the end <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
