            <div class='col-md body'>i am pretty sure it is your attitude. From your initial posting on the thread, it is very easy to detect that you have already isolated yourself from your platoon mates simply because you are thinking too much about things concerning, "how to get a posting i deserve.", "can i get into command school", etc.<br><br>I think the most important thing to do now is to reassess yourself in term of social skills.</div>

Ya, i agree with the rest that you do need to get along with your platoon mates quite well. Or failing which, at least stay neutral, or straddle a comfortable point in between them disliking you and actually shunning or ostracizing you.<br><br>understand that you cannot allow ill feelings to breed. so you must have at least a few close friends in bmt.<br><br>in any case, like you, i didn't like bmt very much. at that point in time, i thought that the ps seem to like to tekan me as well, but seriously you have to understand the flip side. he needs (and probably wants) to mantain a certain amount of friendliness to command a minimal amount of respect.<br><br>life may or may not get better in the army, depending on where you get posted to, and as what. however, the basic dynamics remain the same. as you undersatnd it better you'll find that things are easier to bear and life will generally get easier.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> hang in there! it's only 2 more years! and sgforums is an excellent place to rant!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guess I am considered lau jiao since I was enlisted 21 years ago....some of you were not born then..Recruit life then was really much worse...<br><br>Do make an effort to fit in with your platoon mates and be part of the gang. Offer to help whenever you are able to....when I came back from a really shack log PT one day, I found out my buddy who was attend C in bunk had cleaned and oiled my rifle ready to send arms. I was most grateful....<br><br>The one lesson I learned about surviving NS is not to think too far. Mentally gear yourself to get through each day, one day at a time...and thank god each night you go to sleep that you are one day closer to book out...Each time you book in, thank god you are one week closer to pop..<br><br>Some people will think that is too passive but I am no garang soldier...just wanted to do my duty and get through it. I did....far from top recruit or cadet but I survived, without too many extras either...</div>

Unless of course, he knew at least one of htem previously. finding someone to trust is important, but i'd say to not place such misguided and implicit trust that they can't do their job without him feeling betrayed.<br><br>anyway yah, @ the end of the day the command level in bmt (as with other units, but significantly more pronounced here) is really just concerned about statistics. ie: pass ippt + gold, good soc timing etc etc. and you'll find that they'll give little to no trouble. though of course, i fail to see how that can be achieved with persistant back pains.<br><br>+ yah, hang in there. i hope things will only get better as bismarck progress in ns &amp; make more friends. if it dosen't then he'll seriously need to reconsider how he is like as a person in real life. NS, to me, is one of the best litmus test as on to how people thrive in a near equal world, since there are no chances for promotion and everybody really just wants to make friends, be popular and move on.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No experience here,but what I can say is that, when u are stuck in a crappy situation u are in like now, situation will automatically improve over time,no questions asked. Its just to take notice of all the little things happening around you which will help u realise that it is uplifting. Bite harder and hang in there, don't ever let go as this will make u feel worse. Life has never been about getting to then end, but its more about the process you go through to get to the end.<br><br>Besides, if you say that your bio diploma got no use, den I think i'm worse off,I'm studying business now lehz...how to make use of my poly learnt skills?haha,dun worry, i'm sure u will pull through.Do keep us updated yeah?cheers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
