            <div class='col-md body'>As a soldier, 1WO Ng Siak Ping has proven his might and mettle in the air, on land, and in water. He continues to impress, especially after an outstanding performance at a military academy in the United States. cyberpioneer meets this quintessential Commando.<br><br>"If you're tired, take a few minutes' rest. When you're ready, try again," 1WO Ng Siak Ping, 41, tells a recruit who is attempting the low rope at the Standard Obstacle Course.<br><br>He has just demonstrated how to overcome this obstacle to a batch of new recruits, and is now giving personal guidance to soldiers facing difficulties.<br><br>"I'll show you how to do it again. Watch how I bring my legs up towards my chest to pull myself up," 1WO Ng patiently tells the recruit, before hoisting himself up the rope again.<br><br>As the Company 2 I/C of the Commando Basic Wing, 1WO Ng drafts training programmes and supervises lessons, making sure that training safety is not compromised and that the recruits are properly managed by their instructors.<br><br>"These recruits have been with us for only a fortnight. We have to be patient and student-centric; put ourselves in their place and ask how they feel," says 1WO Ng.<br><br>"This instructional role is not new to me, but previously, I dealt mainly with higher ranks like officers. So dealing with recruits is a new challenge for me."<br><br>Throughout his 23-year military career, 1WO Ng has encountered and conquered many challenges.<br><br>Since joining the Commandos in 1982, 1WO Ng has trained as a parachutist, ranger, and also a diver. He was also part of the Special Operations Forces (SOF) for 15 years before assuming the Regimental Sergeant Major appointment at 1st Commando Battalion.<br><br>In May, he returned to Singapore after completing the 38-week United States Army Sergeant Major Course.<br><br>Conducted at the United States Army Sergeant Major Academy (USASMA) in Texas, the course was attended by 545 students (including 35 international students) and is considered the premier course for non-commissioned officers of the US Army.<br><br>Through lectures, discussions, research work, writing papers, and giving presentations, students learn topics like organisational behaviour, leadership, military operations and strategies, and cultural awareness, to prepare them for higher responsibilities.<br><br>While the focus was mainly on academia, students were also encouraged to participate in various physical fitness tests. In these tests, 1WO Ng faced challenges. But he discovered new strengths too.<br><br>How many sit-ups can you do in two minutes? How about push-ups in the same amount of time? How fast can you run 3.2 km? These were the challenges laid down for the Iron Soldier Award for physical excellence at USASMA.<br><br>1WO Ng's score - 111 sit-ups, 106 push-ups, and 12 minutes to complete the 3.2km run. Using a formula that factored in one's age, 1WO Ng scored full points to receive the award - the first non-American soldier to win it.<br><br>"Actually I was only ranked 'average' after my first attempt at the test. I was quite shocked and decided to push myself harder," 1WO Ng lets on.<br><br>"I wanted to win this award because physical fitness is my strength. Hence after the first test, I put in extra effort to achieve the desired results."<br><br>For two months before the next test, 1WO Ng woke up at 5am daily to train for an hour at the gym before going for his classes. Each night, before going to bed, he would also do push-ups and sit-ups.<br><br>While 1WO Ng readily admits running is his strength, he reveals that skydiving is his 'weakness'. This was why he was initially reluctant to join the USASMA's skydiving parachute team for a competition.<br><br>While he loves to skydive, 1WO Ng's experiences are mainly in military free- falling which is mission-oriented with no showy manoeuvres in the air.<br><br>For this competition however, eight skydivers were expected to form certain formations in the sky and hold them each for five seconds. But when his commanders in the SAF gave their approval, 1WO Ng decided to give the competition a shot.<br><br>His team wound up with a second placing in the eight-way speed competition.<br><br>He remembers that rush of victory: "This form of skydiving is something I never thought I could do well, much less compete in! So when I was able to prove to myself that I could do, and even excel in, something which I was not so strong in, that was the real takeaway!"<br><br>Perhaps the most harrowing of physical challenges was the aptly-named 26.2-mile (41.92km) Bataan Memorial Death March.<br><br>Carrying a 35 pounds (15.75kg) backpack, 1WO Ng trekked across soft sands, faced strong winds and climbed from an altitude of 4,100 feet to 5,300 feet (1,230m to 1,590m).<br><br>Letting out a deep sigh of relief, 1WO Ng recalls the moment when he crossed the finishing line: "It was like 'wow'! That was a real defining moment for me. Especially since I was not feeling well during the race, and I certainly didn't expect to do such a race at my age!"<br><br>While a couple of his team-mates dropped out midway, that thought never crossed 1WO Ng's mind.<br><br>"Once I start something, I have to complete it. It's mind over body, so despite the exhaustion, I told myself to just keep on moving. 'Quitting' is not in my vocabulary!"<br><br>It is this fighting spirit, one of the SAF's core values, that 1WO Ng hopes he was able to deliver to the rest of his course-mates. Another value he exemplified was discipline.<br><br>"Be it punctuality, the way I dress and present myself, my performance during the course or the way I speak about the SAF, when my course-mates looked at me, they could see that I am a very disciplined person," says 1WO Ng.<br><br>For his overall outstanding performance, 1WO Ng was given the International Leadership Award by the academy.<br><br>While he is currently not pushing his physical limits to the extreme, 1WO Ng's mind remains active and focused on imparting knowledge to other soldiers.<br><br>"I tend to be weaker in areas like doing research, writing papers and making presentations. During my course, I had to do these almost every other day, and it has really boosted my confidence."<br><br>"Hence, I now tell my instructors to do some research work, write simple memoranda and give presentations to small groups. It's good for junior commanders like Sergeants to have these skills too," 1WO Ng says.<br><br>After being away in the US for almost a year, this father of two now spends more time with his family. While being away from his family was difficult, 1WO Ng says he is thankful for his supportive and "very, very capable" wife.<br><br>Does he hope to travel again? The sparkle in his eyes says it all: "Definitely, if I have the opportunity! Every time you travel, you learn something new."<br><br></div>
