Cos if you aren't, then you can't charge him.<br><br>Safest way? Report it up to your immediate superior. Your subordinate will get charged for forging your signature.

You can surely tell your men or call the qm to inform him/ her that you will be signing for it later right.  So your men would not need to forged your signature.</div>
