Otherwise, it is the fall back "feature" that armed forces have to make sure command and control is retained when there is a lack of instruction.<br><br>In SAF, appointment is important.  Even a storeman (PTE) can tell a Major to WAIT cos his men have not gone through proper procedure.  He is protected by his appointment as long as he is the proper process of discharging his duties.<br><br>I feel that you should have at the very least accompanied your "men" to return the store.  Or on the very least, AUTHORISE him to sign the return on your behalf.  You subordinate was wrong, cos he forged your signature.  If you want to be a prick and report him and get him charged, of course you can...<br><br>Of course, if he identified to the storeman that he is not you, then he's not half as wrong, as he won't be impersonating or in excess of authority.  In other words, he won't kena charged fully, if he didn impersonate u.  The CSM would usually step in and at most he will kena a few extras for forgery. Unless, he's been doing it so often and have been forging signatures to steal stuff or other bad things.. different story.<br><br>As for you, u'd prolly be the most unpopular 3sg around camp for a while.  People help u return store, and u try to get him charge... Touch your heart lar.</div>
