              <p><span class="bodytext">
              </span></p><p>SINGAPORE - A group of businesses and employers will come 
              together for the first time to pay tribute to Singapore's soldiers, 
              sailors and airmen on Singapore Armed Forces Day next Monday.</p>
              <p>To honour the men and women in uniform, 21 retail, entertainment and 
              food and beverage brands will offer discounts and freebies to all active
               and former military personnel.</p>
              <p>The 800,000 servicemen here just need to wear their uniforms or 
              produce their military identity card (SAF 11B) to enjoy the benefits 
              that range from discounted movie tickets, meals and even dance classes.</p>
              <p>In another first to raise the profile of those who serve their 
              country, some employers are urging their citizen soldiers to show up at 
              work in their uniforms on Monday.</p>
              <p>Mr Andrew Kwan, managing director of Commonwealth Capital, which 
              oversees brands such as Pastamania and Swissbake, will offer free pizza 
              deals and discounts for its 1kg cakes from July 1 to 5.</p>
              <p>The 46-year-old said he did not think twice when he was first approached to be part of the appreciation drive.</p>
              <p>"It wasn't a question to do it or not, but when and how best to give 
              our SAF guys a good deal," said the former army lieutenant whose son, 
              19-year-old Ryan, is now in basic military training.</p>
              <p>"I remembered how people used to frown and wrinkle their noses when 
              my campmates and I booked out in our uniforms and ate at restaurants.</p>
              <p>"We can do better now. We should welcome and not shun the men in uniform who have sacrificed to defend the nation."</p>
              <p>Mr Derek Tan, 42, who was one of the NSmen behind the campaign, said:
               "We want NSmen to be proud of wearing their uniform, not just within 
              their camps but also in public. They should be recognised by their 
              colleagues and bosses for their sacrifices."</p>
              <p>It is understood that the Education Ministry is sending letters to 
              school principals to encourage male teachers to don military uniforms on
               Monday. Yangzheng Primary School principal Jacinta Lim told The Straits
               Times that such efforts are "teachable moments" for pupils. She said: 
              "This is to recognise the vital role the males have to play in defending
               the country and remind students of the dual roles their teachers play 
              to contribute to the nation."</p>
              <p>Charity Care Singapore assistant director Nicholas Lim is even giving
               14 of his 33-strong staff a half-day off to enjoy the perks.</p>
              <p>"Bearing arms is a responsibility that should not be taken for granted and this is just a small way for us to say thank you."</p>
              <p>The latest efforts to salute current and ex-SAF personnel are similar
               to benefits offered to military men during Armed Forces Day in the 
              United States and Britain.</p>
              <p>Earlier this month, a chicken rice seller in Bedok was praised for 
              giving army recruits extra portions of rice, chicken and eggs free - all
               without their asking.</p>
              <p>The new benefits also come at a time when a committee is looking into
               ways to better motivate and recognise the contributions of national 
              servicemen.</p>
              <p>Mindef's national service affairs director, Brigadier-General Tung 
              Yui Fai, said that while perks and discounts are "nice tangible 
              benefits", public affirmation and recognition are welcomed. He added: 
              "We hope this initiative will gain support from Singaporeans to show 
              their appreciation not just on SAF Day but also at other times whenever 
              possible."</p>
