Usually I just lurk around the forums but today I received my ICT call up through Registered post from my NS unit. I am from KINS btw. </span><br style="color: #222222; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px; background-color: #edece6;"><br style="color: #222222; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px; background-color: #edece6;"><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px; background-color: #edece6;">I got the shock of my life when I opened it because my ICT dates are only a month away i from 24 June to 11 July (3 weeks high key) training. At first I thought that maybe Singpost screwed up on the delivery dates or something but no, the issue date printed on my ICT notice is 9th May.</span><br style="color: #222222; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px; background-color: #edece6;"><br style="color: #222222; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px; background-color: #edece6;"><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px; background-color: #edece6;">I am quite troubled as I am not sure whether my employers can release me for 3 weeks in such a short space of time. I have thought about asking for deferment but would like to know whether has anyone had such an experience before?? </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"></p></div>

              <p>@tarutaru, Thanks for your reply. Hmm I did not receive any online SAF100 from my unit. I also have updated all my personal contact information with manpower officer since my last ICT. *Just checked my e-selfupdate on ns portal and all seems to be in order :S</p>
              <p>I also read that in the event you miss out on your SAF100, a registered mail of the order will be sent to your mailing address 10 days later... I think its best for me to give them a call tomorrow.</p>
