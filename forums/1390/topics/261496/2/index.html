            <div class='col-md body'><strong>RE: Maintaining Boy/Girl Relationship while in NS.<br><br>Q:<br>1. Is it possible to maintain a stable, worry-less relationship while serving in the NS?<br><br><span style="color: red;">Yes. Depends on your vocation. If you have to stay-in all the time, busy the whole day with work, trainees etc etc, then its a little hard to maintain the relationship. But if your gf loves you, and vice versa, it can actually work.</span><br><br>2. What is the percentage probability of having a big quarrel, or worst, a breakup with my gf while serving in the army?<br><br><span style="color: red;">% of having big quarrel: 75%<br>% of break-up: 50%<br><br>Both dependant on how you're able to manage the problem and communicate. But ifyour gf loves you, and vice versa, no wall is to high to climb.</span><br><br>3. Any advice on maintaining and managing BGR while in the army?<br><br><span style="color: red;">Communicate with her EVERYTIME you have the chance. Assurre her that you'll always be there for her when you book out of camp and that while you're in camp, the only thing that drives you through the day is the thought of listening to her voice after a day's training. &lt;----YOU GOT TO MAKE HER REALISE THIS AND UNDERSTAND.<br><br>Understand her problems. Let her know that even if you're at camp, doesn't mean she must everytime listen to you rambles and complaints; it is worst for her since she's in the outside world, there's more and harder things to face - your world is merely green, sedia &amp; senang diri.<br><br>Don't be selfish. Don't control her. Don't worry about her being unfaithful or etc etc.. cause if she want to play-around/be unfaithful, she ain't worth it. If she loves you, and vice versa, nothing is hard to manage.</span><br><br>4. Will you still feel like going on a full-day date during weekend breaks?<br><br><span style="color: red;">This is the most important thing to maintain the relationshp. As selfish as this may be, spend time with her as much as you can. If she love you, and vice versa, both will come to a compromise.</span><br><br>5. Can we be excused or request for FALL OUT if we cannot concentrate in training due to BGR problems...<br><br><span style="color: red;">NS teaches you to become a Man; someone who is able to prioritise things; compartmentalise matters, problems, issues. DON'T let BGR problems affect you in camp and DON'T let things in camp affect your relationshp. Fully grasping this, can really benefit you A LOT.</span><br><br>6. What are the consequences of AWOL (Absent without official leave)?<br><br><span style="color: red;">..need I say more? Clean bars lah!</span></strong><br><br>I can't say I have the best knowledge; but I can say I went through 2 and a half yrs of NS, maintained a relationship throughout and this august will be our 4 years anniversary.<br><br>I always tell this to my ex-trainees who came to me for BGR problems:<br><br>Do you think she love you? or<br><br>Do you KNOW that she loves you?<br><br>And of course the famous quote:<br><br>"If your girl leaves you when you're in NS, she's not worth to spend your entire life with.

Well, not exactly worry-less, but if you and ur gf trust each other u'd be fine. I spent roughly a year apart from my gf, due to training, and ya, the worst part is when u're overseas. Just remember, dun bloody do anything wrong in camp and u'd be fine. The worst phase is when u're a trainee. Once u've graduated from the phase, u'd be all right <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> army IS a test of ur relationship. If she cant wait, she's not worth ur time.<br><br>2. 50%. Listen dude, there WILL be times that u have squibbles and quarrels, but IT IS NORMAL. i think u should worry more if u dun quarrel, cos quarrelling is part of a healthy relationship. there WILL be times where u become insecure, but never let it get to u.<br><br>3. Yes. The key to this is mutual trust. If the both of u believe that u r meant to be together, u WILL be together. Conversely, if u become insecure, she WILL leave u. trust me. TRUST IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT.<br><br>4. Well, u'd want to see her, u'd want to be with her .. but going out together? err.. u'd be quite tired. I remember i fell asleep in a movie once when i was out with my girlfriend on one of my book-outs. She was quite upset but i was really tired. U'd know once u enlist. But every relationship is about compromising... so dun think too much of it.<br><br>5. I dunno abt that.<br><br>6. Dun even think about it. The army's detention barracks is not a place u'd want to experience. and it's definitely not worth it. People there are treated worse den dogs, have u heard of sandbag PT? It's not something u'd be very keen to try, trust me on it.<br><br>Lastly, don't worry too much !! Army is a phase every boy has to go through to turn into a man, and i think u shouldn't dread it too much. The key to a successful relationship is trust. U HAVE TO TRUST HER. don't question her whereabouts, what time she came home last night .. etc etc. she'd tell u if she wants to. it's possible to have a r/s in army. I did it, my sis and her bf did it, and many many others did it.. u can do it too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck !!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My case is quite unique haha.  I only got together with my gf about 1 week before I went into Tekong, so I guess we do not miss the 'everyday can see' feeling since we never had it in the first place.<br><br>So far so good for me...finished BMT still together.
