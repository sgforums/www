              <div>SINGAPORE - The Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) has been revised with the scrapping of the Standing Broad Jump, shuttle run and pull-up stations.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The new IPPT will have only three stations: the 2.4km run, sit-ups, and a new testing criterion, push-ups. It replaces the current five-station physical fitness test which has chin-ups, standing broad jump, 4x10m shuttle, sit-up and the 2.4km run.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen announced the changes in his Facebook page on Wednesday in a post titled "New IPPT - Simpler and Better", adding that the SAF expects "more to pass" the new test.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>He said the new format will "make it simpler for NSmen to train for IPPT, and for more to pass" adding that many other militaries use 3-station tests to keep their forces fit. There will also be a new scoring system and more age bands with Operationally-Ready National Servicemen (NSmen) finding it easier to meet the passing marks and qualify for monetary awards.<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/more-singapore-stories/story/new-ippt-will-have-three-stations-standing-broad-jump-sh"> - ST </a></div>

              <p>The Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) for National 
              Servicemen will be reduced from the current five stations to just three:
               A 2.4km run, sit-ups and push-ups. The aim of the changes: Getting more
               NSmen to keep healthy as a lifestyle, and helping them pass their test.</p>
              <p>He
               did not mention when the changes will be implemented, but added that 
              Chief of Army Perry Lim will provide more details on Thursday. Changes 
              to the IPPT format were last made in 1982.</p>
              <p>"This new format will 
              make it simpler for NSmen to train for IPPT, and for more to pass. Many 
              other militaries use 3-station tests to keep their forces fit," said 
              Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen in a Facebook post on Wednesday (July 23).</p>
              <p>The new test system will not require NSmen to meet a minimum passing mark for every station, Dr Ng said.</p>
              <p>"We
               will also have more age bands and a new scoring system. Instead of a 
              pass mark for each station, points will be awarded and the combined 
              points from the 3 stations will be used. This way, soldiers can make up 
              through more sit-ups, if they are weak in push-ups and running, or vice 
              versa. There’s a limit to how much you can make up, but I like this 
              counting system because it encourages NSmen to max out on each station 
              and it plays to the individual’s strengths," he wrote on Facebook.</p>
              <p>The
               overall passing mark will remain "about the same as before" for 
              Full-Time NSmen, Regulars and Awards, while some adjustments will be 
              made based on past data for NSmen, he said.</p>
              <p>He added: "Even though
               the new IPPT is simpler to train for, it will still take effort and 
              regular exercise to pass. And that’s the idea – keeping healthy and fit 
              should be a lifestyle and it’s good for you. We expect more to pass the 
              new IPPT, as a result. Look out for training apps and programmes to help
               you"</p>
              <p>HOME TEAM WILL FOLLOW NEW IPPT FORMAT</p>
              <p>The Ministry of 
              Home Affairs added in a statement that the new IPPT format will apply to
               Home Team National Servicemen - which includes those from the Singapore
               Civil Defence Force and the Singapore Police Force - from next year.</p>
              <p>“Physical
               Fitness is a requisite for Home Team frontline officers. National 
              Servicemen are an integral part of the Home Team. The Home Team has been
               working with MINDEF/SAF on the proposed changes to the Individual 
              Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) and will also be implementing the new 
              IPPT format for Home Team National Servicemen in 2015," the ministry 
              said.</p>

              <p>The
               new NS IPPT Management system will be in effect from 1 Sep 2014. 
              Enhancements to the NS IPPT policies seek to ease administrative 
              constraints to better support NSmen in managing their fitness and other 
              commitments. The key changes are as follows:</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">a.    Extension of IPPT/IPT/RT windows to 12 months.<br> b.    Increase in monetary incentives for good IPPT performance.</p>
              <p>Concurrently, the SAF will improve IPT and RT fitness training in the Fitness Conditioning Centres (FCCs). From <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1 Sep 14</span>, all Fitness Conditioning Centres (FCCs) will be providing a greater variety of training and specialised fitness classes.<br> <br> As part of SAF’s continuous efforts to review the fitness training 
              system, a new IPPT format that is simpler to administer and simpler for 
              servicemen to train for will be introduced. A pilot implementation 
              involving selected Army NS and Active units (i.e. at least 3,000 active 
              and NS participants from various age groups, vocations and gender) will 
              be conducted from Sep to Nov 2014.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>THE ENHANCED NS IPPT SYSTEM</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>(With Effect From 1 September 2014)</strong></span><br> <br> <strong>Enhancements with effect from 1 September 2014:</strong><br> <br> 1.    Pictorial diagrams of the current and new NS IPPT management system are as follows:</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://lifestyle.www.ns.sg/image/image_gallery?uuid=17d97be3-67a9-4935-b8a7-0357c5816f6e&amp;groupId=10401&amp;t=1406197426269" alt="" width="400" height="257"></p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">a.    The IPPT window has been extended from 9 months to <strong>12</strong> months. In this window, NSmen must attempt and pass their IPPT test. 
              Alternatively, they can volunteer for a 10-session IPT programme. They 
              will exit the IPT programme if they (1) complete 10 sessions of IPT; or 
              (2) meet their Personal Performance Targets. <br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example 1</span>:<br> <br> My birthday is on 1 January.<br>  <br> Old system: my IPPT window is 9-months long: 1 January 2015 to 30 September 2015.<br>  <br> New IPPT system: my IPPT window is 12-months long: 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2015.<br>  <br> b.    The RT window has been extended from 3 months to <strong>12</strong> months. In this window, NSmen must complete their 20-session RT 
              programme. They will exit the RT programme if they (1) complete 20 
              sessions of RT; or (2) pass IPPT during the stipulated RT-IPPT sessions.<br>  <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example 2</span>:<br>  <br> My birthday is on 1 January.<br>  <br> Old system: my RT window is 3-months long: 1 October 2015 to 31 December 2015.<br>  <br> New IPPT system: my new RT window is 12-months long : 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016</p>
              <p>2.  
                The quantum for the IPPT monetary incentives has been enhanced. The 
              revised quantum is applicable to NSmen with birthday windows starting 
              from 1 Sep 2014. For example, if your birthday window starts on 1 Sep 
              2014, you will be eligible for $500 if you attain Gold award. However, 
              if your birthday window starts on 31 Aug, you will still be subjected to
               the old system, and you will receive $400 if you attain Gold, even if 
              you take the IPPT after 1 Sep.</p>

              <p style="text-align: left;">3.    NSmen who do not perform IPPT and/or RT will continue to be disciplinarily dealt with.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Transition to new IPPT system</strong></span><br> <br> 4.    As at 1 September 2014, NSmen who are still in their IPPT window 
              will enjoy an automatic extension of their IPPT window by 3 months. 
              Those within their 3-month RT window will have an extended RT window 
              (i.e. remaining RT window + next 12-month window).</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://lifestyle.www.ns.sg/image/image_gallery?uuid=297129e0-21eb-4d10-9007-bdb25a00cbd5&amp;groupId=10401&amp;t=1406249720590" alt="" width="500" height="154"></p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;"> a.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example 3</span>: <br> My birthday is on 1 August. On 1 September 2014, I am 1 month into my IPPT window.<br> <br> After extension, my new IPPT window will be 12-months long. It will be 
              until 30 Jul 2015 instead of 30 April 2015. I will need to complete 
              either my 10-session IPT program or perform at least 1 IPPT test.<br> <br> b.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example 4</span>: <br> My birthday is on 1 January and I failed my IPPT. On 1 September 2014, I am in my RT window.<br> <br> After extension, my new RT window will be from 1 September 2014 to 31 
              December 2015 (i.e. remaining RT window + 12-months) instead of 31 
              December 2014. I will need to complete 20 sessions of RT in this new 
              window or pass an IPPT during a stipulated RT-IPPT session.</p>
              <p>5.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">One-time Reset of Default Offences</span>. 
               NSmen with existing offences and charges are allowed a one-time 
              opportunity to reset all offences by completing their IPPT requirements 
              during this transition.</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">a.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example 5</span>:<br> My birthday is on 1 January and I failed my IPPT. I have defaulted my 
              RT for my past 2 windows and have been charged. After extension, my new 
              RT window will be from 1 Sep 2014 to 31 Dec 2015. If I complete my 20 
              sessions of RT in this RT window, my 2 existing default counts in the 
              system will be reset to zero. If I default my RT again, I will be 
              disciplinarily dealt with.</p>

               reviews our training system, including physical training regimes and 
              physical fitness tests, to ensure that they are relevant and effective. 
              Starting from 1 Sep 2014, the SAF will launch a pilot implementation of a
               new and simpler Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) format, 
              which will be accompanied by a new scoring system. The new IPPT format 
              is expected to be fully implemented across the SAF in 2015.<br> <br> <strong>KEY FEATURES OF THE NEW IPPT FORMAT AND SCORING SYSTEM</strong><br> <br> 2.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A simpler three-station IPPT format to encourage personal ownership of fitness</span>. 
               The new three-station test format will comprise a push-up test, a 
              sit-up test, and a 2.4km run. These stations will measure the strength 
              and cardiovascular fitness of our servicemen. This new and simpler 
              format was designed to allow servicemen to train and maintain their 
              fitness, without the need for specialised technique or equipment. 
              Fitness is a personal responsibility. This simpler test format will 
              further motivate our servicemen to take greater ownership of their 
              fitness, and incorporate these exercises into their daily routine to 
              maintain their fitness.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><span><img src="http://lifestyle.www.ns.sg/image/image_gallery?uuid=a497af9a-5830-4fa8-b146-3606a64e36c0&amp;groupId=10401&amp;t=1406250852346" alt="" width="400" height="125"></span><br><span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Table 1.  New IPPT Format.</span></span></p>
              <p>3.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">New scoring system to motivate personal excellence</span>.
               The SAF will also introduce a new scoring system to accompany the new 
              IPPT format. Servicemen will be allocated points for their performance 
              in each of the three stations. The maximum number of points servicemen 
              may earn for each station are 50 points for the 2.4km run station, and 
              25 points each for the Push Up and Sit Up stations. The maximum number 
              of points a serviceman can achieve in the IPPT is 100. The points will 
              be added together to form a final score, which will determine the 
              serviceman’s individual fitness standard. Similar to the current IPPT, 
              servicemen will need to score the requisite number of points to Pass, 
              Pass with monetary incentive, and to achieve the Silver and Gold IPPT 
              awards. Active servicemen will continue to be held to a higher passing 
              standard because fitness training is incorporated into their work and 
              training routine. To ensure the high standards of our elite combat 
              troops - Commando, Diver, and Guards will be held to a higher Gold IPPT 
              standard. <br> <br> 4.    This new scoring system will encourage 
              servicemen to do their best for each of the stations. The better they 
              perform in the stations, the more points they will be awarded. The 
              flexibility of the new scoring system will motivate servicemen to 
              exercise greater ownership on how they will train for their IPPT, 
              allowing them to tap on their individual strengths to do well.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><span><img src="http://lifestyle.www.ns.sg/image/image_gallery?uuid=af529c81-ef03-4465-939d-8a4b0162461f&amp;groupId=10401&amp;t=1406251254182" alt="" width="400" height="151"></span><br><span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Table 2. New IPPT Standards</span>.</span></p>
              <p>5.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shorter age categories for a better performance-to-age match</span>. 
               As part of this physical fitness review, we will also shorten our age 
              categories, from 5-year bands to 3-year bands. This shorter age 
              categories allow us to better differentiate the different age groups of 
              our servicemen, and is a better performance-to-age match. Instead of 
              having to perform to the same standards in a five year age block, 
              servicemen will perform to a new standard every three years. This 
              shorter age category will be more sensitive to the effects of age on the
               physical fitness of our servicemen.<br> <br> <strong>EXAMPLE</strong><br> <br> 6.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Age Group 3 Pass example</span>. 
               For a 25 to 27 year old NSmen to achieve Pass he would be required to 
              perform 16 Push Ups in 1 min (6 pts), 30 Sit Ups in 1 min (14 pts) and 
              complete his 2.4km run in 12min 40s (31 pts). With this performance, he 
              would accumulate a total score of 51 points, which would make him 
              eligible for the Pass Award.<br> <br> 7.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Age Group 6 Gold Award example</span>.
               For a 34 to 36 year old serviceman aiming to achieve Gold award, he 
              would be required to perform 35 Push Ups in 1 min (20 pts), 35 Sit Ups 
              in 1 min (20 pts) and complete his 2.4km run in 10min 40s (41 pts). With
               this performance, he would accumulate a total score of 81 points, which
               would make him eligible for the Gold Award.<br> <br> <strong>IMPLEMENTATION</strong><br> <br> 8.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pilot implementation</span>.
               Army will conduct a pilot implementation from Sep to Nov 14 to 
              fine-tune the administration of the new IPPT.  Selected Active and NS 
              units will participate in this phase. At least 3,000 servicemen and 
              servicewomen of different vocations and age groups will be represented 
              in the pilot implementation.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Frequently Answered Questions</span><br> <br> <strong>What is the current NS IPPT Management System?</strong><br> <br> The current NS IPPT management system was implemented on 1 April 2011. 
              Under this system, NSmen are required to pass their IPPT within the 
              first 9 months of their birthday window.  Those who fail or default on 
              their IPPT have to attend 20 sessions of Remedial Training (RT) in the 
              last 3 months of their birthday window. NSmen can also volunteer for 
              IPPT Preparatory Training (IPT) in the first 9 months of their birthday 
              window, and will fulfil their IPPT requirement for the year if they meet
               their Personal Performance Targets (PPTs)<sup>1</sup> . Those who fail to meet their PPTs have to attend 8 sessions of RT in the last 3 months of their birthday window. <br> <br> <sup>1 </sup><span style="font-size: 10px;">PPTs
               are intermediate standards raised progressively at an annual rate 
              towards an IPPT Pass. The PPT standard is derived from the results of 
              the IPPT conducted during the first session of IPT. </span><br> <br> <strong>What are the key changes under the enhanced NS IPPT Management System?</strong><br> <br> With effect from 1 Sep 2014, NSmen will be given 12 months to attempt 
              and pass their IPPT. Alternatively, NSmen that require help can 
              volunteer for a 10-session IPPT Preparatory Training (IPT). NSmen who 
              pass their IPPT or complete IPT will proceed to either IPPT or IPT in 
              their next 12-month birthday window. NSmen who fail or default IPPT or 
              IPT will be subject to Remedial Training (RT). They will be required to 
              complete their RT programme within their subsequent 12-month birthday 
              windows. NSmen who volunteer for IPT will be considered to have met 
              their IPPT requirement for the year if they (1) meet their Personal 
              Performance Targets (PPT) at any point in the programme; or (2) complete
               10 sessions of IPT within their birthday window. NSmen on IPT are 
              advised to attend training at least once a week continuously for 10 
              sessions to obtain the benefits of the training regime. <br> <br> <strong>What are the specific changes to the IPPT Management System? </strong></p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">a.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extension of IPPT/IPT to 12 months</span>.  
               The IPPT/IPT window will be extended from the current 9 months to 12 
              months, to give NSmen more time to attempt and pass IPPT or complete 
              IPT. <br> <br> b.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extension of RT window to 12 months</span>.   
              Instead of the last 3 months in their present window, NSmen who default 
              or fail the IPPT will be given 12 months in their next birthday window 
              to complete 20 sessions of RT. This extension is to enable NSmen to 
              better manage their other commitments so that they can meet the RT 
              requirements. NSmen are advised to attend RT at least once a week 
              continuously for the duration of his RT in order to obtain the benefits 
              of the training regime.</p>
              <p> <strong>What are the changes to IPPT Preparatory Training?</strong><br> <br> The IPT programme will continue to be available to NSmen who need help 
              with IPPT training. Participants will be able to exit the programme upon
               meeting their PPTs.<br> <br> <em>Monetary Incentive</em><br> <br> <strong>What are the changes in monetary incentive for IPPT performance?</strong><br> <br> To motivate personnel to do their best and maintain a high level of 
              physical fitness, the quantum of the awards will be increased by $100. 
              The new quantum will apply to NSmen with birthday windows starting from 1
               Sep 2014; NSFs whose IPPT windows start from 1 Sep 2014; and Regulars 
              for tests taken from 1 Apr 2015.</p>

              <p><em>Disciplinary Framework</em><br> <br> <strong>Under the enhanced NS IPPT management system, what happens when NSmen fail or default their IPPT?</strong><br> <br> Currently, both IPPT defaulters and failures are subject to 20 sessions of RT within the 3-month RT window.<br> <br> <em>Enhanced Fitness Training at Fitness Conditioning Centres (FCCs)</em><br> <br> <strong>Will there be changes to the training provided by FCCs?</strong><br> <br> From 1 Sep 2014, the conduct of IPT and RT at FCCs will be enhanced. The enhancements are as follows:</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">1.   
               FCCs will be offering a greater variety of fitness programmes beyond 
              IPPT-specific training as part of IPT/RT activities. These programmes 
              will include high-intensity circuit training, sports-based training and 
              specialised fitness classes such as kick-boxing and spinning. <br> <br> 2.    NSmen will be given the flexibility to choose the programme that best meets their fitness training needs. <br> <br> 3.    IPT/RT sessions will be conducted in smaller group size of 30 
              participants (compared to current group size of 50 NSmen) to enable more
               personalised coaching by the fitness trainers. <br> <br> 4.    With 
              smaller group sizes and more targeted training, the duration of each 
              session will be reduced from 2hrs currently to 1hr15mins inclusive of 
              in- and out-processing time. <br> <br> 5.    To provide more convenience
               for NSmen, FCC opening hours will be extended. In addition to opening 
              up more IPT/RT sessions on weekday nights and weekends, FCCs will also 
              be exploring weekday lunch-hour IPT sessions.  <br> <br> 6.    The lead time for booking of IPT/RT slots will also be reduced to allow same-day booking.</p>
              <p><br> <em>New IPPT format</em><br> <strong><br> What is the impetus for the new IPPT format?</strong><br> <br> Physical fitness of our servicemen is tested using the IPPT protocol. 
              Prior to 2009, combat fitness was assessed using our Standard Obstacle 
              Course and route marches. Since then, the Army has strengthened combat 
              fitness training with the introduction of Vocation-Related Exercises and
               Vocation Obstacle Courses to meet our new operational demands. With 
              this in place, it is now timely to review our physical fitness test 
              protocol and standards.<br> <br> <strong>Will the Home Team be implementing the new IPPT format? </strong><br> <br> Yes, the Home Team will be adopting the same IPPT format as the SAF. 
              The Home Team has assessed that the new IPPT format would meet their 
              needs for assessing the physical fitness of Home Team NSmen/NSFs. <br> <br> <strong>When will the trial for the new IPPT format be held?</strong><br> <br> The trial will be conducted by the Army Fitness Centre from Sep - Nov 
              2014. It will involve at least 3,000 Active and NS personnel across 
              different gender, age groups and vocations. NSmen from selected units 
              will participate in the trial during their ICT.<br> <br> <strong>Will SAF make any more changes to the new IPPT format and scoring system?</strong><br> <br> SAF does not plan to make any more changes to the new IPPT format and 
              scoring system. SAF continuously reviews our fitness training system to 
              ensure that we maintain our high standards. <br> <br> <strong>Is it easier to pass the IPPT now?</strong><br> <br> Passing and excelling in IPPT will still require dedicated training and
               effort by servicemen. However with the simpler and more motivating 
              format and scoring system, servicemen will be more motivated to train. <br> <br> <strong>Why is there a need for a new scoring system?</strong><br> <br> The intention of the new scoring system is to motivate our servicemen 
              to excel in all the test stations. We want to encourage everyone to 
              train to their maximum potential.<br> <br> <strong>Why did SAF/HT move towards a 3-year age band?</strong><br> <br> We recognise that a 3-year age band will provide a better performance-to-age match compared to the current 5-year age band.<br> <br> <strong>How well will this new IPPT structure reflect fitness levels of our soldiers/HT NSmen/NSFs?</strong><br> <br> The 3 stations provide a good measurement of basic physical fitness as 
              it focuses on the three main body parts. When viewed in totality with 
              SAF's other combat fitness regimes such as loaded route marches, VRE and
               SOC/VOC, it is reflective of the fitness levels of our soldiers.<br> <br> For the Home Team, the new IPPT structure is a good assessment of the 
              basic physical fitness of Home Team NSmen/NSFs. In addition, Home Team 
              NSmen/NSFs have to undergo certification and proficiency tests such as 
              the Police Defence Tactics and Hazmat Rescue Certification Test to 
              ensure that they meet the physical demands of frontline operations.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>On Wednesday (July 23), Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen announced on 
              Facebook that the Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) will be 
              revised to three stations from the current five. This was followed by a 
              media briefing in which Chief of Army, Major-General Perry Lim; Colonel 
              Ng Ying Thong, Assistant Chief of General Staff (Training); and 
              Director, National Service Affairs, Brigadier-General (NS) Tung Yui Fai,
               took questions on the changes.</p>
              <p>“The main aim was really to have a simpler format that they can train for. That is the main aim,” said the Chief of Army.</p>
              <p>WHAT WILL THE NEW IPPT CONSIST OF?</p>
              <p>Just
               three stations: A 2.4km run, sit-ups, and a new discipline that will be
               familiar to all National Servicemen: Push-ups. Gone are the standing 
              broad jump, pull-ups and the shuttle run, in the first change of IPPT 
              format since 1982.</p>
              <p>HOW DOES SCORING WORK?</p>
              <p>Participants will 
              be allocated points for their performance in each of the three stations,
               with a maximum of 50 points awarded for the 2.4km run and 25 points 
              each for the push-up and sit-up stations – for a maximum score of 100 
              points.</p>
              <p>The total points that an individual scores in each of the 
              three stations will determine whether he passes or fails, and whether he
               gets a monetary award. For example, an NSman will need a total of more 
              than 50 points for a pass, and more than 80 points for a Gold award. 
              Commandos, divers and guardsmen will need at least 85 points to score 
              Gold.</p>
              <p>Scoring will also be divided into more age categories, based
               on smaller age bands of three years each, rather than five. Goodbye, 
              Cat Z.</p>
              <p>WILL THIS MEAN IT’LL BE EASIER TO PASS THE IPPT?</p>
              <p>Defence
               Minister Ng said on Wednesday that “this new format will make it 
              simpler for NSmen to train for IPPT – and for more to pass”. But as for 
              scoring well …</p>
              <p>Said MG Lim: “In designing the new IPPT format and 
              scoring system, it was very important that we uphold the standards of 
              physical fitness that we require of our soldiers. So, in order to 
              achieve the Gold and Silver standards, it will be just as challenging as
               before.</p>
              <p>“As to why it seems easier for people who are less fit to
               get points: This new system is to motivate those who are very fit to 
              excel. We designed it such that for those who really want to score 25 
              for push-ups or sit-ups, or to score 50 for the run, it becomes more and
               more difficult.</p>
              <p>“I think that servicemen should give this IPPT format a try first before they come to any conclusions.”</p>
              <p>CAN I FAIL A STATION?</p>
              <p>Yes, if you score zero points. “At the least, NSmen must achieve one point for each of the stations,” said Col Ng.</p>
              <p>WHEN WILL THE CHANGES TAKE EFFECT?</p>
              <p>The
               new IPPT format will be implemented SAF-wide, for regulars and NSFs as 
              well as NSmen, from April 1, 2015. The Ministry of Home Affairs said on 
              Wednesday the Home Team, consisting of the police and Singapore Civil 
              Defence Forces, will adopt the new format in 2015.</p>
              <p>“A pilot 
              implementation of the new IPPT format will take place from September to 
              November this year. We are looking at around 10 to 12 active units and 
              up to eight NS units who are returning to camp for their In-Camp 
              Training during this period. So we will try to cover servicemen from 
              across all age bands, vocations and gender,” said MG Lim.</p>
              <p>He added that they are prepared to adjust the scoring table after the pilot this year, if needed.</p>
              <p>WHY THE CHANGES?</p>
              <p>First, the combat readiness of soldiers is now being tested in other ways.</p>
              <p>“Over
               the last few years, we have implemented a revised combat fitness 
              training and test regime for our soldiers and this is in the form of the
               new standard obstacle course (SOC), vocation obstacle course (VOC) and 
              vocation-related exercises (VRE). Our soldiers also continue to build 
              their combat fitness through route marches as well as participation in 
              field exercises,” said MG Lim. “Having implemented an effective combat 
              fitness regime, we are now able to simplify the IPPT format to one that 
              is still an effective measure of basic physical fitness of our 
              soldiers.”</p>
              <p>Second, it’s a move to make fitness less of a burden, and more of a lifestyle.</p>
              <p>“We
               want to change the perception of IPPT: From being an imposition on the 
              lives of our NSmen to one that encourages them to make physical fitness 
              and physical training a part of their lifestyles. The format has been 
              simplified such that NSmen can train in their own time without the need 
              for specialised equipment. I think the best outcome for the army is that
               our NSmen can adopt these three stations as part of their regular 
              exercise regime, such that IPPT is just testing what they do on a 
              regular basis,” said MG Lim.</p>
              <p>WHY PUSH-UPS? WHY WERE THE PREVIOUS THREE STATIONS SCRAPPED?</p>
              <p>“In
               designing the IPPT format, we wanted to focus on three groups – one is 
              the upper body muscular strength and endurance (push-ups); the second is
               the core body strength and endurance (sit-ups); and of course, the 
              2.4km run,” said MG Lim.</p>
              <p>“As for the push-ups station which is 
              new, we take reference from the US Army. And I think you will also have 
              done your research I am sure, that some of the conscript militaries like
               Korea has also adopted these three stations.”</p>
              <p>“In terms of 
              pull-ups, in our combat fitness training regime, like the SOC and the 
              VOCs, our soldiers are required to execute movements that require them 
              to also manage or carry their body weight. So in that sense chin-ups are
               taken care of. Also, although it is not tested as part of the three 
              stations, our soldiers in active units and leadership schools will still
               be doing chin-ups as part of their daily routine.”</p>
              <p>WHAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE HARDWARE FOR THE DROPPED STATIONS?</p>
              <p>“We’re
               going to leave the chin up bars there, obviously, because it is still 
              an excellent exercise,” said MG Lim. As for the others – “I don’t see 
              the harm of leaving them there,’ said BG Tung.</p>
              <p>CAN I TAKE THE OLD IPPT STATIONS IF I WANT?</p>
              <p>Yes, for one to two years from April 1, 2015.</p>
              <p>“We’re
               prepared to give our NSmen an option to do either the existing IPPT 
              format which is the five-station format, or the new IPPT format for 
              another … one to two years after 1 April next year. So they will have an
               option, depending on which format they are prepared and comfortable 
              with at that point in time,” said MG Lim.</p>
              <p>WHY EXTEND THE IPPT WINDOW TO 12 MONTHS?</p>
              <p>Under
               the proposed changes, an NSman’s window to take and pass his IPPT is up
               to a full year from the current nine months, with a further 12 months 
              to complete remedial training. The reason: Flexibility of scheduling, 
              said MG Lim.</p>
              <p>“When we give our NSmen up to 12 months to train for 
              their IPPT and up to 12 months to complete their RT sessions, we also 
              encourage them that they need to do it regularly. That means that you 
              don’t space out all your sessions across all 12 months, but we do tell 
              them that you need to do it within a certain period. It’s just that 
              giving them 12 months will give them some flexibility. They still need 
              to exercise regularly, at least twice a week,” said the Chief of Army.</p>
              <p>WHAT ABOUT IPT AND RT? ANY CHANGES?</p>
              <p>No.
               "We think that some of our NSmen will still need help as we move to a 
              three-station IPPT format, so we will retain the IPT (IPPT Preparatory 
              Training) as well as the RT (Remedial Training) sessions and conduct 
              them in our Fitness Conditioning Centres. So that will still remain," 
              said MG Lim.</p>
              <p>WILL THIS AFFECT THE PHYSICAL TESTING SYSTEM IN SCHOOLS?</p>
              <p>At the tertiary levels, yes, but it’s not yet clear to what extent. And not so much at Primary and Secondary School. </p>
              <p>Said MG Lim: “In terms of the actual details, we’re still working out with the Ministry of Education.”</p>

              <p><em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Frequently Answered Questions</span></strong></em><br> <br> <strong>What is the current NS IPPT Management System?</strong><br> <br> The current NS IPPT management system was implemented on 1 April 2011. 
              Under this system, NSmen are required to pass their IPPT within the 
              first 9 months of their birthday window.  Those who fail or default on 
              their IPPT have to attend 20 sessions of Remedial Training (RT) in the 
              last 3 months of their birthday window. NSmen can also volunteer for 
              IPPT Preparatory Training (IPT) in the first 9 months of their birthday 
              window, and will fulfil their IPPT requirement for the year if they meet
               their Personal Performance Targets (PPTs)<sup>1</sup> . Those who fail to meet their PPTs have to attend 8 sessions of RT in the last 3 months of their birthday window. <br> <br> <sup>1 </sup><span style="font-size: 10px;">PPTs
               are intermediate standards raised progressively at an annual rate 
              towards an IPPT Pass. The PPT standard is derived from the results of 
              the IPPT conducted during the first session of IPT. </span><br> <br> <strong>What are the key changes under the enhanced NS IPPT Management System?</strong><br> <br> With effect from 1 Sep 2014, NSmen will be given 12 months to attempt 
              and pass their IPPT. Alternatively, NSmen that require help can 
              volunteer for a 10-session IPPT Preparatory Training (IPT). NSmen who 
              pass their IPPT or complete IPT will proceed to either IPPT or IPT in 
              their next 12-month birthday window. NSmen who fail or default IPPT or 
              IPT will be subject to Remedial Training (RT). They will be required to 
              complete their RT programme within their subsequent 12-month birthday 
              windows. NSmen who volunteer for IPT will be considered to have met 
              their IPPT requirement for the year if they (1) meet their Personal 
              Performance Targets (PPT) at any point in the programme; or (2) complete
               10 sessions of IPT within their birthday window. NSmen on IPT are 
              advised to attend training at least once a week continuously for 10 
              sessions to obtain the benefits of the training regime. <br> <br> <strong>What are the specific changes to the IPPT Management System? </strong></p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">a.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extension of IPPT/IPT to 12 months</span>.  
               The IPPT/IPT window will be extended from the current 9 months to 12 
              months, to give NSmen more time to attempt and pass IPPT or complete 
              IPT. <br> <br> b.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extension of RT window to 12 months</span>.   
              Instead of the last 3 months in their present window, NSmen who default 
              or fail the IPPT will be given 12 months in their next birthday window 
              to complete 20 sessions of RT. This extension is to enable NSmen to 
              better manage their other commitments so that they can meet the RT 
              requirements. NSmen are advised to attend RT at least once a week 
              continuously for the duration of his RT in order to obtain the benefits 
              of the training regime.</p>
              <p> <strong>What are the changes to IPPT Preparatory Training?</strong><br> <br> The IPT programme will continue to be available to NSmen who need help 
              with IPPT training. Participants will be able to exit the programme upon
               meeting their PPTs.<br> <br> <em>Monetary Incentive</em><br> <br> <strong>What are the changes in monetary incentive for IPPT performance?</strong><br> <br> To motivate personnel to do their best and maintain a high level of 
              physical fitness, the quantum of the awards will be increased by $100. 
              The new quantum will apply to NSmen with birthday windows starting from 1
               Sep 2014; NSFs whose IPPT windows start from 1 Sep 2014; and Regulars 
              for tests taken from 1 Apr 2015.</p>

              <p><em>Disciplinary Framework</em><br> <br> <strong>Under the enhanced NS IPPT management system, what happens when NSmen fail or default their IPPT?</strong><br> <br> Currently, both IPPT defaulters and failures are subject to 20 sessions of RT within the 3-month RT window.<br> <br> <em>Enhanced Fitness Training at Fitness Conditioning Centres (FCCs)</em><br> <br> <strong>Will there be changes to the training provided by FCCs?</strong><br> <br> From 1 Sep 2014, the conduct of IPT and RT at FCCs will be enhanced. The enhancements are as follows:</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">1.   
               FCCs will be offering a greater variety of fitness programmes beyond 
              IPPT-specific training as part of IPT/RT activities. These programmes 
              will include high-intensity circuit training, sports-based training and 
              specialised fitness classes such as kick-boxing and spinning. <br> <br> 2.    NSmen will be given the flexibility to choose the programme that best meets their fitness training needs. <br> <br> 3.    IPT/RT sessions will be conducted in smaller group size of 30 
              participants (compared to current group size of 50 NSmen) to enable more
               personalised coaching by the fitness trainers. <br> <br> 4.    With 
              smaller group sizes and more targeted training, the duration of each 
              session will be reduced from 2hrs currently to 1hr15mins inclusive of 
              in- and out-processing time. <br> <br> 5.    To provide more convenience
               for NSmen, FCC opening hours will be extended. In addition to opening 
              up more IPT/RT sessions on weekday nights and weekends, FCCs will also 
              be exploring weekday lunch-hour IPT sessions.  <br> <br> 6.    The lead time for booking of IPT/RT slots will also be reduced to allow same-day booking.</p>
              <p><br> <em>New IPPT format</em><br> <strong><br> What is the impetus for the new IPPT format?</strong><br> <br> Physical fitness of our servicemen is tested using the IPPT protocol. 
              Prior to 2009, combat fitness was assessed using our Standard Obstacle 
              Course and route marches. Since then, the Army has strengthened combat 
              fitness training with the introduction of Vocation-Related Exercises and
               Vocation Obstacle Courses to meet our new operational demands. With 
              this in place, it is now timely to review our physical fitness test 
              protocol and standards.<br> <br> <strong>Will the Home Team be implementing the new IPPT format? </strong><br> <br> Yes, the Home Team will be adopting the same IPPT format as the SAF. 
              The Home Team has assessed that the new IPPT format would meet their 
              needs for assessing the physical fitness of Home Team NSmen/NSFs. <br> <br> <strong>When will the trial for the new IPPT format be held?</strong><br> <br> The trial will be conducted by the Army Fitness Centre from Sep - Nov 
              2014. It will involve at least 3,000 Active and NS personnel across 
              different gender, age groups and vocations. NSmen from selected units 
              will participate in the trial during their ICT.<br> <br> <strong>Will SAF make any more changes to the new IPPT format and scoring system?</strong><br> <br> SAF does not plan to make any more changes to the new IPPT format and 
              scoring system. SAF continuously reviews our fitness training system to 
              ensure that we maintain our high standards. <br> <br> <strong>Is it easier to pass the IPPT now?</strong><br> <br> Passing and excelling in IPPT will still require dedicated training and
               effort by servicemen. However with the simpler and more motivating 
              format and scoring system, servicemen will be more motivated to train. <br> <br> <strong>Why is there a need for a new scoring system?</strong><br> <br> The intention of the new scoring system is to motivate our servicemen 
              to excel in all the test stations. We want to encourage everyone to 
              train to their maximum potential.<br> <br> <strong>Why did SAF/HT move towards a 3-year age band?</strong><br> <br> We recognise that a 3-year age band will provide a better performance-to-age match compared to the current 5-year age band.<br> <br> <strong>How well will this new IPPT structure reflect fitness levels of our soldiers/HT NSmen/NSFs?</strong><br> <br> The 3 stations provide a good measurement of basic physical fitness as 
              it focuses on the three main body parts. When viewed in totality with 
              SAF's other combat fitness regimes such as loaded route marches, VRE and
               SOC/VOC, it is reflective of the fitness levels of our soldiers.<br> <br> For the Home Team, the new IPPT structure is a good assessment of the 
              basic physical fitness of Home Team NSmen/NSFs. In addition, Home Team 
              NSmen/NSFs have to undergo certification and proficiency tests such as 
              the Police Defence Tactics and Hazmat Rescue Certification Test to 
              ensure that they meet the physical demands of frontline operations.</p>
