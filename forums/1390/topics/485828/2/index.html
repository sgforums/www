              <p>The format of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Individual Physical 
              Proficiency Test (IPPT) is similar to the physical fitness tests of 
              other militaries or government agencies in the world, especially the 
              United States. If that’s the case, how does the IPPT test standard 
              compare with that of other military physical fitness tests?</p>
              <p>Let’s 
              get Ah Seng to help us with this query. He is a 32-year-old combat 
              soldier who has an ambitious dream of being the first to achieve 100 
              points in the new IPPT. He has given us permission to use his recent 
              IPPT results and see how he would have fared in each of the different 
              physical fitness test (PFT) score chart that we can get our hands on.<br><br>For
               the record, he managed 12 minutes 14 seconds for his 2.4km run, 36 
              push-ups in 60 seconds and 42 sit-ups in 60 seconds. Based on the table 
              below, this is how he would score in the PFTs from the different US 
              uniformed groups and government agency.<br><br><img src="http://lifestyle.www.ns.sg/image/image_gallery?img_id=61734740&amp;t=1430191490190" alt="" width="580" height="310"><br><br>After
               comparing with the other PFTs, I can proudly say that our IPPT 
              standards are quite credible. This is because Ah Seng’s IPPT silver 
              standard result would have gotten him enlisted in the US Coast Guard and
               US Secret Service! The only red mark he got for this comparison test 
              was because he didn't meet the passing time for the 2.4km run under the 
              US Airforce Basic Military Training’s PFT. Even then he was just short 
              of 17 seconds from the passing mark.<br><br>Having said that, we 
              shouldn’t rest on our laurels and be complacent about our fitness 
              standards. Every soldier should aim to meet more than just the passing 
              criteria and have a dream like Ah Seng to get full marks for the IPPT.</p>

              <h2>Modified NAPFA Test for Pre-National Service Students from 2015</h2>
              <p>The National Physical Fitness Award 
                  (NAPFA) test was introduced in Singapore schools in 1982 at the 
                  secondary and pre-university levels, and in 1992 at the primary level.  
                  Currently, the NAPFA test comprises six test items to assess the 
                  different components of overall fitness.  The six test items are 
                  customised for different age groups.  For the post-secondary students, 
                  the test items are sit-up, pull-up (for males)/inclined pull-up (for 
                  females), sit-and-reach, standing broad jump, shuttle run and 2.4km 
                  run/walk.</p>
              <p>From January 2015, the NAPFA pull-up 
                  test will be replaced by a push-up test for pre-National Service (NS) 
                  students in pre-university institutions<sup id="foonote1-anchor"><a href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/2014/11/modified-napfa-test-for-pre-national-service-students-from-2015.php#footnote-1">1</a></sup> , polytechnics and Institute of Technical Education.  This will 
                  facilitate the use of the NAPFA test results for pre-enlistment purpose,
                   in line with the modifications in the Individual Physical Proficiency 
                  Test (IPPT) announced earlier by MINDEF<sup id="foonote2-anchor"><a href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/2014/11/modified-napfa-test-for-pre-national-service-students-from-2015.php#footnote-2">2</a></sup> .</p>
              <p>The NAPFA test, with its six test items,
                   will continue to provide a comprehensive indicator of students’ health-
                   and performance-related fitness for MOE’s purpose of developing 
                  students physically.  There will be no change to the NAPFA test items 
                  for all students at the primary and secondary levels, and for female 
                  students in pre-university institutions, polytechnics and Institute of 
                  Technical Education. Inclined pull-up and pull-up will continue to be 
                  used for this group to train upper body muscular strength and endurance.</p>
              <p>The table below shows the NAPFA and new IPPT items with effect from 2015.</p>

              <h4>About Physical Education Syllabus 2014</h4>
              <p>MOE’s new physical education (PE) 
                  syllabus is being introduced in stages from primary to pre-university 
                  level from 2014.  The new syllabus aims to equip students with the 
                  ability to engage in a wide range of physical activities and sports.  
                  This will lay a strong foundation for a lifelong pursuit of a physically
                   active and healthy lifestyle.</p>
              <p>Physical fitness will continue to be emphasised through the new Holistic Assessment<sup id="foonote3-anchor"><a href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/2014/11/modified-napfa-test-for-pre-national-service-students-from-2015.php#footnote-3">3</a></sup> in PE, which will be introduced to all schools in 2016 to support the 
                  new PE syllabus.  It will help students develop a holistic perspective 
                  of fitness and the enjoyment of exercise and sports.  Students will 
                  track their fitness level, participation in sports, games, and other 
                  physical activities.  In addition, students will design their own 
                  programmes to achieve their desired fitness levels for different 
                  purposes.</p>

              <h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enhancements to NS
              IPPT Management &amp; Training </span></h1>
              <div>
              <p><em><strong>July 2014</strong></em></p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>The new NS IPPT Management system will be in effect from
              1 Sep 2014.</strong></p>
              <p>Enhancements to the NS IPPT policies seek to ease administrative
              constraints to better support NSmen in managing their fitness and
              other commitments. The key changes are as follows:</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">a.   Extension of
              IPPT/IPT/RT windows to 12 months.<br> b.   Increase in monetary incentives for good IPPT
              performance.</p>
              <p>Concurrently, the SAF will improve IPT and RT fitness training
              in the Fitness Conditioning Centres (FCCs). From <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1 Sep 14</span>, all Fitness
              Conditioning Centres (FCCs) will be providing a greater variety of
              training and specialised fitness classes.<br> <br> As part of SAF's continuous efforts to review the fitness training
              system, a new IPPT format that is simpler to administer and simpler
              for servicemen to train for will be introduced. A pilot
              implementation involving selected Army NS and Active units (i.e. at
              least 3,000 active and NS participants from various age groups,
              vocations and gender) will be conducted from Sep to Nov 2014.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>THE ENHANCED NS
              IPPT SYSTEM</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>(With Effect From
              1 September 2014)</strong></span><br> <br> <strong>Enhancements with effect from 1 September
              2014:</strong><br> <br> 1.    Pictorial diagrams of the current and new NS
              IPPT management system are as follows:</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://lifestyle.www.ns.sg/image/image_gallery?uuid=17d97be3-67a9-4935-b8a7-0357c5816f6e&amp;amp;groupId=10401&amp;amp;t=1406197426269"><img src="http://lifestyle.www.ns.sg/image/image_gallery?uuid=17d97be3-67a9-4935-b8a7-0357c5816f6e&amp;amp;groupId=10401&amp;amp;t=1406197426269" alt="" width="288" height="185"></a></p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">a.    The IPPT window
              has been extended from 9 months to <strong>12</strong> months. In
              this window, NSmen must attempt and pass their IPPT test.
              Alternatively, they can volunteer for a 10-session IPT programme.
              They will exit the IPT programme if they (1) complete 10 sessions
              of IPT; or (2) meet their Personal Performance Targets.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example 1</span>:<br> <br> My birthday is on 1 January.<br>  <br> Old system: my IPPT window is 9-months long: 1 January 2015 to 30
              September 2015.<br>  <br> New IPPT system: my IPPT window is 12-months long: 1 January 2015
              to 31 December 2015.<br>  <br> b.    The RT window has been extended from 3 months
              to <strong>12</strong> months. In this window, NSmen must complete
              their 20-session RT programme. They will exit the RT programme if
              they (1) complete 20 sessions of RT; or (2) pass IPPT during the
              stipulated RT-IPPT sessions.<br>  <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example 2</span>:<br>  <br> My birthday is on 1 January.<br>  <br> Old system: my RT window is 3-months long: 1 October 2015 to 31
              December 2015.<br>  <br> New IPPT system: my new RT window is 12-months long : 1 January
              2016 to 31 December 2016.</p>
              <p>2.    The quantum for the IPPT monetary
              incentives has been enhanced. The revised quantum is applicable to
              NSmen with birthday windows starting from 1 Sep 2014. For example,
              if your birthday window starts on 1 Sep 2014, you will be eligible
              for $500 if you attain Gold award. However, if your birthday window
              starts on 31 Aug, you will still be subjected to the old system,
              and you will receive $400 if you attain Gold, even if you take the
              IPPT after 1 Sep.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://lifestyle.www.ns.sg/image/image_gallery?uuid=4ce11a50-c74c-4c92-b5a1-fafac271c38f&amp;amp;groupId=10401&amp;amp;t=1406197775143"><img src="http://lifestyle.www.ns.sg/image/image_gallery?uuid=4ce11a50-c74c-4c92-b5a1-fafac271c38f&amp;amp;groupId=10401&amp;amp;t=1406197775143" alt="" width="288" height="111"></a></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">3.    NSmen who do not
              perform IPPT and/or RT will continue to be disciplinarily dealt
              with.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Transition to new
              IPPT system</strong></span><br> <br> 4.    As at 1 September 2014, NSmen who are still in
              their IPPT window will enjoy an automatic extension of their IPPT
              window by 3 months. Those within their 3-month RT window will have
              an extended RT window (i.e. remaining RT window + next 12-month
              window).</p>

              AND SCORING SYSTEM</strong></span><br> <br> <strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br> <br> 1.    Fitness is an important element of soldiering.
              The SAF constantly reviews our training system, including physical
              training regimes and physical fitness tests, to ensure that they
              are relevant and effective. Starting from 1 Sep 2014, the SAF will
              launch a pilot implementation of a new and simpler Individual
              Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) format, which will be accompanied
              by a new scoring system. The new IPPT format is expected to be
              fully implemented across the SAF in 2015.<br> <br> <strong>KEY FEATURES OF THE NEW IPPT FORMAT AND SCORING
              SYSTEM</strong><br> <br> 2.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A
              simpler three-station IPPT format to encourage personal ownership
              of fitness</span>.  The new three-station test format will
              comprise a push-up test, a sit-up test, and a 2.4km run. These
              stations will measure the strength and cardiovascular fitness of
              our servicemen. This new and simpler format was designed to allow
              servicemen to train and maintain their fitness, without the need
              for specialised technique or equipment. Fitness is a personal
              responsibility. This simpler test format will further motivate our
              servicemen to take greater ownership of their fitness, and
              incorporate these exercises into their daily routine to maintain
              their fitness.</p>

              <p>3.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">New scoring system to motivate
              personal excellence</span>. The SAF will also introduce a new
              scoring system to accompany the new IPPT format. Servicemen will be
              allocated points for their performance in each of the three
              stations. The maximum number of points servicemen may earn for each
              station are 50 points for the 2.4km run station, and 25 points each
              for the Push Up and Sit Up stations. The maximum number of points a
              serviceman can achieve in the IPPT is 100. The points will be added
              together to form a final score, which will determine the
              serviceman's individual fitness standard. Similar to the current
              IPPT, servicemen will need to score the requisite number of points
              to Pass, Pass with monetary incentive, and to achieve the Silver
              and Gold IPPT awards. Active servicemen will continue to be held to
              a higher passing standard because fitness training is incorporated
              into their work and training routine. To ensure the high standards
              of our elite combat troops - Commando, Diver, and Guards will be
              held to a higher Gold IPPT standard.<br> <br> 4.    This new scoring system will encourage
              servicemen to do their best for each of the stations. The better
              they perform in the stations, the more points they will be awarded.
              The flexibility of the new scoring system will motivate servicemen
              to exercise greater ownership on how they will train for their
              IPPT, allowing them to tap on their individual strengths to do
              well.</p>

              performance-to-age match</span>.  As part of this physical
              fitness review, we will also shorten our age categories, from
              5-year bands to 3-year bands. This shorter age categories allow us
              to better differentiate the different age groups of our servicemen,
              and is a better performance-to-age match. Instead of having to
              perform to the same standards in a five year age block, servicemen
              will perform to a new standard every three years. This shorter age
              category will be more sensitive to the effects of age on the
              physical fitness of our servicemen.<br> <br> <strong>EXAMPLE</strong><br> <br> 6.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Age
              Group 3 Pass example</span>.  For a 25 to 27 year old NSmen to
              achieve Pass he would be required to perform 16 Push Ups in 1 min
              (6 pts), 30 Sit Ups in 1 min (14 pts) and complete his 2.4km run in
              12min 40s (31 pts). With this performance, he would accumulate a
              total score of 51 points, which would make him eligible for the
              Pass Award.<br> <br> 7.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Age
              Group 6 Gold Award example</span>. For a 34 to 36 year old

              perform 35 Push Ups in 1 min (20 pts), 35 Sit Ups in 1 min (20 pts)
              and complete his 2.4km run in 10min 40s (41 pts). With this
              performance, he would accumulate a total score of 81 points, which
              would make him eligible for the Gold Award.<br> <br> <strong>IMPLEMENTATION</strong><br> <br> 8.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pilot implementation</span>. Army
              will conduct a pilot implementation from Sep to Nov 14 to fine-tune
              the administration of the new IPPT. Selected Active and NS units
              will participate in this phase. At least 3,000 servicemen and
              servicewomen of different vocations and age groups will be
              represented in the pilot implementation.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Frequently Answered
              Questions</span><br> <br> <strong>What is the current NS IPPT Management
              System?</strong><br> <br> The current NS IPPT management system was implemented on 1 April
              2011. Under this system, NSmen are required to pass their IPPT
              within the first 9 months of their birthday window. Those who fail
              or default on their IPPT have to attend 20 sessions of Remedial
              Training (RT) in the last 3 months of their birthday window. NSmen
              can also volunteer for IPPT Preparatory Training (IPT) in the first
              9 months of their birthday window, and will fulfil their IPPT
              requirement for the year if they meet their Personal Performance
              Targets (PPTs)<sup>1</sup>. Those who fail to meet their PPTs have
              to attend 8 sessions of RT in the last 3 months of their birthday
              window.<br> <br> <sup>1</sup><span style="font-size: 10px;">PPTs are intermediate
              standards raised progressively at an annual rate towards an IPPT
              Pass. The PPT standard is derived from the results of the IPPT
              conducted during the first session of IPT.</span><br> <br> <strong>What are the key changes under the enhanced NS IPPT
              Management System?</strong><br> <br> With effect from 1 Sep 2014, NSmen will be given 12 months to
              attempt and pass their IPPT. Alternatively, NSmen that require help
              can volunteer for a 10-session IPPT Preparatory Training (IPT).
              NSmen who pass their IPPT or complete IPT will proceed to either
              IPPT or IPT in their next 12-month birthday window. NSmen who fail
              or default IPPT or IPT will be subject to Remedial Training (RT).
              They will be required to complete their RT programme within their
              subsequent 12-month birthday windows. NSmen who volunteer for IPT
              will be considered to have met their IPPT requirement for the year
              if they (1) meet their Personal Performance Targets (PPT) at any
              point in the programme; or (2) complete 10 sessions of IPT within
              their birthday window. NSmen on IPT are advised to attend training
              at least once a week continuously for 10 sessions to obtain the
              benefits of the training regime.<br> <br> <strong>What are the specific changes to the IPPT Management
              System?</strong></p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">a.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extension of IPPT/IPT to 12
              months</span>.   The IPPT/IPT window will be extended
              from the current 9 months to 12 months, to give NSmen more time to
              attempt and pass IPPT or complete IPT.<br> <br> b.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extension of RT window to 12
              months</span>.   Instead of the last 3 months in their
              present window, NSmen who default or fail the IPPT will be given 12
              months in their next birthday window to complete 20 sessions of RT.
              This extension is to enable NSmen to better manage their other
              commitments so that they can meet the RT requirements. NSmen are
              advised to attend RT at least once a week continuously for the
              duration of his RT in order to obtain the benefits of the training
              regime.</p>
              <p><strong>What are the changes to IPPT Preparatory
              Training?</strong><br> <br> The IPT programme will continue to be available to NSmen who need
              help with IPPT training. Participants will be able to exit the
              programme upon meeting their PPTs. To better recognise the efforts
              put in by NSmen to train for IPPT, with effect from 1 Sep 14,
              service pay for IPT programme will be accorded to NSmen whose
              birthday windows start from 1 Sep 14. NSmen who complete the
              requisite 10 sessions of IPT within the IPPT window but fail to
              meet PPTs will no longer be subject to 8 sessions of RT. To
              motivate NSmen to participate in as many IPT sessions as they can,
              NSmen who default on IPT will be subjected to 20 – D sessions of RT
              in the next window, where D is equal to the number of IPT sessions
              that the NSman participated in, in the preceding 12-month birthday
              window.<br> <br> <strong>Is there a change in determining whether NSmen have met
              their IPT/RT requirement?</strong><br> <br> NSmen who have failed or defaulted IPPT are liable for RT. NSmen
              who have defaulted IPPT will be liable for 20 sessions of RT during
              their 12-month RT window (new system with effect from 1 Sep 14). To
              differentiate between IPPT failures and defaulters, under the new
              system, failures will be liable to 20-D sessions (as opposed to 20
              sessions), where D is equivalent to the number of IPPT/IPT attempts
              made in the preceding window.<br> <br> NSmen who volunteer for IPT will be considered to have met their
              annual IPT requirements if they (1) pass IPPT; (2) meet their
              Personal Performance Targets anytime during their IPT programme; or
              (3) complete 10 sessions of IPT during their 12-month IPPT/IPT
              window (with effect from 1 Sep). They will no longer be liable for
              8-sessions of RT if they do not meet their Personal Performance
              Targets by the 10th session. This is to recognise that servicemen
              have put in their best efforts to train and meet their fitness
              targets in volunteering for and completing the 10-session
              programme.<br> <br> <strong>Under the enhanced NS IPPT management system are NSmen in
              RT allowed to participate in non-ICT IPPT that are not the
              stipulated RT-IPPT tests?</strong><br> <br> In the new system, NSmen in the RT programme will only be allowed
              to participate in ICT-IPPT or RT-IPPT on the stipulated 8th, 14th
              and 20th RT sessions. NSmen are given sufficient time to attempt
              and pass their IPPT during the 12-month IPPT window. NSmen that are
              in the RT programme are deemed to be servicemen that require help
              to train for and pass IPPT. As such, it is mandatory for NSmen in
              the RT programme to participate in at least 7 training sessions
              before they are allowed to attempt the IPPT.<br> <em><br> Monetary Incentive</em><br> <br> <strong>What are the changes in monetary incentive for IPPT
              performance?</strong><br> <br> To motivate personnel to do their best and maintain a high level of
              physical fitness, the quantum of the awards will be increased by
              $100. The new quantum will apply to NSmen with birthday windows
              starting from 1 Sep 2014; NSFs whose IPPT windows start from 1 Sep
              2014; and Regulars for tests taken from 1 Apr 2015.</p>

              when NSmen fail or default their IPPT?</strong><br> <br> Currently, both IPPT defaulters and failures are subject to 20
              sessions of RT within the 3-month RT window. In the enhanced
              system, there will be greater differentiation between IPPT Failures
              and Defaulters. IPPT failures will be subjected to fewer sessions
              of RT in the 12-month RT window. NSmen who fail will be subjected
              to 20 – D sessions of RT, where D is equal to the number of IPPT
              attempted in the previous 12-month birthday window. For defaulters,
              they will have to complete 20 sessions. Within the RT window,
              servicemen will only be allowed to exit RT if they attain the Pass
              standard at the stipulated test sessions (i.e. 8th, 14th and 20th
              sessions).<br> <br> <strong>What is SAF doing to deter recalcitrant
              defaulters?</strong><br> <br> IPPT is an annual requirement for all IPPT-eligible NSmen. NSmen
              who default their IPPT will be subjected to disciplinary action. A
              new disciplinary framework will be implemented from 1 Jan 15.
              Currently, NSmen with three such offences or more will be subject
              to either a Fine or be sent to Detention Barracks. Under the new
              framework, NSmen with three such offences will be subjected to Fine
              and a five-day residential In-Camp-Training (Physical Training)
              [ICT(PT)]. The ICT(PT) is a more constructive way to help NSmen to
              train for their fitness. The ICT(PT) focuses on teaching servicemen
              on the different types of fitness modalities and fitness
              habits.</p>
              <p><em>New IPPT format</em><br> <strong><br> What is the impetus for the new IPPT format?</strong><br> <br> Physical fitness of our servicemen is tested using the IPPT
              protocol. Prior to 2009, combat fitness was assessed using our
              Standard Obstacle Course and route marches. Since then, the Army
              has strengthened combat fitness training with the introduction of
              Vocation-Related Exercises and Vocation Obstacle Courses to meet
              our new operational demands. With this in place, it is now timely
              to review our physical fitness test protocol and standards.<br> <br> <strong>Will the Home Team be implementing the new IPPT
              format?</strong><br> <br> Yes, the Home Team will be adopting the same IPPT format as the
              SAF. The Home Team has assessed that the new IPPT format would meet
              their needs for assessing the physical fitness of Home Team
              NSmen/NSFs.<br> <br> <strong>When will the trial for the new IPPT format be
              held?</strong><br> <br> The trial will be conducted by the Army Fitness Centre from Sep -
              Nov 2014. It will involve at least 3,000 Active and NS personnel
              across different gender, age groups and vocations. NSmen from
              selected units will participate in the trial during their
              ICT.<br> <br> <strong>Will SAF make any more changes to the new IPPT format and
              scoring system?</strong><br> <br> SAF does not plan to make any more changes to the new IPPT format
              and scoring system. SAF continuously reviews our fitness training
              system to ensure that we maintain our high standards.<br> <br> <strong>Is it easier to pass the IPPT now?</strong><br> <br> Passing and excelling in IPPT will still require dedicated training
              and effort by servicemen. However with the simpler and more
              motivating format and scoring system, servicemen will be more
              motivated to train.<br> <br> <strong>Why is there a need for a new scoring
              system?</strong><br> <br> The intention of the new scoring system is to motivate our
              servicemen to excel in all the test stations. We want to encourage
              everyone to train to their maximum potential.<br> <br> <strong>Why did SAF/HT move towards a 3-year age
              band?</strong><br> <br> We recognise that a 3-year age band will provide a better
              performance-to-age match compared to the current 5-year age
              band.<br> <br> <strong>How well will this new IPPT structure reflect fitness
              levels of our soldiers/HT NSmen/NSFs?</strong><br> <br> The 3 stations provide a good measurement of basic physical fitness
              as it focuses on the three main body parts. When viewed in totality
              with SAF's other combat fitness regimes such as loaded route
              marches, VRE and SOC/VOC, it is reflective of the fitness levels of
              our soldiers.<br> <br> For the Home Team, the new IPPT structure is a good assessment of
              the basic physical fitness of Home Team NSmen/NSFs. In addition,
              Home Team NSmen/NSFs have to undergo certification and proficiency
              tests such as the Police Defence Tactics and Hazmat Rescue
              Certification Test to ensure that they meet the physical demands of
              frontline operations.</p>

                  pre-university institutions, polytechnics and the Institute of Technical
                   Education (ITE) will have to contend with push-ups, instead of 
                  pull-ups, for their National Physical Fitness Award (NAPFA) test from 
                  January 2015.</strong></p>
              <p>The Ministry of Education said on Thursday (Nov 6, 2014) 
                  that this change will facilitate the use of the NAPFA test results for 
                  pre-enlistment purpose, in line with the modifications in the Individual
                   Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) announced earlier by the Ministry of 
                  Defence.</p>

              <p>Currently,
                   the NAPFA test consists of six items: Sit-up; pull-up for males and 
                  inclined pull-up for females; sit-and-reach; standing broad jump; 
                  shuttle run; and 2.4km run/walk. There will be no change to the test 
                  items for all students at the primary and secondary levels, and for 
                  female students in pre-university institutions, polytechnics and ITE, 
                  MOE stated.</p>
              <p>"Inclined pull-up and pull-up will continue to be used for this group to train upper body<br>muscular strength and endurance," the ministry added.</p>
              <p><strong>NEW PE SYLLABUS</strong></p>
              <p>MOE
                   also said its new physical education (PE) syllabus is being introduced 
                  in stages from primary to pre-university level from 2014.</p>
              <p>"The new
                   syllabus aims to equip students with the ability to engage in a wide 
                  range of physical activities and sports. This will lay a strong 
                  foundation for a lifelong pursuit of a physically active and healthy 
                  lifestyle," it stated.</p>
              <p>Physical fitness will continue to be 
                  emphasised through the new Holistic Assessment in PE, which will be 
                  introduced to all schools in 2016 to support the new PE syllabus. It 
                  will help students develop a holistic perspective of fitness and the 
                  enjoyment of exercise and sports. Students will track their fitness 
                  level, participation in sports, games and other physical activities, the
                   Ministry said.</p>
              <p>In addition, students will design their own 
                  programmes to achieve their desired fitness levels for different 
                  purposes, according to MOE.</p>

              <p>NSmen are doing better and are more motivated to ace their annual physical fitness test.<br> <br> Results from the three-month pilot implementation of the new 
              three-station Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) format showed 
              improvements across the board: 88 percent of participants improved or 
              maintained their standards for sit-ups, and 73 percent, for the 2.4km 
              run.<br> <br> For the new push-up station, 74 percent of participants achieved average
               and above average performance, compared to current international 
              standards.<br> <br> The pilot, which ended in December last year, saw some 5,000 servicemen and women taking the new IPPT format.<br> <br> "The results validated our belief that the new IPPT generates greater 
              ownership and motivates our people to do well," said Colonel (COL) Ng 
              Ying Thong, Assistant Chief of the General Staff (Training) at a media 
              brief on 27 Feb.<br> <br> For the 27 percent who did not do better in the 2.4km run, the majority 
              were servicemen or women who had already achieved Gold or Silver, 
              according to COL Ng.<br> <br> COL Ng also updated on other changes to the IPPT system, including 
              tweaks to the performance standards. Soldiers will have new standards to
               meet when the three-station IPPT officially rolls out on 1 Apr.<br> <br> Soldiers must now score 85 points for Gold and 75 points for Silver. 
              This is a four-point increase from the standards announced for the 
              three-month IPPT trial.<br> <br> The Gold mark for elite soldiers - Commandos, Guardsmen and Divers - has also moved up by five points to 90.<br> <br> The scoring tables have also been improved to encourage soldiers to do 
              better by making the allocation of points more consistent with the 
              number of repetitions performed for the sit-up and push-up stations, and
               the 2.4km run times.<br> <br> This move is to enable fitter servicemen to continue to find challenge in meeting the higher IPPT award standards, said COL Ng.<br> <br> "We were very careful when refining these standards; to make sure that 
              we not only encourage our fitter servicemen and elite forces to do well,
               but also not de-motivate the bulk (of our soldiers) from trying to do 
              well," added COL Ng.<br> <br> For example, an average 35-year-old NSman will have to do 39 sit-ups, 39
               push-ups and run 2.4km in 10 minutes 40 seconds to attain the Gold 
              award.<br> <br> Operationally Ready National Servicemen will have a year to transit to 
              the three-station IPPT format. This means that they can choose to do 
              either the older five-station IPPT or the new format up to 31 Mar 2016. 
              Active service personnel will move to the new format on 1 Apr 2015.<br> <br> For 29-year-old NSman, Lieutenant (LTA) (NS) Christopher Ng, the new 
              IPPT standards will push him to train and do better. "The new IPPT 
              system is better and the new standards are more challenging, but I think
               they are do-able," said LTA (NS) Ng.<br> <br> "I can now train for the IPPT even at home, without equipment like 
              pull-up bars," added LTA (NS) Ng, who serves in an Infantry unit. He 
              took part in the IPPT pilot, scoring a Silver award.<br> <br> For full-time National Servicemen such as Corporal (CPL) Napolean s/o 
              Parthiban, the scoring system motivated him to do well for the IPPT.<br> <br> "The more reps (repetitions) you do and faster you run, the more points 
              you get. That makes me work to try to max out in all three stations," 
              said the 23-year-old NSF from 5th Battalion, Singapore Infantry 
              Regiment.<br> <br> A new Preparatory Training Phase (PTP) exemption criteria for NS will 
              also come into effect from 1 Mar. Combat-fit pre-enlistees will have to 
              attain 61 points or more when they take the National Physical Fitness 
              Award or NAPFA test with push-ups, to be exempted from the PTP.</p>

              <p>The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) on Friday (Feb 27, 2015) 
              announced that there will be new performance standards for Gold and 
              Silver awards, and an improved scoring table, for the new three-station 
              IPPT format.</p>
              <p>For performance standards, those in 
              Commando, Guards and Diver units will see a 5-point jump to achieve 
              gold, while for everyone else, there will be a 4-point jump to achieve 
              gold.</p>
              <p>There will also be a four-point jump for those 
              looking to achieve the silver standard from 71 to 75. No changes were 
              made to the standards for the passing mark.</p>
              <p>"These 
              changes will make it a lot more challenging for fitter NSmen, but also 
              to motivate others to continue to do well," said Assistant Chief of 
              General Staff (Training) Colonel Ng Ying Thong during a media 
              briefing, stressing the desire not to "demotivate" others.</p>
              <p><strong>ONE-YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD FOR NSmen</strong></p>
              <p>The
               new three-station IPPT format will be implemented from Apr 1, 2015. 
              However, there will be a one-year transition period for NSmen to choose 
              between the five-station or three-station format, said Col Ng. Active 
              servicemen will adopt the new format.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Armed
               Forces (SAF) conducted a pilot implementation of the new IPPT from 
              September to December 2014, which included about 5,000 servicemen and 
              servicewomen of different vocations and age groups.</p>
              <p>Through the pilot, Col Ng said there is potential to "challenge fitter servicemen to do even better in their IPPT".</p>
              <p>Results
               from the pilot showed that for push ups, 74 per cent achieved average 
              and above average performance when referenced against international 
              standards. MINDEF also clarified that females will perform a 
              modified "bend-knee push ups", which is performed with knees bent and 
              one count involves lowering the upper arm to at least parallel to the 
              ground before the arm is fully extended.</p>
              <p>For sit ups, 88 per cent in the pilot improved or maintained
               their performance from their past recorded result, he said. Similarly, 
              73 per cent improved or maintained their 2.4km timing, Col Ng added. 
              "For the 27 per cent who did not run as fast, the bulk had already 
              achieved either Gold or Silver," he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In
               addition, there will be new Physical Training Phase (PTP) exemption 
              criteria for National Service for combat-fit pre-enlistees from Mar 1. 
              Pre-enlistees will have to achieve 61 points and above - the equivalent 
              of the current silver standard for NAPFA - to be exempted from PTP.</p>

              I tried to new IPPT system and failed. I have not trained for a long time since I was a trainee. I did the push-ups, but my instructor said that none of them is "proper", so I got a 0 for it, which sucks.
              
              Looks like I will aim for 10mins 2.4 km run, 48 sit-ups and 0 push-ups in order to pass.

              Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) will be used to assess 
              pre-enlistment fitness. Pre-enlistees who attain 61 points or more from 
              the three IPPT stations in the 12 months before their enlistment date, 
              and who are medically graded PES A/B1, will be eligible for exemption 
              from the 8-week Physical Training Phase (PTP).<br><br> Pre-enlistees can refer to the <a href="http://www.ns.sg/cs/content/eServices/mindef/Pre-Enlistee_IPPT%28pe-ippt%29/Pre-Enlistees_IPPT-Scoring-Tables.html">IPPT scoring table</a> for the number of points they can attain for performing a specific 
              number of sit-ups and push-ups, and for completing the 2.4km run in a 
              specific timing. The maximum score is 25 points for the sit-up and 
              push-up stations, and 50 points for the 2.4km run. The minimum score for
               each station is 1 point. <br><br><br><strong>2. How did the SAF determine the eligibility criteria for the 2-month fitness incentive? </strong><br><br>61
               points is the pass standard for full-time national servicemen. To be 
              exempted from PTP, we expect our combat fit (i.e. PES A/B1) 
              pre-enlistees to possess this fitness standard.<br><br><br><strong>3. Will schools be conducting the three-station Pre-Enlistee IPPT?</strong><br><br> To better prepare pre-enlistees for NS, starting from 2015, MOE has 
              replaced the NAPFA pull-ups station with the push-ups station for 
              students in the following educational institutions who are enlisting 
              into NS:

Will NAPFA results continue to be accepted?</strong><br><br>The six-station NAPFA results will continue to be accepted if you had taken the NAPFA earlier in your school.<br><br><br> <strong>5. Why is there a difference between the NAPFA test and Pre-Enlistee IPPT?</strong><br><br>MOE
               requires the six-station NAPFA test to provide a comprehensive 
              indicator of students' health and performance-related fitness.<br> <br>Pre-enlistees who can meet the IPPT Pass standard in the new 
              three-station IPPT format are sufficiently physically fit to be exempted
               from PTP and enter directly into Basic Military Training (BMT). The SAF
               has in place a comprehensive combat fitness regime, which includes the 
              IPPT, route marches and field exercises, as well as the Standard 
              Obstacle Course, the Vocational Obstacle Course and Vocation-Related 
              Exercises.<br><br><br> <strong>6. Are there other avenues for pre-enlistees to undergo pre-enlistment fitness testing?</strong><br><br> You can take the three-station Pre-Enlistee IPPT on every 
              Wednesday (except public holidays) at Toa Payoh Stadium at 7.30a.m. You 
              are required to make a booking online at the NS Portal as follows:

              <li>Select "Submit"</li>
              </ul>
              You will need to book a slot via the NS Portal latest by 
              Tuesday before noon in order to take the test at Toa Payoh Stadium the 
              next day. You will not be allowed to take the Pre-Enlistee IPPT at Toa 
              Payoh Stadium if you do not book an appointment first.  <br><br> Should there be any changes to the test conducted at Toa Payoh
               Stadium due to unforeseen events, an announcement will be made on the 
              NS Portal.<br><br> The pre-enlistment fitness test results are valid for one year.<br><br><br> <strong>7.	Can I amend my booking after I have booked?</strong><br><br> Yes, you are allowed to amend your booking before 12 pm on the day before the test date.<br><br><br> <strong>8. Can I make a few bookings together?</strong><br><br> No, you are only allowed to make 1 booking at any one time. 
              You can make your next booking after the test date you have booked.<br><br><br> <strong>9.	Do I need to take the Pre-Enlistee IPPT?</strong><br><br> Yes, we would encourage you to attempt the Pre-Enlistee IPPT <strong>if you are medically graded PES A or B1</strong>. <br><br><br> <strong>10. Am I required to take the Pre-Enlistee IPPT if I'm graded PES B2, C or E?</strong><br><br> No. You are not required to take the Pre-Enlistee IPPT if you are graded PES B2, C or E.<br><br><br> <strong>11. When should I take the Pre-Enlistee IPPT?</strong><br><br> You may wish to take the Pre-Enlistee IPPT after your 
              pre-enlistment medical screening and at least 14 days before your 
              enlistment date. However, we advise that you train before you attempt 
              the test to prevent injuries. <br><br><br> <strong>12. Can I take the test after I failed the NAPFA test/Pre-Enlistee IPPT the last time?</strong><br><br> Yes. You are allowed to retake it until you attain 61 points 
              or better. There is no limit to the number of times you can take the 
              test.<br><br><br> <strong>13. Can I retake only the test stations I have failed in my last attempt?</strong><br><br> No. All the test stations must be completed in one single session.<br><br> </span></td>

              <p><strong>Pre-National Service (NS) students in pre-university
              institutions, polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education
              (ITE) will have to contend with push-ups, instead of pull-ups, for
              their National Physical Fitness Award (NAPFA) test from January
              2015.</strong></p>
              <p>The Ministry of Education said on Thursday (Nov 6, 2014) that
              this change will facilitate the use of the NAPFA test results for
              pre-enlistment purpose, in line with the modifications in the
              Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) announced earlier by
              the Ministry of Defence.</p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/blob/1456708/1415253988000/napfa-test-table-data.jpg"><img src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/blob/1456708/1415253988000/napfa-test-table-data.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="134"></a></p>
              <p>Currently, the NAPFA test consists of six items: Sit-up; pull-up
              for males and inclined pull-up for females; sit-and-reach; standing
              broad jump; shuttle run; and 2.4km run/walk. There will be no
              change to the test items for all students at the primary and
              secondary levels, and for female students in pre-university
              institutions, polytechnics and ITE, MOE stated.</p>
              <p>"Inclined pull-up and pull-up will continue to be used for this
              group to train upper body<br> muscular strength and endurance," the ministry added.</p>
              <p><strong>NEW PE SYLLABUS</strong></p>
              <p>MOE also said its new physical education (PE) syllabus is being
              introduced in stages from primary to pre-university level from
              2014.</p>
              <p>"The new syllabus aims to equip students with the ability to
              engage in a wide range of physical activities and sports. This will
              lay a strong foundation for a lifelong pursuit of a physically
              active and healthy lifestyle," it stated.</p>
              <p>Physical fitness will continue to be emphasised through the new
              Holistic Assessment in PE, which will be introduced to all schools
              in 2016 to support the new PE syllabus. It will help students
              develop a holistic perspective of fitness and the enjoyment of
              exercise and sports. Students will track their fitness level,
              participation in sports, games and other physical activities, the
              Ministry said.</p>
              <p>In addition, students will design their own programmes to
              achieve their desired fitness levels for different purposes,
              according to MOE.</p>

                  will be eligible for exemption from the  8-week Physical Training Phase 
                  (PTP). Those who fail to attain the required fitness level will have to 
                  undergo the PTP before attending the 9-week BMT.<br><br> In the modified NAPFA test implemented since Jan 2015, MOE has
                   replaced the pull-ups station with the push-ups station. The modified 
                  NAPFA test now comprises the three IPPT stations of Push-Ups, Sit-Ups 
                  and 2.4km run. The results of the three IPPT stations will be 
                  transmitted to CMPB. The six-station NAPFA results with pull-ups will 
                  also continue to be accepted for those who had taken the older NAPFA 
                  test earlier in their schools.<br><br> Pre-enlistees can refer to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><a href="http://www.ns.sg/cs/content/eServices/mindef/Pre-Enlistee_IPPT%28pe-ippt%29/Pre-Enlistees_IPPT-Scoring-Tables.html">IPPT scoring table</a></strong></em></span> for the number of points they can attain for performing a specific 
                  number of sit-ups and push-ups, and for completing the 2.4km run in a 
                  specific timing. The maximum score is 25 points for the sit-up and 
                  push-up stations, and 50 points for the 2.4km run. The minimum score for
                   each station is 1 point. <br><br> The three-station Pre-Enlistee IPPT is conducted at the Toa Payoh Stadium (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><a class="PartextimageText" href="http://www.ns.sg/cs/content/eServices/mindef/Pre-Enlistee_IPPT%28pe-ippt%29/map_to_toa_payoh_stadium.html">map to Toa Payoh Stadium</a></em></span>) every Wednesday (except public holidays).<br><br> You are required to book an appointment for the test via the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><a class="PartextimageText" href="http://www.ns.sg/nsp/web/esvcs/mindef/pe-ippt/main">Pre-Enlistee IPPT booking system</a></strong></em></span> prior to the test date and you are only allowed to make one booking at any one time.<br><br> Please note that the Pre-Enlistee IPPT  results are valid for one year from the date of test.
