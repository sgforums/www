              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Military Justice System in the
              SAF</span></span></strong><br> <br> 1. Overview<br> The military justice system in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is
              expected to treat every service personnel fairly and equally,
              regardless of race, rank or vocation.</p>
              <p> <br> 2. Multi-levelled Approach</p>
              <p>The military justice system is based on the SAF Act, which was
              implemented in 1972. All servicemen are subjected to the SAF Act,
              SAF Regulations, and orders of whatever form issued pursuant to
              them.</p>
              <p>While discipline is paramount in the military, not all offences
              committed by SAF servicemen are dealt with by formal investigations
              and charges. Essentially, offenders can be dealt with either by way
              of informal or formal punishment systems.</p>
              <p> <br> 3. Informal Punishment System<br> Commanders are empowered to mete out informal punishments like
              push-ups and weekend confinement to servicemen who have committed
              disciplinary breaches, like being late, sluggish, or improperly
              dressed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Formal Punishment System<br> If the offence that a serviceman committed is of a more serious
              nature, he may be formally dealt with by his disciplinary officer
              by way of a summary trial, or brought before a subordinate military
              court (more commonly known as the General Court Martial or
              GCM).</p>
              <p>(a) Summary Trial</p>
              <p>The offences that can be dealt with by summary trial are
              essentially military offences, such as absence without leave
              (AWOL), non-compliance with lawful orders or insubordination.</p>
              <p>Depending on the rank of the serviceman in question, and the
              type of the disciplinary body hearing the case, the possible
              sentences that may be imposed can vary, and these can include fines
              or detention.</p>
              <p>The summary trial is carried out in accordance with relevant SAF
              regulations, and the records of the summary trial are sent to the
              office of the Director, Legal Services of the SAF.</p>
              <p>(b) General Court Martial</p>
              <p>The General Court Martial exists as a separate forum from that
              of the summary trial. Unlike the summary trial, the GCM can deal
              with a wider range of offences, and can impose a wider range of
              punishments including imprisonment and discharge, on top of
              sentences like detention and fines. The GCM is also a more public
              and open forum, and its proceedings are conducted using similar
              legal rules and procedures as those used in a civil criminal
              court.</p>
              <p>Generally, only serious offences investigated by the Military
              Police Command, and which are referred to the office of the
              Director of Legal Services, will result in the accused serviceman
              being charged in a GCM. In such a case, a military prosecutor will
              draw up a formal charge sheet and present it before the GCM.</p>
              <p>General Courts Martial can be further sub-divided into two
              categories, namely the Panel Courts Martial - consisting of a
              President and usually two other members, and Judge Courts Martial -
              consisting of a single President only.</p>
              <p>Currently, the practice is for military offences to be heard by
              Panel Courts Martial, while civil offences like misuse of drugs and
              penal code offences may be dealt with by a Judge Court Martial.</p>
              <p><br> The current policy is also for an NSman, who is or was a District
              Judge in the Subordinate Courts, to preside in a GCM. There are
              currently 10 NSmen who have been appointed by the Armed Forces
              Council to perform duty as President of a court martial. They are
              rostered by the Registrar of the Subordinate Military Court to hear
              cases during their in-camp training. In the case of a Panel Court
              Martial, the other two members are rostered from among some 155
              military officers appointed by the Chief of Defence Force.</p>
              <p> <br> 5. Ways to Seek Redress</p>
              <p>There are numerous safeguards and avenues set out in the
              military justice system for an SAF serviceman to seek redress if he
              is unhappy about the punishment imposed on him.</p>
              <p>Generally, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with an informal
              punishment meted out to him may request a higher level commander to
              review the punishment, or request for formal disciplinary
              dealing.</p>
              <p>In the case of a summary trial, a serviceman brought before the
              disciplinary officer may elect instead to be tried by a court
              martial. Alternatively, an aggrieved serviceman may request that
              his conviction or punishment imposed at the summary trial be
              reviewed by MINDEF's Director Manpower (a delegated authority of
              the Armed Forces Council).</p>
              <p>In the case of a GCM, a serviceman may choose to be represented
              by a lawyer or an SAF defending officer if his case will be heard
              by a court martial. The SAF has about 200 trained defending
              officers. While an SAF defending officer comes free to the
              serviceman, he has to bear the cost of engaging a lawyer. At the
              end of the trial, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with the
              decision of the court martial may petition the Reviewing Authority
              (the AFC or a committee of its members) for a review of his case.
              The serviceman can also appeal to the Military Court of Appeal
              (MCA) for a reconsideration of his conviction, or his sentence, or
              both.</p>
              <p>The MCA, when convened to hear an appeal, sits as a panel of
              five members. Heading the MCA is a President, who is appointed by
              the Chief Justice. By law, he must be a person qualified to be a
              Judge of the Supreme Court. The current President of the MCA is
              Justice Choo Han Teck. Four other members - two civilian members
              who are qualified legal practitioners with at least five years
              experience each, and two senior military officers - make up the
              rest of the MCA. The MCA is the highest court in the military
              justice system.</p>
              <p> <br> 6. Impartial Hearings<br> It is important to recognise that the GCM and the MCA are tribunals
              headed by presidents who are outside the SAF chain of command.</p>
              <p>Being an "outsider", the president of these forums will hear the
              case impartially like any other civil criminal case. The
              proceedings in the GCM and the MCA are also heard in a public
              forum, and these military courts adopt many of the same legal
              procedures and safeguards as that used in the civil criminal
              courts. All servicemen formally charged with an offence can bring
              their case to these forums.</p>

              <p><strong>Singapore Armed Forces Military Police
              Command</strong><br> (SAFMPC/ æ–°åŠ å�¡æ­¦è£…éƒ¨é˜Ÿå®ªå…µå�¸ä»¤éƒ¨)</p>
              <p>The formation is headed by the Command Headquarters which
              oversees its daily operations, and supported by four units
              specialising in the various specific operational responsibilities
              of the SAF MPC.</p>
              <p>The four units are:</p>
              <p><strong>Military Police Enforcement Unit (MPEU):</strong> The
              unit consists of the Law Enforcement and Ceremonial Company (LECC),
              the Security Operation Unit (SOU) and the Special Security and
              Protection (SSP) Branch. It is the active wing of the SAF MPC and
              executes most of the operational and ceremonial duties and roles
              carried out by the SAF MPC.</p>
              <p>The LECC was formed by combining the former Active Provost
              Company (APC) and the former Zone Provost Company (ZPC). Its duties
              include most of the important ceremonial duties required within the
              SAF as previously handled by the APC, and a traffic platoon which
              ensures the compliance of traffic regulations by military personnel
              on the road as well as performing escort duties. It also performs
              regular raids for contraband and/or miscreants on various camps of
              the SAF as was conducted by the ZPC. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Enforcement
              Platoon (also known as Platoon 2) performs regular operations in
              residential areas, workplaces, and many public places such as
              shopping centres, clubs and eating outlets to apprehend <a title="Deserter" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deserter">deserters</a>, <a title="AWOL" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWOL">AWOL</a> offenders, drug addicts and other military criminals.</span> They
              work closely with the Singapore Police Force and are often in very
              dangerous situations and are extremely well trained for handling
              the varied scenarios that they find themselves in. This is also the
              platoon that enforces the public image of the SAF by booking
              offenders who smoke in uniform and commit other offences in uniform
              while in the eye of the public.</em></span> It is worth noting that
              they perform undercover security operations for high-key events
              like the National Day Parade and the Youth Olympic Games. The
              security of Mowbray Station is overseen by a platoon who is also in
              charge of registering and detaining suspects and offenders of
              military crimes in holding cells. The station is similar to a
              civilian police station and it is usually the first stop for
              detainees before their transfer to the detention barracks after
              conviction in military courts, or a temporary holding cell for
              servicemen placed under Closed Arrest. The investigative branch for
              the SAF, the Special Investigation Branch (SIB) investigates
              higher-order military crimes that requires specialised handling.
              Since 31 December 8, MPEU has heralded the inclusion of a new
              branch within its ranks. The Security Support and Protection (SSP)
              Branch is involved in sensitive operations so no further
              information is available.</p>
              <p><strong>SAF Detention Barracks (SAFDB):</strong> Headed by a
              commandant, DB consists of MPs in charge of supervision of
              detainees of the SAF who have been convicted in military
              courts.</p>
              <p><strong>Military Police Training School (MPTS):</strong> Formerly known as the School of Provost, MPTS is in charge of
              equipping trainees with necessary and fundamental military policing
              skills as well as instilling in them a high standard of discipline
              through the vocational courses and specialised courses such as the
              Silent Precision Drill Courses. MPTS also legislation courses for
              senior commanders all over the SAF. In addition, the SAF Military
              Working Dog Unit is a wing under MPTS and it is in charge of all
              dog training and doctrine matters of the SAF.</p>
              <p><strong>SAF MP Command Head Quarters (HQ):</strong> The Head
              Quarters of the Command comprises various branches, namely the
              Human Resource (HR), Intelligences and Security Branch (ISB),
              General Staff Branch (GS), the Special Investigation Branch (SIB)
              and Logistic Branch. Each branch is headed by a branch head who
              serves concurrently as the Command's Manpower, Intelligence, Ops
              and Training and Logistics Officer.</p>

              <p>DB is not the same as the prison as u know from the norm....it
              is military "jail" or preferably detention ...under the military

              <p>its much tougher, and strictly exempt from visits ...and tougher

              <p>DB means he has already been sentenced to detention (military prison).</p>
              <p>Bail is for civil cases (non military), where the person is charged and waiting for trial in court...</p>
              <p>Since he is already sentenced, its not possible to bail, he is serving prison time now.</p>
              <p>How long he will be inside is dependent on the sentence by the officer. There are laws to what crime/max sentence.</p>
              <p>Without knowing the case, nobody can advice you how long..... The SAF laws are just  like your normal civil court with full powers, can have maximum sentences of life imprisonment or even death (of course nobody in Singapore been sentenced to that in army before).</p>
