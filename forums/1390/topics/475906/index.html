              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">Hi guys!</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">I am a PES E Pre-enlistee and there's a few things which worries me.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">I was diagnosed with Panic disorder and Social phobia a few months ago when I went for further psychiatrist review for NS checkup.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">My problem is that I would become nausea and have the urge to vomit when I feel anxious.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">This problem started when I was in polytechnic and has affected me that I couldnt even present when I was in school. I get anxious about the nausea feeling or me puking even when taking <span style="line-height: 1.231;">the public transport. (</span>I know this sounds ridiculous but even taking the public transport is a difficulty for me.) <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Hence I wouldn't eat in school or outside to prevent me from vomitting if I does become nausea.</span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">However, now that I am about to get enlisted into the army, things are different now and there are things which I am worried about.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">My questions may sound a bit childish/ridiculous but:</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">1) What should if I can't finish my food during BMT? Throw it away?</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">2) Will I get into trouble or punished if i failed to finish eating the food?</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">3) What should I do if i am having anxiety attacks?  (My nausea feeling usually stays about 1 ~ 2 minutes.) </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">Thanks!</p>

              <p>Don't worry. Just tell cookhouse aunties and uncles to scoop less/ don't put on tray.</p>

              <p>Just private talk to superior, or just report sick at medical centre. <br>For you, the camp doctor is always your best friend to talk to/ seek help/ counselling.</p>

              BMT</span></strong><br> This 9-week programme trains combat-fit recruits in the basic
              military skills to prepare them for advanced vocational training.
              The programme includes weapon training with the SAR 21 rifle which
              will teach recruits technical handling and marksmanship skills; a
              Battle Inoculation Course that simulates a real battlefield; a
              Field Camp which develops basic survival skills; progressive
              training to complete a 24-km route march which builds combat
              fitness and endurance; and hand grenade training.<br> <em><span style="font: inherit;">For those who fail to achieve the
              NAPFA test silver award, they are required to undergo an 8-week
              Physical Training Phase (PTP) prior to the PES A/B1

              BMT</span></strong><br> As evidence has shown that obese recruits are able to achieve
              optimum fitness levels and weight loss in about 19 weeks, the new
              BMT programme for recruits with Body Mass Index (BMI) scores
              exceeding 27.0 will be 19 weeks. This BMT programme is designed to
              help obese recruits improve their physical fitness progressively
              while equipping them with basic soldiering skills and
              knowledge.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES B2
              BMT</span></strong><br> Enlistees who were PES C1 previously underwent a 7-week BMT
              programme. The new 9-week PES B2 BMT programme will be conducted
              for recruits who are medically fit for deployment in selected
              combat and combat support vocations, such as signal operators,
              combat medics and naval system operators. These recruits will be
              given a new medical classification of PES B2, in place of the
              existing PES C1 classification. This is to ensure that the medical
              classification of our soldiers is consistent with their deployment.
              The new 9-week programme will include customised physical training,
              as well as basic combat training to prepare them for their combat
              and combat support roles.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES C
              BMT</span></strong><br> The 9-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES C recruits. This
              programme will include light physical training and vocational
              training to prepare them for combat service support vocations, such
              as service medic, and those related to logistics and
              administration.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES E
              BMT</span></strong><br> The 4-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES E recruits. This
              programme will focus on, vocational training as well as National
              Education, SAF core values, regimentation and discipline to prepare
              recruits for combat service support vocations.</p>

              <p><em><strong>Being psychologically prepared is all about knowing
              what to expect and being prepared for it.</strong></em></p>
              <p>To be better prepared, you can participate in Total Defence
              activities and Open Houses organised by the SAF/SPF/SCDF.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you should also talk to your family members and friends
              who have lived the NS experience. The more you discuss with others,
              the more comfortable and mentally prepared you’ll become.</p>
              <p><strong>Because NS life is different from civilian life before
              enlistment, there are many adjustments you need to
              make.</strong></p>
              <p>A good way to cope is to get support from your buddy and fellow
              recruits. They are going through the same tough training as you, so
              talking to one another will help relieve some tension.</p>
              <p>In most evenings during your leisure time, you’ll also have some
              time to call your family or loved ones to talk. They can give you
              emotional support during NS.</p>
              <p>You can have a one-on-one interview sessions with your officer
              to highlight any problems you may have. If you have a personal or
              family problem that need to be addressed, do let the officer
              know—he may be able to give you some advice or time off to settle
              your problems.</p>
              <p>Life in NS revolves around structure, routine and discipline.
              This helps us stay united as a uniformed organisation as well as
              imparts the rigours necessary to protect our nation and
              citizens.</p>
              <p>This does not mean there is just work and no play. In fact,
              after a few weeks in NS and you’ll find new friends and new reasons
              to smile!</p>
              <p><strong>As a soldier, one of the biggest adjustments you’ll have
              to make quickly is in regimentation and discipline.</strong></p>
              <p>Being in a uniformed organisation, you’ll have to obey orders
              from your superiors. Thus some of you may feel a sudden lack of
              freedom to do what you want and you may find yourself having
              difficulties accepting authority initially.</p>
              <p>Regimentation and discipline build strong character and
              toughness, so that you’ll be tough enough to handle difficult
              combat, crime-fighting or rescue situations without giving up or
              breaking down.</p>
              <p>When you first enlist into NS, you may have concerns of being in
              a new territory, with new faces and new things to do. But don’t let
              this get to you. Just remember the saying that “when the going gets
              tough, the tough gets going”.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Following are some
              tips on what you can do to prepare yourself
              psychologically:</em></span></p>
              <ul>

              <p>You can also speak to your friends or family members who have
              been through NS. Ask them to share their stories. The sharing will
              help you reduce some of your fears, uncertainties and doubts.</p>
              <p><strong>During NS you’ll be living with different
              people.</strong></p>
              <p>Because these people come from different backgrounds, they may
              not think like you do or react to situations like you would.
              Instead of trying to select your type of people, you should cherish
              the diversity. This is a chance for you to learn more about your
              fellow mates and their cultures.</p>
              <p>You’ll find that you have many opportunities to absorb the
              different cultures—during training, eating, chatting or just seeing
              and listening. Take these opportunities and learn from people
              around you, you’ll have a much better appreciation of Singapore’s
              cultural diversity.</p>

              patients may have tried to take their own lives or showed signs of
              wanting to do so. Ms Lim also helps families cope when they have

              <p>The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) is a 2,000-bed acute
              tertiary psychiatric hospital situated on a 25-hectare
              campus at Buangkok Green Medical Park. Set amidst serene
              surroundings, IMH offers a comprehensive range of psychiatric,
              rehabilitative and counselling services for children, adolescents,
              adults, and the elderly.</p>
              <p>IMH’s tradition of care started in 1928. We were the first
              mental hospital in Singapore, starting with some 1,000 patients.
              Since then, many advances have been made in treatment, training,
              and research. Our treatment integrates evidence-based therapies,
              supported by the departments of clinical psychology, nursing,
              occupational therapy, and medical social work, to provide holistic
              care for our patients. IMH is equipped with modern facilities, with
              50 wards for inpatients and seven Specialist Outpatient
              Clinics.</p>
              <p>IMH was the first mental health institution in Asia to receive
              the Joint Commission International Accreditation in 2005, a highly
              coveted international accreditation for healthcare
              organisations. </p>
              <p>Over the years, IMH has gained a reputation for quality
              research. In 2008, the Ministry of Health,
              Singapore, entrusted IMH with a S$25 million research
              grant to implement translational and clinical research into the
