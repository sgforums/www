If I'm not wrong, the average age of the PS in a US army platoon is about 28 or 29. Contrast this to the SAF - we can have pimply-faced 19 year olds as platoon sergeants.<br><br>Heck, in many cases the men end up being older than the PS. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>There's nothing much we can do about this. We're a conscript army, and we don't have the sufficient manpower to allow the situation where the PS is a highly-experienced soldier in his late twenties who has seen it all. I guess the only thing we can do is to firm up the standards for the PS selection process and make sure that not any green soldier can become a PS.<br><br>Inevitably there will be some black sheep, and I've come across total jerks who think that the stripes on their sleeves entitle them to respect and fear from the masses. Nothing we can do about getting rid of jerks in the Army, but at least we can try to prevent some of them from getting stripes on their sleeves.</div>
