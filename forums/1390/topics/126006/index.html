            <div class='col-md body'>Relax. Loosen up while aiming. Relax. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Some general info.<br><br>1. Stance<br>Your stance must be steady and comfortable so that you do not become fatigued too easily. There are several popular styles including isosceles and Weaver, but any stable, comfortable position will do. You should use both hands. In the Weaver stance, you can use your weak hand to pull back while pushing forward with your strong hand. This is called isometric tension and greatly aids in rapid shooting, shooting a heavy-recoiling handgun, and proper stability. But since you're using a .22lr no need to worry bout this much.<br><br>2. Grip<br>With your fingers and thumb making an "L", place your strong hand as high up on the grip as is comfortably possible. The apex of the web of your hand should be centered at the rearmost point of the curve in the gun's backstrap. This makes sure you are not gripping the gun too far, or not far enough, around the grip. The forefinger should rest naturally along the side of the frame above the trigger and the other three fingers should wrap easily around the frontstrap of the grip. The strong-hand thumb may either be in a "high" or "low" position. Caution must be used in both of these positions. Too low a position may actuate the magazine release, dumping your mag unintentionally. Too high a position may induce stoppages by unintentionally dragging your thumb on the slide as it cycles.<br><br>Your weak hand, in the Weaver position, should wrap naturally around your strong hand with all of the fingers below the trigger guard. Your weak hand thumb should lay over the top of your strong hand thumb to form a cross ("+").<br><br>Both elbows should be slightly bent, but both wrists must be locked. The strong hand should be pushing forward slightly, and the weak hand should be pulling back slightly.<br><br>3. Sight alignment<br>Sights on most auto pistols consist of a square front post or ramp and a rear "U" notch. Simply centering the front post in the rear U with an even amount of light on both sides of the front post inside the rear notch and with their tops level, will give you all the accuracy you need out to 100 yds/109m or so. At closer ranges (25 yards/27 meters and less), perfect sight alignment is not necessary. If the front sight is on target and the rear sight is within close alignment, you will hit very close to the front sight's position. Do not make the common mistake of watching the target. The focus of your eyes should be entirely on the front sight. You will get a chance to look at your target later.<br><br>When shooting the target, if other conditions are within your acceptable limits, imperfect sight alignment should not stop you from taking a shot. When we get to trigger control, you will see that the moment, when the trigger "breaks" and the weapon fires, should be a surprise to you. If everyone was expected to hold a pistol in absolutely perfect sight alignment throughout the entire trigger squeeze in order to hit the target, no one would ever pull the trigger. So, know what the sights are supposed to look like when in proper alignment, and strive to keep them lined up as close as possible to that "perfect" sight picture, but, more importantly, watch the front sight and keep it on the target you want to hit.<br><br>4. Breath Control<br>Breathing control is much less important in pistol shooting than in rifle, however, it is still important enough to cause a miss, especially at long range (25 meters or more). Proper breath control is often difficult to accomplish when shooting pistol, because there is a greater demand for oxygen by our bodies. Usually we are standing up and holding a pistol up at almost the end of arm's reach, and sometimes we've been running/moving, etc., etc. All these activities demand more oxygen, so we breathe heavier. Proper breath control is to take several (usually 3) deep breaths and then take in a fourth and hold it or slightly let it out while squeezing the trigger. This is usually not possible when shooting a pistol. Due to the movement of the shooter's arms and body, a perfect sight picture that would be disturbed by improper breath control is impossible anyway. Therefore, the best method in pistol shooting is to keep breathing, but to control the breaths so that chest movements do not aggravate the amount of movement already created by the arms. I advocate taking deep controlled breaths while moving, drawing, getting behind cover, etc., and then going to "baby breaths" while actually aiming and squeezing the trigger.<br><br>There's virtually no kick from a .22 so no need to worry much about that. So there's no need to grip it very tightly. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Is it a shooting test or something?<br></div>
