              <p>A young man who evaded national service (NS) for more than six years 
              to study in Australia was sentenced to 1.5 months’ jail on Thursday (Feb
               11), after the prosecution appealed against his initial sentence of a 
              S$4,500 fine.</p>
              <p>Brian Joseph Chow, 25, who has attention deficit 
              disorder, left Singapore to study in a school that catered to his 
              condition in 2005 at the age of 15.</p>
              <p>Three years later, he was 
              called up for NS. Chow was offered a deferment to pursue his foundation 
              studies. But in 2009, he applied unsuccessfully to defer NS for 
              university.</p>
              <p>After graduating from the University of Western 
              Australia in 2013, Chow returned to Singapore and completed his NS last 
              year. He is currently undergoing a cadet pilot programme at ST Aerospace
               Academy.</p>
              <p>Delivering his oral judgment on Thursday, Justice Chan 
              Seng Oon allowed the prosecution’s appeal and said he would have given 
              Chow three months' jail "if not for the fact that his performance during
               NS was outstanding".</p>
              <p>However, he rejected the defence’s request to defer sentencing, saying that enough time had been given.</p>
              <p>In
               the appeal hearing last October, Second Solicitor-General Kwek Mean 
              Luck argued for the High Court to set a sentencing benchmark of four 
              months’ jail for young men who were able to serve NS but had dodged 
              conscription for more than two years. </p>

              <p>A New Zealand teenager born in Singapore has been threatened with 
              jail time and hefty fines unless he returns to the Asian nation to 
              complete two years of national service in the army.</p>
              <p>Brandon 
              Smith,19, moved to Dunedin with his family when he was eight years old 
              and holds dual citizenship with New Zealand and Singapore.</p>
              <p>But 
              Singaporean authorities are demanding he report for a pre-service 
              medical or face two years in jail, or a S$10,000 (NZ$10,780) fine. </p>

              <p>Brandon said spending two years doing national service would be difficult and pointless. </p>
              <p>"I don't see the point of it, really. It's sort of a waste of time to go there and just come back anyway," he said. </p>
              <p>Brandon said he does not speak Chinese, and as a New Zealand citizen he would be treated as an outsider. </p>
              <p>After
               an initial three-month training period in which service personnel are 
              housed and fed, they are then expected to find their own accommodation. </p>
              <p>Although
               they receive a small monthly payment, it would not be enough to cover 
              rent and food, and he would not want to impose on family, he said. </p>
              <p>Under Singaporean law, Brandon cannot relinquish his citizenship until he is 21 years old.</p>
              <p>An
               application to defer his national service until the age of 21 has been 
              declined on numerous occasions, despite the Singaporean authorities 
              granting his younger brother Kristen a deferment. </p>

              <p>His father, Shane Smith, said after a long battle with bureaucrats in Singapore they have run out of options.</p>
              <p>"Obviously
               for Brandon, it's not what we want. If he doesn't go back to Singapore 
              to serve his NS, then he can never enter Singapore because he runs the 
              risk of being arrested," said Shane.</p>
              <p>Shane, a New Zealand-born 
              Kiwi, served in the New Zealand Air Force and married Brandon's mother 
              Cindy , who was born in Singapore but is a permanent resident in New 
              Zealand. </p>
              <p>Shane has been corresponding with Singaporean MPs and 
              bureaucrats for years in a desperate bid to help his son avoid 
              conscription. </p>
              <p>"Absolutely no one would accommodate us. It was 
              always the same answer; 'we regret to inform you that Brandon has to 
              serve National Service'," he said.</p>
              <p>Dunedin South MP Clare Curran 
              said in September last year she appealed to Minister for Foreign Affairs
               Murray McCully in a letter to help the family. </p>
              <p>"We have a 
              19-year-old who has left school with his life in front of him, he 
              considers himself a New Zealand citizen and has no identification with 
              Singapore and yet he is expected to do a national service," she said.</p>
              <p>"I think it's a really good case for New Zealand to be sticking up for its citizens."</p>
              <p>In
               a statement released on Saturday, McCully apologised for the late 
              response to Curran's letter and said he had received it shortly before 
              he took time off work to have major surgery to remove a tumour.</p>
              <p>He said that he intended to take the matter up.</p>
              <p>"While
               the Singapore Government is responsible for determining their own 
              citizenship policies, I have considerable sympathy for the situation 
              this family has found themselves in," he said.</p>

              <p>Teenager Brandon Smith, who holds dual 
              citizenship with New Zealand and Singapore, has to fulfil his National 
              Service (NS) obligations, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said on 
              Wednesday (Mar 2).</p>
              <p>"Singapore adheres to the fundamental 
              principles of universality and equity for NS. All Singaporeans are 
              expected to fulfil our NS obligations as citizens. It would not be fair 
              to allow citizens to avoid NS just because they reside overseas," said 
              the MFA in a written reply to MP David Ong's parliamentary question.   </p>
              <p>"Even
               if he were to subsequently apply for renunciation of his citizenship 
              after he attains the age of majority, he would still remain liable for 
              any breaches of the Enlistment Act. He is advised to return to Singapore
               as soon as possible to resolve the matter."</p>
              <p>Mr Smith, 19, faces a two-year jail term and a $10,000 fine if he does not comply.</p>
              <p>The
               MFA said it also informed the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
              and Trade of the point of contact from Singapore's Ministry of Defence, 
              after its New Zealand counterpart made a request. </p>
              <p>A report by 
              Stuff.co.nz said Mr Smith moved to Dunedin with his family when he was 
              eight years old. He reportedly said he does not see the point of 
              returning to fulfil his NS obligations and, as he does not speak 
              Chinese, would be treated as an outsider. He has a New Zealand-born 
              father and Singapore-born mother, the report noted. </p>
