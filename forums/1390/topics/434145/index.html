              <p>Don't worry, kana charge is a standard procedure..there is a service lapse in the system.</p>
              <p>just ask the Investigation officer this question: "I was 
              medically excused in NSF all the way" &gt;&gt; See how the investigation
               officer (IO) reply, you will be in for a real understanding of how they really work.</p>
              <p>anything
               you talk to the IO, you will understand how they really view 
              responsibility..the way lawyer works..as it is our individual 
              responsibility to report our health status, not theirs, the way professionals play with their words..</p>
              <p>just show proof that you are medically excused from IPPT fo NSF Life 
              (black &amp; white) and admit your mistakes than you will be let off with a verbal warning..</p>
              <p>Do
               Not Argue with Them; they are just doing their job (as they are 
              protected by the documents you signed before you ORD), else be at risk 
              of taken away immediately by military poilice on duty.</p>
              <p>after 
              which, when you walk out of the of the place you were told to report to,
               than make a medical appointment review with your unit MO, and bring the
               black &amp; white documents to the MO, than there is high chance you 
              will get to fill up a piece of paper for down-pes application, and wait 
              for the good news.</p>
              <p>what you need to do now is to find all the 
              evidence to support your health injury status claim so the IO can't do 
              anything but to but to let you off.</p>

              <p>thanks fallen for the reply i think tmr i will try to explain my
              situation to the io.. today i just went took memo from my camp
              mo... hope the io will understand i really is want to settle it
              just that i got no choice but to wait see the specialist first
              before i could come up with the letter for downgrading... but my
              supporting document donno can or not i got a camp memo and a
              polyclinic doctor memo.. but if they check my record i never did
              ippt in my nsf life before i was always on excuse even my bmt till

              <p>no use talking to IO, i don't think they have the authority to access your medical history record in their system since they are not MO, so security status different. (but you can try see if they have access to the system, let us know the results)</p>
              <p>you must show black and white.. &gt;&gt; same theory like no money (evidence) no honey (freedom + pes status downgrade in future when you fix medical review appt)..</p>
              <p>the IO is really Law By Law - Step-By-Step follow the book pattern.</p>
              <p>i'm sure the letter you receive a month prior to kanna charged date, they got tell you to prepare documents to support your claim..so if you go in empty handed, take it as a lesson learn to prepare early, whatever things related to govt, especially military..</p>
              <p>if you ask this qn last min, tml just pay the fines (based on your rank) accordingly and treat it and learn from your mistake..(never do anything last minute)</p>
