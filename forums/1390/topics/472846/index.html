              <p>Here's my situation...</p>
              <p>About 3-4 weeks back after one of the outfield exercises I experienced pain in my shin. It was nothing much so I didn't report sick or anything. But then, after a 7km endurance run, the pain was quite bad so I reported sick. I got 2 days RMJ.</p>
              <p>Even after my status has ended, my injury hasn't recovered. The pain is still there and presents itself when I exert force (such as carrying heavy load, jumping, running). But the pain wasn't very bad so I participated in training as much as possible, and only asked to fall out when I feel I can't take it (e.g. endurance run, upslope chiong sua).</p>
              <p>During these few weeks my pain gradually worsened, but I didn't see the MO because it was bearable.</p>
              <p>I missed one endurance run because of that, and was lagging behind everybody else. So for the next endurance run, I participated even though the pain was moderate. After the run, the pain was unbearable so I went to report sick. My PC was suspicious and questioned me for quite a bit. I can't remember the exact conversation, but it was along the lines of:</p>
              <p>PC: Why pain?</p>
              <p>Me: I don't know, the MO also don't know, he didn't say anything that time I reported sick.</p>
              <p>(Followed by some trivial bullshit which I can't remember)</p>
              <p>PC: Leg pain is normal, don't need report sick one la.</p>
              <p>Me: But my leg pain is not the normal sprain kind, it's been painful for the past few weeks already.</p>
              <p>PC: (Threatens to OOC me, but in a joking tone)</p>
              <p>Me: I don't want to OOC, but if no choice then I will OOC. My leg is more important. If you want me to choose between the course and my leg of course I'll choose my leg la. Also not I want to get injured one.</p>
              <p>PC: Ok you go report first, see what the MO say.</p>
              <p>So I went to the MO.</p>
              <p>MO referred me to A&amp;E for x-ray and helped schedule an orthopedic appointment. X-ray to rule out stress fracture (what he said).</p>
              <p>When I went A&amp;E, the doc says x-ray shows that the bone is fine. But doc acknowledges that x-ray can't detect stress fractures; instead, x-ray is more to check for bone cysts. Stress fractures have to be determined by bone scan during my specialist appointment.</p>
              <p>So I told my PC what the doc says. I think he only focus on the part "bone is fine". But doc gave me 2 weeks excuse RMJ and heavy load until my specialist appointment.</p>
              <p>My attend B status includes a field camp. During field camp, I didn't participate, but I had to help out with the stores. So throughout 4 days, I unloaded and loaded a lot of crap: 90+ field packs, ops box, safari beds, 40 over jerry cans, benches, tables, A-frames, rations, ammo boxes, etc. Needless to say it aggravated my shin pain (which was brought on by heavy load in the 1st place).</p>
              <p>So this weekend I went to the doc to take MC for my shin pain. I was given 2 days MC (sunday and monday). Because Mon there is outfield and I'll be expected to carry all the load again, and I hope to be able to rest my leg. I shared all this with the doc, who agreed to give me the MC.</p>
              <p>But after hearing that I have MC, my PC very buay song and called me to tell me "I cannot stand you la" (all along he very frustrated that I am on status even though my x-ray "nothing wrong what"). he asked me to endorse my MC tomorrow. </p>
              <p>i understand that only MCs longer than 3 days are required to be endorsed. I have asked my PWO (which is basically PS) about it and he also said MCs &gt;3 days need to be endorsed. But he hasn't gotten back to me regarding what I should do since PC asked me to go back endorse.</p>
              <p>So what should I do? <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>

              <p>Confirm for most camps, MC less than (&lt;3) days no need to go back camp to endorse.</p>
              <p>Just stay at home since the MC is Attend C status.</p>
              <p>If anything happens such as PC calls you again to demand you go back camp, just tell him tomorrow either him or send someone such as Coy Office Clerk to collect the MC from your home or to personally ferry you. If want, you can also claim transport fare.</p>
              <p>In addition, nowadays just activate parents. <br>If when you have a real medical condition, tell PC to go to your home to have meet-the-parents session. As long as you have MC or doctor's note/ memo, you are safe.</p>

              <p>@eac:</p>
              <p>From the link you posted, it mentioned that I have to file a training injury report to seek compensation claims for medical fees, right? But even if I don't, I thought I can show my 11B for free healthcare at govt hospitals anyway?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks for the information. I don't think my case is serious enough to approach SAF counsellors. Although I'll keep that in mind for future reference and such. :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>@SC.Officer:</p>
              <p>Hmm... but doing that is like going all out to oppose him. I've texted my PWO (the SCS equivalent of PS) who ALSO said that only MC &gt;3 days need to be endorsed. I told him that PC asked me to go endorse... and he said to "then just endorse". In my case, since 2 of my direct commanders have asked me to endorse, I think I'll just endorse. Although I'll be speaking to the MO and my coy clerk to ask about the protocol/procedures. I'm in training institute so not too good to go all out and p*ss my commanders off :D especially since if I downPES they have a say in my posting. Even though I have not flouted any rules whatsoever and is fully within my rights to stay at home.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>

              <p>The training injury report is to seek extra compensation (additional payment from MINDEF, apart from the NS allowance), and a Service Injury (SI) card for any related medical problems/ conditions arising from the service injury <strong>even after ORD <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>for life</em></span>. </strong></p>
              <p>Now during your 2 years of NSF, it's free with the SAF 11B ID card. <br><br>But after ORD, what if there are any deterioration/ worsening/ aggravation of the conditions and its subsequent side effects attributing to the service injury as the key source? <br><br>After ORD, do you want MINDEF to pay for you or you fork out your own money? <br><br>If you go claim your own private insurance, your annual insurance premiums payable to the insurance company will go up and up if you claim more and as you age.</p>

              <p>@SC.Officer: i'm asking for advice for more than just the endorsement of MC thing :) i'm also asking how to approach my problem of sustaining a service injury. anyway i've called the medical center to ask, and the medic said there is "no such thing as endorsing a 2 day MC", and that i should tell my PC that if he has any queries he can contact the MO directly. so i guess i won't be endorsing my MC at all. medic told me that i don't have to endorse it, that it's under the SAF directive, "no worries", if your PC insist you can ask him to approach the medical center. :)<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>
