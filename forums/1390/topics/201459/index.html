SAF likes to keep these units together.<br><br>If you were from school or some other non-combat unit then it's a little more of a crapshoot.  Good chance you might end up in PDF if you are combat fit.  Although if you are trained in a particular combat field, i.e. if you were scout instructor during your NS, you might get posted to one of the combined arms divs to make up for people downgrading etc.<br><br>If you are on exit permit for studies, then you are on IHL and will go back to unit when you complete your studies.<br><br>If you on exit permit, no worries, you shouldn't be liable for IPPT.<br><br>So as long as you on exit permit, relax and enjoy the time.<br><br></div>

But I'm PES C2L2, so go back also lobo. All my downgraded friends in the same company all do admin. KNN, go back reservist to sleep and tak kiew. At most shoot range lor like them.<br><br>Odd thing is that I'm also from a combat unit. Was there, disrupted, then returned there after disruption. So technically i should follow all my old mates back to the reservist unit. All of em are there and waiting for me to go back. But nothing leh. I think they got too many downgraded personnel already, can't justify me going back there. Not sure how it works.<br><br>I dunno, will see how. Some of them said I will get posted at approx 2 years after I ORD. That would be mid-Sept, so see how.<br><br>EDIT: On that same note, my friends told me that one of the reservist PC is this old fat fella, 1st time come back do reservist. Apparently he worked overseas for a very long period. Suppose to conduct GPMG familarisation for the men, but instead the men teach him, ROFL.</div>

At most shoot range lor like them.<br><br>Odd thing is that I'm also from a combat unit. Was there, disrupted, then returned there after disruption. So technically i should follow all my old mates back to the reservist unit. All of em are there and waiting for me to go back. But nothing leh. I think they got too many downgraded personnel already, can't justify me going back there. Not sure how it works.<br><br>I dunno, will see how. Some of them said I will get posted at approx 2 years after I ORD. That would be mid-Sept, so see how.<br><br>EDIT: On that same note, my friends told me that one of the reservist PC is this old fat fella, 1st time come back do reservist. Apparently he worked overseas for a very long period. Suppose to conduct GPMG familarisation for the men, but instead the men teach him, ROFL.</div></blockquote>Posting to reservist unit will be a year after ORD n for ur case, u mentioned go back for reservist do nothing except sleep, this is considered fortunate already<br><br>compared to combat vocation need to go field n exercise.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

It isn't too tough.  You just have to be prepped for the short uphill bit.  But the nice part is that you then have the downhill bit just before the finish to help you speed up.</div>
