              <p><br>The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) is a 2,000-bed 
                  acute tertiary psychiatric hospital situated on a 25-hectare campus at 
                  Buangkok Green Medical Park. Set amidst serene surroundings, IMH offers a
                   comprehensive range of psychiatric, rehabilitative and counselling 
                  services for children, adolescents, adults, and the elderly.</p>
              <p>IMH’s tradition of care started in 1928. We were the first mental 
                  hospital in Singapore, starting with some 1,000 patients. Since then, 
                  many advances have been made in treatment, training, and research. Our 
                  treatment integrates evidence-based therapies, supported by the 
                  departments of clinical psychology, nursing, occupational therapy, and 
                  medical social work, to provide holistic care for our patients. IMH is 
                  equipped with modern facilities, with 50 wards for inpatients and seven 
                  Specialist Outpatient Clinics.</p>
              <p>IMH was the first mental health institution in Asia to receive the 
                  Joint Commission International Accreditation in 2005, a highly coveted 
                  international accreditation for healthcare organisations. </p>
              <p>Over the years, IMH has gained a reputation for quality research. In 
                  2008, the Ministry of Health, Singapore, entrusted IMH with a S$25 
                  million research grant to implement translational and clinical research 
                  into the causes of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.</p>
              <p>IMH also plays a key role in training the next generation of mental 
                  health professionals in Singapore. We train psychiatrists and mental 
                  health professionals through the NHG-AHPL Residency Programme for 
                  psychiatry and through collaborations with the local tertiary 
                  institutions. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>================================================================</strong></em></span></p>

              <p><em><strong>Being psychologically prepared is all about knowing
              what to expect and being prepared for it.</strong></em></p>
              <p>To be better prepared, you can participate in Total Defence
              activities and Open Houses organised by the SAF/SPF/SCDF.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you should also talk to your family members and friends
              who have lived the NS experience. The more you discuss with others,
              the more comfortable and mentally prepared you’ll become.</p>
              <p><strong>Because NS life is different from civilian life before
              enlistment, there are many adjustments you need to
              make.</strong></p>
              <p>A good way to cope is to get support from your buddy and fellow
              recruits. They are going through the same tough training as you, so
              talking to one another will help relieve some tension.</p>
              <p>In most evenings during your leisure time, you’ll also have some
              time to call your family or loved ones to talk. They can give you
              emotional support during NS.</p>
              <p>You can have a one-on-one interview sessions with your officer
              to highlight any problems you may have. If you have a personal or
              family problem that need to be addressed, do let the officer
              know—he may be able to give you some advice or time off to settle
              your problems.</p>
              <p>Life in NS revolves around structure, routine and discipline.
              This helps us stay united as a uniformed organisation as well as
              imparts the rigours necessary to protect our nation and
              citizens.</p>
              <p>This does not mean there is just work and no play. In fact,
              after a few weeks in NS and you’ll find new friends and new reasons
              to smile!</p>
              <p><strong>As a soldier, one of the biggest adjustments you’ll have
              to make quickly is in regimentation and discipline.</strong></p>
              <p>Being in a uniformed organisation, you’ll have to obey orders
              from your superiors. Thus some of you may feel a sudden lack of
              freedom to do what you want and you may find yourself having
              difficulties accepting authority initially.</p>
              <p>Regimentation and discipline build strong character and
              toughness, so that you’ll be tough enough to handle difficult
              combat, crime-fighting or rescue situations without giving up or
              breaking down.</p>
              <p>When you first enlist into NS, you may have concerns of being in
              a new territory, with new faces and new things to do. But don’t let
              this get to you. Just remember the saying that “when the going gets
              tough, the tough gets going”.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Following are some
              tips on what you can do to prepare yourself
              psychologically:</em></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Adopt a positive perception</li>
              <li>Build up physical stamina</li>
              <li>Develop good working attitude and habits</li>
              <li>Overcome psychological stress</li>
              <li>Adopt teamwork spirit</li>
              <li>Learn to be independent</li>
              <li>Set realistic expectations</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can also speak to your friends or family members who have
              been through NS. Ask them to share their stories. The sharing will
              help you reduce some of your fears, uncertainties and doubts.</p>
              <p><strong>During NS you’ll be living with different
              people.</strong></p>
              <p>Because these people come from different backgrounds, they may
              not think like you do or react to situations like you would.
              Instead of trying to select your type of people, you should cherish
              the diversity. This is a chance for you to learn more about your
              fellow mates and their cultures.</p>
              <p>You’ll find that you have many opportunities to absorb the
              different cultures—during training, eating, chatting or just seeing
              and listening. Take these opportunities and learn from people
              around you, you’ll have a much better appreciation of Singapore’s
              cultural diversity.</p>
