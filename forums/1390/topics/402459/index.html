If anyone know who i can turn to. PLS feel free to let me know as i am out of choices..<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Alright, firstly i am a malaysian and a singapore PR. I had been studying in Singapore since primary school and my grasp of malay is close to null. So yesterday, i got news that i had been recruited to join the malaysian national service by the end of this month. Here's my current situation.<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">1) I had just ORD from singapore NS in June 2010.. (should be happy, but...)<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">2)I had already applied for singapore citizenship still waiting for results<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">3)I had already been accepted in a university and will be starting school in august<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">I tried calling ICA but no one answered my call at all.. just referral after referral.. Please understand that i am not trying to escape from my duty as a malaysian citizen. But imagine just after 2 years of NS, you have to go in another one? moreover, i do not understand the malay language at all and not forgetting i am starting school soon... help...</span></p></div>

              <p>My suggestions is if the the malaysia NS falls on the date before you got your Singapore citizenship, report to the Malaysia NS first, then when your singapore citizenship, report to your commander-in-charge (in your platoon) and request for discharge.</p>
              <p>If your University (Singapore Local University) falls on earlier date of your MNS, report to the MNS that you are getting a defer.Report to the dept who send you the letter.else report to your MNS first, then request for defer, (Uni date later than MNS date = no use)</p>
              <p>if by that time you got your citizenship, request for discharge.</p>
              <p>If above failed, go through your MNS first, finish it then get your Singapore citizenship late and enter the University late (you can prove your MNS to excuse your uni attendance)</p>
              <p>it's all procedure and paperwork, you will know...</p>
              <p>Don't know malay Language, don't worry, you will figure it out....</p>

              <p>Malaysian NS is basically a glorified version of Outward Bound Camp. Really. It's an insult to National Service initiatives around the world to refer to it as 'National Service'.</p>
              <p>Sure, there's live firing. But the instructors load the rifles for them and do weapons maintenance for them. If the cadets can't even see the inside of an M16, what are the odds that they would see any classified info? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Hey,</p>
              <p>I'm exactly in your situation before,I'm a Singapore Malaysian PR, knew nothing about Malay and was called to do both nation's National Service. When the Malaysian side send me the letter and I simply inform my S1 (Unit Manpower Officer) and he simply send a CMPB letter stating I'm serving my NS here. No point calling KL's office, they close shop at 3pm and will only ask to do a deferment. If there's still doubts you can PM me. Hope this helps</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Hi everyone,<br style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; padding: 0px;">I will just like to share the situation i am in now... If anyone know who i can turn to. PLS feel free to let me know as i am out of choices..<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Alright, firstly i am a malaysian and a singapore PR. I had been studying in Singapore since primary school and my grasp of malay is close to null. So yesterday, i got news that i had been recruited to join the malaysian national service by the end of this month. Here's my current situation.<br style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; padding: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">1) I had just ORD from singapore NS in June 2010.. (should be happy, but...)<br style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; padding: 0px;">2)I had already applied for singapore citizenship still waiting for results<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">3)I had already been accepted in a university and will be starting school in august<br style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; padding: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">I tried calling ICA but no one answered my call at all.. just referral after referral.. Please understand that i am not trying to escape from my duty as a malaysian citizen. But imagine just after 2 years of NS, you have to go in another one? moreover, i do not understand the malay language at all and not forgetting i am starting school soon... help...</span></p>

              <p>There were some death cases in Malaysian NS. Some students may have allergies or could not take the rigorous training have died. Reason for this is because some NS camps are located too far from hospitals or ex army trainers want the NS people to rough it out.</p>
              <p>There was a case where one NS student was beaten up and bulled by other more dominant NS students. Assuming you are chinese, you best hang out with chinese and make sure you got a circle of your own people to protect you. Speak chinese to the chinese educated chinese and they will accept you as one of them. Let your trainers know that you don't understand Malay.</p>
