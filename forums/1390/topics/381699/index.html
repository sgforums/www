                          the visit, Mr Teo, who is also Minister for Defence, met the 17-man SAF
                          Weapon Locating Radar (WLR) team at their operating base in Tarin Kowt,

              <p></p>
              <p>DEPUTY Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean visited Singapore Armed Forces
                          (SAF) troops deployed in Afghanistan last week to get a first-hand feel
                          of their operations in Oruzgan and Bamiyan province.</p>
              <p>He was accompanied by Chief of Army Major-General Neo Kian Hong and
                          other senior SAF officers, said a statement from the Ministry of
                          Defence on Monday.</p>
              <p>During the visit, Mr Teo, who is also Minister for Defence, met the
                          17-man SAF Weapon Locating Radar (WLR) team at their operating base in
                          Tarin Kowt, the provincial capital of Oruzgan. He interacted with the
                          SAF troops, who shared their operational experiences during the two
                          months they had been there.</p>
              <p>Speaking to the WLR team, Mr Teo stressed the important role that
                          they were playing in Afghanistan and Singapore's overall contributions
                          to international security operations.</p>
              <p>'I can see the tough and challenging conditions you operate under
                          many miles from home. The SAF's deployments to Oruzgan and Bamiyan are
                          important for the people of Afghanistan and are a part of Singapore' s
                          overall contribution to international security operations,' he told the
                          SAF team. 'I have full confidence that you will continue to do
                          Singapore and the SAF proud in carrying out your duties vigilantly and
                          professionally.'</p>
              <p>While in Tarin Kowt, Mr Teo also visited the field hospital, where
                          a 20-man SAF medical team was deployed from November 2008 to May this
                          year to provide emergency and trauma care and primary healthcare, as
                          well as the Winter Deployment Team (WDT) in Bamiyan led by
                          Lieutenant-Colonel Andrew Chan.</p>
              <p>The SAF has made deployments to Afghanistan since 2007 as part of
                          Singapore's contributions to multinational stabilisation and
                          reconstruction efforts there.</p>

              <p>Because we benefit from contributing to HADR and peacekeeping operations in a coalition setting.</p>
              <p>What we can learn from overseas deployments outweigh mere exercises.</p>
              <p>Secondly, effective defence diplomacy is a concept that small nations take seriously. These take the form of many things, some, like our contribution to ISAF and CTF 151, show that we are a responsible nation that can contribute in our small way to global stability within this ambit.</p>
              <p>Those forces that you have mentioned are engaged in offensive combat operations. The Canadians and the Dutch have gone on insurgent hunts and QRF missions unlike our forces, who have been there serving in medical and base protection capability.</p>
              <p>IMHO, Singaporean deployments serve our national interest, not American interests.We're not there kicking down doors of the Taliban.</p>

              <p>i'm not a US citizen yet but I support the American war in Afghan and Iraq. Do you know what kind of lives the Iraqis lived before the US went there?? They were living under the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, denied basic amenities like food, drinkable water, basic medical care and human rights. Many were tortured and killed by him during interrogations of suspected insurgencies.  His favourite methods are many, including plucking out the fingernails of the people with pliers and implementing electric shocks onto his victims' genitals. He also had a penchant for raping women civilians. Pls go read up about the world before you croak so much like a self righteous toad.</p>
              <p>The goals of the US war include overturning the Hussein's regime and setting up a democratic government for Iraq, in which members are wholly elected by the people of Iraq. Same goes for Afghan.</p>
              <p>Hussein was eventually arrested by US troops in the invasion and charged, trialed and executed by the <a title="Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Iraqi_Criminal_Tribunal"></a>Iraqi Special Tribunal, and not the US government.</p>
              <p>SAF has always sent its soldiers on overseas missions, but they only send the regulars so that the precious NSF boys won't risk their lives in dangerous places so don't worry. BG Tan Chuan Jin went to Aceh and COA Neo Kian Hong was deployed to East Timor.</p>
              <p>Our top soldiers are also sent to US army training in the various Forts (their army bases are called Fort something) in the US during the start of their career (pre LTC). their first one occur as soon as during university vacation attachment and after they graduate from university, they go for a longer one that is a full officer's course.  Its first to Harvard, then to Fort Benning.</p>
              <p>Their CSC (command and staff college) is done in actually professional military institutes like Sandhurst, rather than half-bake SAFTI where the farmers go so please don't go crapping again that our scholar-officers are soft, only good bureacrats or paper generals.

              <p>The methods of bringing about societal change may be debatable, but it's really untenable to deny that Iraqi society has enjoyed greater freedom and personal autonomy compared to the Saddam era.</p>
              <p>In any case, you are off topic.The unhappiness with American-led occupation is not a monolithic issue, you must understand the complex sectarian background of Iraqi society to really be able to comment on the degree of happiness and unhappiness existing side by side.</p>

                  leading to the US bombing and occupation of Iraq in March 2003 was a
                  lawsuit under the US Freedom of Information Act brought by Sierra Club
                  and Judicial Watch, initially to find data on Cheney`s role in the
                  California energy crisis. The suit demanded that Vice President Cheney
                  make public all documents and records of meetings related to his 2001
                  Energy Task Force project.</p>

                  files of the domestic US energy review was, curiously enough, a

              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Regime Change Intended from the Outset</span> - US Secretary of the
              Treasury Paul O’Neill, later recalls: “<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>From the very beginning, there
              was a conviction, that Saddam Hussein was a bad person and that he
              needed to go.…<span style="color: #ff0000;"> From the very first instance, it was about Iraq.</span></strong></span> It was
              about what we can do to change this regime. Day one, these things were
              laid and sealed.” O’Neill will say officials never questioned the logic
              behind this policy. No one ever asked, “Why Saddam?” and “Why now?”
              Instead, the issue that needed to be resolved was how this could be
              accomplished. “It was all about finding a way to do it,” O’Neill will
              explain. “That was the tone of it. The president saying ‘Go find me a
              way to do this.’”</p>

                      secret strategies for regime change in Iran and elsewhere.</em></p>
              <p>In "A Time to Lead: For Duty, Honor and Country," published by Palgrave
                      Macmillan last month, the former four-star general recalls two visits
                      to the Pentagon following the terrorist attacks of September 2001. On
                      the first visit,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> less than two weeks after Sept. 11</strong></span>, he writes, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>a
                      "senior general" told him, "We're going to attack Iraq. The decision
                      has basically been made."</strong></span></span></p>

              <p>But these wars are dirty wars instigated by USA to serve their goal of securing global dominance.</p>
              <p>That is completely clear.</p>

              <p class="RVPS706570">I think that the origins of the current situation
                  can be found in the events that took place seven years ago. It was then
                  that the world missed its historic chance, the chance to de-ideologize
                  international politics and create a genuinely democratic world order.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> It let slip this chance because of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">United States’ desire to
                  consolidate its global rule...</span></strong></span></p>

              <div class="productDescriptionWrapper">For the faction that controls the Pentagon, the military industry and
              the oil industry, the Cold War never ended. It went on 'below the
              radar' creating a global network of bases and conflicts to advance
              their long-term goal of Full Spectrum Dominance, the total control of
              the planet: land, sea, air, space, outer space and cyberspace.</div>
              <div class="productDescriptionWrapper"><br></div>
              <div class="productDescriptionWrapper">Their
              methods included control of propaganda, use of NGOs for regime change,
              Color Revolutions to advance NATO east, and a vast array of
              psychological and economic warfare techniques, a Revolution in Military
              Affairs as they termed it.</div>

              <div class="productDescriptionWrapper">The events of September 11, 2001 would allow
              an American President to declare a war on an enemy who was everywhere
              and nowhere, who justified a Patriot Act that destroyed that very
              freedom in the name of the new worldwide War on Terror. This book gives
              a disturbing look at that strategy of Full Spectrum Dominance.</div>
