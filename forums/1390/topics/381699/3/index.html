              <p>You stated that the guy should not bring in other armies to compare due to the differing MO. Which i find contradictory as you bring Israel in to compare with singapore despite the different MO for war.</p>
              <p>And since you argued that Israel, since being an enemy of the Arab, can be brought in to compare, then the guy's argument for bring in Australian army to compare with is valid as Australia is involved in the Afghan and Iraq US mission.</p>

                                  the page and read my post over. It was Kuwait and Iraq in which I used to compare, when highlighting how you should dutifully serve your NS (i hope you're aware of the Kuwait-Iraq war and the Iran-Iraq wars). These three countries - Kuwait, Iraq and Israel- have in common one thing, and that is military conflict. Singapore decided to build up an armed force and conscript to deter and in the event of the failure of deterrence, to win military conflicts. So I had due cause to put forth that.</p>
              <p>Whereas someone else tried to say that Israel is slacker with its reservist than SAF is, especially regarding IPPT. So it was right that someone said Israel and SAF do not share the exact same military doctrines and MO for war. How could it be when the terrain and size of fighting units are different? As long as wartime MO is not the same, there is no justification for reservist training doctrine to be the same. Thats why its not relevant. So there is due cause to put forth that.</p>

              <p>hahahahaha you mean ALL countries who have a conscripted force should have the same war MO? hahahahahaa</p>
              <p>Countries build up armed forces to defend themselves or attack others. Its as simple as that. SG built up ours for the elaborate reasons I highlighted above. We built up ours so that in the event of a conflict that occurs after failed deterrence, we don't get screwed. I simply raised a few countries that have an armed force and have engaged in conflict. You ARE quoting out of context.</p>
              <p>Whereas the criteria an armed force makes of its reservist is dependent on the war MO. how can all countries with conscript have the same war MO, and hence how to have the same IPPT standards of reservists?</p>
              <p>Stop trying to pull the wool over other people's eyes. I think you could succeed, with some here, but not me.</p>

                  others. Its as simple as that. SG built up ours for the elaborate
                  reasons I highlighted above. We built up ours so that in the event
                  of a conflict that occurs after failed deterrence, we don't get
                  screwed. I simply raised a few countries that have an armed force
                  and have engaged in conflict. You ARE quoting out of context.</p>
              <p>Whereas the criteria an armed force makes of its reservist is
                  dependent on the war MO. how can all countries with conscript have
                  the same war MO, and hence how to have the same IPPT standards of
                  reservists?</p>
              <p>Stop trying to pull the wool over other people's eyes. I think
                  you could succeed, with some here, but not me.</p>

              <p>I am not trying to.</p>
              <p>The criteria that countries build up on their armed forces and reservist goes beyond that of the reasons you listed. There are many other underlying and overlapping reasons which i don't wish to dwelve into. That's why i don't think it's fair to compare any countries' armies or reservist with that of another countries at all. We are all in different situations and circumstances and thats why certain countries react in certain ways while other countries don't. That's why some countries have consripted armies while others don't, amongst many other reasons.</p>
