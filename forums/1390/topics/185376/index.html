All the officers telling me that i will definately recourse, since i will still be retaining PES B status. But i have accepted the fact that i will recourse at the end of my NS, although my OC said he'll "try to do something" about recourse earlier. To my understanding, i will be joining a RECOURSE BMT, specially designed for OOT personnel like me.<br><br>Anyways, thank you everyone for advice, it really helped cos it kinda gave me the head's up on what might happen to me, and LOWERED my expectations greatly, so i was not extremely depressed that all this crap is happening to me.<br><br>For the few thinking of OOT.......PLEASE DON'T!! U'll rather do 10 AGR's than live a useless, ghostly life of an OOT........</div>
