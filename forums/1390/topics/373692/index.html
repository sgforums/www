              <p>There is no recommendation for technician vocation. Only recommendation NOT to get into technical vocation due to permenent excuse dust, excuse heavy load etc</p>

              <p>No la i posted this thread up cus I did the following:</p>
              <p>1) Ringed up CMPB on Thursday Afternoon</p>
              <p>2) Got this guy who picked up and said that maybe because I majored in Mechanical Engineering in poly and that the reason I gave for requesting for a recommendation is that I will spend 2 years of NS gaining occupational experience as a technician that will help me in my future career as I dun look down (but rather admire, on the contrary) ITE students who are able to have hands on experience. Rather than to spend 2 years doing things that are totally not related to my studies in combat units.</p>
              <p>So he said that my reason might work out.</p>
              <p>3) He asked for my PES status, which I haven went for medical checkup</p>
              <p>4) He replied that by doing this its like sending a question mark question to expect a question mark answer.</p>
              <p>5) So he told me to get back to him after I have gotten my PES status.</p>

              <p>As i mentioned before, in my entire batch of technicians, majority of the technicians were not from an engineering background.</p>
              <p>When u called, did you take down the rank and name of that person? NSF mostly can just anyhow answer since you also dunno who they are, wrong also not their problem.</p>
              <p>CMPB is not the 1 that does the posting, should be CPC side so CMPB also cannot give any reliable information.</p>

              <p>Simply: The world is unfair. If any person can suka suka call up a request to go to any vocation, then by tomolo SAF is going to get tens of thousand calls on requests.</p>
              <p>Thousand of ppl before enter NS and got into vocations that is not related to their study, why the heck u must be different?</p>
              <p>Lastly, u have not even enter NS, what makes u think the skills u learn poly will not be useful in vocation not related to ur study. And in contrast, what makes u think the skills that u are going learn in vocation that is not related to ur study is going to be useless?</p>
              <p>The only thing I find that u are commendable is that u took the time to go and find out, which I feel is quite a good quality in a person but I can't say that for ur morbid fascination of die die must get into a related vocation.</p>
