            <div class='col-md body'><p>Eh dude...I think they will say that if u're PTP, there's no diff from you being in Enhanced. Just that they give u 1mth of "special training" to get in shape and the training is more "strung out" rather den compacted. In my"enlistment notice" it says " As you did not attain the required NAPFA test standard,you will be attending a 4 weeks physical training phase programme followed by 9-weeks basic military training."</p></div>

              <p>Since you were given notice for PTP enlistment, i presume you are either a diploma or A level..therefore, you will most prob be in Tekong for your enhanced bmt also...  My word of advice.... if you are able to attain a silver for NAPFA, do try your best to get it... It will cut off two months of your NS liability so you serve only 1yr10mths instead of 2yrs.  It seems ok to enlist a month earlier but dun forget that means you will ord a month later than the enhanced batch also...trust me, at the end of 1yr10mths you will be more than willing to leave asap....</p>
              <p>Hope this helps</p>

              <p>just a bit of add on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>even if u pass IPPT before u go for enlistment on that date allocated to you.</p>
              <p>u still have to serve 24 months of Army coz PTP is for ppl who didn't take or have failed their IPPT.</p>
              <p>while u can have the option of trying ur best to pass IPPT but if they tell u to wait for posting, than u might need to wait for a while more. Depending on when there's is a intake than will enrol u into a Enhance PTP batch, which u may have already wasted a few months just on waiting.</p>
              <p>Who knows..</p>
              <p>Just go in and join this.</p>
              <p>Do some training first.</p>
              <p>Normal NAFA training only help a little bit in Tekong since the training is tougher than what we do inside while in the PTP batch although mine is PTP Enhanced Batch.</p>
