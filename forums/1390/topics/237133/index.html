From my understanding NCC cadets who go for the course are required to conduct 2 days jumps and 1 night jump... Commandos have to do a different amount of jumps... Let's wait for Gedanken <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>Ok I have to admit that my knowledge is outdated here.NCC cadets had their wings inscribed with the letters NCC(if i am not wrong) and for them it was just a confidence course.However they do need to go for a refresher course/more jumps to qualify for the standard wing.Cdos and other units went for the same course,where got ? 2 days jumps and 1 night jump in clean fatique some more!!.Geez how could I know? I left the SAF in the 80s.Thanks for the info anyways.</div>
