A popular phrase within the Ranger Regiment regarding this issue is: "The tab is a school, the scroll is a way of life" (the scroll being the insignia of the 75th Ranger Regiment). Another saying is Tab Wearers and Scroll Bearers. You wear the tab, but it's an honor to bear the scroll. A person who passes Ranger School is considered "Ranger Qualified", but is not a member of the Regiment, and thus not a Ranger.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/92/United_States_Army_Ranger_Tab_%28embroided%29.gif/180px-United_States_Army_Ranger_Tab_%28embroided%29.gif"><br>tab<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bf/75th_Ranger_Regiment_insignia.gif/180px-75th_Ranger_Regiment_insignia.gif"><br>scroll<br><br><blockquote>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Rangers</blockquote></div>
