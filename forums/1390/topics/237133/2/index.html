Do note that Guards are not superman super-trained infantry, they are more like Cavalry. Lightly armed, but capable for quick insertions into key locations in the battlefield to turn the tide of the battle. The role they serve is not much unlike Armour. Both are cavalry, except that the Guards are Air Mobile.</div>

I think I was misunderstood<br><br>I know there are some who get those badges (American Wings etc), but the whole group of commandos i.e. 1st CDO Btn is not a special forces group right?

Hence I was not surprised to hear that parachute trg was an idea toyed with.  I think there was even a <span style="color: darkblue;">Guards Pathfinder platoon in the past (not sure about now)</span> showing yet more similarity with the Para.

In the British ARmy, 'Guards' units (eg. the Scots Guards, the Coldstream Guards, Welsh Guards, etc) are used as ceremonial guards at eg Buckingham Palace.

Sniper and LRRP are division assets, but I don't think they will be deployed together. I think they act seperately, in different capacities and functions.<br><br>Sniper is primarily a front-line unit, aka, they stay ahead of friendly forces to "scout ahead", but remain infront of the enemy's front. However, LRRP will be inserted behind the enemy's front, and may not be involved directly in the emminent attack. They may be monitering the enemy's reaction to the attack and how they redeploy forces, checking if enemy reinforcements/new troops coming in, etc.<br><br>The battalion level scouts are a diff matter altogether, they deploy shortly ahead of the battalion only, help to determine method of attack, enemy positions, and do not act idependently of the parent unit.</div>
