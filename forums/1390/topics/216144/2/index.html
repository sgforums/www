Maybe you can PM me the unit?<br><br>In my NS days, me and three other "clerks" were doing the job scope for 2WOs and 1WOs. I found this out when I was reading the VAA guidelines, and realised our tasks and job scopes within for our vocation, were actually part of a warrant officer's scope, but like God knows what, the SAF works in funny ways.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

They are doing what their warrant officer has task them to do, easily Boss-employee role, it is just that this employee AKA ur friend abit tua kang only.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Because most clerks, handle admin matters which ususally can go into the documents that of importance, they too will get high security clearance so as to handle them.<br><br>Ex wallaby, clerks also will go one, why? Clerks are also need to go there to do paper work and sh!t jobs what (sai gang). All the soldiers out in field already, who is going to do all the sai gang? CLERKS OF COURSE!
