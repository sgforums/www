            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>I've been writing to PAP ministers (Mr. Teo Chee Hean, Ex Minister for 
              Defence and  Dr.Ng eng Hen, Minister for Defence) for more than 2 years 
              now about my case. Every time I write to them, it is always forwarded to
               the Permanent secretary and then it takes 3 months to get any reply. 
              More often than not, the reply would not even address all my questions 
              (being calm and mature i think)<br> <br>To tell my story in short :<br>I had a service injury when I was in 
              SAF school campus way back in 1977. I was asked to climb a durian tree 
              by my officer and I fell from the tree and hurt my spinal cord. We had 
              to bear all my medical expenses and I was also medical board out of SAF 
              school at the age of 15 because I was disabled.  I've been suffering 
              from Syringomyelia ( spinal injury)  so I have lived my life doing odd 
              jobs and getting support from my family. In 2009, I decided to request 
              for my medical benefits because I had to undergo another surgery due to 
              the service injury. MINDEF kept rejecting my claim repeatedly saying it 
              was not a service injury and  that I had fell from a tree in my house. 
              However, I gathered enough evidence to prove my case after which, MINDEF
               couldn't reject my claim. <br> <br>I've suffered for over 34 years because of my injury and now It has 
              taken 2 years of writing to the Ministers to finally have MINDEF accept 
              that it was a service injury and the doctors have also declared that I'm
               99% permanently disabled. But still, there is no light on when I would 
              get my compensation and medical benefits. I've not even been able to 
              work for the past 2 years and I'm living solely with the support of my 
              family. How can anyone deal with this calmly? This had to be dealt with 
              maturely by the government. If they had done so, I would have received 
              my compensation and medical benefits by now. <br> <br>I joined SAF school aspiring to be a soldier. But because of the 
              injury, I haven't been able to marry or get life insurance or even get 
              DPS coverage. I've been incapable of getting many such  things that a 
              normal person can get. How can I stay calm bearing all this and also the
               insensitivity of MINDEF and the ministers to my case?</p>

              <p>I feel sad for your story.But you should have realised you have sold your own life for the nation once you sign on. The compensation is the minimum for regulars. In fact there is no compensation back in 1977.</p>
              <p>Even now, the regulars are expected to buy their own insurance to cover themselves for service injury in SAF (whether it is operational or personal).</p>
              <p>NSF, we are expected to buy our own pioneer insurance policy for service injury.</p>
              <p>For more severe cases, such as death, the SAF insurance might pay a litttle, but it is like a few hundreds to a few thousands only.</p>
              <p>For reservist, it is different, SAF actually brought insurance for us, for the two to three week training.</p>
              <p>Remember you volunteer to serve the nation with your own life, when you sign on the contract!!</p>

              <h3>Service Injuries</h3>
              <p>When an NSman sustains an injury due to an authorised activity
              sanctioned by the Unit Commanding Officer during his In-Camp
              Training (ICT), he is required to report the incident immediately
              to his Unit S1/Manpower Officer and Unit Medical Officer (MO), so
              that his unit can assist him in the filing of his injury report and
              to provide him with the required treatment for his injury.</p>
              <p>NSman is to provide the following, should he wish to submit his
              bills incurred for the treatment of his service injury:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Original tax invoice/receipt</li>
              <li>Certification from hospital/doctor that the bill incurred is
              for the treatment of his service injury</li>
              <li>Statement from CPF Board for amounts deducted from Medisave
              account (if any)</li>
              <li>Statement from insurance company on the amount deducted from
              policy plan for the treatment of his service injury (if any)</li>
              </ul>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div><br>
              <h3>Service Injury (SI) Card</h3>
              <p>Upon the approval of his injury as attributable to service, the
              NSman may be issued with an SI card, if it is certified by his
              attending doctor that he would require long-term medical treatment
              for his service injury. This SI card will provide him with fully
              subsidised medical benefits at government/restructured hospitals
              and polyclinics at his eligible ward for as long as he requires
              it.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div>
              <h3>Medical Reimbursement</h3>
              <p>If NSman has incurred medical fees at government/restructured
              hospitals and polyclinics for the treatment of his service injury
              prior to the approval, he is to retain all original receipts,
              certification from the doctor that the treatment is for his service
              injury and other supporting documents to his payment of medical
              fees. He may submit these documents to MINDEF/SAF Human Resource
              Shared Services Centre (HRSSC) upon the approval of his service
              injury for medical reimbursement. Do note that only medical fees
              incurred at government/restructured hospitals and polyclinics are
              reimbursable by MINDEF and he is to seek referral from doctors at
              polyclinic, hospital's A&amp;E or his Unit MO for treatments at
              government/restructured hospitals.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div>
              <h3>Ex-gratia Payment</h3>
              <p>If the NSman remains on continuous medical leave upon his ICT
              due to his service injury, he may be eligible for ex-gratia payment
              if it is certified by his employer that he is not receiving any
              salary for the period of his medical leave for his service injury.
              He is to provide a letter from his employer to inform MINDEF of
              this and the amount that is to be reimbursed, together with
              supporting documents.</p>
              <p>This ex-gratia payment, which is meant to compensate NSman's
              loss of income during the period of medical leave, will be paid in
              a stepdown approach based on his civilian pay or an equivalent pay
              of a regular serviceman, whichever higher. The ex-gratia payment
              will cease upon the termination of his medical leave or the award
              of his disability compensation, whichever earlier.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div>
              <h3>Lump Sum Disability Compensation</h3>
              <p>If it is certified by his attending Specialist that his service
              injury has stabilised, the NSman is to inform his unit to request
              for him to be reviewed by his Unit MO. He will be required to
              complete an authorisation form to allow MINDEF to obtain a
              Disability Assessment Report (DAR) from his attending Specialist on
              his service injury. The hospital will take about 3 to 4 months to
              revert with the DAR. Upon the receipt of the DAR with no further
              query, he will be scheduled to attend a PD Board by Military
              Medicine Institute (MMI) for the endorsement of the PD that has
              been assessed by his attending Specialist for him to have suffered
              as a result of his service injury. Upon the endorsement and
              approval of his PD Board Outcome, MINDEF/SAF HRSC will then be able
              to process his disability compensation. He will be informed of the
              award of his lump sum disability compensation subsequently.</p>

              </p><p>National Service is the duty that every male citizen must undertake upon attaining the age of 18. It is for the serviceman to swear allegiance to Singapore. As much as the serviceman swears his commitment to be loyal to the country, the country should also vow some commitment towards the serviceman.</p>
              <p>Here is an excerpt from an article published on 4th August 2010 in 'The Straits Time' :</p>
              <p>"The Advisory Council on Community Relations in Defence has done much to recognise the important role of Singapore's citizen soldiers, particularly in the form of monetary rewards and welfare provisions."</p>
              <p>Infact, Mr. Kumar should have been less than 18 when he had the injury since he was in the SAF boys school. The SAF boys school would have been instituted to instill more discipline in the servicemen. How can they not support when a kid has been injured aspiring to serve the country? This is discouraging to the next generation who are willing to serve the country.</p>
