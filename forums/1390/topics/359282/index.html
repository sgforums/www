              <li><strong>SAF soldiers do not have the right motivation to fight: </strong>Compared to Israel, we do not have a common cause for defending Singapore, apart from family and friends living here. Even that can change by migrating elsewhere. Where as Israelis are known to take the first plane home to defend their country at the outbreak of war. With the influx of foreign talent, this might even errode the sense of belonging and ownership of the country. Why defend a country from foreign threats when the country itself is not interested in protecting our own citizens interest.<br></li>
              <li><strong>Bulk of the Armed Forces are the reserves: </strong>Lets face it, how many reservists actually considered or imagine having to fight a war one day? How many do actually keep in shape for combat duties? How many do their keep abreast of the latest development of combat skills. The way war is fought 30 yrs ago might not be the same war we will fight today. Do our reserve training enough time to train our reservist to the level of professional soldiers?</li>
              <li><strong>Resentment  between NSFs and Regulars:</strong> We all know of this while serving National Service. Arrowing of work/duties, getting charged for the silliest offences. Earning lesser then the regulars but shouldering more workload. Having been part of the lower rank, i always been hearing snide comments to violent outbursts from NSFs regarding Regulars. Are you willing to fight with/for the people who you do not respect or like?</li>
              <li><strong>Overreliance on technology rather than the development of the human factor:</strong> Every year or so we would hear about new weapons platform, planes. But how often do we hear about how to improve the conditions of soldiers, be it personal development or welfare or personal equipment. We all know the PE of the average soldier is not exactly world class less if you belong to a elite unit or testing experimental gear. The standard issue gear we have are sub-par compared to what other advanced countries soldiers are using.</li>

              <p>pretty much agree with what you've just said, i can't really name anything i really feel i would fight for if there's a war.</p>
              <p>i can't even go out each day without getting swarmed by foreigners. and the PRs we have nowadays aren't the ones we grew up with. most people i know who are PRs don't want to stay here. they're here for stuff they want then going off ASAP.</p>
              <p>I know some do say its unfair to singaporeans because we have to serve ns and they don't but its not an area i can indentify with so i never had strong resentments in that area. what i don't like is why am i sharing my country i like with someone who don't like it? it makes sense if you like it here, i don't mind you here if thats the case. but if i'm going to have to defend my country in a war and i know somewhere behind the frontlines i'm protecting some dipshit who hates my country it doesn't makes sense does it?</p>

              <p>Hmm, the thread title got changed...Maybe it was politically incorrect. Anyway i got some more points to add.</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong> The "top down" only manner of which most new ideas or concepts are being introduced and the "bottom up" is largely ignored:</strong> What i am trying to convey is that most new ideas, SOPs etc are being pushed down from the top. The opinions of "the man on the ground" is largely ignored or dismissed as illogical. Although sometimes expericence do count enormously when new concepts are being introduced, do not forget that the "man" running this concepts are of the lower rank and younger. Though lacking in experience, he will be the one doing the same tasks day in and day out. How many times do you see a major and above changing a wheel or leading a patrol?</li>
              <li><strong>Discrimination of race, education level and social status</strong>: I wont hide, i am sure certain units and vocations are close-hold to a certain minority. Is there a certain good reason for this unofficial policy? Does the government really dont trust soldiers of a certain race to do their duty and put aside religious or race issues? How do you expect soldiers to fight for a country who dont even trust them? i know soldiers of minority races and i dont think they will balk at the trigger even when facing the enemy of the same etnicity. <strong>Education Level:</strong> Is education level a must to be a commander in the military? Having the intelligence is ok, but it is not all of being a commander. Why not give certain promising soldiers to be commanders and fully utilise their potential in NS rather than getting them to sign on to be one. <strong>Social Status:</strong> "White horse" classification, Enough said.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> Anyway, i dont belong to a minority race, but i feel we are a country for long enough for the politicians to not dodge the issue and come clean, rather than say they dont trust a minority machine gun commander to perform his duty when facing the enemy.</p>

              <p>You might have the right concepts, but the thinking is hard to imply on the military, an institution based mostly on tradition and regimentation. Its like trying to change course of a huge oil tanker, it will take time for changes.</p>
              <p>I think the Goverment not only discriminate against minority groups, Hell it even starts to discriminate against Singaporeans. " I need Singaporeans to fight in war but during peace, you have to find your own way" I dont even know if a war breaks out the fellas beside me will run or drop their arms. I dont think MPs wont even have the manpower to catch deserters.</p>
