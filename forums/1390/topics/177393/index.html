              <p><strong>Q1: Why  are pre-enlistees and  National Servicemen  subject to exit controls?</strong><br><br>Exit
               controls are necessary to regulate overseas travel to maintain 
              operational readiness and to ensure that national servicemen who go 
              overseas remain contactable to facilitate recall in times of emergency. 
               Exit controls also provide a psychological reminder of a national 
              serviceman's NS obligations.</p>

              <p><strong>Q2: Why is there a need for NSmen to notify MNC of overseas trips of more than 24 hours and less than 6 months?</strong><br><br>During
               peacetime, information collected by the MNC is used by units for 
              mobilisation planning and to report daily recallable strength during 
              standby. <br><br>When the rapid mobilisation of NSmen is required, the 
              information captured by the MNC can be used by the SAF to contact and 
              recall NSmen who are overseas quickly.  <br><br><strong>Q3: Why  did MINDEF 
              decide to exempt NSmen who have completed their Operationally Ready 
              National Service (ORNS) training cycle and have been phased into the 
              MINDEF Reserve (MR)  from notifying MNC? <br><br></strong>Exempting NSmen who
               have completed their ORNS training cycle and have been phased into the 
              MR from MNC requirements enhances convenience for NSmen who are unlikely
               to be called up for ORNS whilst maintaining it for those who are 
              required to to be operationally ready at a short notice. This is a 
              balanced approach that enhances convenience for NSmen without affecting 
              the SAF's operational readiness. This is also in line with MINDEF's 
              efforts to recognise NSmen who have actively served and completed their 
              ORNS. <br><br><strong>Q4: How would an NSman know if he has completed his ORNS training cycle and have been phased into the MR?<br><br></strong>MINDEF
               will be writing to inform NSmen who have already completed their ORNS 
              training cycle and are in the MR that they will be exempted from 
              notifying the MNC.  Going forward, all NSmen who have completed their 
              ORNS training cycle  and are due to be phased into the MR will also be 
              informed that they no longer need to notify MNC.<br><br><strong>Q5: Will NSmen who have not been called up to serve ORNS be exempted from mandatory notification? <br><br></strong>There
               are some NSmen who are not called up for ORNS as they belong to defunct
               vocations or  are medically unfit for ORNS. Such NSmen are not 
              considered to have completed their ORNS training cycle and would be 
              required to notify the MNC until they reach the statutory age of 40 (for
               non-officers) and 50 (for officers).<br><br><strong>Q6: How can NSmen notify MNC of their overseas trips?<br><br></strong>NSmen can notify MNC via the following channels:<br> <br>- Telephone: 1800 3676767 (eNSNSNS) <br>- SMS: 36767 (eNSNS)<br>- Fax: 6853-7894<br>- Internet: <a class="imindefParstextimageText" href="http://www.ns.sg">http://www.ns.sg</a><br>- Email: <a class="imindefParstextimageText" href="mailto:mailto:contact@ns.sg">contact@ns.sg</a><br>- Mail ( MINDEF eServices, 5 Ang Mo Kio Street 62, NCS Hub, Singapore 569141)<br><br><strong>Q7: What is the penalty for failing to notify the MNC of overseas trips of more than 24 hours and less than 6 months?<br><br></strong>NSmen
               who fail to notify the MNC would have committed an offence under the 
              Enlistment Regulations. NSmen who persist in not notifying the MNC  will
               be served with a composition fine.  Recalcitrant offenders may be 
              prosecuted in court and be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding 
              $2,000.</p>

              <p><strong>Q8: Why did MINDEF decide to relax EP controls for NSFs and will this affect the operational readiness of the SAF?</strong><br><br>MINDEF
               has decided to  relax exit controls for NSFs as there are already 
              sufficient controls in place to ensure that they fulfil their full-time 
              NS obligations. NSFs are subject to disciplinary controls  under the SAF
               Act and would be liable for the offence of AWOL or desertion if they 
              fail to report for duty. NSFs are also subject to leave policies and 
              will be required to fill in their  contact details during leave 
              application. As such, MINDEF is able to exempt NSFs from EP for short 
              trips of less than 3 months. This will enhance convenience for NSFs 
              making short overseas trips over the weekends or whilst on leave.<br><br><strong>Q9: Will NSFs who are on disruption be affected by this policy change?<br><br></strong>This
               policy change will also apply to NSFs who are disrupted for their 
              studies. Such NSF disruptees will similarly be required to apply for an 
              EP only for overseas trips of 3 months or longer.<br><br><strong>Q10: Why were NSmen required to surrender their EPs and what has changed for this requirement to be removed?</strong><br><br>NSmen
               were required to surrender their EPs upon their return to Singapore as 
              an indication of their permanent return to Singapore. This  enabled the 
              SAF to schedule them for ORNS activities without undue delay. Going 
              forward, MINDEF will leverage on the system linkage between the EP 
              System and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority's Exit-Entry 
              Control Upgraded System to detect NSmen who have returned to Singapore 
              in order  to schedule them for ORNS activities.<br><br><strong>Q11: How can NSFs and NSmen apply for an EP?</strong><br><br>EP applications may be made through the following:<br><br>- Internet: <a class="imindefParstextimageText" href="http://www.ns.sg">http://www.ns.sg</a><br>- Exit Permit Office (Central Manpower Base, 3 Depot Road, Singapore 109680)<br><br><strong>Q12: What is the penalty for going overseas without a valid EP?</strong><br><br>National
               Servicemen who remain overseas without a valid EP would have committed 
              an offence under the Enlistment Act. Initial EP offenders may be served 
              with composition fines. Recalcitrant offenders will be charged in court 
              and on conviction be liable to a fine of up to $10,000 or to 
              imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both.</p>
