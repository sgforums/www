            <div class='col-md body'>Combat life is simpler, particularly if posted to the company line. The unit will be training for REDCON status (twice during NS, &amp; also every reservist ICT in the future), so the field training is usually structured around passing the proficiency tests -- first at the company &amp; then the battalion level. They'll take a few months to achieve, or kena re-test. Thereafter, the unit becomes ops-ready &amp; will rotate with other active units to do weekly standby. There are also chances to go overseas, or train locally alongside other foreign armed forces. Sometimes a unit gets arrowed to do other non-military stuff too, like NDP or blind-clearance in the Live Firing Area.<br><br>Some BMT activities like IPPT, SOC, ATF (range shooting), BCCT (if applicable), guard duty, area cleaning etc. will continue with the unit. But no more stand-by-beds, unless it's a tekan session. IMO You can really become self-independent in unit life, in everything from buying a pail to do your own laundry (instead of bringing home ala BMT); to bartering with your Encik on when best to clear your off-in-lieus; to booking out regularly during nights-off to "wind down" (so much so I didn't mind burning holidays or Saturdays -- but not Sundays -- doing guard duty).<br><br>If you're with a frontline unit, you'd better get along with your buddies too. As I told my old mono-intake batch, most of you guys are going to be together for the next 10-plus years including reservist -- unless you're posted out due to studies (NS-disruption or reposting to IHL unit), medical downgrading (only the most serious cases) or overseas-based work (reservist deferment or holding list). So get used to each other.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I left out mob manning, which was always nervy even though we only did it on weekends in NS. Standby duty, I should also add, was done at the COY (or equivalent) level. But the unit can usually see the assignment rotate back to it in every 3 weeks or so, hence regular internal preparation (like T-loaning each other stuff to meet the logistics SOP).<br><br>I dunno whether it's changed through the years, but one big difference between unit &amp; BMT life was that recruits in my time weren't allowed to see the training programme (&amp; were too sotong to ask) They just lived day-to-day, as a result.<br><br>But, at the unit, a fortnight's (sometimes up to a month's) timetable was usually displayed on the notice board, prompting many to consult it to see if they could bend the system their way. Usually cannot "siam" important activities like SOC &amp; field EX, but chao kengers could try to see about scheduling medical appointments on less-important mornings, while the aquaphobic would plan to volunteer for guard duty instead of going for swimming, etc. For the others, they would just check when the nights-off were or whether they could apply for a long weekend, etc.<br></div>
