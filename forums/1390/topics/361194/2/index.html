              What do you mean by control of state? If you think that it is independent and not controlled by the ruling party, then you are very naive.

              <p>Sigh...pearlie, who makes up the SAF?</p>
              <p>It's our people, our fellow citizens, brothers, fathers, sisters, even mothers inside, along with our relatives and friends. Is there a need to fear our own SAF, whose sole duty had been always been to protect and defend us the people? Had it ever interfered in our political affairs? Are there any uniformed soldier as MP in our Parliament?</p>
              <p>It only exists to train us on warfare and its organisation, keeping the reservists constantly updated on the latest information and tactics, so that in an outbreak of war or wars, we will be prepared and organised, unlike our forefathers who were kept stupid by the brits and annihilated by the squat jap bastards in 1942.</p>

              <p>A) " I am fighting for my country" - can be commonly interpretated as meant fighting for a piece of rock and everyone that exists on the rock.</p>
              <p>B.)I am fighting for my Nation" -  same explanation.</p>
              <p>C.) "I am fighting for the State" - can be commonly interpretated as meant the government and the ruling party,</p>

              <p>Country, Nation or State ultimately means one and similar thing - its people. Who can be more important than the people, regardless if we say we fight for our country or nation or state?</p>

              <p>A) " I am fighting for my country" - can be commonly interpretated as meant fighting for a piece of rock and everyone that exists on the rock.</p>
              <p>B.)I am fighting for my Nation" -  same explanation.</p>
              <p>C.) "I am fighting for the State" - can be commonly interpretated as meant the government and the ruling party,</p>
              <p>but in Singapore, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">th</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">e government and ruling party exists WITHOUT authority by vote from its people?</span> No, thus even if one say fighting for the state, it would mean fighting for everyone as well as the land.</p>
              <p>Country, Nation or State ultimately means one and similar thing - its people. Who can be more important than the people, regardless if we say we fight for our country or nation or state?</p>
              <p>Hope that clears the issue up. Any further erudition, i guess we all need to go back to school and this place renamed as the  "Queen's Perfect English and usuage Clarity Forum". Any violators of the Queen's  engrishh gets banned, and probably me with be first one lor!</p>
              <p>So chill out, will yer,guys? You'll are on the same page - 'protectin and defendin the people' - as far as I and probably readers reading here. It aint worth an ounce of energy you both goin on and on.</p>

              The 7 core values was concieved by LG(NS) Bay Soon Khiang, then Chief of Defence Forces, to serve as a guidance for the common soldiers and their leaders. It is not an oath per se and was never intended to be. 
              
              All soldiers already have sworn an oath upon enlistment and reaffirmed it every year on 1st July or other special functions.
              
              We, members of the Singapore Armed Forces, do solemnly and sincerely pledge that we will always bear true faith and allegiance to the President and the Republic of Singapore. We will always support and defend the Constitution. We will preserve and protect the honour and independence of our country with our lives.
              
              Everyone with a common sense understands that when we protect our Nation, it is equivalent to protecting our homes and our way of life.Arguing over the wording is quite redundant really when it doesn't change this fact.

              <p>True, that the SAF oath is not sworn to any political party, but due to the dominance of the ruling party, the saf may as well be indirectly sworn to the ruling party.</p>
              <p>as a soldier, true, we sworn our allegiance to the country, but who's the one who will actually issue any orders for us to carry out? the ruling party.</p>

              <p>I believe that it is this confusion and uncertainty which causes the Thai police to side with the pro-thaksin protesters in their taking over of the airport.</p>

              <p>There should be no question.</p>
              <p>A) Ruling parties or opposition parties, once the election is over, the one with the majority vote wins, meaning they have the mandate of the People to rule. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">They are no longer 'ruling party' or 'opposition' parties.</span></p>
              <p>They are Singaporeans and the Government of Singapore, the sole and rightful administrators of the country and the voice of the people represented in the PM by the cabinet. It is the duty of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">every</span> citizen to rally and unite behind the people's choice.</p>
              <p>The only 'ruling parties' or 'opposition parties' are the legislatives, who have no power of authority to administer saved for the hearing of citizen's views, debate of laws and policies, to be approve by the cabinet.</p>
              <p>B.) In the event of civil crisis, MAKE DAMN SURE IT WILL NOT EXISTS. So choose your MPs wisely. Such a situation MUST NEVER, NEVER occur. The pitting of brother against brother, families against families, citizens against citizens, must not happen no matter how divided we become on issues. We still have the freedom to vote, to determine a mandate.</p>
              <p>But some stubborn ones will ask, what if. The truth is that it had never happened before, no armed soldiers were used to roam the streets saved for the manhunt for a dangerous terrorist, for the past 44 years, despite what many claimed had been authoritarian rule. But what if it happen one day?  ( READ POINT B. AGAIN)</p>
              <p>The day, IF it happens, will be that the elected MP and his grassroot organisation had failed in his duty either to listen to his constituents or explain a govt policy effectively to the people, which is no excuse for our county is only small and comms is never an issue.</p>
              <p>While it may not be possible to please EVERYONE, at least the majority will accept policies if effectively put across reasonably and logically with compassion if needed. It will only be a minority who may not be pleased, but then it is only a minority,  and that's the job of the police (home affairs) to maintain order, not soldiers whose sole duty is defence. </p>
              <p>Therefore, our oath is to the military defence our country, which is made up of our People, everyone and everything IN Singapore.</p>

                              SAF.</p>
              <p>True, that the SAF oath is not sworn to any political party, but
                              due to the dominance of the ruling party, the saf may as well be
                              indirectly sworn to the ruling party.</p>
              <p>as a soldier, true, we sworn our allegiance to the country, but
                              who's the one who will actually issue any orders for us to carry
                              out? the ruling party.</p>
              <p>so i would like to pose a qsn here. so what happen if singapore
                              was to one day end up like thailand, where the people cannot seems
                              to arrive at a compromise regarding their choice of leaders? will
                              we still obey the orders of an unpopular (albeit legal) government,
                              or would you go with the wishes of the masses.</p>
              <p>I believe that it is this confusion and uncertainty which causes
                              the Thai police to side with the pro-thaksin protesters in their
                              taking over of the airport.</p>

              <p>The Singapore president is not and CANNOT be a member of ANY political party, let alone the ruling one. President position in Singapore, any regular serviceman in the armed forces and yes this includes the army, and ALL civil servants including the top non-political position in ALL THE MINISTRIES- which is the Permanent Secretary have to be non-partisan. They cannot belong to any political party. (this is not the US where the president is their version of our PM, and thus Obama belongs to a political party).</p>
              <p>Military officers who seek allegiance with any political party ie seek political office must leave the SAF before doing so, or did so after they retired from SAF. That is why PM Lee, left the SAF before he sought political office.</p>
              <p>Your sentence that the defence minister aka Teo Chee Hean belonging to a political party is the dumbest thing I ever heard. Obviously....He is a minister. ALL ministers belong to a political party. ALL ministers are MPs. MP means politician. Got political office except NMPs. MPs are the guys who listen to the grouses of the heartlanders every week and canvas for people's votes. They are partisan. All ministers are partisan to a party. Not all MPs are ministers. Most are not. ALL MPs belong to a party they pledge allegiance to. ALL ministers are MPs.</p>
              <p>The Permanent Secretary is right one level below minister. Perm Sec is the biggest non-political boss of every ministry and he serves whichever minister of the party that wins the election. This means if tom SDP wins the election, Peter Ho, Head of Civil Service who is the boss of all the perm secs will work for the SDP elected PM.</p>
              <p>And each ministry's Perm Sec will work for the new minister elected by SDP. All Administrative Officers, a group of top civil servants which includes Permanent Secretaries must be and are non-partisan.</p>
              <p>It's clear to everyone you're not very educated. If you had gone to JC, you must have failed your GP.</p>
