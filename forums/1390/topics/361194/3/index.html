              <p>To be in a singaporean political party, have to be singaporean
              right? And for being a singaporean, for almost all guys, excluding
              disabled, gays, mentally challenged, deferred, have all recited the
              SAF oath.(not really linked)</p>

              <p>Are you a retard? You went to Chao Yang?</p>
              <p>Even if everyone in every political party here has recited the SAF oath in their NS days, it doesn't mean when SAF soldiers recite it, they're reciting to all those parties. Are you an idiot? Why are you born so stupid?</p>
              <p>If out of 1625363 Singaporeans who ever took the Cambridge O level paper, 7 of them went to form the JI and became JI regional heads. So it means the rest of the Singaporeans who ever took it before and subsequently took it after, were actually connected to the JI? Did your parents disown you cos you are a retard?</p>

              <p>There should be no question.</p>
              <p>A) Ruling parties or opposition parties, once the election is
              over, the one with the majority vote wins, meaning they have the
              mandate of the People to rule. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">They are no longer 'ruling party' or
              'opposition' parties.</span></p>
              <p>They are Singaporeans and the Government of Singapore, the sole
              and rightful administrators of the country and the voice of the
              people represented in the PM by the cabinet. It is the duty of
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">every</span> citizen to
              rally and unite behind the people's choice.</p>
              <p>The only 'ruling parties' or 'opposition parties' are the
              legislatives, who have no power of authority to administer
              saved for the hearing of citizen's views, debate of laws and
              policies, to be approve by the cabinet.</p>
              <p>B.) In the event of civil crisis, MAKE DAMN SURE IT WILL NOT
              EXISTS. So choose your MPs wisely. Such a situation MUST NEVER,
              NEVER occur. The pitting of brother against brother, families
              against families, citizens against citizens, must not happen no
              matter how divided we become on issues. We still have the freedom
              to vote, to determine a mandate.</p>
              <p>But some stubborn ones will ask, what if. The truth is that it
              had never happened before, no armed soldiers were used to roam
              the streets saved for the manhunt for a
              dangerous terrorist, for the past 44 years, despite what
              many claimed had been authoritarian rule. But what if
              it happen one day?  ( READ POINT B. AGAIN)</p>
              <p>The day, IF it happens, will be that the elected MP and his
              grassroot organisation had failed in his duty either to listen
              to his constituents or explain a govt policy effectively to the
              people, which is no excuse for our county is only small
              and comms is never an issue.</p>
              <p>While it may not be possible to please EVERYONE, at least the
              majority will accept policies if effectively put across reasonably
              and logically with compassion if needed. It will only be a minority
              who may not be pleased, but then it is only a
              minority,  and that's the job of the police (home
              affairs) to maintain order, not soldiers whose sole duty is
              defence. </p>
              <p>Therefore, our oath is to the military
              defence our country, which is made up of our People,
              everyone and everything IN Singapore.</p>
