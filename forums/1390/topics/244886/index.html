This initiative reflects the increased professional and technical expertise required by the 3rd Generation SAF and enhances the attractiveness of a career in the Warrant Officer and Specialist corps. Minister Teo was speaking at the commissioning of the new Specialist and Warrant Officer Institute (SWI) at Pasir Laba Camp today.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Wow... Now there's sponsorship for specs too!</div>

In the Army, esp for WOSPEC one must be a high flyer to stay on long till retirement at 55, to enjoy the salary and subsequent pay out.<br><br>Like i've discussed it previous threads, with the 'in' thing of buying time in the SAF... are the people being recruited as regulars, be it Officers or Specs less committed and dedicated? Are we perhaps seeing fundamental cracks in the middle management of the force?</div>
