              Hi guys...
              
              During the CMPB medical check up, i did not declare that I have fracture my elbow before. Because I did not learn about this as the incident was during pri 1-2. I have been into an operation theater before. After completing my BMT, i was posted to SCS and had just graduated from my foundation term. 
              
              During my foundation term, i got gold for my IPPT and during that process I injured my elbow. I thought it was normal muscle ache and did not care about it and continued with training. But in recent times, when field camp(i was matador holder) the pain can get so bad that I could not sleep at night. I did not sound off until during the near the end of my course. I was doing IOC (the new SOC) and while doing low rope, i injured my elbow and at that night the pain was so bad the next morning i tired to hold the cup to get a sip of drink, and i dropped the cup. My friends were damn shocked and asked me what happened. 
              
              I finally decided to go to the MO and was given a specialist appointment at Alexandra hospital. The day arrived and i went for the medical appointment. This was what happened
              
              Specialist: Are you NSF?
              Me: Yes
              Specialist: Sit down. Where pain?
              Me: My left elbow hurts and sometimes at night the pain is so bad I cant sleep.
              Specialist: *plays around with my elbow*
              Me: I used to fractured my elbow before and im left master hand.. Im afraid that this pain...
              Specialist: Go do xray.
              After Xray is done.....
              Specialist: Xray shows no sign of dislocate or fracture. You are fine. 
              
              And he goes on to write a memo stating "Xray shows no sign of dislocate or fracture. Please do the Necessary." 
              
              When I wanted to continue to describe the pain he chased me out of the room and ask me to book a physio appointment. 
              
              I went back to camp and wanting to book a review at the medical center. But the medic told me it wasnt possible because we are passing out in 3 days time. All the slots are after we pass out. He advised me to come back if i am posted to Profession term, if not pass the memo to my new unit MO. So i went back to COY line and my PWO asked me if i can participate in UO. I told him my elbow still hurts and he insist I must have a status. If not who cover my backside? So I went back to the MO and reported sick. I was about to tell him my problems and he just asked how many days status I need. At the end of the day he gave me 5 days excuse upper limb till the graduation march. 
              
              I went for a private specialist and he diagnosis me with golfer's elbow. But everybody thinks I'm trying to chao keng... So here I am now.. Can anybody please advise me the next course of action?

              <p>during weekend - when you book out. Go to hospital A&amp;E - report your elbow suddenly every pain !!! they can do instant x-ray. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Frankly if the xray there show something - then they can write a note to your MO - which will start things rolling.  If nothing then - you bones may be fine - you may need to seek chinese doctors who specialised in injuries to treat you.</p>

              <p>Agreed.</p>
              <p>Weekend bookout, go look for specialists. Remember to bring  your parents too.</p>
              <p>For me, I dont feel good if that doctor talk to me like that.</p>
              <p>At least have yr parent around, the doctor will dare not say this kind of sentences.</p>

              <p>What you are having is an inflammated tendon, there is nothing much an orthopedic specialist can do, other then giving you painkillers to bring the inflammation down and physio to strength the tendon back.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333;">"Xray shows no sign of dislocate or fracture. Please do the Necessary". It just means that. Dont think too much about this. Doctors are too busy with their work, they dont have time to put emotion in it. </span></p>
              <p>You might not get downgraded for this. It like a sprained ankle, except that is not on the ankle but elbow. </p>
              <p>If chronic pain persists you should see a specialist again, do an MRI to check for tore tendon. Physio and pain killers. </p>
              <p>You should deeply regret that you have not declared the injury before. Cose my friend is pes E because he declare leg fracture before CMPB. You might get Pes C if it is you master hand, but now is all too late. Too late... </p>
