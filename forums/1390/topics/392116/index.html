              <p>Hey guys, i have flat feet which is giving me problems when i stand or march esp during runs in boots. The archs are exceptionally pain. The MO first examined and said that i did not appear to have flat feet then when i went for X Ray he said i had slight flat feet and referred me to physio and gave recommendation for inosles.</p>
              <p>However, the physio date is like 1 and a half months for now and the medicine he gave me were painkillers. He did not refer me to a specialist as he said there was no need to. Both my feet are pain esp in high kneel squatting etc positions.</p>
              <p>Would like to know if there is any way i can get to a speciailist or to excuse myself from such activities.</p>

              <p>Get a memo from an external specialist, and give it to your MO. Try to avoid the same MO who checked up on you previously if possible.</p>

              <p>I got the same MO twice in a row already. The first time he gave me medicine which did not help my flat feet at all. He did not seem interested in my condition and just appeared to be in a rush to read his soccer website -.-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>plus i am in enhanced batch and the OC does not allow me to go out to external speciailists on weekdays. I do not want to take painkillers lest i become dependent on them</p>

              <p>Go get yourself an Orthopedic referral from the Polyclinic during weekend. Ask him and tell him about your foot pain. He will surely send you for xray to check for fractures.</p>
              <p>Regarding your OC not allowing you to go for specialist appointment on weekdays, you can get your parents to phone and have a "nice chat" with your OC. They cannot disallow you to go for medical appointment. </p>
