IPT is conducted <span style="color: red;">only at Bedok and Khatib Fitness and Conditioning Centres </span>(FCC).<br><br>[*]<span style="color: blue;"><strong>IPT Program Structure</strong></span><br>IPT is a <span style="color: red;">5-week training program</span>. It provides differentiated training packages for individual NSmen to overcome their weak areas in physical fitness. NSmen would be coached on the training methodology to improve their performance in IPPT as well as lectures in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. <span style="color: red;">It is conducted twice a week, each session being 3 hours in duration.</span><br><br>[*]<span style="color: blue;"><strong>IPT Schedules</strong></span><br>There are 3 new IPT schedules available every 5 weeks at the 2 FCCs for NSmen to select from. The schedules are differentiated by the training sessions timing. This will enable NSmen to choose a time slot and location to suit their personal and work commitments. NSmen will remain in their selected schedule at the chosen FCC for the whole duration of his IPT.<br><br>[*]<span style="color: blue;"><strong>Schedule Sessions  </strong></span><br>Timing of Sessions (hours)<br>Monday, Wednesday 1900-2200<br>Monday, 1900-2200, Saturday 1630-1930<br>Tuesday, Thursday 1900-2200<br><br>[*]<span style="color: blue;"><strong>Booking System</strong></span><br><br>NSmen would be able to book an IPT slot, using the same booking system used for booking non-ICT IPPT slots. They will have the option to book IPT schedules within 9 months of their current IPPT window. This would enable NSmen who could not pass their IPPT at the end of IPT to continue their own training, applying the training methodology to improve on their performance and thus maximizing the knowledge gained during the IPT.<br><br>[*]<span style="color: blue;"><strong>IPT Eligibility</strong></span><br><br>NSmen who are eligible to book for their non-ICT IPPT in the NS IPPT Booking System would also be eligible for IPT. <span style="color: red;">Those who did not passed their IPPT for their previous IPPT window would have to attend RT before they could subscribe for IPT.</span><br><br>NSmen aged 35 years and above MUST be medically screened for IPPT before he can booked for IPT. This would enable the NSman to attempt his IPPT during the IPT.<br><br>[*]<strong><span style="color: blue;">NS Liability and Pay</span></strong><br><br>Participation in IPT is strictly voluntary. NSmen on IPT would not be paid Service or Make-up Pay, except for the 8th session which is an IPPT. Attendance at the IPT would also NOT count towards the NSman annual NS of 40 days except for the 8th session (IPPT). However, all IPT sessions attended would be recorded in the NSman Training History as a voluntary training activity so that the NSman?s participation in IPT is duly acknowledged.<br><br>[*]<strong><span style="color: blue;">Incentives</span></strong><br><br>NSmen who passed their IPPT during IPT will be released immediately from the IPT and their result would be recorded as their annual requirement for the current IPPT window. They will also be eligible for IPPT Monetary Awards if they achieved the corresponding standards. <span style="color: red;">Those who completed at least 8 IPT Sessions (including the IPPT at the 8th session) would be exempted from RT if they could not pass their IPPT at the end of their IPPT window. </span></div>

It is part of the Singapore Armed Forces' (SAF) continued efforts to improve the physical fitness of NSmen. The <span style="color: red;">IPT consists of ten sessions, lasting three hours each, spread over five weeks.</span> NSmen can take their IPPT during the eighth session. If they pass the test, they will qualify for the IPPT Monetary Award pegged to the results that they achieve.<br><br>Fitness specialists will be on hand to impart the proper training techniques to improve performance on each of the IPPT stations. The IPT training programmes have also been differentiated to address the particular areas where NSmen may need help in improving their levels of physical fitness. Participants can also attend talks on maintaining a healthy lifestyle and receive advice on proper diet and nutrition.<br><br>The IPT will be recorded as a voluntary training activity and <span style="color: red;">NSmen who successfully complete the programme will be exempted from attending Remedial Training.</span> The SAF believes that participation in the voluntary IPT is a sign of the NSmen's personal commitment to improving their fitness levels and the programme will equip them with the proper techniques so that they can train effectively on their own to pass the IPPT.</div>
