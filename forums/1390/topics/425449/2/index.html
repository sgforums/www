              <p>it's all in the name of technical specialisation expertise. and only certain vocations can be in that category. most scholars when they pen their signature on the contract, they have to stick with the voc all the way [even if the job is not in line with the voc for eg psychologist] with certain exceptions.</p>
              <p>so alize, it isnt abt impressiveness or being forced but rather the choice of vocation and area of study. nothing is really all "slack" in this world. for eg in RSAF, the head of air logs is alrdy the highest lvl for an engineer if going strictly by vocation without assuming other command appts in which many of them alrdy go to pilots.</p>

              <p>Fully agree with what you said but I didn't say being an ME was slack (amanda said it) or a forced choice.</p>
              <p>I'm aware one is almost always bound to the career scheme you choose. Therefore a scholar would always choose to enter the command track (possible regardless of field of study) instead of the ME track if he can help it, leading to BG-level scholars who would otherwise not reach that rank. (which might open more top posts to able people other than top scholars)</p>
              <p>What is not clearly explained by Mindef are:</p>
              <p>the command authority given to MEs. Are they like US E-4 Specialists, with no authority except within their appointment?</p>
              <p>whether the scheme will reduce or remove the opportunity to make Spec-to-Officer conversions (eg MWO-to-MAJ promotions) like in the past, conversions to ME being encouraged instead.</p>

              <p>say, for CO itself, operations/frontline units usually have the officer from the related vocation that is in line with what the unit primarily does to take the place in their unit. and of course for logistics/ammo/maintenance units, that role is mostly held by a senior expert who's an engineer.</p>
              <p>however there are certain appointments that fit all those eligible regardless of vocation also, for example those dealing with training/manpower/operations</p>
