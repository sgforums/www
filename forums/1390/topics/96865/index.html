And the fact that this article is still up there indicates that it is to foment discontent against the established authorities.<br><br><strong>OR</strong><br><br>b)   The report is genuine but the investigation had found the content to be fallacious.

Stumbled on the followup from the same website:<br><br>Mindef to act against staff who punished soldier<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Straits Times Feb 4, 1999<br>By CHONG CHEE KIN<br><br>Mindef investigated after a corporal complained over the Internet that he was ill-treated during his training<br><br>Read the soldier's chilling report<br><br>THE Ministry of Defence is taking disciplinary action against some of its instructors after investigating complaints of ill-treatment made over the Internet by a soldier.<br><br>Corporal Benjamin Lou, 24, claimed in a posting on the Internet newsgroup soc.culture.singapore that he was ill-treated by instructors during his basic military training (BMT) three years ago.<br><br>In the posting, which first appeared on Jan 24, Cpl Lou made numerous detailed allegations. [Singapore Window's source obtained the report in October 1998.]<br><br>Among other things, he claimed that he was assaulted, made to do excessive exercise and forced to go without sleep for days on end.<br><br>It is understood that before he enlisted, he had signed a six-year contract to serve the Singapore Armed Forces as a commando.<br><br>Cpl Lou, who is still with the SAF, said that he complained about the alleged ill-treatment only late last year.<br><br>His posting on the Internet newsgroup remained there for several days.<br><br>Responding to questions from the Straits Times, a Mindef spokesman said yesterday that it had investigated Cpl Lou's allegations.<br><br>"The investigation established that there were instances of unauthorised punishment meted out to him by his instructors," the spokesman said.<br><br>But he added: "However, our investigations also showed that some of the allegations, such as the claim that he was deprived of sleep for 15 days, could not be substantiated."<br><br>Stressing that Mindef took all such complaints seriously, the spokesman said: "We do not condone the actions of the instructors who meted out the unauthorised punishment as they are clearly against our rules and regulations.<br><br>"Appropriate disciplinary actions are being taken."<br><br>He also said that the ministry first came to know about Cpl Lou's complaints in November last year and that a thorough investigation had followed.<br><br>He added: "The investigations took some time because the alleged incidents happened about three years ago and most of the witnesses had already left the SAF."<br><br>Published in the Straits Times.

Don't tell me you mums give you a canon and 2 marbles for nothing??<br><br></div></blockquote>You need to make a distinction between accountability and demoralising.Making the CDOs accountable for an act of criminal negligence and intended grevious bodily harm is different from an officer scolding a instructor in front of the latter's recruits.A profesional force will understand what is accountabily and openness.A sub-standard army will not.If we are the latter, then God bless us indeeed.Anyway, your mother gave you a cannon and two marbles but she would expect it to be used , not be burnt early and go up in smoke.Capische?</div>
