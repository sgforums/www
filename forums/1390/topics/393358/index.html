"I think it is a very good initiative to bring IPPT training facilities to the community, not just for NSmen, but also for the whole community, to allow them the opportunity to exercise and keep fit within the neighbourhood."<br><br>Another nine other fitness corners located in five Town Councils, namely, Tanjong Pagar, Tampines, Bishan-Toa Payoh, Sembawang and West Coast will be ready in the next few months. <br><br>These selected corners, once enhanced with all four static IPPT stations as well as the demarcated 2.4km route, will make it more convenient for NSmen to keep fit and train for their annual Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT).<br><br>The IPPT-In-Your-Community initiative is one of the recommendations, put forth by the Fifth Committee to Recognise the Contribution of Operationally Ready National Servicemen to Total Defence or <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #5d5ebc;" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/record">RECORD V</a> in September 2009.<br><br>All the designated fitness corners earmarked in this project, fit the criteria set by the "Fitness Corner for NSmen" committee, made up of 10 volunteer NSmen. </span></p>

Another three static stations, which include standing board jump, chin-up bar and sit-up bench have been added. An enhanced running route with specific markers on the route will also be available so that NSmen can practice their 2.4km runs using this route. <br><br>For 28-year-old NSman, Corporal (CPL) Poh Yong Cheng, the 2.4km running track will be the most helpful. <br><br>"There are markings along the way so I will know the distance I've covered and monitor my training progress. I think this facility is great because it brings together all the five IPPT stations, for instance, the standing broad jump, shuttle run and sit-up stations. These are some of the workout stations that you don't find at usual workout places like stadiums," he said. <br><br>"And it's also near my neighbourhood so it's easy to come here to train for my IPPT."<br><br>For others like 3rd Sergeant (3SG) (NS) Muhammad Fadly Bin Asis, 32, who plays football regularly as part of his workout, he hopes this new initiative can help him improve his IPPT standard. <br><br>"With my current workout routine, I can get a Silver [award], but maybe with this new facility, I probably can get my Gold [award] again, what I used to get back in those days when I was with the Guards," he told cyberpioneer.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: normal; font-size: 12px; border-collapse: collapse;">The IPPT-In-Your-Community project, saw all five Town Councils working together with the Housing Development Board (HDB). One of them, Sembawang Town Council, has tentatively identified two sites in the precinct to be enhanced. They are located at near Nee Soon Community Park at Block 755 Yishun Street and at Block 114 Yishun Ring Road. <br><br>3SG (NS) Tian Zhiyuan, a representative from the Sembawang Town Council who does his reservist with an infantry unit, thinks that the IPPT-in-your-Community project is a good initiative because it helps to reduce the amount of time spent on travelling. <br><br>"These new amenities will encourage more NSmen who were previously reluctant to travel far for a workout, to start utilising these nearby IPPT-fitted fitness corners to keep fit and train for their IPPT. I will definitely be checking it out when it is built."<br><br>The 10 fitness corners, once enhanced as part of the "IPPT-In-Your-Community" project, will serve at least 3,000 NSmen living nearby in the selected areas.</span></p>
