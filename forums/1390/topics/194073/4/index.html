CA and SUS in the main building, where u go for medical and collect equipments.<br><br>only CD are drilled in sandbag regime. CA and SUS hardly gets to come out that it can get very distressing.<br><br>the diet is supposed to be low in energy, so that you only have wat u need for the day. tat said, CD's get better meals but have to do regime. CA and SUS eat porridge.<br><br>and the sandbag regime thingy, nowadays is new army, so they won't have to torture u until u report to MO. nowadays they have to adhere to a time period. regimes are only done once everyday on monday to fridays, if morning will be 3 hours, afternoon will be 1 hour, no regime and no make-up in event of bad weather. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>there are a lot more. who else have been to DB recently, please own up.<br><br>i see if anyone can recognise these stuff:<br>1. yellow lines and numbering off<br>2. the MO drill and roll call/strip cell<br>3.

There is no moral issue and indeed we have an obligation to treat prisoners, say,  following caning or any other punishments. For death sentences, the prison MO certifies death. He cannot and is not expected to execute anyone.<br><br>In the US, there is an issue with their dealth sentence by lethal injection, because the doctor sets the drip for the lethal coc_ktail.<br><br>So in summary, the MO cannot refuse a legal order to attend to a prisoner who collapsed during punsihment.

The SAF will not have to disrupt NS for medical students in that case, a policy that has been criticized. Apart from the increased costs of such a policy, these GPs are not bound by the manning needs of the army. The only solution left is to make them sign on with the army as well, but there has been few takers.<br><br>MOs are not required to 'obey' the CO is he wants a lower sick rate. In fact, any CO who makes such a demand can and will be reported to higher authorities. But the MO is also aware that a high sick rate just prior to a major exercise will place a greater burden on the other soldiers, lower manning numbers and a greater risk of service injuries.<br><br>Those who are sick need to be properly treated and given appropriate rest. But why should the report sick rate predictably rise before an exercise and drop to almost nil before public holidays? MOs are not daft. We know there are kengsters out there as well and they must not be allowed to succeed. Btw, we do have enough cards up our sleeves (especially for the lao jiao MOs) to catch the kengsters  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
