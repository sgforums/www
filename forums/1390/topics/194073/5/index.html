            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Dogtor:</div><div class="quote_body">Agreed.<br><br>1. Should we be a signatory? pros and cons?<br><br>2. Where does the physician stand (who does not condone such actions) with regards to statutory duties or judicial orders?<br><br>- what happens to the Ministry of Health M.O. (bonded) asked to serve in the prison service for such? should they feel it is unethical to participate in certifying prisoners for punishment?<br><br>- Are they at risk of judicial penalties for refusal, yet are bonded and thus unable to resign their office?<br><br>- What if this is  an undesirable posting and junior docs have to do at least one undesirable posting (MOH directive)?<br><br>You are a wise mushroom.<br></div></blockquote>1. The biggest impact on us if we signed the international conventions mentioned earlier is that we will lose the right to impose the death sentence and caning.<br><br>It is true that between imprisonment and caning, the latter is a  greater deterrence. Convicts have been known to ask if they can exchange caning for a longer sentence. In fact, there was an occasion when the ex-CJ,   feeling that a more severe sentence was needed, reduced a convict's prison sentence and added caning instead.<br><br>Following a series of brutal murder cases including the Huang Na case, many Singaporeans felt the death penalty should stay. There are also many who support the death penalty for drug trafficking offences. Given its proximity to the golden triangle and a big drug market down south in Australia, Singapore would not want to be the first nation to abolish the death sentence for drug offences when all other countries along this route have retained it.<br><br>For these reasons, I seriously doubt that Singapore would sign these conventions, particularly as many of our neighboring nations have not signed them either.<br><br>2. The duty of a physician with regard to statutory obligations and judicial orders is absolute. For example, you have to break confidentiality to report an infectious disease, for example; and you cannot refuse to answer a judge's question even if it means breaking patient confidentiality.<br><br>As for the MO who is posted to the prison, you have a contractual obligation to your employer who has posted you there. The prison has no power over you in this respect, but you may be breaking your contract with MOH if you refuse to carry out a legitimate official duty as laid out in your contract. If the terms of your employment spells out your ethical objections to various procedures and yet the MOH employs you, you are not liable. If it does not (I suspect many doctors don't even read their contracts), then you have to fight it out in court as to whether the duties required of you by your employer are unreasonable because they contravene your right to practise your religion, as provided for by law, or some other such reasons.<br><br>For example, a Muslim lab technician may refuse to handle a pig or a dog used in research experiments even though the hospital defines it as part of his official duties, if he can prove that those duties are unreasonable as they directly conflict with the practice of his religion.<br><br>There is a big difference between the two forms of obligations. If you refuse to answer the court as to whether your patient has a venereal disease, you can be thrown into jail. If you refuse to certify prisoners fit prior to caning, the worst that can happen is that you will lose your job and have to pay back the bond.<br><br>In practice, it can be sorted out administratively. If you do not want to be posted to the prison, perhaps you can choose an even more undesirable posting...say, in the mortuary instead.<br></div>
