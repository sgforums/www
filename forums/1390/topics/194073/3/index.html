            <div class='col-md body'>its quite hard to for detainees to mutiny and rebel... since we control their regime, their rest and even their food... its not to their best interest to rebel really. Besides, whilst the punishments are harsh, we're not that sadistic until we drive them to their graves...it really defeats the whole point..plus that means giving us more work to do.<br><br>You will be amazed at what the body can do when the mind is pushed to the limit. We got doctors and psychologists to take care of their mental strain and push them further than they expect.<br><br>That's why those in DB for serious offenses SUS are called Singapore Universal Soldiers for a reason- they are physically damn fit, and mentally trained to endure and enjoy hardship and pain.<br><br>Besides, if there really is a mutiny, they only got their bare hands. We got batons, stun guns, and even live ammo if all hell breaks loose. And that's just the offensive weapons. Consider our defensive armaments, the surrounding, the structure, and the law, there is no way they can rebel.<br></div>

Refuse to examine a detainee who collapsed during training?<br><br>The doctor does not administer the punishment, just as the prison doctor is not required to execute any prisoners on death row. There is no moral issue and indeed we have an obligation to treat prisoners, say,  following caning or any other punishments. For death sentences, the prison MO certifies death. He cannot and is not expected to execute anyone.<br><br>In the US, there is an issue with their dealth sentence by lethal injection, because the doctor sets the drip for the lethal coc_ktail.<br><br>So in summary, the MO cannot refuse a legal order to attend to a prisoner who collapsed during punsihment. As for certifying someone fit for those snadbag marches, haven't you done FFI for detainees bound for DB?<br><br></div>
