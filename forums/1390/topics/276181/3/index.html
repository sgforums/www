Mara, triathlon is a very risky sport. I believe a average person (even if he does train for it) shouldnt even be running competitvely in such a event. For leisure run yes but competitive no.<br><br>N u know if SAF organise such a event, many regulars, nsfs are obliged, encoruaged and even forced to join to show face. Many of these are not well trained in such a event. Yes they can clock gold for 2.4km but over 21km is no joke. I beleive there are alot of fainting at finishing point n thats why there is alot of MO n senior medics.<br><br>IMO, for such a high risk event, they should ask SCDF to sent some staff to standby not just MO, medics<br><br></div>
