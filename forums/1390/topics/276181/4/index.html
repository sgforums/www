Its really sad and scary to think that people can drop dead just like that. Makes u really wanna treasure life even more.</div></blockquote>this is interesting, remember there is also a case of someone about 1-2 years back, where the person crossed/almost cross the finishing line and then died?<br>That person also has a history of long distance running.<br>I remember replying to the thread as well. I think the factors to death are the following:<br><br>1). Someone who has ran before marathons, and am confident. But they have less than 4 years continuous training on the marathons<br>2). They passed on/collapse at the finishing line ==&gt; they tried to overwork their heart by running faster to get a better timing.<br>3). On point 2, it might be a wrong technique that runners have used to breathe during the last couple hundreds of meters to get better timing. This could be due to improper guidance of training ==&gt; since most runners arent professional, but amateurs, who have developed their own technique of running and sprinting at the last meters.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

Even if no pulse is detected, the heart might still be beating, just that the rhythm is unable to pump blood to a point where the pulse can be felt.<br><br>Defibs will not have any effect if the heart has completely stopped. A lot of people have a wrong understanding about defibrillation, no thanks to the movies.<br><br>Defibs are used for getting the heart rhythm from a irregular rhythm back to a regular rhythm. Defib in itself cannot "restart" a heart that has stopped completely.<br><br>Regarding the last question, there are many answers as to why defib is not given. If the Defib on scene is an AED, chances are that the AED will not allow the shock as the rhythm is non-shockable, in this case no heartbeat at all. If a manual defib is on scene, i.e. Lifepak12, the paramedic will analyse the ECG and deem that defib will not be of use due to the rhythm.<br><br>The SAF uses the AED on medical cover, only SCDF will bring out a manual defib to location.</div>
