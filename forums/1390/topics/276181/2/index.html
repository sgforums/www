ST reported he finished the 21 km in (just) 90 minutes, before collapsing. TODAY also said he'd finished 23rd out of 1,369 participants in a 10 km run last month.<br><br>The medics did their best this time around, so let's not speculate further. If it's attributed to heart failure (ala Thaddeus Cheong), I'm not sure any prior FFI could've sussed out the vulnerability either. Point is, his body was already conditioned to being under severe physical stress until now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the thing that bothers me is that when some1 dies .. the media will always focus their reports on how "efficient" the medical assistence is .. in short they r more focus on wayanging and covering their asses as some1 died in service ..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
