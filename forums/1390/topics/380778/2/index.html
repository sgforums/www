              <p>LOL. My friend is a marathon, triathlon athlete. When he say,
              lets go for a light run, he meant a 21 km in less than 1 h 45
              mins., when he say let go for a swim, that is about 1.5 km of free
              style. He can run at least twice a day with varying distances and
              speed, having more than 2 PT sessions in a day. </p>
              <p>If you are a man in his unit, I am sure you will be tanned,
              muscular and super fit. But he understand what is sports injury so
              he know RICE therapy. He understand the rest needed for sport
              injury and time taken to recover. </p>
              <p>Can you imagine after a short warm up light 10 km run, and still
              have to 100 push up, 200 sit up and plus plus..., everyday
              ? </p>

              <p>Actually to me, as long as the spec is willing to join his men in whatever training he gives, that is not really considered tekanning. To me tekan is when he watch while everyone is doing what he instructs.</p>

              <p>VEES is good. Most of my friends went in and out safe and sounds, and it now either working or doing study in ITE or Poly. </p>
              <p>If one sign on under the VEES scheme, you will give you time to study to retake the N, O level, supporting your education, ... all the way up to poly, degree now with the NEW specialist scheme. The only price that you have to pay is the bond that you have to serve. If you are happy-go-lucky person, opt for the VEES. By the time you are 25 grad, you will be richer than everyone else.</p>

              <p>all support personnels are slackers. only guardsman,
              armor troopers, combat engineers, commandos, divers, SIR, are not
              slackers. "Slacker" is just a nickname, dont get too upset about
              it.  </p>

              <p>Actually slack is a very subjective term. All the logistics units works all year round. We don't really have a low period like the combat units where its time to mass clear leave or just slack in camp after a major exercice etc.</p>
              <p>For major exercises, all the logistics units have to work OT to support the exercise and after exercise we still have our regular work. In terms of physical exhaustion obviously we can't compare but in terms of workload, thats hard to compare cos diff vocations have diff type of 'workload'</p>
