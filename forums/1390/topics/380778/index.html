              <p>NS is always a good experience. If you really opt for early enlistment, there are still alot of possibilities as to where you'll end up in. Most likely your BMT will not be in Tekong. And speaking of promotion it depends on your IPPT and SOC; silver and pass respectively.</p>
              <p>To me I think it's an advantage(study wise) if you go in earlier. Since you're only 17, by the time you're 'free', you'll only be 19/20. From here you can have choices like either work or going back to studies. If you go in after your poly, then you'll be 22/23(17+3[poly]+2[ns]).</p>
              <p>Take time to plan if you'll be studying after you ORD. If not, it's better to study first. There's a whole lot difference when you go in with O-level and diploma.</p>

              <p>There is no more cook vocation except for navy and even that is quite rare to get.</p>
              <p>SAF, SPF or SCDF depends on ur luck.</p>
              <p>With only a O's cert, its almost confirm mono intake into combat unit with no chance of command sch. U will be together with most of the ITE, poly dropouts etc etc and promotions is base on IPPT and performance to a max limit of CFC.</p>
              <p>If u do intend to continue ur studies, i would advice u go study 1st before NS as its harder to start studying again after NS. However if u intend to go work etc after NS then there is no difference.</p>

              <p>20 - 23 points there is still many poly courses you take, keep your option and mind open. it is a fact that if u not smart enough, even if you get into the course you are going to struggle like mad, and even if you  get the poly cert, you may end up struggling in your future job. go ITE or poly..</p>
              <p>VESS for the BTC. Trouble Makers &lt;-- aren't you one of them?</p>

Appreciate it.<br><br>@ Hitman2 <br><br>I appreciate your help on the polytechnic part, but I'm not looking for advice on that. I know well after sitting the papers and can roughly gauge my mark range. From there, I've actually looked at the 2009 COP of poly already and gave it a hard thought before deciding that none of them are suited for me (Including the ones you've listed out, most of which belongs to engineering).<br><br>But just because they are not suited for me, I'm not stupid enough to throw my future away just like that. I know what I am &amp; will be doing. I believe that there is no one better than myself to make the decisions that affect my own life.<br><br>Putting that aside, I'm more concern about my NS life. 1 year &amp; 10 months/ 2 years is actually quite a long time for me. And because of that, I do not wish to spend my time there hating and cursing life in NS. I do want to make full use of my NS to get fitter, wiser and everything else.<br><br>@ Lokey<br><br>I do believe that I'm smart enough to excel. I hope I'm not sounding too proud or being too cocky, but I know the reason why I did badly for my "O" levels was only because I was lazy, academically. To simply put it, I'm more of a hands-on person.<br><br>I appreciate your concern for my future, but I'm sure no one would be stupid enough to screw up their life, and neither will I.<br><br>As for the NS part, what is the "VESS for BTC" you are referring to? I'm quite new to all these NS terms, but are you referring to VEES (Voluntary Early Enlistment Scheme)? Cause if not, I think you've mistaken me.</p></div>

              life and prospect in NS? (Only NS wise, I'm confident of my future,

              to know. I apologize if my question have already been asked before

              <p>Hi Liter, </p>
              <p>I will suggest that you continue your studies first, if you do not wish to end in a mono-intake unit. If you really think that the courses in local polytechnics are not for you, you may want to consider taking up private diploma/courses instead.  </p>
              <p>Your qualifications will not affect what vocation you will end up in, though it will affect your chances of getting into Command School. As for your fitness, unless you have a medical history of serious heat injuries and such, otherwise it will not affect your vocation if there is no change to your PES status. </p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi Liter,</p>
              <p>Mono-intake is not necessary a bad thing, but most will agree that the training there is tougher, the commanders are much more vulgar, and you will have to be able to collaborate together with people from all sorts of background.</p>
              <p>As for the vocation, it will depend on which mono-intake unit you got posted to.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>@ loki_chaos &amp; dkcx<br> <br> Thanks for taking the time to answer. Appreciate it.<br> <br> @ Hitman2<br> <br> I appreciate your help on the polytechnic part, but I'm not looking
              for advice on that. I know well after sitting the papers and can
              roughly gauge my mark range. From there, I've actually looked at
              the 2009 COP of poly already and gave it a hard thought before
              deciding that none of them are suited for me (Including the ones
              you've listed out, most of which belongs to engineering).<br> <br> But just because they are not suited for me, I'm not stupid enough
              to throw my future away just like that. I know what I am &amp; will
              be doing. I believe that there is no one better than myself to make
              the decisions that affect my own life.<br> <br> Putting that aside, I'm more concern about my NS life. 1 year &amp;
              10 months/ 2 years is actually quite a long time for me. And
              because of that, I do not wish to spend my time there hating and
              cursing life in NS. I do want to make full use of my NS to get
              fitter, wiser and everything else.<br> <br> @ Lokey<br> <br> I do believe that I'm smart enough to excel. I hope I'm not
              sounding too proud or being too cocky, but I know the reason why I
              did badly for my "O" levels was only because I was lazy,
              academically. To simply put it, I'm more of a hands-on
              person.<br> <br> I appreciate your concern for my future, but I'm sure no one would
              be stupid enough to screw up their life, and neither will I.<br> <br> As for the NS part, what is the "VESS for BTC" you are referring
              to? I'm quite new to all these NS terms, but are you referring to
              VEES (Voluntary Early Enlistment Scheme)? Cause if not, I think
              you've mistaken me.</p>

              <p>My platoonmates ? luckily my platoon is the most civilised in the whole company. Almost 90% of us are from tekong , only a 4 is from mono intake. Most of us are the tuck-chek-kia ( study freak )waiting for our uni upon ORD . But all of us get along well with the mono guys, even the most "fierce" paikia is in my platoon and he plays UNO with us LOL.</p>
              <p>TS, there are bound to be sabo-ers / troublemakers wherever you go. It comes down to your own attitude, how do you view them. I get along well with almost everyone in my company, i even went sheesha / drinking sessions with those "troublemakers". As long u aren't a total douchebag, nobody will ka jiao you. Of course there are some cb face wanting to find trouble with you, just don't be scared and ask them WTF he wants. They wouldn't dare to beat you up, if they do its straightaway go DB and jiak hong for them. Which is why most ppl will avoid fighting other than some extreme cases lol.</p>
              <p>Most importantly, if you ever landed up being with the mono intake guys, don't detest them. Learn to accomodate and get along with them. Afterall theyre the ones chionging with you till the day u guys ORD and ROD.</p>

              <p>No matter where you might go, may it be in school, in the workplace, in BMTC or in the combat unit, there will be 'good' people and there will be 'bad' people.</p>
              <p>But regardless of family background or education level, every human being will respond well to you if you treat them with friendliness, kindness and respect.</p>
              <p>So yes, keep an open mind. If you treat your platoonmates well and don't backstab or sabo them then they will treat you well as well. Meeting the occasional bastard is inevitable, but when the time comes I think you will know what to do.</p>

              <p>You should believe him, treating his men well could be true but
              his definition of well and our definition could be different :p</p>
              <p>Giving them extra PT etc could be treating them well as its to
              improve their fitness. Tekanning them could be treating them well
              to make them more resilent grow stronger etc etc :p</p>

              <p>LOL. My friend is a marathon, triathlon athlete. When he say, lets go for a light run, he meant a 21 km in less than 1 h 45 mins., when he say let go for a swim, that is about 1.5 km of free style. He can run at least twice a day with varying distances and speed, having more than 2 PT sessions in a day. </p>
              <p>If you are a man in his unit, I am sure you will be tanned, muscular and super fit. But he understand what is sports injury so he know RICE therapy. He understand the rest needed for sport injury and time taken to recover. </p>
              <p>Can you imagine after a short warm up light 10 km run, and still have to 100 push up, 200 sit up and plus plus..., everyday ? </p>
