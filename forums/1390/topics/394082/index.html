              <p>I read the article in the New Paper today... frankly I think they are overreacting...maybe they need to find other ways of selling more papers after the Jack Neo saga died down.</p>
              <p><br>Selling rifle parts is illegal, fair enough, but what's with the hoo ha over kevlar helmets and LBV? Given virtually all ORDed male Singaporeans have it at home, being able to get it at beach road isn't exactly a breach in security. It's just overreacting.</p>
              <p>If you want to go law by law, it is illegal to sell anything with "property of SAF" on it outside of E-Mart. This means that even your Number 4, Jockey Cap, field pack and what have you not should not be sold at all. </p>
              <p>As I said, overreacting. Our military security isn't compromised if Beach Road sells these non-dangerous items, and as a matter of fact it improves the efficency of our forces, not to mention Beach Road is an intergral part of the NS experience. Whoever wrote and edited the new paper article really needs some perspective.</p>
              <p>If IBA becomes standard, then expect to see it in beach road... if the body armour plates are sold then yes, that's a security problem. But frankly Beach Road is useful in the sense that I want to field-mod an extra pouch on my LBV and E-Mart is closed... they are very helpful... the article in the New Paper is quite unfair to them.</p>

              <p>in e first place, there's SBO on sale at e-mart.</p>
              <p>But I think the fuss is because the SBOs are paid for by taxpayers $$, so ppl are selling it w/ getting a profit is politcally wrong.</p>

              <p>I think this is really a non-issue as well.</p>
              <p>Fine, i agree that selling weapon parts are illegal. And thats by Law. But then people who go to the army market to buy lost gas regulators and such are sometimes not to blame for negligence. I've lost my gas regulator before, actually, both my buddy and I sleeping in the same Basha, lost ours. We recovered one within the Basha. We suspected that someone tried to steal our gas regulators as we slept. And searching by the company didn't recover the missing gas regulator. I was made to sign a 1206 and that amounted to about $70. If you go to beach road, you can get a better price. Oh and i was also given confinement together with my buddy for the loss.</p>
              <p>BUT LBV and such is ok to buy at army market i think. They don't really pose a security threat. LBVs without the armor plates are harmless enough and sometimes our kits are damaged, and waiting for a Kit exchange in my experience takes too long. Since the market provides the service for a reasonble fee, then fine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And if you want to buy military gear and such, its not so difficult. There are alot of companies selling such things online and will happily ship you a catalogue and sell you kevlar helmets, boots and whatever you need. Plus their quality is really top-notch. </p>
              <p>If i were really bent on causing trouble then it is still possible, beach road black market or not.</p>

              <p>Its is an issue of security breach, and moral breach, because foreigners can easily purchase these items from NS men selling them. I've met guys in china who say that they love the SAF #4 uniform and would like to own a few sets. Can you imagine the horrors if the enemies you fight are wearing the same uniform as you to confuse you?

              <p>One even flaunted that he could sell his helmet because he was downgraded. What the government needs to do is to flush out the crook and hack specialist doctors in the private sector facilitating this farce.

              <p>yeah I know. Its manufactured in China does not mean its easily obtained in China outside of the uniform manufacturer. And do you know how big China is?</p>
              <p>And if the Chinese or any terrorist in question wish to employ such tactics, I'm not saying its mission impossible or tough for them to do it. But do we have to be the very instrument with which they use to do it? You want to be that fool? I don't. But apparently these helmet sellers do.</p>
