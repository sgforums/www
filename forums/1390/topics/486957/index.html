              <p>Like that Roy Ngerng and Han HuiHui, TS may stand up to the growing public sentiment to petition to vote and forward your answers 'Reduce' or 'Abolish' the national sacred duty call of National Service (NS) in the Republic of Singapore to the government of the day in Singapore. Please give constructive reasons to support your answers.</p>
              <p>It is up to you. TS' vote is.. Vote YES for Abolishment! </p>

              <p>A <strong>referendum</strong> (in some countries synonymous with
              <strong>plebiscite</strong> — or a vote on a <strong>ballot
              question</strong>) is a direct <a title="Vote" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote">vote</a> in
              which an entire <a title="Constituency" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituency">electorate</a> is asked to vote on a particular
              proposal. This may result in the adoption of a new <a title="Constitution" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution">constitution</a>, a <a title="Constitutional amendment" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_amendment">constitutional amendment</a>, or a <a title="Law" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law">law</a>.</p>
              <p><em>Referendum</em> is the <a title="Gerund" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerund">gerund</a> of
              the <a title="Latin language" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language">Latin</a> verb <em>refero</em>, and has the meaning
              "bringing back" (i.e. bringing the question back to the people).
              The term <em>plebiscite</em> has a generally similar meaning in
              modern usage, and comes from the Latin <em>plebiscita</em>, which
              originally meant a decree of the <em><a title="Plebeian Council" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plebeian_Council">Concilium Plebis</a></em> (Plebeian Council), the
              popular assembly of the <a title="Roman Republic" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic">Roman
              Republic</a>. Today, a "referendum" can also often be referred to
              as a "plebiscite", but in some countries they refer to different
              types of votes, differing in their legal consequences.</p>
              <p><em>Referendums</em> and <em>referenda</em> are both commonly
              used as plurals of <em>referendum</em>. However, the use of
              <em>referenda</em> is deprecated by the <em><a title="Oxford English Dictionary" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a></em>, which advises
              that:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>Referendums</em> is logically preferable as a plural form
              meaning <em>ballots on one issue</em> (as a Latin gerund,
              referendum has no plural). The Latin plural gerundive
              <em>referenda</em>, meaning <em>things to be referred</em>,
              necessarily connotes a plurality of issues.</p>

              <p>National Service (NS) provides the security and stability essential 
                                for Singapore’s progress and prosperity. Introduced in 1967, NS is now 
                                deeply entrenched as a national institution.  It has evolved over the 
                                years to remain relevant and keep pace with the changes in our society 
                                and our threat environment.</p>
              <p>Our servicemen and Regulars are at the heart of the Singapore Armed 
                                Forces (SAF), Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the Singapore Civil 
                                Defence Force (SCDF). Since independence, NS has evolved to keep pace 
                                with the changes in our society and our threat environment. This is 
                                necessary if NS is to remain relevant.</p>
              <p>Against this backdrop, the Committee to Strengthening NS (CSNS) was 
                                set up in March 2013 to examine how the NS system can be strengthened 
                                for the future, to better serve Singapore and Singaporeans.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>To strengthen NS as the critical institution for Singapore’s continued
                                 survival and success, the CSNS recommended measures to further:</p>
              <ol> </ol>
              <p>Motivate national servicemen to give their fullest in performing their duties.</p>
              <ol> </ol>
              <p>Help national servicemen balance their duties with family, career and personal commitments.</p>
              <ol> </ol>
              <p>Strengthen support for NS from families, employers, schools, Permanent Residents, new citizens and the broader community.</p>
              <ol> </ol>
              <p>Promote recognition and appreciation of the contributions of national servicemen.</p>

              <h2 class="pageTitle">Why NS?</h2>
              <p>NS was introduced in 1967, just 2 years after Singapore’s independence to ensure the peace and stability of our nation.</p>
              <strong>We are a 'little red dot'.</strong>
              <p>With a population of 4.4 million and a land of 699 square km, 
                                                  Singapore is amongst the 20 smallest countries in the world. Singapore 
                                                  is too small to change the world. Instead, we must adapt as the world 
                                                  changes around us.</p>
              <img src="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/asiamap.jpg" alt="Storming the hideout" width="400" height="300">
              <h3>Importance of NS</h3>
              <p>We must be able to defend Singapore ourselves. No one else is 
                                                  responsible for our security and we cannot depend on others to come to 
                                                  our defence.</p>
              <p>Our defence is predicated on deterrence. That is why we invest 
                                                  heavily and consistently in building up a strong defence force to 
                                                  provide that deterrence.</p>
              <p>At the same time, we seek to be friends with as many countries 
                                                  as possible in the region and beyond. By having friends who can help us 
                                                  in our times of need, we enhance our security.</p>
              <h3>Need for NS</h3>
              <p>NS is our only viable option to building up a credible defence 
                                                  force to ensure our survival. A conscription force by law which obliges 
                                                  all eligible people to enlist would create a sizeable standing force 
                                                  ready to guarantee our security.</p>
              <p>The <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr> maintains itself in a high state of operational readiness at all times so that it is able to react swiftly to any threat.</p>
              <p>To meet the defence challenges in the 21st century, the <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr> is upgrading and transforming itself into a highly sophisticated, well-integrated fighting force.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Third Generation <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr> will be a network-centric organisation. Our forces will be 
                                                  interconnected, equipped with electronic information systems, and be 
                                                  able to fight cooperatively, and in an integrated manner, on land, in 
                                                  the air and on the sea.</p>
              <p>Within the nation itself, the <abbr title="Singapore Police Force">SPF</abbr> upholds the law and maintains order, keeping the streets safe for family and friends.</p>
              <p>And in case of any crisis or emergency, such as a major accident or a terrorist attack, the <abbr title="Singapore Civil Defence Force">SCDF</abbr> will be there to rescue and save the lives of fellow citizens.</p>
              <p>All together, the <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr>, <abbr title="Singapore Police Force">SPF</abbr> and <abbr title="Singapore Civil Defence Force">SCDF</abbr> play a key role in Singapore’s Total Defence—Military Defence, Civil 
                                                  Defence, Economic Defence, Social Defence and Psychological Defence.</p>

              <h2 class="pageTitle">Benefits of NS</h2>
              <p>NS isn’t just about serving the nation—NS benefits you as well.</p>
              <p>Firstly and obviously, your <strong>physical fitness will improve</strong>. You will be <strong>stronger and tougher</strong>. You may even <strong>look better</strong>!</p>
              <p>NS training doesn’t just toughen up your body; it <strong>toughens your mind too</strong>. You will become <strong>more confident and capable.</strong></p>
              <p>NS brings together people from all walks of life—different 
                                                  races, different religions, some rich, some poor, some educated, and 
                                                  some not so educated—you will also learn to live and work closely with 
                                                  those <strong>who are different from you</strong>.</p>
              <p>At the end of it all, you will notice changes in you. You will become <strong>more mature and independent</strong>—no longer the boy you once were.</p>
              <p><strong>You will become a man. </strong></p>
              <div id="second_col">
              <h2 class="pageTitle">Supporting your son</h2>
              <p>NS is a crucial phase in your son’s life. He will be 
              moving from a cosy home environment to one that requires him to be 
              independent, disciplined and fit.</p>
              <p>These are big changes for your son and you can do your 
              part by supporting him during NS.  The support and encouragement that 
              you provide will help make his transition from a boy to man an easy and 
              enjoyable one.</p>
              <p>Here are a few simple things you can do as a parent:</p>
              <dl class="table-display"><dt>Before NS</dt><dd><strong>Prepare</strong>: a sure way to help your son 
              is to prepare him for NS life. This can be as simple as encouraging him 
              be independent and fit. The earlier he learns these traits the better he
               will be able to cope with NS life. You can also encourage him to talk 
              to friends or family members who have been through NS to learn from 
              their NS experiences. So start early with this.</dd><dt>The first days</dt><dd><strong>Observe</strong>: The first few days or 
              initial weeks of NS are the most crucial. This is the time where your 
              son will most likely feel the impact of the change. Talking to him 
              during this period will give him encouragement to take the change in his
               stride. </dd><dt>Regular weekends</dt><dd><strong>Converse</strong>: NS has much to offer in 
              terms of rich experiences—new people, new practices, new words and new 
              friends. Be a part of your son’s NS life by having a conversation about 
              his NS experiences. This is a good opportunity for you to bond with your
               son. </dd><dd><br></dd><dd><br></dd><dd>

              <h2 class="pageTitle">NS facts</h2>
              <p>National Service (NS) was introduced in 1967, shortly after 
              Singapore’s independence, to defend our nation. Since then, 700 000 sons
               of Singapore have served their NS.</p>
              <p>Every son is important to Singapore. NS will transform our boys 
              into men, a path trodden by many sons of Singapore and more to come. 
              Your son is no different. Your son’s potential will be put to test in a 
              challenging environment that will strengthen his mental and physical 
              abilities. Living together with peers from different ethnicity and 
              backgrounds, he will also appreciate the importance of teamwork and 
              unity.</p>
              <p>NS, is the responsibility of every male Singapore citizen and 
              permanent resident (PR) when they reach the age of 18. This is 
              compulsory, governed under the Enlistment Act.</p>
              <p>If your son is a male Singapore citizen or a PR, he is liable

              <p>A <strong>referendum</strong> (in some countries synonymous with <strong>plebiscite</strong> — or a vote on a <strong>ballot question</strong>) is a direct <a class="mw-redirect" title="Vote" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote">vote</a> in which an entire <a class="mw-redirect" title="Constituency" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituency">electorate</a> is asked to vote on a particular proposal. This may result in the adoption of a new <a title="Constitution" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution">constitution</a>, a <a title="Constitutional amendment" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_amendment">constitutional amendment</a>, or a <a title="Law" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law">law</a>.</p>
              <p><em>Referendum</em> is the <a title="Gerund" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerund">gerund</a> of the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Latin language" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language">Latin</a> verb <em>refero</em>, and has the meaning "bringing back" (i.e. bringing the question back to the people). The term <em>plebiscite</em> has a generally similar meaning in modern usage, and comes from the Latin <em>plebiscita</em>, which originally meant a decree of the <em><a title="Plebeian Council" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plebeian_Council">Concilium Plebis</a></em> (Plebeian Council), the popular assembly of the <a title="Roman Republic" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic">Roman Republic</a>.
                                 Today, a "referendum" can also often be referred to as a "plebiscite", 
                                but in some countries they refer to different types of votes, differing 
                                in their legal consequences.</p>
              <p><em>Referendums</em> and <em>referenda</em> are both commonly used as plurals of <em>referendum</em>. However, the use of <em>referenda</em> is deprecated by the <em><a title="Oxford English Dictionary" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a></em>, which advises that:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>Referendums</em> is logically preferable as a plural form meaning <em>ballots on one issue</em> (as a Latin gerund, referendum has no plural). The Latin plural gerundive <em>referenda</em>, meaning <em>things to be referred</em>, necessarily connotes a plurality of issues.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In the United States, a referendum is also typically known as an <a title="Initiative" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative">initiative</a> when originating in a petition of ordinary citizens, and as a 
                                referendum only if it consists of a proposal referred to voters by the 
                                legislature. A referendum can be considered a kind of <a title="Election" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election">election</a> and is often referred to as such in the U.S. (an <em>election</em> literally means a choice). In other countries, the term <em>election</em> is often reserved for events in which elected representatives are chosen.</p>
              <p>From a political philosophical perspective, referendums are an expression of <a title="Direct democracy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy">direct democracy</a>.
                                 However, in the modern world, most referendums need to be understood as
                                 an element of systems that are predominantly representative in 
                                character. As such, they tend to be used quite selectively, covering 
                                issues such as changes in voting systems, where currently elected 
                                officials may not have the legitimacy or inclination to implement such 
                                changes.</p>
              <p>Most of the time, when the citizens of a country are invited to vote, it is for an <a title="Election" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election">election</a>.
                                 However, people can also vote in referendums. Since the end of the 
                                eighteenth century, more than five hundred national referendums were 
                                organised in the world; among them, more than three hundred were held in
                                 <a title="Voting in Switzerland" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_Switzerland">Switzerland</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> <a title="Australia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia">Australia</a> ranked second with dozens of referendums.</p>
              <p>A referendum usually offers the electorate only two choices, either 
                                to accept or reject a proposal, but this may not necessarily be the 
                                case. In <a title="Switzerland" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, for example, multiple choice referendums are common; two multiple choice referendums held in <a title="Sweden" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden">Sweden</a>, in 1957 and 1980, offered voters a choice of three options; in 1977 a referendum held in <a title="Australia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia">Australia</a> to determine a new <a title="Advance Australia Fair" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Australia_Fair">national anthem</a> was held in which voters were presented with four choices; and in 1992,
                                 New Zealand held a five-option referendum on their electoral system.</p>
              <p>A multiple choice referendum poses the question of how the result is 
                                to be determined if no single option receives the support of an absolute
                                 <a title="Majority" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority">majority</a> (more than half) of voters - a proviso for some; others regard a non-majoritarian methodology like the <a title="Borda count" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count">Borda count</a> as more inclusive and more accurate. This question can be resolved by applying <a title="Voting system" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system">voting systems</a> designed for single winner elections to a multiple-choice referendum.</p>
              <p>Swiss referendums get around this problem by offering a separate vote
                                 on each of the multiple options as well as an additional decision about
                                 which of the multiple options should be preferred. In the Swedish case,
                                 in both referendums the 'winning' option was chosen by the <a class="mw-redirect" title="First Past the Post electoral system" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Past_the_Post_electoral_system">Single Member Plurality</a> ("first past the post") system. In other words the winning option was deemed to be that supported by a <a title="Plurality (voting)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_%28voting%29">plurality</a>,
                                 rather than an absolute majority, of voters. In the 1977 Australian 
                                referendum the winner was chosen by the system of preferential <a title="Instant-runoff voting" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting">instant-runoff voting</a>.
                                 The 1992 New Zealand poll was counted under the two-round system, as 
                                were polls in Newfoundland (1949) and Guam (1982), for example.</p>
              <p>Although <a title="California" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California">California</a> does not have deliberate multiple-choice referendums in the Swiss or 
                                Swedish sense (in which only one of several counter-propositions can be 
                                victorious, and the losing proposals are wholly null and void), it does 
                                have so many yes-or-no referendums at each Election Day that the State's
                                 Constitution provides a method for resolving inadvertent conflicts when
                                 two or more inconsistent propositions are passed on the same day. This 
                                is a de facto form of <a class="mw-redirect" title="Approval Voting" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_Voting">Approval Voting</a> - i.e., the proposition with the most "yes" votes prevails over the others to the extent of any conflict.</p>
              <p>Other voting systems which could be used in multi-option referendums are the Borda and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Condorcet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet">Condorcet</a> rules.</p>

              <p><strong><br></strong><em>100 years after Norway introduced full voting rights for women,</em><strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Norwegian Parliament voted to adopt compulsory conscription for women as well as men with an overwhelming majority. </span></strong><em>– This is an historic day for equality and for our armed forces, said Norway’s Defence Minister, Mrs. Anne-Grete Stroem-Erichsen, on the day of the vote.</em><br><br><em>With the decision, seen as another major step towards equal rights, Norway will be the only European country and first peacetime NATO member practising gender-neutral conscription.</em></p>
              <p>This is important for two reasons. Male-only conscription is out of synch with the rest of society. All citizens shall have the same rights and obligations, regardless of sex.</p>
              <p>Secondly, in order to secure our operational capabilities in the future we need to recruit the best, and we need diversity. Therefore we cannot limit our recruitment to the male half of the population, says the Defence Minister.<br> <br>This does not mean that all women must serve in the military. Women will, however, be subject to conscription on an equal basis with men, making them as likely to serve in the military as people of the opposite gender.  Norway’s armed forces have an annual requirement for 8 - 10,000 conscripts out of a total of 60,000 men and women in the relevant age group. Recruitment is already high and increasing, and the number of applicants each year exceeds the needs of the Armed Forces.<br> <br>We do not adopt conscription for women because we need more soldiers, but because we need the best, no matter who they may be, says the Defence Minister, and adds: - High-tech equipment alone does not make for a modern military; we also need a modern and diverse organisation with different people, skills and perspectives.<br> <br>Norway’s goal is to have 20 percent women in its armed forces by 2020. Today the share is nine percent. Over the years, a wide range of measures have been taken to increase the number of women, but they have yielded limited results. Today, women who join the military are asked why they do it. It is my hope that the natural question to ask in the future is why they don’t want to serve, says Mrs. Stroem-Erichsen.<br><strong><br></strong>Norway on Tuesday voted to extend military service to women, saying the step was meant to expand the talent pool for its armed forces.<br><br>“We wish to extend military service to all in order to attract the most motivated and competent (recruits),” Minister of Defence Ine Eriksen Soereide told news channel TV2 after parliament adopted amendments to two laws paving the way for the change.<br><br>Most European countries have abolished conscription in favor of a professional army, but Norway has instead said it wants to ensure its military is more competent and diverse by making it “gender neutral.”<br><br>The new policy will come into effect in 2016, bringing the NATO country, which operates a weak form of mandatory military service, more in line with Israel than other European nations.<br><br>But the change, first proposed by the previous center-left government, is unlikely to affect more than a small fraction of young Norwegians.<br><br>Some 8,000 people — including about 1,000 women, all volunteers — are currently called up for military service each year out of a potential 60,000.<br><br>Norway had an official target of reaching 20 percent women in the army by 2020 under the previous administration but the right-wing government, which took power last year, has not committed to gender targets.<br><br>An historic bill was passed by the Norwegian parliament on Tuesday extending mandatory military service to women as part of a plan to promote gender equality.<br><br>Proposition 122 L is looking to amend the Military Service and Home Guard Acts to enable women to fight in the military.<br><br>The bill was passed in Oslo with a strong majority of 96 votes in favour of the proposition while just six votes were against.<br><br>Women currently make up about 13 per cent of the Norwegian Armed Forces but that ratio could be set to rise. The proposition will be put to a second reading later in the term before being written into law. According to the Norwegian government women women currently make up about 13 per cent of the Norwegian Armed Forces. If the bill is enacted,<strong><em> all medically fit women between 19 and 44
                                                    years old will have to serve at least 19 months of mandatory duty
                                                    in the armed forces. It will apply to women born in Norway from
                                                    1997 onwards, with the first service in the summer of 2016. Women
                                                    will also be subject to conscription during wartime.</em></strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://rt.com/files/news/30/22/00/00/norway3.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Defense Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide said in a statement, 'The most suitable and most motivated will join the service, regardless of gender.' <br><br>Norway is one of the most proactive countries in the world for championing women in the work force. Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Finance Minister Siv Jensen are both women.<br><br>The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development previously acknowledged that the Scandinavian country has the fourth highest proportion of female workers in the world (with 76.1 per cent) after Iceland, Sweden and Switzerland.</p>
              <p>Currently, women constitute just above 10 percent of military conscripts in Norway, serving in the armed forces on a volunteer basis. The initiative of compulsory military service for all citizens regardless of gender makes Norway the first European country to make such a decision in peacetime.<br><br>Earlier this year, the Norwegian army started testing unisex dormitories. Women soldiers shared bedrooms with male recruits at one of the country's military bases.<br><br>"Even though there is a girl in the room, it doesn't mean there are any romances. We are just soldiers," conscript Mathias Hoegevold told Ruptly news agency. <br><br>In August 2013, the country's military officials announced that men in the army would be permitted to grow their hair long and keep it in ponytails, after a male officer complained it wasn't fair that only women were allowed to have longer styles.<br><br>If enacted, the new bill for mandatory female service will include provisions for the use of gender-neutral language.<br><br>Before being written into law, the proposition must be approved in the second reading. Voting is expected to take place later this term.</p>
