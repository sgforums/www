You should have just pushed him back to the end of the line or something.<br><br>Shouting dosen't get things done.

We are indeed very "guai lan"...<br><br>actually it all depend also.. Some unit officers are very cooperative, esp those reservists units. They will follow instructions clearly and we will do thing "chop chop" for them.. Usually, they will try to expend all the ammo drawed, so that it will be faster when returning and they wont have to help to move those unused ammo back to store house, whereby carrying one box of mortar bombs, can be super shiong..<br><br>however, for certains units, they simply bo chap. They can open out all the 5.56mm boxes but used only very little. And thus we have to inspect every round and count.. and this take times.. And sometime, the cartridges returned are not enough or some items, they never return and we have to booked them... and usually when we tell them, we will book them for non-compliance, they will usually ask us to give them chance....for which, we will tell them we give them one day to go and search for it, else we will submit to our HQ.<br><br>remember got one incident that 30SCE come to draw their OPS ammo, which were kept in PLAD. Think they got timing to keep for this and they must draw out the ammo in certain timing..<br><br>I ask the CPT to go back, as there is one authorised signature missing and he was very furious and ask what is my rank and name and ask to see my officer..<br>My OC was only a 2LT and he was not around.. My 2IC was a 2WO and he tell the CPT, that what i do is correct and he also will not be able to release the ammo, without authorised signature. The CPT face, turned super black and ask his driver to go back to camp immediately to get the signature.. Dunno anything happen to him or the ammo party or not, due to this incident...<br></div>
