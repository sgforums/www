            <div class='col-md body'>So i guess you trainees have already passed out. Since someone said the final trainee phrase ends around 2nd week of Nov. So may i know do you guys do shift work now? Like RPs who work one day get next day off. Or is it same thing like when you were trainees only can come back on weekends? Btw it seems like you guys not need to book back today sunday night, when will you guys book in?<br><br>Thanks for replying</div>

Ok usually after a course or any exercises, your PC may give off for gd performance and so called rest period. Other cases are they don't want you to store too much leave and off, then you will be forced to clear. e.g a 3 day block leave consist of 2 day off and 1 day leave. Leave will be deducted and off is a give away depending how gd is ur PC and OC. Else you have to earn your off by getting ippt silver or SOC pass.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oic, so is this block leave thing just given to a few individuals or to the entire company? Or do you think the whole unit got it?I find it weird to just give lets say off to some ppl who pass soc and then others cannot get it. But okay, i'm not really sure anyway. But seems like no 30 SCE ppl who are currently serving say anything.</div>

But most of the time platoon by platoon will be scheduled to take turn to go for block leave. I used to be from PLANT coy and that is how we go about it. When you go block leave, it is deducted from your 14 days of leave. For those with ippt and SOC given off, they will be using their off to cover it. So in the end, when near to ord, they will be the ones who will leave earlier.</div>
