              <p>Hi, sorry if I sound like a complete loser:</p>
              <p>My enlistment date is the 9th of December, 2011.</p>
              <p>I have a deferred offer of admission for Honours Electrical Engineering at a University here in Canada, which starts at 14th of September 2013.</p>
              <p>I've just read on the NS portal that it's possible for me to disrupt my full-time NS to pursue university studies overseas, provided I serve the remainder of my NS liability once I recieve my Degree. Since it's basically going to be a ~3 month term, I have no problem doing so. I'm rather excited about this since I'll be able to go to University without having to defer an additional year.</p>
              <p>Does anyone know if there's a good amount of people who have done this?</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>DISRUPTION FOR TERTIARY STUDIES FOR FULL-TIME NATIONAL<br>SERVICEMEN (NSFs)</strong></em></span><br><br>MINDEF provides sufficient opportunities for NS-liable males to attain up to<br>first education bar qualifications before enlistment, subject to the deferment<br>cut-off age criteria*. A first education bar is defined as GCE 'A' level, Polytechnic<br>diploma and equivalent qualifications. Disruption will hence be restricted only<br>for full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) to pursue a higher level educational<br>qualification, such as an advanced diploma, associate degree or degree course.<br>Only courses conducted by the educational institutions which confer their own<br>qualifications are allowed. For example, a NSF will not be allowed disruption<br>to pursue a foreign degree course conducted by the Singapore Institute of<br>Management (SIM) since the qualification is not conferred by SIM.</p>
              <p>Disruption is only considered on the basis of equity to allow those from the<br>same school cohort but enlisted in the later intake, to proceed for further studies<br>at the same university at the same time as those enlisted in the earlier intake.<br>Disruption will not be granted to NSFs who are enlisted ahead of their age<br>cohort with equivalent qualifications as the basis of disruption is to maintain<br>cohort equity.<br><br>Disrupted NSFs are required to serve their remaining full-time NS in<br>one continuous period immediately upon completion of studies.<br>NSFs must submit their applications for disruption, together with documentary<br>proof, through their unit Manpower Officer to MINDEF/SAF HRSC for approval<br>three months prior to their date of disruption. Late or incomplete application<br>may be rejected.<br><br><strong>Minimum Service Period</strong><br>The earliest date that NSFs can disrupt is on the 1st of the month that they<br>complete the minimum service period stipulated in the table below, or one week<br>before the start of the official course term for local studies (two weeks before<br>the start of the official course term for overseas studies), whichever is later.<br>Approval will not be granted for NSFs to be disrupted for orientation or other<br>pre-matriculation activities.<br><br>Disrupted NSFs are required to serve their remaining full-time NS in<br>one continuous period immediately upon completion of studies.<br>NSFs must submit their applications for disruption, together with documentary<br>proof, through their unit Manpower Officer to MINDEF/SAF HRSC for approval<br>three months prior to their date of disruption. Late or incomplete application<br>may be rejected.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MONTH OF ENLISTMENT   : MINIMUM SERVICE PERIOD</strong></span><br>December / June         : No Disruption       <br>January / July                : 24 months<br>February / August        : 23 months<br>March / September     : 22 months<br>April / October              : 21 months<br>May/ November           : 20 months</p>
