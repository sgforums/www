            <div class='col-md body'><strong>This is the USAF special forces</strong><br><br>Air Force Special Tactics (also known as Air Force Special Forces) are commandos of the United States Air Force under the Air Force Special Operations Command or AFSOC, a branch of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). The 720th Special Tactics Group is responsible for all Special Tactics personnel and consists of six operational squadrons and numerous supporting organizations.<br><br>There are five types of air commandos: Combat Controllers (CCTs), Pararescuemen (PJs, AKA Pararescue Jumpers or Parajumpers), Special Operations Weather Technicians (SOWT), Combat Rescue Officers (CROs), and Special Tactics Officers (STOs). CROs and PJs share a separate pipeline from STOs and CCTs (who also share a pipeline). SOWT personnel do not attend either the Pararescue or CCT pipeline, but attend a separate weather school and receive Basic Airborne qualification from the U.S. Army's Airborne School at Ft. Benning.<br><br>They typically operate in close cooperation with other special operations units, such as the Army Rangers, Army Special Forces, and Navy SEALs.Contents [hide]<br>1 Combat Control<br>2 Pararescue<br>3 Special Operations Weather Technician<br>4 Special Tactics Officer (STO)<br>5 Combat Rescue Officer (CRO)<br>6 Unit Formations<br>7 History<br><br><strong>Combat Control</strong><br><br>The Combat Controllers (Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) 1C2X1) are ground operators certified to act as air traffic controllers such as those found at any major airport, but with a few added duties. They can take over or construct an airstrip, set up navigational equipment, and direct airplanes and helicopters to a safe landing without the use of a tower or elaborate communications system. They also control air attacks of fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft from all military services.<br><br>Their training includes Air Traffic Control School at Keesler AFB, Combat Controller School at Pope AFB, U.S. Army Basic Airborne Course at Fort Benning, Georgia, AFSOC Advanced Skills Training at Hurlburt Field, Florida, U.S. Air Force Combat Dive Course in Panama City, Florida, U.S. Army Military Freefall School, and U.S. Navy Underwater Egress Training at NAS Pensacola.<br><br>Combat controllers are a part of the 720th Special Tactics Group and are assigned to 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, and 123rd Special Tactics Squadron. They can be distinguished by their scarlet beret.<br><br>Their motto is "First There".<br><br><strong>Pararescue</strong><br><br>Pararescuemen (AFSC 1T2X1) have what some consider to be the most difficult job in all of the armed forces—combat search and rescue, typically of (but not limited to) downed pilots. They are trained and able both to fight with virtually any special operations unit and are paramedics on the battlefield.<br><br>In addition to the initial training listed above they must pass an indoctrination course. The goal of the indoctrination is to weed out all of those who are not physically and mentally fit enough to be pararescuemen. A 24-week Paramedic Course at Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, New Mexico to attain EMT-Paramedic certification, a 20-week Pararescue Recovery Specialist Course (for integrating what they have learned in the pipe-line training; i.e. combat tactics, advanced parachuting, helicopter insertion and extraction, mountaineering, and field tactics training), U.S. Air Force Combat Dive Course in Panama City, Florida (open and closed circuit), and Underwater Egress Training at Spokane, Washington. Their training pipeline is sometimes referred to as "Superman School". On average, eight out of every ten trainees fail to graduate.<br><br>Their motto is "That Others May Live".<br><br>They wear maroon berets and many tattoo green footprints on their body. The green feet originated in Vietnam due to a tradition of calling the helicopters used "The Jolly Green Giant".<br><br><strong>Special Operations Weather Technician</strong><br><br>Special Operations Weather Technicians (special duty AFSC 1W0X1C) are airmen that gather and interpret meteorological and oceanographic information, as well as act as forward ground combatants. Their primary mission is collecting and disseminating forward observations in denied, hostile or otherwise data-sparse regions. They are a critical element in mission planning and work mostly with Army Special Operations. Recruits must score high to meet the entrance score requirement, and must already be in the weather career field.<br><br>In addition to weather technical school and the initial training listed up top, selected trainees attend the final two phases of AFSOC Advanced Skills Training which includes modes of employment, weapons training, small unit tactics, advanced communication, navigation, et al.<br><br>Special Operations Weather Technicians are a part of the 720th Special Tactics Group and are assigned to the 10th Combat Weather Squadron, 24th, 320th, and 321st Special Tactics Squadron. They wear grey berets.<br><br>SOWT is an acronym referring alternately to both Special Operations Weather Technician and Special Operations Weather Team.<br><br>Their motto is "Coela Bellatores" or "Weather Warriors".<br><br><strong>Special Tactics Officer (STO)</strong><br><br>Special Tactics Officers (AFSC 13DXB), formerly known as Combat Control Officers, are commissioned officers whose primary responsibility is to manage and lead Special Tactics Teams (STTs) comprised of, but not limited to, the three AFSCs specified above. Because their training mirrors that of the CCT pipeline, they can function on a team as mission commander or direct combatant or they can serve on battle staffs to provide expertise in terminal control, reconnaissance, and personnel recovery operations.<br><br><strong>Combat Rescue Officer (CRO)</strong><br><br>In 2000 the Air Force, recognizing the importance of the personnel recovery mission, created the Combat Rescue Officer career field (AFSC 13DXA). CROs are commissioned officers whose primary duties are to manage and lead personnel recovery teams as well as serve on battle staffs to provide expertise in command and control and personnel recovery operations. Their training pipeline mirrors that of the Pararescue pipeline.</div>
