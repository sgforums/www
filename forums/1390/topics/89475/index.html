            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all. Just need some advice on certain matters as i am very confused now.<br>I was put OOC around my (supposed) POP date because i was hospitalised. Monday i am going to my new unit. This is weird because my company's POP date was last week. I am being posted out exactly the same time and same pattern (go www.miw.com.sg to get eposting) as my platoon/company. It's like i never OOC sia. Is this typical?<br><br>My vocation is a driver. In tekong, i didnt complete my BMT, so i didn't attend range/field camps etc. I have no combat skills and very little useful knowledge learnt from BMTC school. This is my greatest worry. Can someone with no military training (because of OOC) cope with driver vocation? I always have the impression that OOC people are sent to be clerk/storeman. This is why i am worried. Very worried.<br><br>Some questions to ask. I am posted to HQ 8 SAB (Keat Hong Camp 1 at chao chu kang) as a driver. Anyone from there? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Can i roughly know what to expect as a driver (besides driving duh)<br><br>1. Once i get my license and everything if i pass, i might be sent back to a BMT recourse in future. Will i be posted to a new unit after my recourse? If yes, wont it be a waste of the driving license and training i went through. (I assume most people are posted to other units after they pass their recourse).<br><br>2. Anyone have any idea how long it takes to get the license. Will you be posted out again after you get license?<br><br>3. Why am  i posted to Keat Hong camp 1 when my vocation is driver? That is the scary part. That is an armor camp isnt it.<br><br>I know thats alot of questions i was asking. But i am really confused. Really appreciate if people can help answer some of my questions. Thanks!</div>
