Afterall, they all had been soldiers before.<br><br>Because punishments are dished out a for good reason, and done fairly (that is unbaised), after a while, the soldiers tend to realise the reason.

They will "get it" very quickly and respond appropriately very quickly. So they never get punished for long. Not only do they not go against the the instructors, they even act as extensions of instructors. There are actual cases where they "enforce discipline" on their own initiative on the other "sabo kings" in the platoons up in the bunk.<br><br>Because they are more mature, mentally tougher and faster to get it, they can get whacked by the instructors but remain cheerful and be very friendly with the instructors.<br><br></div>
