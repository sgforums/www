              <p>Remember way back in time time i had a fellow REC who got PES B but everyone in the company who learnt about his condition agreed that he should definitely not be PES B and blame CMPB MO for giving the wrong PES. That guy ended up OOT and if not wrong was rePES to E sometime later.</p>
              <p>In army things often happen this way. A recourse is inevitable if the specialist does say that your problem is nothing. However recourse normally happens later in your NS life anyway and not directly after specialist certified you fit. Generally recourse you get slightly better treatment since you are no longer a REC and can return to tekong with any rank from PTE up to 3SG.</p>
              <p>I don't really think theres much you can do but just wait for ur specialist review and see what he says since thats unfortunately how our army works.</p>

              doing the NS excercises like jumping causes me to feel pressure on
              one leg 1st.. i duno how can i handle SOC.<br> <br> So i reported this to CMPB when i check up b4 enlist..they issued
              me pes B.. and said regarding this problem.. i just sound off if im

              .. my PS enquired abt my prob.. and said i would have difficulty in

              <p>left leg longer than right leg, overtime, the length will become the same.</p>
              <p>just like people with a leg in a cast for some time will have that leg become a longer.</p>
              <p>the knee cap thing i don't know. have you fell out of any of the training before? any problems for you? do you feel that you are unable to meet the physical demand?</p>
              <p>the story of another guy who downgrade because everyone think he should be downgraded... doesn't apply to you. he is downgraded because of his medical conditions, not because everyone thinks he should be downgraded.</p>

              my personal opinion will be to:
              
              a. see outside specialist - write letter to exempt.
              b. see MP - ask him also to write letter to ask for review by not the same MO.
              c. complain to SAF hotline.

              <p>First, let me say one thing, as a NSF, anything done inside is not consider wasting time. Believe me, chow keng time also contribute in getting nearer to ORD.</p>
              <p>So what if no problem need to recourse, then? Recourse lor! Now NS only 2 years, if I do 2 mths BMT and OOC and waste 1 more month lazing around for medical review, in the end need to recourse again for another 3 mths. That is a total 6 mths over! Which means u are now 1.5 years left to ORD.</p>
              <p>So dun worry about the time thingy, remember ur aim is not getting through to POP it is to get nearer to ORD.</p>
              <p>As for medical wise, trust me, now can say no problem, but a few months down the road? Who can confirmed? Trust me, alot of recruits focus too much on the army liao, that is wrong, your health come first, the training can go f**k itself later. You are responsible for your own health NOT SAF. I have friends who just close one eye on their medical problems and carry on with their training in the end make their condition worse and lagi affect their whole life.</p>
              <p>NS only 2 years, no sense in making a condition which suppose to be no problem for life become a condition that you have to suffer to the day you die.</p>
              <p>Lastly on MOs in SAF, sad to say, most MOs I come acrosss during my active days score a zero in professionalism. Even, if they say no problem and you must still seek a second opinion. Preferably with your own family doctor whom you know or get a buddy/parent/etc to accompany you to see another doctor outside.</p>
              <p>I know getting someone to accompany u sounds abit ginnah but if you are the kind that don't know how to argue with ppl type then getting some accompany u sometimes can leverage and prevent the other doctors "putting their MO face" on and assume you are chow keng even before they diagnose you, YES, it happens outside also (because most male doctors outside are ususally MOs during their NS days also).</p>

              <p>I am a fellow REC OOT. I OOT in Jan 08 and was posted to a unit in Feb 08 and has been stuck there since. Generally your BMT Recourse FFI will be scheduled 6 months after you OOT. In the interim period, dont bother seeing MOs (because they are inexperienced and will merely refer you to MMI). I suggest you go directly to any hospital A&amp;E and seek treatment . Generally, they would refer you to a specialist. Once you have seen the specialist, show the SAF Memo to your MO who will rubber stamp it. Its far more efficient.</p>
              <p>SAF will not downgrade you unless you can back up your claims with solid medical evidence - SAF Memos from external specialist, specialist diagnosis, x rays etc.</p>
              <p>Dont overact and go see MP, call SAF hotline etc.</p>
