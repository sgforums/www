              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>I would like to ask a question on behalf of my friend regarding his PES-to-be when he goes for the medical check-up sometime later this year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here are his medical conditions:</p>
              <p><br>1. 3rd degree burn scar at the back of his left leg, more than 90% of the back surface.</p>
              <p>(due to this, he's left leg is unable to let out sweat. slight trouble with movement / flexibility)</p>
              <p>2. Shingles</p>
              <p>(random recurrances of Shingles appear on his face every few months, numbing his facial nerves and etc.)</p>
              <p>3. Tailbone nerve sclerosis</p>
              <p>(recently, he was diagnosed with a sclerosis around the nerve in the tailbone region. at the moment, he is unable to stand, sit, move around freely, or lie down with back straight due to this)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am really honestly curious about what PES status he will be classified under should he decide to go for the medical check-up later this year. Of course, he would bring along all the necessary medical documents and such to support his claims.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Could anyone please kindly advise? Thanks!</p>

              <p><br>judging by the more complicated condition no 3, coupled with no 1 &amp; 2, he is more or less within the pes range of e (may come with a couple of excuses this n that perm), should i say... BUT if the cmpb doctor may not be able to give a definite pes on the spot to the person, given the combination of the 3 conditions, hence the cmpb mo give a pes D, meaning awaiting pes grading discussion in the cmpb medical board with another 2 doctors. if so, the official pes result will be post mailed to him a few months after the check up.</p>

              <p><br>spinal / back problems as i have said many many times along with any other conditions is by seeing the <strong>severity</strong> of the conditions. (of cos need to be backed by specialist memo/report)</p>
              <p>e.g. say for prolapsed intervertebral disc ("slipped" disc), what's the extent of the budging/herniated/ruptured/teared discs affected (from where to where) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with/without</span> the impingement of the surrounding nerves (myelopathy)...etc...etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in this case, specialist opinion is needed for the extent/severity of the person's mobility.</p>
              <p>with condition 1 &amp; 2, its within the range of pes c. when combined with condition 3, then there may be a greater concern for consideration at the medical board level..</p>

              <p>hi eac,</p>
              <p>i went through the link that you provided me in my "rising BP" thread..</p>
              <p>although I'm still not sure why I'm experiencing this sudden rise in BP, I'm still concerned nonetheless because, well... the doctor seemed pretty worried about it...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My BP reading back in Feb 08 was 130 / 100.</p>
              <p>Now, it is 140 (+/-) / 100 with no apparent reason.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If my BP remains at the current level, does it pose any imminent dangers for my health?</p>
              <p>Also, to be downgraded due to BP, how high / low does your reading have to be?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Really quite worried about this....</p>
              <p>thanks for the help in advance..</p>

              <p><br>since u have already passed pes c bmt, it's unlikely ur s1 branch to send u for standard bmt, considering its 2 months long... n assume u r pes c <em>permanent</em>, then its NOT to go standard bmt...<br><br>during my time, most i knew who went for vocation courses remained as the present vocationalist at least <em>till ord.</em> if ur dept commander kept insisting u stay n can't be released if u r damn good at work or good working r/s, ur dept commanders may help u to talk wif s1 br.</p>
