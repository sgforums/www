            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by seow:</div><div class="quote_body">Asking for a friend.<br><br>"I went for my medical a year ago and everything is fine except my childhood arm fracture The MO asked me to squeeze his hand and told me i have power but he referred to the "secret book" and later gave me C1L2 I have since sailed for 6 months onboard an oil-tanker and will be going for enlistment soon<br><br>I would like to know if this PES status will affect my chances of getting a Navy-related vocation or whether it will still be a random choice Thanks for your help "<br><br>He is not known as broken arm for nothing, appears that he had crooked arm due to taking a fall in childhood.<br><br>Wonders if this question fits in better here...</div></blockquote>On vocation streaming, No one really knows how SAF decides on which vocation you go to. What ppl do is observe on individuals and come up with theories. For example, one such theory is if u are the only son in the family, highly unlikely u will kena high risk vocation like commandos, etc, etc I also dunno how true is that also. So if you ask how SAF decides, no one really knows, if someone do know it will unlikely he/she will post here (kinda like confidential information)<br><br>But one thing for sure is PES status does play a important fact in deciding in if u are going to a combat vocation or not. If u look at PES C and below, u will see vocations are non-combat based and are mostly service and tech vocation.<br><br>So coming back to Navy, I am not a Navy man so I cannot give u exact detail information on what kind of vocation Navy has but if the Navy has service or tech vocations, I dun see why it is not possible.<br><br>However, dun get ur hopes too high either, because SAF doesn't do job fit kind of stuff meaning, even if u have some skills, SAF can choose not to place you in the vocation of your skills. For example, I know of soldiers who study mass communication or study graphic design but they still end up as infantry. Doesn't mean u study these in poly will end up in the SAF's publication department one.</div>

For officers, most of them will not disclose one.<br><br>I am also not sure how arrangements is done between ur doctor or the SAF MOs. I believe u must have some form of medical appointment right? From what I know, there are periodic medical reviews by the SAF MOs and is ususally arrangements is done on the MO side.<br><br>But if u do wish to clarify on this matter, go to your doctor outside first, AND go with your parents/uncle/aunties (NO friends, no brothers sisters)*. Talk to your doctor on what shld u do, ususally, they will know what to advise you and ask them to write a letter addressing your camp's MO.<br><br>This is just a suggestion, of course u can go to ur camp's MO first but it is highly not recommended because most camp MO's are not specialist and they ususally have this "assume chao keng until proven sick" &amp; "I will charge u for malingering" mentality + with the number of people they see everyday. Without the letter from the outside doctor, u will be at a disadvantage. (I have seen my fair share of worst MOs in SAF with no professionalism)<br><br>*Why parents are needed even when seeing outside doctors?<br>This is from personal and friends experience and I find it f**king strange that doctors outside can behave this way: From the moment u enter SAF, every doctor I see outside will put on their "MO face" when seeing NSF and they immediately have the "assume chao keng until proven sick" &amp; "I will charge u for malingering" mentality. Why? Because these doctors are also MOs during their NS time and I have no idea WHY on earth they need to put on their "MO face" even for a G.P. in a neighborhood clinic.<br><br>So to f**king neturalise this f**king attitude problem of these f**king doctors bring along a parent during visit. 180 degrees attitude change.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

When u get the specialist letter, ur MO still can't do shi.t.<br>Why? He basically is no specialist, he has no power to downgrade or upgrade, he can only recommend.<br><br>So if u get the letter for a downgrade, ur case will be forwarded to a Medical Board for review and final judgment.

Please read above threads)<br><br>Sorry dude, SAF by right dun do vocation request.<br><br>However, by left, I do know there are case by case basis but reasons must be rock solid. U can request but I first forewarn u, dun be surprised that SAF personnel might pop up at ur home to do home visit or checking with other government bodies to verify ur claims. (Usually, to prevent chow keng ppl to misuse the system). U have to also understand SAF's view, if anybody can suka suka request vocation then SAF where got authority.</div>
