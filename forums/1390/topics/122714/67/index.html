              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I have chronic uticaria and demographism. It's a rash allergy. When I put on the uniform, the seams that causes the abrasion, will trigger the rash patches on that area. [when exposed to heat and sweat]</p>
              <p>My worst outbreak was during field camp when caring my FBO, my affected area was so bad it was bleeding. </p>
              <p>Currently I'm excused uniform until for a month and waiting for an appointment with the MMI. Is my condition downgradable?</p>
              <p>Thanks in advance  </p>

              <p>Certainly downgradable. Depending on how serious. C9L3 with temp 6mth at least. When going to MMI, better for you to show the symptom on that day. So try to make the symptom out so that the specialist can see it. The more it comes out, the lower your grade. Good luck!</p>

              Hi, a couple of months ago, I fractured my jaw towards the end of BMT and I lost quite a number of teeth also. Now I'm still on long-term mc and may have lots of dental appointment during the 2 years of service, I'm wondering if my Pes status (Pes B) will be downgraded due to my condition?

              <p>thanks for the reply, my specialist told me something about allowing me to continue with 3 months of light duties and also currently i still cannot chew on any food (on a soft diet).

              <p>MMI specialist are under SAF. U have to check with the medics on this. I know that they have certain schedule to see patients every month. It's like a medical board. Instead of having it at your own unit, which your MO is not specialise in, they refer u to MMI for outside specialist to make a decision.</p>
              <p>But you can ask your own specialist to write a memo to excuse you uniform or the sun for 3mth and wait for the MMI appointment. Normally MO will approve for 3mth since it is within their control.</p>

              <p>thanks for the reply, my specialist told me something about
              allowing me to continue with 3 months of light duties and also
              currently i still cannot chew on any food (on a soft diet). Cos i
              was not posted to any unit yet after my bmt, i'm wondering what
              possible vocations will i get then?</p>

              <p>Did you complete BMT or were you considered OOT?</p>
              <p>If you OOT, you will only be posted to non combat vocations but if you complete BMT, you can be posted to any vocation that you were supposed to be posted to after BMT</p>

              <p>Hi, i recently saw a specialist after years of recurring back pain. Diagnosed with degenerative disc disease, submitted the letter to my reservist unit MO for medical board.</p>
              <p>Result just came back, perm C2L2. Now my question, in my letter it asked for excuse permanently from heavy loads, running and jumping, yet there is no mention of this in the medical certificate they sent me. I am more particular on the carry heavy loads portion.</p>
              <p>My worry is when i go back for reservist, they will ask me to help carry stores/ load tonner, or carry the SBO and rifle to do 'light duties/training'</p>
              <p>I have 6 ict left and my vocation is 3SG Guards. I presume i have to go see the camp mo during my next ict to get perm excuse heavy loads since rifle + sbo is enough to create the pain in my back? Or do i have to schedule another appointment with my reservist unit MO?</p>
              <p>Also, with regards to this condition, it is quite apparent that the cause of is due to the years of heavy load and training i went through during active and reservist trainings, is it possible to file some sort of service injury and claim some sort of compensation? I am 28 years old.</p>

              <p>Dear all experienced brothers out there. i am in a dilema now. i have passed my bmt and was posted to a chiong unit now. i have a record of skin problem which is atopic eczema. i sounded off to my pc in bmt when it got serious after field camp but he ask me to endure through or else i will need to recourse. he told me to sound it off when i am posted to my new until and they will revocate me.</p>

              <p>the third time i went to national skin centre, was attended by the senior doctor over there. my big patch bcome quite jialat as there's those watery watery thing coming out and seems like a infection. this time the doctor wrtoe a letter to recommend me to down pes. the letter states my present condition of wad skin problem i have. and also said that this problem has been disturbing my sleep. thus he kindly request the person in charge to review me for KIV downgrade.</p>
              <p>But the problem is my camp MO already told me that even got letter i also canot down my pes. but now its really torturing for me cause its very itchy and everything. can anyone advice wad should i do?</p>
