              <p>Many thanks for answering my query. I was just wondering if you are able to tell me what is the PES status normally assigned to someone who has been diagnosed with my condition.</p>
              <p>Thanks again. :)</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I've already read the first page. But I'm curious if my commander can insist that I continue front line combat training even when informed of my downgrading? Or has the system changed such that C2L2 still need to chiong?</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I was recently downgraded to C2L2. Just wondering what it means. Am i still fit for front line duty like infantry? Also can my commander insist that I still participate in their training? i.e. chiong sua.</p>

              <p>C2 means that serviceman is not fit to take their IPPT.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>L2 means that serviceman can bear firearms and can go outfield. However, they cannot be deployed in front line duties like direct combat.</p>
              <p>If your commander insists that you participate in their training but you feel that your condiition don't allow you to do so, you can appeal to get the specific excuse like excuse outfield training or whatever excuse training that you need.</p>
              <p>You can appeal by arranging for a medical review by making an appointment with unit medical centre via National Service Human Resource Centre. During your medical review with the medical officer, inquire the MO whether your condition allows you to have this excuse. MO can only give excuses temporarily during the consultation visit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can check for more details about what your PES status means at your unit medical centre or National Service Human Resource Centre (NSHRC in short).</p>
