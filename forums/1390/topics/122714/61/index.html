              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Hi seniors need your help again. Last week I posted on the Medical FAQ section. </span><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1390/topics/79306?page=82"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Calibri;">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1390/topics/79306?page=82</span></span></a></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Thanks for the information. As for now, I have another doubt which I wish u guys would enlighten me. I went down to CMPB again on Tuesday to hand up my memos written by the Orthopedic in Changi General Hospital. I was given an upgrade from PES D to a temporary PES C status for 6 months which will start on the date of my enlistment. As usual I was asked to sign an acknowledgement form to prove that I am aware of my current PES status (I was asked to do that when I was downgraded to PES D last week).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">After I got out of the medical centre, I wrote an appeal letter to the enlistment counter requesting for early enlistment date. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">On Thursday, the enlistment department from CMPB replied me thru an email. They indicated in the email that my case <span style="color: #444444; ">require additional 3 CMPB Medical Officers to do the endorsement before completing the medical classification process. As at current, I am still medically graded as temporarily unfit. I would be scheduled for enlistment within 6 months upon my medical clearance.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="color: #444444; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Can I know whether did they make a mistake or any kind of miscommunication? The medical officer in the CMPB has given me a PES status on Tuesday and I already signed to acknowledge it. Why is there still a need to require additional 3 MO to do an endorsement? Why isn’t there any similar process done when I was downgraded to PES D? (I signed acknowledgement letter last week and I was declared as PES D on the spot). If the process is necessary, any of the seniors have any ideas on roughly how long will the medical classification process take? </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="color: #444444; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">As for me I am not so much concern about my PES status. I am very worried about when is my enlistment date as all of my peers had already enlisted and is now doing their BMT. I am the only one left not given any place to go.<span>  </span>I don’t wish to drag the matter any longer as I am quite old and I am still hoping to go for further studies when I ORD.</span></span></p>

Btw from my understanding on point 7 and 8, the MO gave me the PES status that day might not be the same PES status i am getting after the Medical Board PES Review. Am i right? if yes, most likely will be the same or won t be the same as the PES status given by the MO?</p></div>
