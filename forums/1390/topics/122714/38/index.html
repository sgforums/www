              <p>I've been posted to C9L3 temp for 6 months upon enlistment.</p>

              <p><br>1) go read the BMT thread... ...<br><br>2) yes/no maybe... depending on the condition and what u tell the MO... worse/improve/no change. will be call back for review at medical centre when due expiry. if u got specialist appt outside, get a memo then give to MO as supporting document.<br><br>3) no.</p>

              <p>Hey hello i thought I might chip in..Just to inform you all i got a E9L9 for my PES status today, and that i am a very healthy guy who is ultra sporty ( I'll die without it) and has got gold for NAPFA every single year. The reason for my E9L9 ?? A condition called Brugada syndrome that is one of the causes for sudden cardiac arrest. Although my condition is a less serious Brugada type 2, the MO decided the risks were not to be taken. Hence i will most probably do clerk duty or if i hope, get into MDC.  Oh yes.. And Brugada syndrome has no symptoms at all so yeah my E9L9 came suddenly out of the blue. So yeah my advice to all is take care of your body and that chao kengs will nvr work.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Heh thanks. </p>
              <p>The reason i was asking this is not because i wanted to check if i was capable of getting the  fitness cut but more due to the fact that i was wondering if they mite just upgrade/review my pes level to c or something because they see im fitter than what my check up shows.</p>
              <p>And yep i really feel that my condition is minor just that it seems that my condition is overated :p Was really expecting a pes b or c and was shocked that i ended up with E1l9 but just accept it anyway hehe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Looks like i am most probably settled to be a clerk haha.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I ORD with PES B. Now recently given PES C9 L2 Temporarily 6 months due to a small medical problem due to expire in 3 months. And now I had another medical condition, a persistant heel Bone pain on both of my leg for 2 months. Whenever I stand or walk for an hour or more, both of my heel bone will be in intense pain. Sometime, the pain would make me walk with a limp. I seen an othopaedic specialist, and he told me that I should avoid high impact exercise due to my heel bone problem. But he is scheduling me for a Bone Scan to check the underlying leg heel problem, since X-Ray cant find any problem, except that the Arch of my leg is very high, which makes me suitable for Plantar Fasicitis inflammation of my tissue. I suspect I might have Stress Hairline Fracture on my heel, because I am obese and all the years of stress have put onto my heel bone of my leg. Should I go for another medical review? Thanks guys.</p></div>

              <p><br>yes, the more u should if ur future ICT is coming soon... FYI, it really helps if u can get a latest stronger worded specialist memo to show the unit medical centre..<br><br>if it's just for the annual IPPT, just get a GP MC/memo during ur normal IPPT session, ask the PTI to bring u to medical centre and endorse the MC to excuse IPPT for a couple of / some weeks.</p>

              <p>Guys, i have a question</p>
              <p>Ok, basically in secondary school while playing as goalkeeper in football (the ball full force hit the finger while i try to catch , and yes,i had no exp in football) i accidentally broke my left hand little finger, when healing, required two metal bars to keep the bones in place. Now it (technically) healed and the metal bars are taken out (i think i still have them) Now, i'm wondering what my PES may be. I know i need to serve lol. I'm almost graduating le.</p>
              <p>I was in NCC when my broken finger came about. After my finger recovered, i could still continue and finish NCC in Secondary 4. I heard that if i could have done NCC, they will defintely put me in NS combat roles no matter what. Is that true?</p>
              <p>Some points to note -</p>
              <p>1) I don't think i have any documentations from the doctor last time for my left little finger. I remember the doctor saying that if i break it again, i'll probably cripple my left finger/hand. But i don't think the MO will care about unconfirmed information from 5 years ago right?</p>
              <p>2) It's not feeling very natural and responsive, it doesn't bend well unless forced, and it's a bit of "limbo" state. And it has the slight (not pain) unnatural feeling when placed on the floor, don't think it'll support much weight. It's tough to describe the feeling. haiz..</p>
              <p> EDIT - I have 800+ eye degree on both eyes with alot of shan guang thingy, my dad had heart condition (and passed away already) and not sure if i got inherited. Don't know about other conditions atm.</p>
              <p>Yup, so i'd like to know my likely PES status. My friends say it might be PES C L 1(surely can go out field because of my NCC history)?</p>

              <p>It wasn't i say one though, but was my Internship ITP colleague say one .

MO will say that the finger heal already confirm can just go chiong one won't die. That same ITP colleague say since NCC i can tahan with healed broken finger, he say NS sure can one.

              <p>Thing is, will SGH (the hospital that operated on my finger) still have my record history from like, 6 - 7years ago? From what i know, that time my family and i didn't know that this stuff may affect NS, and the doctor never prescribe any documentation or memo either.</p>
              <p>Should i wait till MO write specalist letter or should i go to SGH asap and talk to them or will MO check with SGH for me? I'm a bit worried that they see my hand seems ok after this years and say i'm ok and later cripple my finger by breaking it again.</p>
              <p>And also, in the (unlikely) case i am unable to obtain the necessary documentation somehow, will i be placed in as PES B? i know defintely cannot be PES A due to a broken body from the past. No appeals either?</p>

              <p><br>usually the unit medical centre will note down the due expiry pes cases and liaise with the formation's NSHRC to schedule the review date with the reservist.<br><br>but if there is a admin lapse by them... then u have to book urself. there must be a review for due expiry temp pes cases... no auto-upgrade one...</p>
