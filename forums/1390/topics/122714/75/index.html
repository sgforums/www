              <p>Excuse induction might mean you won't need to go for the 1 month Tekong stay and directly posted to a unit. We do not all PES E intakes really mono intake since that is a term more reserved for combat units.</p>

              <p>Unless the MO recommends revocation or the unit decides to revocate becos u can't join their training, otherwise you are generally stuck there if they can give some reason not to let you leave.</p>
              <p>Even the usual revocation can take weeks to months.</p>

              <p>I've recently passed out of BMTC under PES C BMT due to my 6 months temporary PES status. Just wanna know, will I be recoursed into PES A/B BMT after the PES ends? Cos I saw somewhere saying that once a person passes his BMT, he will not need to recourse again.</p>
