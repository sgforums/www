              <p>And oh id like to add a few things that i missed out.im actually currently in a guards batallion already and this condition is recently diagnosed. and my unit likes to "torture" the status personel and others who try to downpes / revocate. so id like to know if such a diagnosis could possibly revocate me?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in addition, my specialist wrote a letter advising the MO to revocate me but i never submitted the letter because i had no intention of revocating becaused i really loved my platoon mates in there. but due to recent develppments, im regretting that decision. so id also like to ask, if its an offense that i did not submit the letter from my specialist when i got it and whether i can still submit that letter now. (i got that letter about a month ago)</p>

              <p><br>it's <strong>not</strong> an offence... it's never too late to submit the specialist memo to the camp MO. it's still a recent memo.<br><br>u r high % to be granted temporary excuse sunlight, sweat, physical activities...etc, in any combination depending on the memo; also, meanwhile u should ask the MO in a <strong>polite manner</strong> for a consideration to case pending u for a medical board.</p>

              <p><br>if u go see MO this month, typically ur case pending will be scheduled for next month's medical board, since routine medical board at formation level is usually held in a day, once every month.<br><br>yes, it's a probable medical condition for reassessment of PES, in addition to some permanent excuses added to the PES. it depends on what's written on the specialist memo.<br><br>once u got the official medical board MC days after the medical board meet, u just show the MC to ur PC, if not OC to take u out of the nominal roll for the exercise.</p>

Because i read somewhere that an hiv test could be opt out by the person taking the medical check-up..</p>
              <p>Im worried sick. As my brother is quite fit as a person and i just dont understand why he got PES C..Like got some hidden disease we dnt knw about..The only thing i know is that he was in a motorcycle accident earlier this year and he hurt his leg(alot of scars) but he seems ok after that..My mother and I are really worried as he's not that close to us(he goes out alot,and he stays with my dad,who's more close to his new family)..and we want to make sure he's fine,especially now he's going into the army..even if he's not,we want to be there for him..</p>
              <p> </p>
