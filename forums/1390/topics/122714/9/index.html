            <div class='col-md body'>went polyclinic to see doc regarding my flat foot and he said that he dunno of any case that flat foot can be downgrade and initially refuse to give me a referal letter to specialist saying that they also cant do much except that they will only give me insole which is not useful to me but in the end he gave it to me. however my appointment is on 12/01/07 at TTS hospital. i need to settle this in 1-2 wks time. is there any other faster way to get to a specialist? do SAF take a private specialist recommendation into consideration?<br><br>any MO here that can give me any advice? coz the pain is somehow getting worse.</div>

Most officers that I come across will just follow the MO's MC, those kiasu kiasi will double check with the Medical centre just to be sure but most will not ask u to do since u are already excused.<br><br>But leh, I have to agree with Oxford, deployment depends on ur L rating on ur PES, so lets say a clerk is C9L1, although excuse firearms, he still can be ask to go to field and do sai gang because his L rating is L1. Why I know? Because my unit last time like this, clerks also go out field to go sai gang.<br>(You can go to page 1 and check on Gordonators posting on L deployment).</div>
