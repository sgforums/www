              <p>Hi, I'm diagnosed with vasovagal syncope. However, I read in another forum that it is a non-downgradable condition. Although so, I experienced some difficulties in BMT when I keep whiting and theres even a time when I nearly fainted and fell during shuttle run, causing a slight injury. Any advice as to whether the doctor will retain my pes status of b or is there any chance of downgrading because I'm really experiencing the giddiness problem many times every day. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi Moderator/eac,</p>
              <p>Your advice in this forum has been very helpful, especially the steps in http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1390/topics/315224</p>
              <p>I would like to ask a more specific question for a friend who has just OOC in ASLC. He was just diagnosed with Osgood-Schlatter disease on one knee by an private specialist. When he showed the MO the x-ray, the MO said he will recommend down PES from B to C2L2. Now he is waiting for Medical board review.</p>
              <p>If he gets C2L2 he would like to do something useful in NS. He is very good with computers and would like to contribute his IT skills to the saf (he finished A levels).</p>
              <p>Who/where can he approach to do this ?</p>
              <p>Many thanks for your advice.</p>

              <p>Hi Moderator/eac,</p>
              <p>Your advice in this forum has been very helpful, especially the steps in http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1390/topics/315224</p>
              <p>I would like to ask a more specific question for a friend who has just OOC in ASLC. He was just diagnosed with Osgood-Schlatter disease on one knee by an private specialist. When he showed the MO the x-ray, the MO said he will recommend down PES from B to C2L2. Now he is waiting for Medical board review.</p>
              <p>If he gets C2L2 he would like to do something useful in NS. He is very good with computers and would like to contribute his IT skills to the saf (he finished A levels).</p>
              <p>Who/where can he approach to do this ?</p>
              <p>Many thanks for your advice.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Yes, Mindef will subsidies his treatments (any one of options), just so long as it's a general operation/ surgery/ medical procedure, and not considered cosmetic enhancements/ beautifying aesthetics in a medical term.</p>

              <p>Hi Moderator</p>
              <p>My brother has two medical conditions, first of which is bilateral pes planus. Two specialists said that it was bad, but all the NS MOs insisted it is not on seeing that it arches when he tip toes. He is currently using insoles but without it, his feet hurts severely. His flatfoot also makes his back weak.</p>
              <p>His second condition is Osgood Schlatter Disease in his right knee. He has a case history when he visited the specialist many years ago but up til now, his knee has not healed. Training worsens the pain in his knee. Even with more than two months of excused status, he says that pain has not gone away.</p>
              <p>My bro saw a senior consultant osteopedic specialist and he wrote a memo to be downgraded. He is currently Pes B and in a combat vocation, but given his conditions and spec diagnosis, will the MO/Medical Board reject the downgrade request?</p>

              <p>If a specialist memo specifically request for a downgrade, the chance of getting downgraded is generally high.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, agreed with dkcx.<br>What's written on the speciaist memo is the crux to a Medical Board Review.</p>
              <p>If the camp MO still reluctant to push his case to Medical Board despite showing the latest memo, ask your brother to please politely request for the MO to do up his case statement to the Medical Board, and then let the Medical Board Chairman to decide.<br><br>The key is to be <em>polite yet firm</em> to his tone and his usage of words in convincing the MO to do up a case statement for the monthy Medical Board Review.</p>
