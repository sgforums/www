You must bring this up at your pre-enlistment review. The main problem with this medical condition is that  your blood is more likely  clot and hence you may be at risk of stroke &amp; other thrombosis especially if dehydrated.  Please do let the  Mos at the MCC knowas you merit a downgrade Prob to PES C or E.</div>

I would however bring this up at MCC.  Being Skinny really cannot account for all the fainting spells.  if nothing definite can be found then PES B would be quite likely, but make sure you bring all the test results. Without seeing your detailed info, I wont be able to classify you straight off.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
