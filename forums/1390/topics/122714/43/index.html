              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Good day M.O.s,<br><br>My name is Chua Hian Koon and I was born in 29th April 1971. I enlist in March 1990 as PES B and I fought for PES downgrade from B to C2 and was given C2 in 1992. In 1997, I was given C2L2 without any medical review. I am a NSMEN with singapore civil defense. My next reservist is on 10th Feb 2009. I am approaching the end of my reservist cycle and wish for my medical status to be the correct medical status. A doctor has seen me and says my scoliosis deserve to be minimum C9L3 based on the current cases he has fought, as it is severe deformality that is visible on the street, even without taking my clothes off. He advise me to retake X rays / MRI etc... to fight for downgrade to the correct PES status before I reach age of 40. I was seen 17 years ago at SGH but at that time, my parents insist that i do not go for operation at that time, even though the professor recommended it.  A photograph of me taken in 1987 shows that I have the severe deformality at 1987, which is around the time I went for MMI 1st medical grading and was given PES B despite the severe deformality. But I have no official proof that the photo was taken in 1987.<br><br>The problem is I took the X rays/MRI etc at current time.... and they show the bones structure to be normal, the only thing that is visible is severe deformatility that is visible on the street. I also suffered from back pain for almost 20 says, but the X rays / MRI show everything to be normal. The only thing that can proof that I have high pain tolerance is that my upper body is covered with tattoos almost completely (Something like the Prison break main actor). This is because my previous immediate next door neighbour is the kallang river chopper guy and I did upper body full tattoo in case I meet someone like him and got chopped into pieces. After enduring back pain for 20 years without use of medication, I can endure the pain of upper body tattoos. But according to the secret instruction manual , there is absolutely nothing to proof that I should be C9L3 or below, except for visible severe deformality. The tattoos cannot be used as proof of pain tolerance level developed over 20 years. e.g. An old man suffered heart attack for 3 days before he sees M.O., when asked the old man says he endured heart attack for 30 minutes, then 1 hour, then 2 hours .... until he can endure it for 3 days. At least the old man has proof that he has heart attack. The problem with my case is that I do even have any evidence at all to fight for the correct PES status to be assigned to me.<br><br>I am not keng as I almost reach age limit for NSMan. My platoon mates with same condition managed to downgrade from C2L2 to C9L9  as he keep complain non stop  but I did not complain about it and endured it.  I am born in 29th April 1971. I hope that I can be assigned the correct PES status that should be given to me before I leave the reservist unit. My reservist unit is in Civil Defense so it is not a combat unit and I have no reason to keng. Do I have to go for operation to rectify the highly visible deformality before I can request for medical board ? Is there any way to ask for medical board based on visual inspection of physical deformality only and perhaps the tattoos as proof of high pain tolerance developed over a long period of time of continuous pain ? I heard that it is not possible, there must be positive evidence that there is bone problem. If necessary, I am willing to go for operation as it should have been done 17 years ago.<br><br>I wish to seek your opinion before I print out this email and your response to my reservist unit M.O., so that he can consider fighting my case when there is not much evidence.</p>

              <p>What will happen if suay suay war in singapore break out or other major disaster and my reservist unit activated? As I am C2L2 officially, I will be recalled for official duties. But actually I cannot do much also even if recalled for official duties, as SCDF rescue work involves a lot of tasks that only PES A/B can do e.g. carry man over shoulder etc..... should I send the original message and your comments to SCDF M.O., so at least a record exist somewhere, so I can easier ask for excuse if suay suay war break out or major disaster break out.</p>

              <p>Dear sir, I am a NSF currently on combat unit and staying at the 4th floor. On 24th September morning, I wake up standing beside my bed and this has freaked me out as I fear that "something" is playing tricks on me. When I call home and told my brother about this, he said that: "I saw you moving around the room @ night or you'll sleep upright and move about in bed, however, when I ask you in the morning, you always don't believe" This has triggered my memory on what my brother told me before. And I fear that I am sleep walking. I am scared and worried as I am staying at the 4th floor. Should I report about this? To the MO or should I go to private specialist? I fear a stain in my medical report saying I have mental illness.</p>
              <p>Next is that I am facing high stress level due to family issues and army life. On my first day of my new vocation, I saw "something" that greatly increase my stress level (especially at night) Likewise, should I report about this and will my record be stained? If I were to go for it, should I visit the MO or private specialist? </p>
              <p>MO = government and P.S = Private. Private spec will not reveal your condition right?</p>

Even if next time should u decided to work for the civil service, and should if the civil service wants to see ur records in the SAF, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">u must sign a permission note of information release for them to retrieve ur military / medical info.<br></span></strong></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I am now secondary 4 student. From age of 12 onwards I always got feeling that something wrong with my right leg, sometimes I cannot even get out of bed easily. My parents got bring me to see doctors and take X rays and other tests but the result is always there is nothing wrong with leg, must be psychology or mental problem thinking that there is something wrong with leg. But actually my leg hurts badly. I am thinking of live firing exercise, if I am alone with live ammo, I fire 3 times at knee kap of my right leg. I choose to be wheelchair bound/crippled leg forever than to live with this leg pain problem. I doubt any doctor will believe that I have leg problem when x ray and other tests show everything normal. I really want to amputate my leg as it is really painful but I doubt doctor will agree to amputate so I want to amputate my self by all means.  </p></div>

              <p><br>go to a specialist and get it checked out.. why cut/shoot your own leg? Sometimes leg pain can be caused by spine problems. get an MRI done, expensive but can detect problems x-ray cannot find. well if still wanna cut your leg, i think i got a chainsaw lying somewhere.....</p>

              <p>2) High myopia of over ~800 degrees - astigmatism heard is 300. havent check</p>
              <p>3) Sensitive nose - cold/dusty environment may get my nose irritated, then start sneezing uncontrollably, in worse case may become a runny nose. It's really cannot tahan in some cases de.</p>
              <p><em>4) sensitive to loud noise. i'm not sure if this is a medical condition, but when exposed to loud noise my ears very pain then like got something blocked. maybe it's my mentality ba.</em></p>
              <p><em>5) and also, is there any test on your mentality in medical checkup? like, depression, stress, panic etc? i dont feel right in my mental mind sometimes.</em></p>
              <p>So based on these, can sort of guess my PES?</p>
              <p>I'm also wondering when i see the medical checkup guy, will i need to declare about my sensitive nose? I've no idea how not serious/serious it is, and it seems like a trivial matter cause when i'm not in cold/dusty environment i'm a normal person. later combat mission halfway sneeze uncontrollably lol.</p>
