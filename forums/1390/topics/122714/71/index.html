              <p>If u are lucky, they may sent you to maybe logistics vocation as an officer where there is less chance of your problem affecting your work or if suay cancel ur contract since PES C are not supposed to be eligible for command school.</p>
              <p>I've known of regulars who down PES later in their service terms due to medical problems and still keep their contract but for you, i guess its best to check with them so you can make other plans just in case.</p>

              <p>It depends on your backpain severity. In fact, most of the time, MRI does not show much informations either. Even when the MRI do show that you are having a slip disc, are you going to take out all the organs and cut away the protuding tissue and then put all organ back again, that is a big surgery. The surgeons would not bother unless it is a patient really can live on without the surgery.But you must tell the "SAF" MO that it is causing you lost of pain that you have a problem, shiting in the toilet.</p>
              <p>SAF should be willing to let you go if you are unfit for your vocation. There is no point training man who is unable to chong in the first place. Dont waste our taxpayer money!</p>

              <p>If you are really having lots of pain, you can request for MC, attend C or B in months or weeks and regularly "renew", and ask for out of course and post out. Then your contract is automatically gone.</p>
              <p>For back condition, usually is a wait and see approach. People do recover from back sprain after a few months.But the couse instructors cannot possiblity wait you so...<br> yah.</p>

              <p>For temp cases, there are a number of times where OCS will keep the person in OCS as a temp clerk and let the person join the new batch of OCS trainees so its not always a confirm postout if the condition is considered temporary.</p>
              <p>Without a down PES, its almost impossible to get a vocation as a clerk except those temp clerks helping out while waiting for the start of the next course in whichever vocational school.</p>

              <p>I’ve got a question. I went for my xray at cmpb for my back, I
              went to the mo and they said there was nothing wrong with my
              spine.</p>
              <p>So they referred me to <span>JMC</span> and the
              specialist says my lumbra spine has a missing disc or something, I
              have to go for a <span>MRI</span> to see what’s going
              on.</p>
              <p>I’m also a regular, if the results comes out and I do have a
              problem, issit possible to downpes then what will happen to the
              contract?</p>

              <p>I doubt u have a missing disc. Else u will have back problem since when u r born. <br>u mentioned that x-ray does not show anything. It means that ur case is
              not that serious. So I suspect it is degenerated disc actually. So mri
              can better see how serious it is.</p>
              <p>If ur case is is totally degenerated disc where ur spinal bone or vertebra are rubbing against each other which certainly needs a surgery to put an artificial disc onto it..else ur spinal column may collapse.</p>
              <p>if it is only degenerated disc, at most C2L2 depend on the seriousness. if it is totally degenerated disc, then confrm a Pes E. Coz it will cause instability in ur spinal column which thus will affect the spinal cord.</p>
              <p>my personal feeling is not that serious for your case. Any serious prob can be seen in the X-ray. hope it helps.</p>

              Hmm the camp month says there nothing wrong he can see from the xray but the specialist says that there is a birth defect cause my l5 does not have a disc or something. I can't remember what he said. 
              
              C2l2 is what sorta pes?? 
              
              And let's say the worst happens and its really degenerative can I still downpes?
              
              And say its not that serious and I don't want it to get worse can I sound off to the specialist to get me to downpes to a less active vocation?

              <p>dont know. dont  worry so much let the doctor do the professional assessment, you pay for it anyway. Let them do their job. </p>
              <p>The concern should be focus on how the pain is affecting you, influencing for your performance and not actually medical diagnosis itself. </p>
              <p>There is a friend of mine who is a badminton player, and she is having lots of backpain (due to unknown reason). She has to quit badminton because she can hardly sit properly and not to say trained. But the specialist cannot find anything wrong with her, just to ask her to rest. </p>
              <p>A lot of us, dont receive regular physical training, so body defect will only shown up when the body is being stressed. </p>
              <p>I also have a back problem, and I reported sick on the second day of my BMT. But I still managed to POP but I get myself eventually downgrade before I ORD. If SAF dont want to downgrade you, you just take MC, take MC, take MC loh. I never learnt to march when I am in BMT, because I am always attend B. </p>
              <p>But how do you managed to POP and get into OCS...</p>

              But as a regular its not very good to always be taking mc right? 
              
              I've managed to live with the pain thru my bmt. How I got into ocs is still a big mystery to me. So I don't know what happened that got me into this place
              
              right now my vocation training is basically sitting down and studying. Ocassionally with a few pt and swimming but since m on status I'm not participating. And currently my back still have the pain but not as major as compared to during activities. 
              
              The reason why I want to downpes is because since I'm a regular and I can't exert myself there's no point in being in the saf. I won't be able to do ippt which results in no promotion. So what for right? And do correct me if I am wrong that is my take on this.

              <p>LOL. that why I never sign on in the very first place and I HATE SAF regular. My JC classmate who sign on as SAF MO, only realised that he had slipped disc problem, 6 years after he sign the contract.  And now he is also helpless in deciding what he wan to do. </p>
              <p>If you have not get your chocolate bar, it is still not so bad, perhaps you can still get your chance to get out. I remember in the SAF contract, there is a statement that say if you do not fulfill the expectation, or you have not been able to pass out from OCS, your contract is void. I am not sure if you need to pay SAF though.   </p>
              <p> If you are already a regular, even you are Pes E they can still post you the HQ to do a non-combat, admin. And you might get stuck with 1 bar, until your contract ends. But they may not want to renew your contract later. </p>
              <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">I hope they will not down you to be an CPL admin clerk for 5 years, before your contract expires...  &lt;-- you better check properly what your contract says. <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">To sign on  is easy, to let you go, hehehe, difficult. Good luck. </span></span></p>

              <p>If you are in the Navy, then you can under a different Pes system. </p>
              <p>You can be C9N1, which means that you are a combat officer but you dont need to take IPPT. Since you are combat Navigation officer, you dont need to carry loads, your back problem will not be a problem in your vocation. And &gt; 50 % of the Navy officer is doing admin or technical work anyway so they are non-combat by posting. </p>
              <p>I think air force is similar and most likely you are a not a pilot, since you are in OCT, and most likely your posting will be a technical officer. </p>
