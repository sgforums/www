            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br><br>I'm here to ask for advice and opinions on the problems I'm facing now. Thank you in advance to whoever can help me.<br><br>I've shin pain after running since BMT but simply endure through it thinking that it's the usual muscle soreness. However, after entering OCS and a 5km run that resulted in the same pain but with higher intensity and longer duration, I was out of coursed on a visit to the medical centre. The MO diagnosed me with 'Bilateral Medial Tibial Stess Syndrome (MTSS)', which after some 'googling' on my own, I realised what it was. An overused injury that with rest, I had a chance of recoursing for the next batch.<br><br>In addition, I was refered to AH's Sports Medicine which the specialist there confirmed my condition and enforced the 2 months excused RMJ given by the MO. He referred me to the physiotherapist. Also, he informed me that my feet overpronation was causing and aggravating my condition and prescribed me special insoles to wear.<br><br>During the first session of therapy, she evaluated me and informed that my injury was quite bad and that my overpronation is not that good either, to which I think she meant the severity. After the deep friction massage, she told me that I had naturally tight muscles as well which also contributed to my injury and taught me several stretching exercises.<br><br>Then, during later sessions, she had asked me to run to evaluated my recovery on the treadmill. At 5 minutes into the run, I would start to feel ache and tightness in my left leg of the calfs and the anterior muscles. Numbness would set in after 5 minutes and I would be told to stop. Twice this has happened and I could only run/jog for 10 minutes max. On thinking back, this was the same sensation, apart from the pain after the run, that I also felt when I embarked on that fateful 5 km run. She told me that I might have compartment syndrome on hearing my complains about the ache and numbness in addition to the pain from the MTSS after the run. This was later verified by her in massage sessions.<br><br>At the latest specialist review, he told me that I do have compartment syndrome and that my MTSS was not easing. He refused to allow me to recourse OCS, gave me a memo to pass to the MO asking for 3 more months of excuse RMK as well as a podiatrist referral letter!<br><br>After checking out what was 'Chronic Exertional Left Anterior Compartment Syndrome' as stated by the specialist when I got home, I was thinking I might as well be down PES-ed because, what I read online, an invasive surgery would be the only effective and rapid treatment while conventional treatment (conditioning, strengthening, slow easing back into exercise but ultimately rigorous exercise would have to be given up) would take longer time and not 100% effective. On passing the memo to the MO during FFI, I was deemed unfit and given the 3 months excused RMJ.<br><br>What I'm worried about now is that because my eligibility for recourse has been taken from me, I've heard that might just be posted out to Combat Medics or Combat Signallers anytime, which I find ridiculous because I'll just be out of course all the same and waste more time as an OOC, albeit of another course. Apart from feeling saddened at being unable to go through OCS, I now worry for my legs as well.<br><br>Currently, I'm set for more physiotherapy, a podiatry review at end of December and the sports medicine specialist review at end January. If I can recover, that would be great and I'll just take it as fate that OCS is not for me. However, if I am supposed to or eligible for down pes, I'll be able to retain the current job that I enjoy, seeing that my superior too would like to retain me if the chance offers.<br><br>I don't know whether the articles I've read online are reliable or that I've interpreted them properly, or that my injuries don't warrant a down pes. That's why I'm posting my problem here because I want to know if I should push for a down pes with the specialist(s) help.<br><br>I hope this post is not too long because I've been feeling frustrated for the medical personnel that I'm seeing are not giving me chance to voice my concerns and ask for answers.</div>

However, if I am supposed to or eligible for down pes, I'll be able to retain the current job that I enjoy, seeing that my superior too would like to retain me if the chance offers.<br><br>I don't know whether the articles I've read online are reliable or that I've interpreted them properly, or that my injuries don't warrant a down pes. That's why I'm posting my problem here because I want to know if I should push for a down pes with the specialist(s) help.<br><br>I hope this post is not too long because I've been feeling frustrated for the medical personnel that I'm seeing are not giving me chance to voice my concerns and ask for answers.</div></blockquote>This is a really long post. The medical side i can't say much, hopefully eac can when hes around. Not sure what are your exact queries with the lack of ? but i'll try base on what i know which can be wrong sometimes though.<br><br>As long as you are not eligible for recourse, they will post you out but to where its hard to say. Its hard for them to keep you whether you get revocated or down PES unless some big shot there is going to talk to CPC and revocate you as a clerk or whatever and post you there.<br><br>If you want to down PES and do not want to go into a combat vocation which might affect your problem, talk to your specialist to prepare a letter saying you are unfit for combat vocations and get the MO to declare you unfit for combat so you can be posted to logistic vocations where the need to run etc is much lower.<br><br>If i miss out anything, feel free to ask.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, my questions and their anwsers actually affect each other. Firstly, I need to know whether my condition warrants a down pes so that i can take the next step and ask for help in retaining my current position. Also, I was looking for a second opinion on my medical condition, especially when the one I have to see seems more bothered to finish the paper work and get me out of the office.</div>

Each unit has a specific estab for the number of personel they have so i won't say the hopes are high unless your side happens to have some clerk or whatever ORD and your unit can try put you as that person's replacement.<br><br>I would say that if your specialist recommends a down PES there is a very high chance you will get it as often medical board will accept specialist's recommendations. If your specialist do not feel you can downgrade then theres little hope for a downgrade in my opinion.</div>

(a similiar case i saw is this guy with "runners's knee" condition, temp downgrade review every 3 months... only with ord time then given the perm status.)<br><br>as for retaining ur present temp vocation, all u have to do is to persuade an officer/encik to speak to and with a recommendation letter/ OA email to ur unit manpower branch's chief clerk/ s1 officer to retain u... the chief clerk / manpower officer have the right to retain u with recommendations as it is the liaison department between the unit and the mindef CPC.</div>

If there is none then theres no way you can be kept with them since there is no estab for you. If there is 1, you can check with the the likelihood of them being able to keep you since such things are more between the officers and how they want to handle it.<br><br>Get as much information as you can about your condition and also do reconsider whether you really want to recourse in OCS if the specialist say you might be able to recover since the tough training might caused the injury to reoccur or even get worse. Its not worth it to cause any serious injury on yourself for 2 years NS as some injuries are for life.<br><br>If its inevitable that you have to post out sooner or later, what i feel is you might as well try to down PES and get posted somewhere else earlier. Reason being its better to go somewhere early and learn your new work than be posted later and higher chances of your upper study going to ORD soon or worse already ORD so noone to train you. My understudies had about 10 days to learn everything to take over my work. Considering i'm the only expert in the entire camp on the systems, i needed to train them very hard. 1 person brokedown due to all the stress but i could only just counsel him and he still had to carry on since time was limited.<br><br>eac mentioned SSU but somehow i don't think that is where you are and if you were to post there, i don't think it would make you feel any different from posting out.</div>
