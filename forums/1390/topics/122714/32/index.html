              <p><br>clearly, no case for downgrade. even for drug allergies. drug allergies just notify medical centre to update ur medical records.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so far when i was in ns, this common antibiotics is still in use in the medical centre and any govt polyclinics... and the memo u had is 'just to inform' mo that u taking this drug while in ns.<br><br>if u still think u have a case valid for medical board, then prove to a specialist to write a memo for taking this drug renders u unable to work while in ns.<br><br>if after serveral yrs of taking this drug to treat ur ance, and it still not better, then switch to other many antibiotics for ance. e.g. doxycycline. an example.</p>

              <p><br>its better and strongly recommended to declare ur present and past medical conditions to the cmpb mo truthfully and honestly. ns is only 2 years... some injuries, or possible further injuries to worsen ur present condition is <strong>FOR LIFE.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>u have night blindness... u ever thought  of night training with the very minimal use of torchlight, and a faint glow of lightstick.<br><br>u have hearing problem... u ever thought of live firing. even with the use of a pair of ear buds, the firing at close range with the eye at the scope, the ears to the firing chamber. u may go deaf sooner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>pes is based on PULHEEMS code. go wikipedia it, its worldwide used in the armed forces. ur HEE is already affected. Hearing, left Eye, right Eye.<br><br>ocs and sispec is based on selection, not by interest expressed.</p>
