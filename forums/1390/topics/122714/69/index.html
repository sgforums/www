              <p>SAF getting lame la. Last time we auto techs say if war dun wan use rifle, we slowly throw the tools in our toolbox also can kill a few ppl. Ask a PES E who cannot touch the rifle do wat i wonder. The baton and shield is a total joke. These days got ppl wan attack the camp, if they believe the baton n shield is usable, i think they are still thinking people now fight with wooden sticks...</p>

              <p>There are alot of clerks that are stayin. Stayout is a privillge given to few so don't hope for it. Its the camp that you are posted to that determines you stay in or stay out.</p>

              <p>Don' t try to keng, go read some of the recent post in this forum and you will see what happens to kengsters. Clerks are definitely not the slackest vocation out there much to 'popular belief'. Everyone just thinks clerks is the slackest because it sounds the slackest.</p>

              <p>I used to be a PES A but after i ord, I was downgraded to PES E9L9 in 2004 as i was suffering from depression. I had to seek treatment at IMH and was put on regular medication and consultation.</p>
              <p>In year 2008, i have recovered from my depression and no longer need to be on medication. I am thinking of upgrading my PES status as during my last 2 ICT, i even volunteer to go for outfield exercise. I feel that i am as normal and fit as everyone else in my reservist unit and do not wish to have the E9L9 status showing in my medical report.</p>
              <p>Pls advise what will be my chances of upgrading and what PES status will they upgrade me to? Thank you all.</p>

              <p>No. and low chance so do not bother.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Depression patient is bounded to have relapse in the future in the event of stress. Imagine you are now you are outfield in Australia, have not bathe for days, and thristy, hungry, wet, sleep deprivation,  tired + having live rounds. Combat Stress + Depression, might set you shooting every1 and throwing grenade at your own people and yourself. And it is beyond your control and unaware.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They have been numerous cases of depression relapse, and usually the relapse is much worse than the first occurence. Usually the patient is not conscientiously aware and please get the family members and friends to look out for the patient.</p>

              <p>U will go through the normal PES C BMT with all the PES C ppl regardless C1 or C9. U will be excused certain activities base on ur excuses. Outfield, route marches etc etc are all as per normal except PES C9 does not need to stay overnight outfield (unless ur OC decides to force u to like at least 1 batch i know). Route march is also restricted to 10km instead of 24km.</p>
              <p>Theres alot of vocations PES C can enter, clerk is just 1 out of the long list. PES C vocations have been answered so many times already that i don't want to repeat, please go READ all the past posts as PES C posts are SUPER frequent.</p>

              <p><br>hey,</p>
              <p>so how significant will the difference be between my BMT and ordinary PES A/B BMT? Since I am L2 and not L3 or L9 does that mean I have to do more stuff? And the MO never write any specific excuses on the piece of paper I was given...so how does that impact my BMT?</p>

              <p>If you are doing A Levels or IB, and you get 3 or 4
              distinctions/or a 38, then you stand a chance to become an
              assistant chief clerk or admin supervisor or project clerk (like
              help out in the 2010 NDP). </p>
              <p>Also, it's not the PES status that determines your vocation, but
              rather, the medical conditions that constitute(s) to your PES.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>As with the past, don't give ppl such hopes when the chances are damn low la. How many assistance chief clerks or admin superviors are there in the whole SAF, divide it by the number of people in each intake as well as waiting for ppl to ORD for u to replace, the odds are really low.</p>
