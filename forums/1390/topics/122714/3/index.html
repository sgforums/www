The unit will request for ppl with unqiue skills not the other way round.<br><br>3.) Err....can't comment on this because I ORD for quite some time liao.<br><br>4.)

I dun think SAF will call u up after u ORD for the obvious reasons: Too expensive liao and furthermore, (this is my thinking only), u are a liability to them more than an asset.</div>

Ur G.P. (the male lot) are mostly MO during their NS time, so u can check with them.<br><br>I will try to help answer some of ur qns:-<br>I fracture my arm too but unless ur fracture is very serve it does not play much effect to the outcome of ur PES.

Believe me, wanting to go to a xiong unit because u feel like it is definately not strong reasons. And you must also think from the SAF perspective, if anyone su-ga su-ga want to change vocations/unit then SAF where got authority.<br><br>If u die die want to go into combat, sign on lor.
