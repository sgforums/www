              <p><br>I am not sure about the Pes grading. What I know that medical officers have strict guidelines to follow when recommending for pes status and it will be decided based on your medical condition and the treatment too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pes status can only be changed during a medical board whereby a chairman who is a doctor too will endorse the Pes status recommended by the medical officers after some discussion.</p>

              <p><br>no need to say friend one, as others mentioned and predicted most of the time, 99% say friend is in fact, himself/herself. just to shy to say it's oneself who actually has it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cholinergic urticaria is under the classification of the collectively 'hives' grouping. (according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholinergic_urticaria">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholinergic_urticaria</a>)</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>so for pes, pls refer to the above similar hives answer already on this page.</p>

              <p>Undergone <span>arthroscopic surgery in late Jan 08. The doctor told me that my avulsied mensicus is not worth to repair using open surgery. The inflamed torn tissue is trimed off. I am currently PES B.<br> </span></p>
              <p>Can i be downgraded?</p>
              <p>Should I go for a second opinion? I fear of complications arising from the condition.</p>
              <p>Injury report is filed during BMT and the top portion of it is retained in the interview booklet.</p>

              <p>for service injury cases, u can call 6373-1144/6373-1163. its a general enquiry line, just tell them specifically and get them to transfer ur line to the correct department. if ur service injury case is approved, it will have a record just by telling the correct person-in-charge ur ic no. everything is searchable by info system queries nowadays. it should be under the manpower division, service benefits br. here: <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/dmg/mp/abt_mpdiv/entities_mp_policy.htm">http://www.mindef.gov.sg/dmg/mp/abt_mpdiv/entities_mp_policy.htm</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but if its a case of admin lapses by ur unit, go directly to ur s1 manpower br, and ask the chief clerk.</p>

              <p>9th Army Maintenance Base. Basically your unit is involved in repairing SAF vehicles (Land Rover, 3 ton, 5 ton etc) that units are unable to repair (base level job). Think of it as a really big car workshop with a lot of vehicles to fix up. So your guys will be doing all the chim stuff that unit cannot do because they lack the equipment or expertise or whatnot. What vocation are you posted in as?</p>

              <p>i'm serving NS right now, current PES status c1l1 due to weak ligaments.</p>
              <p>recently my back aches have been coming back esp after running/long periods of time standing or walking. every year i get about 1 - 2 "crippling backaches". i will feel a severe sharp &amp; dull pain on my lower back at the same time lasting at least 15 - 20 mins followed by an 'aura' that feels like a watered down version of the ordeal which will last 1 - 2 days. during the 15-20 mins, i will have to find a seat and have my back completely arched as i cannot bear the pain even when i'm in that position, needless to say if i were to continue walking. for the next couple days i will continue to experience lower back aches.</p>
              <p>i think the backaches were the results of an injury i sustained when i was younger. but because i did not seek medical help, i did not have any documents to support during the medical checkup before enlistment. and since as NSFs we are entitled to medical benefits i'm now thinking of going to see a (orthopaedic?) specialist via a referral from the polyclinic/MO. </p>
              <p>any bros out there experience the same back aches, have seek treatment before and know what medical condition it is? will i get a further downgrade?</p>

              <p>u better go wikipedia.org to research... if ur major lower limb sciatic nerve is affected, then very jia liak liao....</p>
              <p><br>yes, u r strongly advised to get the polyclinic/saf referral letter to see a govt hospital orthopaedic specialist.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if not in camp, the pain strikes, just GO to any govt hospital A&amp;E, just show 11b and the cost incurred is all borned by saf...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>most common spinal problems i have seen b4 such as slipped/ruptured/buldging discs often get c2 and below. degenerative disc or more serious ones get c9 and below.</p>

              <p>if u want a faster one, u can either go thru the polyclinic route and have another appt time scheduled OR report at a&amp;e... the appt schedule for a&amp;e is usually faster than poly/saf referral, based on emergency priority.</p>
