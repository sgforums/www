            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, i'm concern about my medical status and want to know likely which PES i'll be in. Here's my condition:<br><br>-FlatFoot<br>-Mild Hypertension(High Blood Pressure)<br><br>Here's the process of my Medical Examination:<br><br>1)I booked my appointment for medical examination and started collecting all my medical reports including the above 2. I got a letter from the SGH podiatrist for my flatfoot and a letter from my GP regarding my Hypertension as my GP is the one reviewing my BP for a long time.<br><br>2)I went for the Medical Examination on the appointment date and go through all the normal precedure. I thought i'm gg to be given a PES status on the spot but i wasn't. The MO gave me a PES D for 3 mths and asked me to get an update of my condition from my GP and podiatrist and told me to ask both my doctors whether my condition can recover in 2-3 weeks  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> ...<br><br>3)I went back and get the update from both my doctors and went back to the MO in 1 mth time. The MO then send me for a 24hr Ambulatory Blood Pressure Measurement(ABP). So i have to go back for this thing on a next day.<br><br>4)Back on another day for the ABP in the morning and then go back home for the measurement and go back to the CMPB the next day to remove the device. (Btw, its a pain in the ass for the ABP becoz its like a person strangling your arm for 24hrs haha and more imptly, i am not allowed to bath <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> ).<br><br>5)After the ABP is removed, spoke to the MO and i was told that my condition is quite bad as my Blood Pressure is constantly high(including my heart beat rate). So i got send to a specialise in NUH and again given a PES D.<br><br>6)I went to the hospital and the doctor there agrees that my BP has been high and wanted to know about my heart beat status. So this time she's going to send me for a AECG(Ambulatory ECG) to measure my 24hr heartbeat. I booked an appointment and is going but i was told by CMPB to go back and get a letter from them so the consultation will be free. So i went back to the CMPB and get the letter.<br><br>7)My appointment for the AECG is coming and i have to go NUH to put on the device. And have to go back the next day to remove the device(No bathing again!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> OMG haha).<br><br>8 )Then the appointment to consult the specialise is not on the same day with the removal of the device so i have to go back to NUH for another appointment.<br><br>That's my condition now... can i know briefly what my PES status will be?</div>

Why? Didn't you book your next appointment? what's your reason for PES D?<br><br>For me, i book an appointment immediately after i got my PES D everytime i went back~ Read my post and see how many time i went back to CMPB. I booked an appointment everytime~<br><br>I think you better call back to CMPB to double comfirm. And better call back a few times at different time, coz sometimes the ppl there dun answer properly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys i just recently found out about this forum. Was directed here by another singapore forum.<br><br>I already ord. For around 6 years. About 3 yrs ago i had a corneal ulcer in my right eye that was very painful. During all that time as was not called up for reservist did not bother to get a specialist letter. This year was asked to go back to camp to update particulars, which i did. After that  I went to get a specialist letter from the national eye center. This is because i have a deep corneal ulcer in my right eye that affects my vision so that i can see outlines only from my right eye. My left eye is fine except that it has a 500 degrees. So you can see that i have coordination problems etc cos of my eye problem.<br><br>Here is the procedure:<br><br>MO stated that i do not need an appointment. I guess as i am now an nsman and a civilian maybe that's why (is this true?) So i showed him my letter. Apparently he had a chart there and he said something along the lines of pes C9 or something like that. He got a clerk to write down my specialist letter word for word and copied it into the computer, later the clerk photocopied my letter and then the letter was returned to me. I was given an excuse ippt for 2 months. He asked for my particulars, contact number etc etc. Then he said my camp would contact me.<br><br>Here are my questions:<br><br>How long does it take for the medical board to come to a decision?<br><br>Does the MO that you saw that day have any say in the decision making of your pes status? The MO merely copied down the letter that i had into a pc and also rejected 2 other letters that i brought because he said one letter stated that i was seeing the specialist for further review and another did not have a specific case. I read in one of the posts that even if the MO or some clerk or puts in a special request the final decision is still up to the board.<br><br>It has been 1/1/2 weeks since i last saw the MO, how long does one normally have to wait. ARe there different criteria for reservists and active service men?<br><br>I was a pes A RP and in fact did not take any sick leave during that time and even during BMT or on course, but it seems they do not even have that record in my e-ns website, maybe they have a record that only higher ups in mindef can see?<br><br>Sorry i was a bit out of topic, but what do u think of my situation? What kind of circumstances influence the decisions of the medical board? IS the decision based on one man or based on voting by each board member? Also does the kind of specialist affect their decision? Like an associate professor's reccomandation be taken more into account than a newly appointed specialist?<br><br>Is there only one national medical board that oversees all the NS ppl in singapore or a few boards? SO the head of the board is a lpt-col/col MO as i read from here, is he  also some kind of specialist or asso prof in hospitals or is he just purely based in the army?<br><br>SOrry for being so long winded, it was just that these questions popped into my head while typing this<br></div>

Usually (ususally) holding dual roles, as a doctor and as a MO. He/she (ususally COL/LTC) holds the most power to decides. Of course, a doctor well-known in the medical community does hold some weight in influencing the outcome but in the end it will be up to the chairman.</div>
