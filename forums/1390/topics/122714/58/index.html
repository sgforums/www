              <p>Sine you going to ORD soon, its unlikely they will relocate your position.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, one u ORD and your PES status is revert back to higher status... A B C range... it is likely your vocation will be different when u are called back for reservist.</p>

              <p>You will be required to review your status before you ORD and as long as its temp, it has to be renewed. If you upPES, you might be revocated but since you only went for PES E BMT, there are limited vocations they can revocate you to if at all.</p>

              <p>Technicians still need to be able to shoot and still go for range, outfield exercises etc. Those who did not complete BMT etc are given technical handling lessons and test in unit before range to qualify them for range.</p>

              <p>PES C BMT is generally slack and the activities involves depends on the reason you got PES C and you excuses etc. As long as you no excuse firearms,you will learn to fire a rifle.</p>
              <p>This depends on whether you get C9L9 for what medical condition and what excuses you might have since this will affect your vocation.</p>
              <p>C9L9 mostly is vocations in CSS and you are generally stuck at CPL unless you manage to be a transport spec/supply spec/tech spec</p>
