              <p><br>It is dependable on the % of PD and the payout is equivalent to the civil law "Workmen Compensation Act"</p>

              <p>Thanks!</p>
              <p>But I don't really understand how the amount is calculated. There is a Max and Minimum payout but how am I suppose to know mine is a max or minimum?</p>
              <p>By the way, I was told by the Medical Board that I have a 18% permanent disability.</p>

              <p>hi, just wanted to try asking anyone here because i don't know what problem am i having... ever since enlistment to BMT, after some weeks of training, i will feel some sort of stress in both of my legs.</p>
              <p>At first I went to see specialist and i said that my hip there is pain so he wrote "hip stress", and subsequently i got OOTed (after 8 weeks in BMT). However, since then I realised my pain has been like jumping around from kneecaps to hips, never really staying fixed. Yep.</p>
              <p>And actually I've already been resting for a few weeks already because I got excuse footwear the prior week but it has not recovered. Also, if I wear slippers to go out, I'll be walking with pain (has not happened before BMT), but the specialist say I don't have flat foot, so cannot give anything.</p>
              <p>But anyway, yeah I just want to see if anyone have any idea what problem is this since I think go specialist say here pain there pain he will just say my muscles are strained, but it's already been a few weeks already leh like not recovering...</p>
              <p><br>currrently PES B btw</p>

              <p>Dear all, I have the following medical problems and I would really appreciate some advice on whether/how I should sound them off.</p>
              <p>1. I experience chest tightness, shortness of breath and feel light headed during intense physical activities. I have fainted twice when I was young and my granny died recently of heart problems. I have seen a specialist and he suspected me of mvp, thick heart walls, extra sound and leaking valves through ECG and preliminary observation. However, the an echo test showed no problems with the heart structure. I'm genuinely worried that something might happen to be if I were to keep exerting myself.</p>
              <p>2. I sneeze excessively and frequently experience blocked nose and frontal headache under dusty environments. My (maternal) aunt and uncle have lost their sense of smell after similar problems. A doctor did a skin-prick test and concluded that I have allergic rhnitis and that I'm allergic to dust. Another doctor concluded that I have "deviated nasal septum, turbinate hypertrophy and nasal neuralgic headache". All the sprays and medication that they gave did not seem to work.</p>
              <p>3. I injured my left wrist after repeated strains and a fall during a bike course. Then I realised my wrist is visibly not aligned witih my palm so I'm not sure f this is a natural deformity that makes me prone to wrist injuries or if it's a result of the fall/strains. My wrist and arm hurts alot with lateral movement, even during simple movements like pushing the door. I'm still observing my conditions to see if it will get better or worse. </p>
              <p><br>Thanks so much!!</p>
              <p>p.s. I'm pes A btw.</p>

              <p>Hi. I am a JC2 student, going to sit for A lvls in November and going to be enlisted next year. I just saw my orthopeadic doctor who diagnosed me with bilateral shin stress injuries based on my bone scan results. He said such a condition can be recovered and also said that the SAF may not downgrade me and instead, ask me to enlist later. Does that mean that I even if I have not recovered, I will still not be downgraded?</p>
              <p>If so, which PES am I most likely to be downgraded to? (I also have nose allergy and partial colour blindness)</p>

              <p>You'll most likely is within PES C1 or C2 range.<br>However, as others mentioned, you may also be PES B, with excuse RMJ.<br><br>Whatever the medical conditions, just get the doctor to write you medical memos for all your medical conditions and hand them over to the MO for Medical Board's assessment and final decision. Since it's the sole decision of the medical board for determining your PES, it's of no use to play the guessing game now...</p>
