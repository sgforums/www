              <p><br>for pes status definition, go read page 1 of this thread...<br><br>for nil, it just means u r fit to perform normal duties/vocations under pes c9l3 category.<br><br>e.g. some common excuses others have: excuse heavy loads, excuse upper limbs, excuse lower limbs...etc...etc.</p>

              <p><br>it maybe, maybe not.<br>for this, u would have to clarify with the MOPA who mostly do these typing in PACES2, as IIRC, u mentioned somewhere that u r a medic.<br><br>or u can also read ur own medical stuff in PACES2, as it's ur own case file anyway, provided when u have access to PACES2 log in.</p>

              <p>I have a question regarding duration of BMT. </p>

              <p>2) If a recruit does not attain gold/dilver for NAPFA he attends an additional 4 weeks of PTP right? So what happens if he is both obese and did not attain silver/gold?</p>
