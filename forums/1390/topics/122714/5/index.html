Those are pes A-B vocations.   Logistician is very likely... especially if they feel u got good organizational skills. (eg checking ur sock drawer)  So if u are really dat good, and have the educational qualifications, they MAY send u for a logistic specialists course.<br><br>C9 most prob wont have to do guard duty, unless its damn lobo one.  Depnds on the unit lar.<br><br>and the difference between combat n service pay assuming same rank is a couple  hundred dollars difference.  ORDed quite recently, so should still be about $100-200 difference.</div>
