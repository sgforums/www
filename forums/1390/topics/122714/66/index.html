              <p>If your specialist did not recommend a downgrade. It means he does not feel your condition requires 1. Unless you are willing to seek a 2nd opinion with another specialist, asking here won't be of much use since the MOs will only look at a specialist memo and not what people on forums say.</p>

              first up, the "pink bible" is called the DOD. 
              
              Your specialist merely has to state what condition you have. 
              
              The MO will check against the DOD.
              
              If it's inside, he'll d/g you. If not, he'll not. 
              
              the specialist doesn't have to explicitly state "downgrade this guy"
              
              you yourself can sound out to the MO. He'll check.

              <p>I was Medically boards more than 6 times in 2 years. Other than the 1st memo that stated downgrade me, other all don't have. But I still managed to downgrade from C2L2 to C9L2 to C9L3 and E9L9.</p>
              <p>My last pes status when i got it didn't mention anything much in the memo, just some old facts and my current condition. It also mentioned that i should get C9L3. But the MO seeing my medical condition, telling me that he don't agreed with the pes status from my specialist and recommend me E9L9 and ask me not to attend the MB.</p>
              <p>FYI, my medical condition is not written down in the pink bible ( DOD ). How do I know ? Coz i was seen by a reservist MO before and told me my condition not inside and he don't know wat to do. Then the main MO came back and recommended me E9L9.</p>
              <p>From my experience, there are no fix medical problem that can secure Pes E.  As long as MO feels that the condition of the patient may cause very serious problem or even death. They will recommend for it.</p>
              <p>One more thing to add. Skin problem normally specialist will not recommend for downgrade. They will just write their analyse and your current condition and MO will understand it as all these are written inside the DOD. So i hope those downgraders not be discourage just becoz the word DOWNGRADE is not written in the memo. Most important is you really have a medical problem and the right words are written in the memo. Your Medical condition being the most important.</p>

              <p>For each 1 of u that gets a downgrade regardless with or without specialist recommendation, there are many others who do not get a downgrade despite specialist recommendation. The way you write makes it seem so simple that i feel alot will have false hope about getting downgrade.</p>

              <p>As long as u have a medical condition, u have a chance to get downgraded. I tried for 2 years as my condition worsen. If it is so simple, i wont have taken 2 years. Most importantly, i am trying to let ppls know, if  u really have a problem and don get downgraded the first time , don give up. As long as u have a true case, you have a chance. One MO in this forum told me before, condition can change over time. So they will revise you as long as your condition has changed. Tat's wat happen in my case.</p>

              <p>Revocation takes weeks as suitable slots have to be found for revocation. Its not you want to revocate straight away can revocate so just wait till the revocation letter arrives. Asking anyone to help also no use. Sometimes you just have to wait for someone to ORD or close to ORD for you to take their place.</p>
