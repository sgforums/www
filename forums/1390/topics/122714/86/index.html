              <p>However , i would like to voice out the concerns of my buddy's health as it seemed particularly  serious . Prior to his enlistment , he went to the specialist to seek consultation for his skin problem and diagnosis-ed with severe eczema ( dun know how to spell the correct term ) Originally , he was put out of training (OOT) by the MO at the Pualu Tekong Medical Centre  after he shown them the necessary documents , including the specialist's memo .  But , after the CO interview with advices from the high-ranking MO( another high ranking MO at the MC ) , he was stripped off the OOT status  arguing that his condition wasn't serious enough to put on OOT status . </p>
              <p>Immediately , he went back to see the MO regarding the medical condition . In the end , he was merely excused for  No . 4 and Dusty environment . </p>
              <p>The question remains unanswered : </p>
              <p>1) If he was given OOT status(with specialist's memo, of course ) by the MO (first) , can it be overruled by some other high-ranking MO ?</p>
              <p>2) Who actually wield the power to grant the OOT status ?</p>
              <p>3) If he has severe eczema , why hasnt he granted another medical review ? ( the MO said the condition was normal and non life threatening and rejected the numerous request for medical review )</p>

              <p><br>1) Yes, of course, a higher rank Senior MO is a specialist by higher medical qualifications and experience where he has already earned a Masters / PhD in a medical specialisation. Therefore, a higher authority can and have the vested powers to overwrite.</p>
              <p>2) The Medical Centre - Convened thru Medical Board.</p>
              <p>3) Urge to go get a stronger-worded specialist memo and then, re-apply. As usual, the "No specialist memo, no talk" rule still applies...</p>

              <p>Usually you will be asked to book a date online. If you have friends just go together, cause it will be a long one. Lots of stations there i think around 9. Urine testing, blood, IQ, ECG, X ray, Teeth, Hearing, Eye sight, Height and weight bla bla bla.</p>
              <p>At the end, you will be asked to go to a room. And thats the time you tell him your conditions, and of course remove pants check..... =)  Whole thing takes around 5 hours, so book early, i mean timing wise.</p>
              <p>NAPFA doesnt determine pes, your medical checkup does. K thats all about it.</p>

              <p>NAPFA taken at school can push back your NS for 2 months.</p>
              <p>If you are heng, on that day no people will be there. If you are suai, a horde of people will be there. Pro tip is book around 9am slot, or even 8. Have your nice cosy breadfast with your friend then go there. Usually you wont be allowed to choose stations, but i guess you can skip here and there. Longest being the IQ test(3 hours ? or 4), where they have some computer, 200 questions all repeated. Second pro tip is do not tikam, might affect your vocation really.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Last thing is, if you have a eye problem, tell it to the eye station, ear problem to ear station etc etc</p>
