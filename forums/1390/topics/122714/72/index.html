              <p>I know a Navy Submarine officer (2 Crabs) who have often shoulder delocation, his Pes status is surely C2/C9 but N1. I dont think it is a joke. These vocation does not require much physical fitness, but more of mental power.</p>

              <p>Most examples are all of relatively senior officers and not junior officers or for your case, OCT so it could be a different case since senior officers do more staff work than junior officers do.</p>

              <p>Have u ORD? If u have ORD means your PES status should not be reviewed anymore since its a perm PES. If u still in service, the last PES review will be during ur ORD FFI though its unlikely a perm PES E9L9 will be changed to anything else since there should  be a good enough reason to give u that PES which is the closest to F u can get.</p>

              <p>wah... even which branch cannot disclose &gt;.&lt; but for job

              domain]</p>
              <p>so u signed during enlistment but before u POP right? [u were
              recommended by your PC in BMT for OCS if im not wrong?]</p>
              <p>there are still many things that can be done = u need not be
              chiong sua-ing or whatever, but instead take part in other
              important roles that will be helpful. it's not as if u literally
              hide one corner like the poster above u mentioned... those
              stationed in the base will still be involved in combat in their
              base and/or the surrounding areas.</p>

              <p>Nah I singed during OCS, like kena brainwashed. I also dont know how I got into OCS. Like random only, I thought my performance will only get me to SISPEC which is good enough already.</p>
              <p>If I don't do chiong-sua I only can be admin, and admin don't get promotions as fast as the combat people, so if I become admin for 6 years, I probably will be drawing the same pay for 6 years. Wheres the point in that right? Might as well go outside and find a job.</p>

              <p>for reg... admin positions not so much.. [usually done by DXOs nowadays] usually logistics/combat support would be more for u if your medical is not helping u at all... but promotion still more or less about the same [provided your job isnt dangerous; putting your men at risk]. so when posted to OCS, did u change your wing [service] or still remain as it is?</p>

              <p>If its only a temp excuse and you are fit for everything but pullup and pushup, a down PES should be unlikely. Even for BMT, most of the major activties should have been over by now and very likely for you to be OOC at this stage.</p>
              <p>Depending on SISPEC/OCS, you might be OOC from them immediately even if you qualify if they deem your problem would affect their training since they will rarely keep a person for 6 months to wait for the end of his status. However that might not be too likely.</p>
              <p>You should be able to get into any vocation since your excuse would not excuse you from any vocation.</p>
