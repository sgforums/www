              <p>The MO at CMPB is there only to assess your PES status. His purpose there is not there for medical consultaion. So you shouldn't really ask his to refer you to any specialist for anything. He'll only do so if it is to fulfill his purpose to determine your PES.</p>
              <p>Bring whatever documents you have when you go to the check up. If you know you have a medical conditions, and you have had someone look at it before, bring them too. If you highlight this only then and say you lost/don't have/cant be bothered to bring the documents, then all the MO can do is send you to a specialist to assess and wait for a response. </p>
              <p>It'll only delay the process and your enlistment. If you have loads of free time, then by all means. But i recommend just bring the documents and give to the MO. Let him do his job.</p>
              <p>The MO is not hell-bent to send everyone to the frontline. If you think you shouldnt be whatever PES. Then let him know, he'll consider this while making his professional opinion.</p>
              <p>He IS a professional doctor y'know.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I'm a pre-enlistee with a PES B status. I have a very sensitive nose. I frequently have nose blocks and excessive mucus that happens for no particular reasons and i have difficulty breathing. I've previously seen a GP at a private clinic and he mentioned that one nosril of mine is smaller than the other. He has prescribed me oral pills and nasal sprays that don't work much for my nasal problems. I often suffer from insomnia because i have difficulty breathing at night. Since then I have not seen any specialist yet but i would just like to find out if any form of nasal issues would allow me to downpes from PES B. thanks</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">I just received my letter and I've been graded a Perm Pes E9L9.. I have two questions and I really need your advice on it.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I've got a number of ailments..</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I was diagnosed with IgA nephropathy (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgA_nephropathy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgA_nephropathy</a>) when I was 18… Ever since then I have been on lifelong medication and will continue to be until I die…</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Now because of the fall. I had Rhabdomyolysis (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhabdomyolysis#Non-physical_causes">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhabdomyolysis#Non-physical_causes</a>)</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I had a fractured pelvic bone as well as my scaphoid bone located in my wrist that lead to me going through surgery to putting a screw in and taking it out...</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I have 24 points of numbness along my legs due to the fall my nerves tore and have not been restored even after 4 years…</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I have gait difficulty (walk difficulty) so I walk with a bad limp everywhere I go, because I’m unable to feel my left leg at all.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I also suffer from Bowel and Urinary Incontinence<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_incontinence">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_incontinence</a><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence</a></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">All these have been written down in my memos given to by two specialists…</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">However I’m still perplexed as to why I’m still graded <em>PES E9L9 Permanent</em>.<br>I’m already having so much difficulty coping with my life…</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Having to limp quickly to the toilet at the slightest need to go to the washroom.<br>I have to even carry around extra clothes just in case I can’t get there in time.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I get so tired easily walking around because of my limp, and I have High Blood Pressure due to my condition of IgA nephropathy. It’s a really tough time for me to lead a normal life and I don’t understand why our army is so in need of manpower that they still have to draft me into it.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">And what tops it all is the MO telling me that he can only grade me Pes E9L9 because my conditions are common… He has had no idea how it is like to live in my shoes. I’ve had depression from my conditions and I too declared this to my MO, but it doesn’t matter.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> What I wanted to ask if there was anything that you guys could advice me on how I can genuinely try and push for a Pes F? How should I go about doing it and what are the procedures to doing so? I have not gotten my posting yet and I’m still waiting for the date, if it comes to the point that I must still serve, I will serve as best as I can, but I really feel that the army needs to be fair to me as well and truly understand my difficulties. Can anyone please give me some advice on what I can do now?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Also another thing that I want to ask is what are the chances of me being able to be posted near to my home?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> I called the CMPB hotline and shared with them my health conditions. They said that by right they do not allow people to choose but due to my predicament they will look into it. Anyone have any idea of the chances that I would be posted near my place if I don't get Pes F?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Thanks</p>

              <p> well...</p>
              <p>think they really lack of manpower</p>
              <p>me Pes E also runner le</p>
              <p>but is ok because i already MR</p>
              <p>I suggest u go to ur spec to write a much stronger memo</p>
              <p>if all fails.. CMPB refuse to grade u to Pes E</p>
              <p>then u go down there to talk to them as in u really a camp</p>
              <p>thats near to ur place so that u can move around easily</p>

              <p>3Staples, </p>
              <p>I would recommend that you go to a specialist and get him to draft a letter specifically on why you are<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> not fit for service</span>. Not just one that highlights your conditions.</p>
              <p>I think this will help more.</p>
              <p>I understand that this is troublesome and may incur additinal costs, but i think this is the best way to go about doing it.</p>
              <p>Also, as Rednano say, bring your parents to appeal on this too. </p>
              <p>If you don't manage to get a PES F after all of this then i dont really know what else you can do.</p>

              <p><br>There's nothing else you can possibly do except to follow what're recommended as mentioned above. Even I will make the same advices as listed above like what Rednano had replied.<br><br>PES E9L9 Perm is already designated as an 8-5 office hours desk-bound Clerk vocation.<br><strong>It's already the least possible minimum you can do to contribute to NS, just like all male Singaporean sons.</strong><br><br>PES F is more to almost mentally and medically unfit for any form of service, for conditions examples: cancer, HIV/ AIDS, visually-handicapped, limbs amputated, bedridden-handicapped, severe mental disorders / total mental unsounded...etc.</p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>I have a questions to ask about my possible pes status for my state of health. It has been 4 months since I entered NS and I had already been hospitalized for 3 times already. The first time was before my pop week in bmt which made me missed out my pop, the second was when I am in sispec which made me ooc. The last time was 2 weeks before when I am a ooc for the sispec company I am in that time.</p>
              <p>I have a very sensitive nose since young and will be having blocked/running nose almost the whole day, I do have childhood asthma. And during training I feel that I have problem breathing or catching back my breathe. My skin are sensitive as well and has been becoming worse when I entered NS as a lot of red dots surfaced when I am going through bmt and has never go away till now. During my 3rd time of hospitalization, the doc told me that I have tonsillopharyngitis and referred me to ENT specialist.</p>
              <p>May I ask what kind of pes status I would likely to get from my problems? Thanks.</p>
