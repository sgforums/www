            <div class='col-md body'>I have a flat foot condition. I do not know how serious it will be classified as, but everytime i go running, my feet will hurt. And when i walk out of the swimming pool and see my footsteps, they are totally full foot prints, with no visible arch. When i went to the CGH podiatrist, she told me to take off my slippers and from her desk, she said " wow your foot is really flat, i can already see it from here". Yet later when i asked if it will affect my PES status, or if i could get a downgrade (im PES A now. I didnt mention flat foot during CMPB check), she said "NOPE". The thing is i also have knee problems (cartilage is wearing out) and im wondering if its related to my flat feet. The podiatrist prescribed insoles for me. But im worried about IPPT. Can anyone help me?<br><br>Sorry i posted again here cos i dont know which is the right thread for it. Pardon me please.</div>

If you are excuse range then it will depend on your unit to still sent you for guard duty carry baton and shield or duty clerk. Duties normally varies with unit and the type and number of manpower they have so its hard to be sure of anything until we know what unit and which camp you are posted to.<br><br>If you can get excuse heavy load and excuse upper limb permanent, most prob you will be excused from combat vocations and service side i think only service medic and clerk might be open to you or maybe the small arms division of MES.

Bring all your supporting documents to tekong and go see the MO there to explain your problems and request for the neccesssary excuses which now seems like will need include excuse firearms as well.<br><br>PES C1L1 is the most useless of the PES C so you better get the perm excuses once you get into tekong and if you really feel the need, can even ask the MO there whether you are really suited for C1L1 or can you downgrade further.<br><br>Anyway, i'm not a 'medical' specialist for humans... Those who are more knowledgable in this area are not around for some reason or ignoring this forum so all the advice and info i can give is what i know or guess but i can't give you any confirmation on everything as how the medical board side works is not something i know.</div>

C1 is in a way very close to a PES B.<br><br>Unless the MO has given you any excuses together with the PES C, its not going to help much.

CMPB MO not the first time anyhow give status and made people suffer. My time got 1 guy CMPB give PES B but he first day go in already fall sick and first training he injuried himself again. Less than 1 week he got OOT and i think after medical review, got downgrade to PES C9 or E.<br><br>I don't think your problem is serious enough to get a PES E so regardless you will still have to go for PES C BMT so it won't make that much of a difference since regardless PES C1 or C9, everyone goes for the same BMT but are excuse from the activities their status excuses them from.</div>

You will have to tahan the first day where you have to carry your civilian bag and your issued duffle bag n field pack filled with all your army stuff. That won't be light i though but i guess its unavoidable.<br><br>Route march, range etc won't happen till at late first week or second week so you should have already seen the MO. As long as your specialist has letters to prove your case, even if the MO does not give you a permanent excuse, he should give you a temporary excuse while he reconfirms your status etc.</div>
