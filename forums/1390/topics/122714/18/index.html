They probably have to check with your doctor details of your condition, likely prognosis etc...Hypothyroidism will lower your heart rate, not increase it. The MO is worried that the thyroxine you are taking might be a tad too much...<br><br>Likely pes status depends on how well your condition is being controlled etc...but I think probaby pes C...maybe C9L9...you will find out in time once the medical reports are back.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear MO,<br><br>I have just OOC'ed from guards AIT due to combination of pes planus and hallux vagus, which causes me to experience pain when wearing footwear and doing lower limb activities. However, the MO which i went to see, did not mention anything about either downgrading or the medical board, but kept the specialist's letter which i showed him. The specialist letter mentioned that i should be downgraded for 6 months.<br><br>I would like to know whether if my situation will be forwarded to the medical board for review, or I will just remain with my Pes B status. I would also like to know if my condition allows me to be downgraded.<br><br>In addition, the MO gave me an excuse boots status for 2 months, partly due to the fact that it is explicitly stated in the specialist's letter. However, I experience the same intensity of pain (if not worse) in my MTP joint while wearing normal PT shoes too. If i were to bring this up to the MO, is it possible that he gives me an excuse footwear status, as it is hard to "detect" pain and he might consider me to be malingering? The only visible sympton is redness over the MTP joint.<br><br>Thank you in advance.</div>

With regards to the issue of wearing shoes outside camp, I only started experiencing pain while wearing footwear after the fieldcamp period in BMTC. Prior to enlistment, I was unaware that I have such deformity in my feet, as I was able to take off my shoes at my own convenience, for example, in the classroom, lecture hall, canteen, as soon as I felt any discomfort. The earlier weeks of my PTP BMT also gave me many chances to rest my feet due to the more lax schedule and regimentation/discipline. However, as BMT proceeded and I had to go through fieldcamp, live range and other outfield activities, I was required to have my footwear on for the whole day, and I started feeling pain when having footwear on. I went to see the tekong MO but he dismissed it as "after-training" ache. The condition then worsened, which caused me to see a specialist.<br><br></div>
