              <p>If a person serves NS for lets say about a few months then halfway downgrade to PES F then gets discharged from the army, can that person still legally declare that he has served/completed NS instead of "exempted" when filling up job applications?Is he even considered as having served/completed NS in the first place?</p>

              <p>Will that person be able to claim the $1500/$3000 NSman tax relief from IRAS too after his PES F downgrade?</p>

              <p>I hope for some clarification on this so that I can grill into my nephew's thick skull that trying to keng PES F does not mean that he get to enjoy the few privileges that the NSmen get because he's thinking that he can bail out of his serving term,smoke his way through job applications that he is a bona fide NSmen like me and enjoy the tax deductions.</p>

              <p>I cannot confirm this but I have heard of another kind of status for this.The 301 grouping.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Apparently 301 people are those that are not gay but display heavy signs of being effeminate(eg.Straight but likes to dress in drag,etc)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think they(301) are still able to marry after they finished their NS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just a neutral advice.You might think that you are "gay" but the doctors diagnosis may be that you are just very effeminate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Either way,302 or 301(if it exists) needs to be backed up by medical certification from a doctor when you declare it.</p>
