              <p>Hi eac, just wondering if I am pes c1l3 and then today I just went for specialist checkup and he said I got a hamstring and excuse me from lower limbs activities for 3months.</p>
              <p>I am due for enlistment on 25th of July and I think that pes status also excuses me from upper limb activities. So am I right to say that I'm excused like from lower limb + upper limb activities?</p>
              <p>What exactly will I be doing if that is that case (during BMT)? I hope I wont get recourse from BMT for no reason la... :( got friends say got high chance of that since I cannot pass the IPPT etc etc</p>

              <p>Hi, i'm a service medic at MCC (medical classification centre).</p>
              <p>i recommend that you should declare your condition at cmpb, cos your specialist recommend excuse but the MO's need to officially recognize that.</p>
              <p>about bmt that one i'm not so sure, but you can check with the enlistment staff at cmpb.</p>
              <p>for review please call 6373 1340, or walk in to CMPB-MCC between 8-11 am or 1 to 4 pm. Recommended time is 9 am or 2 pm to minimise waiting time.</p>

              <p>Hi, I just went to get my specialist letter endorsed by my MO yesterday. May I know when will I be able to know the results of the medical board? I had a slip disc..most probably C2 or C9.</p>

              <p><br>besides ur designated unit medical centre, u can call ur respective NS HRC.<br><br>but for this, best is still call the medical centre. usually the MO's Personal Assistant (MOPA)/medical board IC medic have the schedule.</p>

              <p>hey guys. i just finished my BMT and ive been posted to guards but the problem is that i have a previous wrist fracture that keeps giving me problems. i fought through bmt with the pain and even highlighted the problem to my pc but nothing was actually done. my left wrist hurts when i do push ups, pull ups or when i carry weights on it and when i strain it.</p>
              <p>so im just worried that with a posting like guards, i wont be able to take it because of this injury. what can be done? if the pain persists and affects my training there is it possbile to seek for a medical review?</p>
              <p>thanks for the help.</p>
