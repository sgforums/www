              <p>Hi EAC,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i wonder if you heard of a condition called Arterio-venous malfunction(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_malformation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_malformation</a>)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Before NS, I already had this condition but it was undiagnosed. I was therefore PES A. I would suffer from wild headaches now and then which affected my BMT performance and in the end I didn't make it to command school. The Tekong doctor said that I was only suffering from stress-induced headaches and gave me nothing more than painkillers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fast forward through my NS life, I was a pioneer in 39 SCE and represented SAFSA in dragonboat. Can safely say I did my part and did not chaokeng. Near ORD, I had my condition diagnosed and the AVM removed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However now that I have ORDed, the AVM has returned. Whenever I exercise, the blood rush engorges my AVM with rapidly pumping blood and I get headaches of varying severity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I plan to go for another operation to remove this new AVM but hope to get downgraded and excused from IPPT. AVMs are a congenital disorder of the cardiovascular system so I can be permanently downgraded even after the AVM has been removed?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Doctor says possibly after this AVM is removed, another one will take its place and there are might be other undiscoverered AVMs in my body.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I want to downgrade, I have to take a specialist letter to the MO in my reservist camp, right?</p>

              <p><br>it depends on whether the condition is medically stabilised to be considered as a perm medical condition... depending on where and what type of injury or condition...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>take an analogy.... like u have a deep cut. but it will sure to be healed right... there might be as though nothing had happened or a scar is formed... all depends.</p>

              <p>I got psoriasis , and i went to NUH to get specialist letter , the letter says , i need long term treatment , and condition will worsened if expose to heat. then i went down to cmpb at 11+ , the person told me to come back at 1pm , so i did , and when i go back , he told me to take a seat , and yeah , i waited till 2pm , before i can see the MO , i reuqested for a downgrade and there is the specialist letter for evidence , showed him all my rashes , and the MO says , your pes status remains , because , i must have 20% rashes on my body then can downgrade to pes C , and he says mine is like only 5% , and this MO cant even read doctor words. And yeah i want to ask the MO , if my condition worsened , who is going to be responsible? i dun think he know what is psoriasis , what 5% cannot downgrade? only 20% then can? , psoriasis can never be cured , and the fact that i have so few rashes , is because i try not to expose to sunlight. If i ever chiong sua , my psoriasis will act up , and who is going to take responsible? dun tell me go see unit MO al those crap , cos MO will always think u are trying to keng. I want to know , am i still eligible for a downgrade? if yes i will go to skin centre and get another specialist letter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and yeah to add on , my skin cant even take it , when i play sports. so no need say army training.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>cancer or not, or any other conditions <strong>ALL NEED SPECIALIST MEMO/REPORT/</strong>SCAN REPORT/BLOOD REPORT.... so long as its a certified diagnosis, u have a case.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>n if doctors at medical board says so, then it is it. u want to appeal, go find hospital specialist to write more details in the report. n give the report/memo again for review, its that simple. no proof, no talk.</p>

              <p>If that is the case,it will be Cat X,which all IPPT eligible recruits will start under.When they hit 25,they will be under Cat Y and so forth.Lowest Cat for the older Nsmen is Cat Z or even Cat ZZ IIRC.</p>

              Hi,
              
              I checked my PES Status through the NS Portal MRS System and have been graded C9L2 (Temp 6mths). I have no idea about my enlistment date yet. Can someone advise what kind of life i will be looking forward to? Especially the BMT phase.
              
              Thanks in advance,
