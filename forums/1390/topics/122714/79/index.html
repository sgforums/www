              <p>If you are enlisted while being on C9L9, you will enlist into PES C BMT with no chance of OCS. If you do up PES later, the chance of going OCS is close to impossible unless you are willing to extend ORD and even that won't assure you anything.</p>
              <p>PES C will generally be stuck as CPL/CFC max and a lucky few might be posted to logistics specialists to get their 3SG.</p>

              <p>Any vocation can be exciting depends on how you see it and theres nothing really special of exciting about OCS to most OCS people. NS is not a time for you to have fun and play around.</p>

              <p>Yeah man, been exercising regularly.</p>
              <p>I went for medical checkup. It was last year September, if my memory doesn't fail me. I recall subsequently, I started my exercise on November, everything thing seems to goes well. I can jog longer distance.</p>
              <p>But now is like half of it and I'm like catching for health.</p>
              <p>MINDEF put me under Pes A during my medical checkup.</p>
              <p>Probably is lack of exercising, since I stopped for a month or so. But don't mind me asking, but what if condition persist, how do I inform or declare?</p>

              <p>Yeah man, been exercising regularly.</p>
              <p>I went for medical checkup. It was last year September, if my
                  memory doesn't fail me. I recall subsequently, I started my
                  exercise on November, everything thing seems to goes well. I can
                  jog longer distance.</p>
              <p>But now is like half of it and I'm like catching for health.</p>
              <p>MINDEF put me under Pes A during my medical checkup.</p>
              <p>Probably is lack of exercising, since I stopped for a month or
                  so. But don't mind me asking, but what if condition persist, how do
                  I inform or declare?</p>

              <p>If your problem persist, it might be good to see a doctor or specialist before enlistment rather than drag till then. If there is really something wrong with you etc and the specialist gives you some sort of memo to excuse you from certain activities or recommend down PES etc, call up CPMB to inform them and request for a medical review.</p>

              <p>Hi. I just had my pre-enlistment medical check up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am medically fit and do not have any cause for concern, including blood pressure. My BMI is 40(yes i know, i should lose weight, already started), but I'm still graded for PES C9L3. I might be severely obese but I know I can run and keep up with my peers as I have sufficient stamina. </p>
              <p>I also have a family history of officers. So i don't think they graded me Pes C for any other reasons really.</p>
              <p>I'm also puzzled as to why I'm put in Pes C9L3 as the MO told me its simply because of my obesity but during all the tests, all of them said no problem with heart rate or blood pressure or lungs everything. </p>
              <p>Is there anyway I can get myself bumped up to Pes BP as I really want to be eligible for more vocations. </p>
              <p>Also, what does PES C9L3 really does? like, what are the common vocations after the new guidelines for BMT and Vocation allocation that just came out? </p>

              <p>Its very often for PES BP guys to still be given PES C9L3 after BMT due to severe obesityso upgrading you to BP is not going to help.</p>
              <p>C9L3 will allow you to get any of the logistic vocations such as driver, storemen, technician, clerk or medics.</p>
              <p>As what i've just posted last night, regardless what vocation you get, they serve a purpose to progress of SAF regardless how little or minor your job might seem. NS is a service to the nation and not a place to find fun and enjoyment which could come with the process but should not be something you come to get.</p>

              <p>It would be due to your BMI, 40 is really very high since most i know who get BP are up till about 35 or so.</p>
              <p>They might consider it too risky for you to take part in the BP training since people who are severely obese have problems with exercises and are more prone to alot of health problems and if not wrong, the risk increases with increasing BMI.</p>
              <p>If you can get your BMI down to maybe 35 or lower, you could consider calling up CMPB and requesting for a medical review. Many here will say that you will be stupid to do so but if that is really what you want, work hard and lossing weight and you might be given a chance.</p>
              <p>Good luck</p>
