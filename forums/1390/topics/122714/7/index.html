If the BMI is above a certain magical number, u will 'tio' the obese BMT. Even then, in my day, they divide the obese into 3 categories. Mild obese, moderate obese, and 'super' obese. Me that time tio the moderate obese, which was far better than Mild obese, because the sergeants tend to teach those moderate obese like those 'normal' BMT recruits. I remember that time when we POP, i saw the mild obese recruits machiam like normal or even enhanced BMT recruits, very slim.<br><br>I am not sure if that's the case now, but hope it helps</div>

PES C is definitely still non-combat and yet you are still in a combat vocation. I suggest you check into this by speaking to your NS MO. You should not be in a combat position, although I'm not sure what is allowed and what is not. In any case, you can complain to your MP that you are non-combat and having problems, yet being posted and made to do combat related activities. Wasted, should have complained before elections.<br><br>EDIT: On further thought, your current position might not be due to the C1 classification, but the deployment - L1, able to be deployed to front lines. Best to check, cos regardless of L*, C is non-combat.</div>
