              <p>edit - shoot, thought i posted it in Medical FAQ thread. ps. I'll leave this post here ba.</p>
              <p>My medical's checkup on 11 Dec.So far the medical conditions that i have gathered info are:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Finger had suffered Salter Harris Type II Ephisyseal on left little finger phlanton platix fracture. Will occasionally pain, and sometimes it happen during rain and cold. The doctor's report i recently got in Oct from SGH -&gt; healed well. I can say that the finger have 90% mobility and strength. <strong>Some of my friends say that this left little finger is useless as long as trigger finger on right hand is ok and this will not affect PES. (Debunk this myth?)</strong></li>
              <li>I have a booklet regarding Rhinithis that my mum got from the doctor when i was in Sec 1 after seeing the doctor about my severe sneezing when in dust/cold. Not sure wether if i do have rhinithis (should be, my mum say it runs on my father's side, and my uncle got PES C grading because of it) but i do sneeze in cold and dust, can turn into severe sneezing and runny nose for at least one-two days. <strong>Can i show this booklet to state back up that i am having this Rhinithis and see if they recommend me for a further evaluation? And if they say it's just common to sneeze in dust and cold, should i pursue further for a doctor's memo from GP?</strong></li>
              <li>Eyesight of 800+ with 100+ or 200+ astagmism.</li>
              <li>Medical History - My dad passed away due to rheumatic heart disease. That time he was unable to serve the army due to his heart condition, I don't think i have rheumatic heart disease, so far all medical report states i'm fine.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This are unconfirmed</p>
              <ul>
              <li>** Loud noises that are sudden can make me lose awareness of what im doing. Ear may ache when exposed to loud noise.<strong> My friends again say this is normal. So, I just tell MO?</strong></li>
              <li>** Leg joints at the knee, when cold seems to ache mildly. This does not happen frequently, and im also not sure how it came about.I think it's something like old people bone ache when cold that kind of ache. <strong>I just tell MO?</strong></li>
              <li><strong>** </strong>Suicidal - So far, now i'm sort of ok. My friends told me that they observe if  i'm highly stressed out, i may have sucidal tendencies.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Do i seem like i have alot of medical problems? The ones marked with ** are the ones which i do not have any medical evidence, and it happens erradically that it may slip off my mind. This is mostly complete.</p>
              <p>I most likely of PES C given those medical conditions not marked with **, and if it is, do i go to C1 or C2? L of course, nobody knows yet.</p>

              <p>Health booklet seems like there's no mention of Rhinitis.</p>
              <p>I  remember that the online form (medical questionaire) in October i filled in that i have "Sensitive nose in Dusty/cold become runny nose" due to the stupid lack of typing space at the "Others" section . I don't know it's called Rhinithis. Is it ok? Know that it's running on my dad's side.</p>
              <p>I checked with my mum's friend whose sons last year enlisted and they also have Rhinithis. She say that her sons just told the MO without any memo, so it's fine. Heard they got PES C because of Rhinithis.</p>

              <p>i went to that checkup today le. PES B. </p>
              <p>Firstly, the eye station there due to my high myopia, he ask wether i got see floaters and black dots. I don't really know what is floaters, but i told that guy i see white things floating in my sight without specs. He ask how many. What the, as if i go count one, i say not sure should be 6-10 floaters. That guy never say is add together both eyes or one eye or ask me to count at the spot.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the MO never interview de. Took the questionaire and medical report, scan and then never ask about my finger or anything else want to declare. Just "PES B" and told me to put the folder outside and wait. My finger still have aching pain since two years ago. Ya, the letter said heal well. So SGH letter can express my finger's feeling. Right, and he never bothered to ask anything else to declare because his face shows that the boys today all want to chao keng.</p>
              <p>Oh right, those people at CMPB and this forum's members will be thinking im going to chao keng if i start to ask if there's a possiblity to get PES C1L1 even though mines B. CMPB is puts the highest possible PES.</p>
              <p>Is there now a possiblity that i can PES C1L1 perm?</p>

              <p>i went to that checkup today le. PES B. </p>
              <p>Firstly, the eye station there due to my high myopia, he ask wether i got see floaters and black dots. I don't really know what is floaters, but i told that guy i see white things floating in my sight without specs. He ask how many. What the, as if i go count one, i say not sure should be 6-10 floaters. That guy never say is add together both eyes or one eye or ask me to count at the spot.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the MO never interview de. Took the questionaire and medical report, scan and then never ask about my finger or anything else want to declare. Just "PES B" and told me to put the folder outside and wait. My finger still have aching pain since two years ago. Ya, the letter said heal well. So SGH letter can express my finger's feeling. Right, and he never bothered to ask anything else to declare because his face shows that the boys today all want to chao keng.</p>
              <p>Oh right, those people at CMPB and this forum's members will be thinking im going to chao keng if i start to ask if there's a possiblity to get PES C1L1 even though mines B. CMPB is puts the highest possible PES.</p>
              <p>Is there now a possiblity that i can PES C1L1 perm?</p>

              <p><br>As if the review could do any help. PES B is defininite - Permed.</p>
              <p>I've learnt today that having a fracture on the most useless finger on the non-master hand - makes no difference. Ya, no PES C because it isn't a serious medical condition.</p>

I mean, who the heck would count the number of floaters in the first place when all they can see are floating things in their eyeballs. i declared less then 10 to the eye people because - Eye people there didnt say isit 1 eyeball, both eyeballs total floaters more then 10. "Isit more then 10?"</p>
              <p>After yesterday's MO checkup i don't have that kind of confidence in the CMPB. Seems like there's no case to fight at all @ 10% sucess.</p>

              Also, is it optional for MO asking anything to declare? My parent's friends said that anything i can also declare to the MO when they ask.

              <p>And oh id like to add a few things that i missed out.im actually currently in a guards batallion already and this condition is recently diagnosed. and my unit likes to "torture" the status personel and others who try to downpes / revocate. so id like to know if such a diagnosis could possibly revocate me?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in addition, my specialist wrote a letter advising the MO to revocate me but i never submitted the letter because i had no intention of revocating becaused i really loved my platoon mates in there. but due to recent develppments, im regretting that decision. so id also like to ask, if its an offense that i did not submit the letter from my specialist when i got it and whether i can still submit that letter now. (i got that letter about a month ago)</p>
