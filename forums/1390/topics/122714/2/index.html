Which means you can be posted to any unit for either service or tech vocations. No need combat but requires you to take IPPT and range (unless excused)<br><br>2.) Need to retake BMT? Have you completed ur BMT liao?<br>a.) If you have completed and pass ur BMT before then dun need liao.<br>b.) If no, OOC perosnnel/failed/neber complete. Yes, need to retake BMT.<br>c.) I finish PES E induction liao. PES E induction doesn't count as BMT. Once upgraded to PES C and above, u need to retake BMT.  Why?<br><br>PES C personnel although only some spare part spoilt but still combat effective when required. So you still need to learn ur field skills, weapon handling, etc.<br>So Bo Pian.<br></div>

Is it true?<br>I also heard they like to post weak people to PES B and fit to PES C? This are all what i heard, can anyone clarify?<br><span style="color: green;">hearsay is powerful! but that's all. do you think the doctors want to play a fool with their own careers by doing all those mindless things, especially when NS is already sensitive, and especially with the increasing focus on safety? </span><br><br>hmm, i still got some questions. Hope you guys can help me answer, i am very curious in the NS system.<br><br>1) BMT and after BMT for PSE C , is it siong? Or is it determined by the L-code?<br><span style="color: green;">what is siong? what is siong for us may not be siong for u. but generally, you can say that pes c would be less siong than pes b. but well, you know this is quite meaningless. </span><br><br>2) How can i get into infantry? Their intake for infantry is huge? Will PSE C people get into infantry?<br><span style="color: green;">yes infantry intake is large, since all soldiers are supposed to be able to function as infantry soldiers. to specialise in infantry hence does not take much effort on your part. as pes c you can still go to infantry but you may do more sedative stuff. </span><br>3) How long does infantry stay in tekong? the period of BMT and another few months in tekong?<br><span style="color: green;">if one spends additional time in tekong after bmt it would mean he goes to sispec. that would mean at least 3 more months there. </span><br>4) Is training tough for infantry? I heard it is very tough and siong. All days rushing hills etc.<br><span style="color: green;">again, this thing about siong. how can one objectively make a judgement on that? </span><br>5) I also heard that the toilet in tekong very "dirty", can always hear voices at night, is it true?<br><span style="color: green;">personally i have never had such encounters. yes there are stories, and hearsays and rumours. without commiting myself, i still have to point out that they are hearsays, stories and rumours. its really whether or not u believe in such things. </span><br>6) What is the average distance NS people run everyday? 5Km?<br><span style="color: green;">depends on the school / unit. </span><br>7) I have been doing this exercises everyday, i am not sure whether is it enough for me to survive in NS.<br>- 100 pumpings everyday<br>-  train dumb bell 10 reps x 3   ( 2 times a day)<br>- sit and reach<br>- core strength training<br>- running for 30 minutes to train stamina<br>- pull up<br>- train standing board jump<br>- climb stairs everyday<br>- sit up 40 times everyday<br>- normal stretch exercises that last for 25minutes<br><br>Is there any other exercises that you guys can recommend in order for me to survive in NS in great ease.<br><span style="color: green;">at least you are doing something! im sure with what you are doing, you wouldnt have much problem coping with at least BMT. </span><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Is there any website around or can anyone tell me the right method to train standing board jump and sit and reach? I can't just seem to get it right. What is the right method to train them?<br><span style="color: green;">it is really hard to describe. anyway there is no sit and reach in IPPT.</span><br>9) Another question, why do i feel tired and restless whenever i run in the afternoon at around 6-7 pm? Is it because i over run or because of the warm weather? I heard warm weather do slow us down.<br><span style="color: green;">are you training too hard? remember progressive training. and is it because of the humidity? have you drank enuff water? did your warm ups properly?</span><br><br>Thanks and sorry for so many questions.<br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><strong>a) since, I dont require IPPT, so I can eat and shake leg until Oct?<br></strong><br>Even though you dun need to take IPPT, doesn't mean that you cannot do simple exercises. It is still best to do some training.<br><br><strong>b) since I dont need IPPT, why still need Modified BMT ?<br></strong><br>BMT stands for Basic Military Training, it is not an exercise course. For PES A, B, BP ppl. IPPT is one of the passing criteria. You can count urself heng already that IPPT is not one of ur passing criteria.<br>You will still be required to learn and be tested upon on ur field craft, weapon handling, etc.<br>(Fire weapon need IPPT one ah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> )<br><br><strong>c) currently acceptable weight, will there be problem if I go in overweight?<br></strong><br>My advise: Dun go in overweight. It will impede on ur training one. Trust me, I was PES BP during BMT and I can tell u doing ur BMT with a belly is not very "efficent".<br><br><strong>d) since no need IPPT, go tekong do what? Cant run, pull ups..etc...<br></strong><br>Please see (b)<br><br><strong>e) Must I learn swimming? Or rather my pes need to swim?<br></strong><br>This I dunno, I was downgraded to PES C after BMT. But for the PES A, B, BP, confirm need to take swimming lessons one.</div>
