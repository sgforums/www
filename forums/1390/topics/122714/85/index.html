              <p>Touchwood, but if you are to really get an allergy attack, you will almost be sure to DownPes straight away if you are Pes A/B.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, just stay away from dusty stuff for the time being and wait for your next Specialist appointment.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">Hi guys , </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I have been experiencing intensive back pain following the rigorous physical training since i enlisted on the 6 March 2010 . With the pain became unbearable , i decided to ask my parents to book an medical appointment for my back pain at any of the hospital regardless of private or public ASAP . Fortunately , my parents managed to book an medical appointment at the Raffles Hospital on the 16 March 2010 . The doctor handling my case was Dr David Wong Him Choon , a regionally well known spine consultation . In addition , he has successfully conducted the disc replacement surgery with the success rate of 100 %</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">The specialist conducted a detailed physical examinations  and the medical history which i have been experiencing since the early childhood . Then , he asked me to do the MRI scan , which it would be held at Thursday .  in order to determine the source and cause of the back pain . In the meantime , i was given the 3 days of  medical certificate to cover the time between current and MRI scan .</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Following the MRI scan , the results were stated as follows  : </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">According to the MRI scan's summary , i was diagnosis ed with Bulging disk and  Schmorl node at the L4-5 section .</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Note : Bulging disk is the first stage of the DE-GENERATIVE Disk , depending the intensity of physical activities and the BMT training . </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">To my disappointment , the specialist refused to write the memo , which states my medical condition , as the results wasnt conclusive . Therefore , he asked me to conduct a advanced diagnosis test called the Provocative Discogram .Then , i argued that i wouldnt be covered with any status for the time being if i choose not to do the diagnosis test . He said : '' i couldnt write the memo as long as the results wasnt conclusive arguing that it would significantly influence the MO decision . I discussed the matter with my parents seriously and concluded that theh cost of the diagnosis test ( cost around $4000 after the deduction from Medishield .) was relatively , i decided to go to the AMK's polyclinic to ask for a referral letter  which they willing to grant it to me after much persuasion . I was referred to the TTSH's Orthpaedic clinic and the medical appointment would be at the 6 /18 . So , my parents asked me to go to the medical centre to demand the status with the necessary documents in order to cover the period between the medical appointment at the TTSH and current . </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Next , i went to the Pualu Tekong medical centre for a medical review on my hearing and spinal problem . In the first consultation , i shown the Medical Officer ( commonly known as MO in solders' slang )  the necessary documents , including the MRI scan's summary  and the words from the specialist .In the first words blurted out by the MO , he said : '' Shouldnt u be OOT  by now since u have so many medical condition '' . After looking at the documents by the MO , he asked me when would be yr next appointment with the Alexandria Hospital . In response , i told him that i have yet received the medical appointment letter from the medical centre . In the end , he gave me excuses for RMJ ( Running , Marching and Jumping ) and Loud Noise for  two weeks . However , concurrently , he taken off my excuses for heavy load arguing that the above excuses would be sufficiently covered the medical condition for the time being .</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">So , i messaged the news to my parents immediately( since it would  seriously undermined the health ) and they told me to ask for advices from the PC regarding my medical condition and status . Reluctantly , i approached the PC for further advices regarding my medical conditions as according to the wishes of my parents . As usual , i shown the necessary documents and told him my situation to my PC . Then , my PC suggested that i should go to the medical centre to demand the necessary status to cover for the period , otherwise , u would have to participate the training which in turn may or may not worsen the condition .</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Next day , i went to the medical centre for the medical review for my spinal problem with the hope of demanding the needed status. In the second consultation with the MO , i shown the necessary documents to him . After looking at the documents , he said '' the medical conditions seemed to be normal , as stated in the MRI scan's summary . Regarding the bulging , he argued that many people have bulging disk and suffering the varied effects . '' In response , i told him that there were abnormalities in my L4-5 section of the spine , according to the words of my specialist ,and awaited for the further diagnosis test to confirm the source and cause of the back pain . However , the MO shown no sympathy towards my medical conditions since my medical condition seemed relatively normal and mild . Then , he asked whether i have been experiencing pain on my back in which i answered YES  In the end , he didnt give me the demanded status and merely referred me to the Pulau Tekong Physiotherapy Centre for the physiotherapy session in the hope relieving the pain . </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">So , i would like to ask the following questions :</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">1) If i managed to get the specialist's memo , does it mean that i have higher percentage of downgrading my PES status . </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">If so , what are the likely status will i be granted ?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">2) Does my medical condition seemed serious enough to get a downgrading of PES status , assuming that i do the advanced diagnosis test and get the memo .</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">3) Why did the Medical Board not grant any excuses for my hearing problem ( i was diagnosis ed with tinnitus ) </p>

              <p><br>First of all, you don't demand this and that. Anybody, even Doctors don't like this attitude. Instead, you are to<strong> request</strong> for. Doctors are professionals with a medical practising licence. Nobody is your servant. So, don't show "that stuck up face" at anybody, especially when you're there to <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">request</span> </em>an "influencing memo".</p>
              <p>1) For this case, even with a specialist memo as the supporting document, the Medical Board will at most review this as a within mild PES C range status, with a possible permanent excuse heavy loads.</p>
              <p>2) A simple specialist memo from a public hospital will do. This is not so complex/ complicated enough to warrant a private specialist to write the memo. Don't waste money.</p>
              <p>3) Tinnitus, dependable on severity, e.g. mild/ moderate/ severe, will at most be given an excuse of loud noise environment (e.g. rifle range/ grenade throw) to accompany the PES. Nothing more to the PES.</p>

              <p>Reply to Eac  ,</p>
              <p>Im sorry to use the word '' demand'' instead of appropriate words  . </p>
              <p>Anyway , i was given a PES B status ( prior to the development of spinal problem ) without any excuses such as range , grenade throw or loud noise when i received the enlistment letter . </p>
              <p>Recently , my hearing problem seemed to worsen SIGNIFICANTLY as i have severe difficulties of hearing commands from the sergeants or platoon ic ,especially during the marching . As such , i always screwed up the whole platoon marching formation and angered the PL DI  . In turn , he used PROVOCATIVE words to scold me : '' Fuyker , Do u know hw to march probably ? '' or  '' Guys , look at this guy , he doesnt know hw to march probably  " ( asked to stand in front of the platoon ) . Most of the platoonmates seemed to detest me whenever i joined the marching formation .So , i decided to go to the Pualu Tekong Medical Centre to have a check on my hearing . According to the MO , he said my hearing problem was relatively minor since there wasnt any ruptured eardrum .He gave me excuses of loud noise for a duration of 2 weeks pending further medical evidence .</p>
              <p>Similarly , i was forced to stand within the platoon and endured the shouting and loud noise despite being excused of loud noise . In conclusion , i felt  that i was suffering from hearing loss with the constant exposure to loud noise even though it hasnt confirmed by the specialist (MO) at the NUH .</p>
              <p>Referring to the second question : </p>
