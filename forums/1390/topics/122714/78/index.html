              <p>At least Pes E1L3. Since this is inborn, they will ensure that your the other ear will not be affected. They have to put u in Pes E and as a Clerk to ensure it won't affect your other ear. Else u will be perm disable and have loss the use of hearing completely.</p>
              <p>Just declare watever medical histories you have.</p>

              <p>If you complete all the major requirements of BMT such as range, field camp etc, you will have completed BMT and do not need to reBMT.</p>
              <p>If you were to Out of Course (OOC) before you POP, you will have to re BMT again sometime later in ur service.</p>
              <p>BTW, this is the PES FAQ thread, please post BMT questions in the Enlist/BMT FAQ thread.</p>

              <p>I tore my right knee meniscus about 2-3 weeks ago during soccer and am scheduled for MRI in SGH this coming monday. My IPPT is booked for Feb 9( I don't think its humanly possible for me to recover by then). My ICT is in June( I hope to attend it and not downpes).</p>
              <p>Should I wait for my MRI results(which will be around Jan 11) to let me know the extent of my injury before letting SAF know about my condition or should I tell them about it first before my results are out?</p>

              <p>I would advice you to wait since its also not a long time more. Informing SAF now when you can't give them any clear status etc nor do you have any MC or memo from the doct to endorse with the MO would be rather pointless.</p>

              <p>If you completed medical checkup, you should know your PES so why is it a i think?</p>
              <p>Poly NAPFA results will be used but if you failed it, you can take retests at Toa Payoh.</p>
              <p>Enlistment will be at least 6 months to a year after medical checkup so there is 0 chance of you enlisting for the march batch which is a JC batch while poly batches are always after Jun.</p>

              <p>If you complete the entire medical checkup, they will give you a final confirm PES status. No need guess yourself.</p>
              <p>You do not get to choose your intake be it tekong or mono nor when you enlist so stop behaving like a small kid and start getting yourself to behave like a solider.</p>

              <p>Hi there,</p>
              <p>I've recently been diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder by my shrink after 1 year of NS. Will be seeing the SAF shrink soon as referred by my MO. I'm currently a combat medic but i've always had this condition and never really been bothered by it until recently. May i know what kind of procedures i may expect? The MO suspects that it may be due to my current camp (just got posted in).</p>
              <p>Is there any chance of being revocated or at least be placed in another camp?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope to hear from you guys soon.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hi there,</p>
              <p>I've recently been diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder by my
              shrink after 1 year of NS. Will be seeing the SAF shrink soon as
              referred by my MO. I'm currently a combat medic but i've always had
              this condition and never really been bothered by it until recently.
              May i know what kind of procedures i may expect? The MO suspects
              that it may be due to my current camp (just got posted in).</p>
              <p>Is there any chance of being revocated or at least be placed in
              another camp?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope to hear from you guys soon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>That will depend on the MO and what the SAF psychiatrist recommends though i wonder why a camp will result in GAD.</p>

              <p>I will base it on behavior/attitude.</p>
              <p>If they don't, it would be a miracle but even if they do, you won't be enlisting for at least another 6 months since you just completed your medical checkup.</p>
              <p>Go find a job after you grad from poly cos we do not expect anymore intakes till i would guess Jun/Jul since the JC students are filling in all the Dec, Feb, Mar, Apr batches.</p>
              <p>Remember there is no "I want" in the army. You just have to accept what you get and the only choice you have is to do your best and get yourself adapted to whatever is thrown at you or choose to chao keng and accept any consequences of that choice.</p>

              <p>Unless your injury will affect your job as a service medic which is already a vocation even PES E9 can do, its unlikely it will change nor be down PES i think.</p>

              <p>Noah has already said it should be C1 so its unlikely you will be downgraded etc. Its up to your MO whether he believes you are capable of performing youe duties of not since ultimately, revocations and down PES are still decided by the MO anyway.</p>
