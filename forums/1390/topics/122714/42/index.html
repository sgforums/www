              <p>That was what I was trying to say.I just wanted to point out that even though you know you are gay,the doctors might think differently.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Before you go declare it,get a medical certification from a doctor,this can save you quite abit of trouble and unnecessary attention that you might get if you were to go through the Army system from scratch.</p>

              <p>I also think so.....the C i think it's most like to determine whether u can take the full IPPT or just partial. The deployment code, it determine whether can you function in the front line or now.</p>

              <p>I cannot confirm this but I have heard of another kind of status for this.The 301 grouping.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Apparently 301 people are those that are not gay but display heavy signs of being effeminate(eg.Straight but likes to dress in drag,etc)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think they(301) are still able to marry after they finished their NS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just a neutral advice.You might think that you are "gay" but the doctors diagnosis may be that you are just very effeminate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Either way,302 or 301(if it exists) needs to be backed up by medical certification from a doctor when you declare it.</p>

              <p>no, you won't need medical proof. the psy MO at the classification centre will interview you and question you and everything. they will decide whether or not you need further specialist review or anything. otherwise, they will grade based on their observations and findings.</p>

              <p><br>both are taken into consideration. let's say you're graded C1L3 for 1 condition, and C9L2 for another condition, overall you'll be graded as C<strong>9</strong>L<strong>3</strong>. meaning they'll take the lowest of each code. that is as tarutaru says, C code to determine your pes and whether you need to take IPPT etc, whereas L code determines whether you are allowed to bear firearms/be deployed in field activities etc.</p>

              <p>What my one and only "302" colleague told me was that he had to get a certification from a psychiatrist before they would fully endorse his condition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess he might have been one of the few requiring further specialist review.He wished he had gone for medical certification before enlisting as those of his friends who had medical proof beforehand had theirs endorsed without further questioning.</p>

              <p>just wish to ask, i went to see my MO at my unit (im a nsman), and he
              gave me excuse from heavy loads and temp pes status C9 L2 for 3 months until end August.</p>
              <p>Subsequently a few months after that i went for the medical review back in august, and the MO said he will send the letter to the medical board to get me boarded and downgrade and he gave me excuse from IPPT/RT/heavy loads/RMJ for 3 months and excuse from firearms for.. 3 days (?¿). Not a typo. Don't understand why 3 days since 3 days is useless.</p>
              <p>In the letter, it did not give me any new medical pes status, and i was told by the MO that though my temp pes status has expired, it will not really expire till the medical board finish boarding me. As my ICT is coming up soon, and im concerned abt it.</p>
              <p>So my questions here are</p>
              <p>1) would my pes status still remain c9 l2 as the MO said ? or has it already expired ?</p>
              <p>2) i have read the first page of this thread where the different pes status is explained. But for the case of C9 l2 in reservist combat vocation, combined with the excuses i have been given, what is likely to be the stuff i would end up doing? Am I actually eligible to go for live firing range and trench digging and such?</p>

              <p><br>1) technically, ur current excuses MC is valid since any Att B/ excuses  <strong>&gt;84 days</strong> is <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">deemed</span></em> as KIV pending medical board status. so i suggest u call up ur unit medical centre and ask a medic / the MO exactly when the medical board date is for ur case scheduled.<br><br>2) if u felt that any activities will cause ur condition to hurt, sound off, fall out and respond by what the MC states in there and ur medical conditions. if ur superiors ignore u, respond by saying, should if anything happens, i will officially file an in-service training injury report to seek compensation claims and medical benefits.</p>
