              <p>I am an NSman. Orded 1.5yrs ago. Pes A and in combat vocation. I injured myself during soccer and have a complete tear to my anterior cruciate ligament(ACL) and sprains to the meniscus. Did my medical review at my medical centre a day ago. The MO said confirm will downgrade and will give me an appointment with the medical board. Not sure to what pes but a friend of mine said surely C9 and below. I would hate to be revocated and go to a completely new vocation and be surrounded by people other than my NS peers.</p>
              <p>May I know what are the chances that I will be revocated or will they let me remain in my current unit and let me do lesser duties instead? I used to be an engineer recce. If revocate, will I be in a completely different NS unit or the same and be doing admin duties or something?</p>
              <p>Thanks for your time.</p>

              <p>Hi i have a few questions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1.) I am also graded C1L3... as dkcx stated, those who enlist after Jun 2010. enlist which means enter first day of BMT or enlist means those who enlist to be a NSF (go for medical checkup) ... so if now i am C1L3 and i first day of BMT is let say Sep 2010. Will i still be C1L3 ? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2.) So, let say in question 1 if i still remain in C1L3, i understand that i must do IPPT.. but what if i havent take my NAPFA (which means fail)... will i be posted to go for PTP ? or just serve 7 weeks BMT ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3.) Because i L3 cant go outfield, so whats the diff between B2 and my current PES C1L3 ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Really thanks those who can answer my queries! </p>

              <p>I received MINDEF letter today and they asked me to report to HENDON CAMP for a Vocational Assessment tests. The assessment will take almost one day (from 0745 hours to 1730hours) to complete and compries the following stages:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Medcal Screening</li>
              <li>Physical Fitness Assessment</li>
              <li>Psycho-Motor Assessment</li>
              <li>Psychology Assessment</li>
              <li>Interview</li>
              </ul>
              <p>So basically is just go there and have the test and i can go home on that day? Or have confinement? Anyone have been through this VA, kindly share with me or the rest of forums members here.<br><br>Warm Regards.</p>

              <p>Wow your background seems so complicated, so messy and blur. LOL..<br><br>Anyway if your studies is not good like me, then we must aim to work harder next time! I'm also an ITE Student, just graduate only.. To cut short you story, let's not talk about qualification, i don't look down actually:)<br><br>Talk about girlfriend running away, every guy also will scare want. "Shi ni de, jiu shi ni de, bu shi ni di, jiu bui shi ni de (In Chinese)" (In English)  "if is your's, means your's, if it is not your's, by all means, not your's" If you 2 have a strong relationship, i don't think nothing will happen. I myself also scare too, but just don't take it to hard:)</p>
