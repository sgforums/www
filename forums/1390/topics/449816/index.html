              <p>Singapore Camps are "dirty places".</p>
              <p>Whether You believe it or not,  the new enlistees will see ghosts in their army days or their buddies and friends in the Army will happen to see ghosts.</p>
              <p>When You go into the woods , jungle or forest for training , remember to say "excuse" , "sorry", "give way" when You want to urine or shit in particular spot or tree.</p>
              <p>In the woods, there are tree spirits, wondering ghosts and "datoks". Do not talk and curse these beings.</p>
              <p>You may like to laugh at such things as superstition , wait until You or friends got disurb or possessed then You will believe.</p>
              <p>Other than the ghosts, there are many accidents, mishaps and danger waiting to happen. No matter how much precaution the Army and You has taken, they will happen.</p>
              <p>Hardly any news of soldiers get killed in the Army training or injured are reported.</p>
              <p>Buying Insurance alone is not enough. Insurance will only pay You are injured and imagine what if You are physically disabled?</p>
              <p>Get Yourself a powerful Talisman or Thai Buddhist Amulet before You enter the Army.</p>
              <p>Make sure You get a Real Taoist Talisman or Amulet from a Taoist Master or Buddhist Archan.</p>
              <p>If You belong to any SIn-Tua or Tanki Group, You may get direct help from the diety during trance.</p>
              <p>If Your parents have got You a Talisman or Amulet before You ask them, You should keep it with You at all time in Camp.</p>
              <p>For those who don't know where to get such spiritual stuffs, You may ask Your Parents about it.</p>
              <p>For the Act "Ang Mao" join that "kind of religion" who don't believe in such things, Maybe You can call out his "name" when accidents happen on You.</p>
              <p>Buddhist Amulet can turn hot or start burning when any danger is going to happen to protect You.</p>

              <p>Muslim and Christian can also carry Taoist Talisman or Buddhist Amulet.</p>
              <p>But the Christians never will touch other religions' stuffs. I don't know what Christians can do. I think they should ask their own Father/Pastor.</p>
              <p>For Muslims, they have their own bomohs for help.</p>

              <p>I cannot promote the Talismans and Amulet which I offer at my Blog ,orelse the message will be deleted.</p>
              <p>So anyway, You all can find Your own masters or Taoist Temple ( best is have tanki in trance) and seek direct help.</p>
              <p>Many years ago, during Sec 1 NCC, the NCC Sergeant told us that Ngee Soon Camp was very dirty and die die at night go toilet must go in pair, confirm will see ghosts.</p>
              <p>Then at night, my friend went to tell Sergeant want go toilet but he din come back to call me to go in pair... then he came back... he vomit , said saw ghost.. later one NS Sergeant saw ghost, fainted and sent to hospital. Lucky, I was carrying a Talisman.</p>
              <p>Sec 3 NCC Camp, my buddy during luch ,kena fish stuck on throat. drink water n eat rice .. try also cannot let bone unlog from the throat. So i took out a yellow cloth talisman, said if he believed in spiritual power , he could use it and stroke the throat 3 times .. last stroke swallow water.. the bone gone.</p>
              <p>In NS, my indian bunk mate at night alone in bunk keep kena disturb by ghost... and told me about it.. I gave him a Talisman... after that ghost din come to disturb him.</p>
              <p>Another case, one recruit was stabbed to death during book out. His spirit came back to visit the bunkmates to farewell. They freak out, the next day... the  guys who got tanki background brought in Kwan-Ti Altar to put at the Corridor..</p>

              <p>Anyway, for christian side, there is an "legend" that for those who are hardcore people that didn't believe in spirit, if you look in the mirror at midnight and said "B???y M??Y" x 3 times, you bound to get into trouble later. And some people believe that Jade or Crystal is also your best protection. As for the tailman, some "deep" believer would also burn it in ash and mix with water and drink 3 times before they go to spooky place like Tekong.

              <p>So far for the scientific type who are ghost hunter type like Ghost Lab, you can only "detect" ghost by EMF meter to heard their "voice", otherwise skeptics people always claim that you are too tired and think too much etc</p>

              <p>Ever wonder why these paranormal shows on TV never ever sem to capture anything conclusive?</p>
              <p>In any case, don't go disturbing the spirits, and they won't disturb you. I'd be pissed too if a camera crew and some idiots come to my house uninvited and try to get a reaction out of me.</p>
