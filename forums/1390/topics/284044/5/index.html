If kanna guard duty only can do prowling which is good or bad depending you prefer to prowl or to do sentry.<br><br>For my case i think my guards prefer sentry cause i chat with my sentry and sometimes treat them better than my prowlers cos i don't have any contact with them except the occasion where are you now through the comms set :p</div>

PES C people have different kinds of excuses so its more case by case i think since someone who excuse outfield cannot make him recourse of failed his BMT because he has skin problems which isn't his fault that he can't go for field camp etc. As long as you managed to experience most of the stuff you are supposed to excluding those you are excused from, you should be able to POP or for PES C its POC normally.</div>
