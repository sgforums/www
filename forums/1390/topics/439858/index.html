            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi, my boyfriend is currently in NS and taking his IPPT. he will be completing his BMT during early jan. Supposingly, we were suppose to ROM before he complete BMT so by then he could down pes and convert into 8 to 5. which means he wont need to stay in camp. but cause something had cope up, we will have to postpone our ROM to feb. by then, can he still down pes to 8-5? as currently, i'm pregnant. will be giving birth in jan. my main concern is, can he visit me when i'm giving birth and can he still get 8-5 because we will be giving birth first before we get ROM. Please give me some tips. i'm really lost here. Thanks</p></div>

              <p>PES stays same, he gets to come home every day after ROM except during exercise.</p>
              <p>I assume you've already booked and changed your ROM date.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>We haven booked the date yet. because both of us are 18. And last month, new law came and by saying that we had to attend this marriage preparation course. so we are currently taking this course now. The army is aware of it. btw he's in infantry. so which means he can still come home everyday after ROM as long as the baby's birth cert had his name in it as the father right?</p></div>

              <p>1. must have supporting documents such as ROM certificate, child birth certificate...etc to prove to his Officer Commanding (OC) / officer-in-charge (OIC).</p>
              <p>2. there is no  "office hours timing" during training phrases such as BMT, on course for vocational training, outfield training...etc.</p>
              <p>3. time-off (for a few hours off camp) to witness your child birth is subject to his commander's discretion due to training schedule, with supporting documents such as a EDD (expected delivery date) note/ memo from your O&amp;G doctor/ gynecologist.</p>
              <p>4. it's only when he is posted to a permanent unit, then he can request for 8-5 office hours timing. usual route: BMT -&gt; on course (vocational training) -&gt; permanent unit (till ORD).</p>
              <p>5. after you are officially legally married, with the ROM certificate + child birth certificate as supporting documents, he can apply for a spouse/ dependent benefit cards for you and your baby to have more subsidised healthcare at polyclinic/ public hospital. do take note that the benefit cards are only valid during his NSF stint.</p>
