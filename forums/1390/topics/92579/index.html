Those who enlisted in January were lucky -- they had Chinese New Year break a few days after their enlistment, so essentially they were not confined.<br><br>During the entire confinement period, I was actually quite comfortable, thanks to the support my section mates gave me. Without them, I might now have survived that 14 days. I cried on Parents Visiting day. It was simply too overwhelming, not seeing both my parents and the simple sights of my familiar surroundings.<br><br>When I booked out on the 24 December 2003, I was reeling from shock. I was not used to seeing so many vehicles on the road. In fact, I nearly forgot about them, and crossed the road as if I were on Pulau Tekong...</div>
