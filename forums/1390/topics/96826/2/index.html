            <div class='col-md body'>Whether you believe in NS or not, whether you believe all that training can protect our country or not, I guess that is defintely debatable. Whether you like to serve or not, you just have to. Many of times, we just have to do certain things that we didn't choose to. I believe just treat the whole thing as a learning experience.<br><br>Just like many of the brothers in this forum have pointed out, NSF gives us "realistic training" of the society that we are going to work in. A time for boys to learn how to adapt and become a real man. We are going to experience some form of unpleasant situations in life. We have to learn to handle that. Whether the SAF ( or SCDF or SPF) is the best place to learn these lessons or not, well, that is also debatable. BUT since, we all have to serve, just make the best out of it.<br><br>IF you think that your superiors are horrible and cannot lead  and do not deserve that rank and appointment, well, observe and try to "learn" where they have gone wrong. I believe this will be beneficial for you. You have experienced the outcome of bad leadership and you know the feeling. Just make sure that you don't do the same thing next time when you assume leadership positions be it within the army or in the civilian world. You know how it feels.<br><br>No point complaining excessively. Of course, if you are "abused"  to the extend that you feel like collasping or what, then that's a different issue.<br><br>Likewise I believe there are also good role models in the forces, learn from them. Certain skills can be "brought over" to the civillian world.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

However, other people who post in this forum with different viewpoints are also entitled to put foward their comments.<br><br>If you are thinking of leaving the country, go right ahead, no one is stopping you. Makes it a lot easier for us who have served and still proud of this country. At least SAF don't have to waste manpower, time and effort to bring charges against you for AWOL.<br><br>True, it is not the country that <strong><span style="color: red;">DIRECTLY</span></strong> feeds you, however, bear in mind that it is the peace that is due to the presence of SAF that results in working opportunities that enable your parents to be able to clothe and feed you. So in a way, you owe it to the country that you are still alive and don't have to worry about getting your arse shot every second. For a home and family to exists, there must first be a country (xian1 you2 guo2, hou4 you2 jia1).<br><br>Your thinking reflects a growing sentiments among the younger generation that the whole damn world owes you a living. Sorry about it, but the whole world don't. You can serve and look at the process and experiences in a positive manner and be happy about it, or you can B.I.T.C.H about it till kingdom come and wallow in your pathetic little self-pity and be miserable about it for the rest of your life. It's your call at the end of the day.</div>
