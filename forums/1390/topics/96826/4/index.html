            <div class='col-md body'>I think everyone of you thinks I am a chao kay kia...<br><br>The truth is I am not... if only you all know all the bad experiences I had in the army..<br><br>1) I went into BMT PES C Batch.. thinking that all I ever had to do was to be nice and listen to the sgts.. I always listen to the sgts, greeting them.. showing that I have a fear of them.. hiding in the background.. but they constantly making fun of me.. laughing at me... calling me names.. thinking that I am some gay or what... they also make fun of my poor performance in ippt.. humilating me in front of the whole platoon.. tekaning me... I have to be the platoon I/C for 5 weeks even though my BMT is only 7 weeks.. I told them repeatedly that I cannot do the job well but still.. they forced me to do it and tekan me for doing a bad job.. if not for the sergernt major.. I would have to do it for the whole of BMT... den the worst thing happened.. they confiscated my camera fone (ok, my fault for bringing it) and refused to give it back.. threatening to charge me and further humilate me... it is the worst period of my life.. I am constantly in fear and stress...<br><br>2) Den when I finally got posted to my unit.. it was fun when I am on course but when I got posted to the worst place of my unit, I first act stupid and pretend not to know anything even though I got a specialist post... but fate has it that because of that, my pc dun like me and I have to do so many sai kangs.. so many and so many sai kangs in my first department.. now I am in another department.. a department with less than 10 men.. all specialists... with an regular I/C that is a super slacker.. 2 of my collegues (including one most fucked up regular I ever seen in my entire life) are so slack that all they do is to sleep in the mess with the I/C.. leaving all the shit to me and my other 2 colleugues... if you guys know how much shit I have to handle all day.. it is really stessful... I have the most fu%%ed up OC ever.. the things I could complain about him.. never endless... I am so scared that one day, when he do a spot-check on my dept.. he will discover all the shit and I will get into trouble.. I so don't want to get into trouble.. I just want to lie in the background and be done with army.. but bad things always happened to me... I wonder why must I suffer all these for a pathetic pay... I just want to have a good record and no trouble but all shit are being thrown at me... tomorrow.. I have to take care of 20 NSmen to bring them to do something.. my dept is gone.. all gone for duty... including my super slacking I/C... how am I going to do it? That is no doubt I will be bullied and and f by my OC... the army is the most stupid place... I wish I could leave...<br><br>These and more are what make me hate Singapore... I never hated Singapore b4 I attended army.. but after that.. I hate the place for making me suffer... no one really bothers to help me... regulars getting so high pay.. we doing all their word.. bloodly hell... I HATE IT....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have another reason to hate NS.<br>Both my parents were Yaweh's (more commonly called Jehovah) Witnesses. My father was born one and my mother converted before they married. That was before 1980 something when Singapore disallowed the religion. What did they do? No choice... have to stop open-practice of their religion and let their son (me) go for NS. In that way I feel NS sort of puts me in a dilemma. I don't want to break the law but I have to sing the national anthem, say the pledge and serve the nation. It reminds me so much of holocaust... persecuting a religion like that! My father was born and brought up with this religion. How can Singapore just say "You can't practice your religion."? I know there have been many protests before but I'm not strongly opposed to NS. If not for my complications, I would have thoroughly enjoyed it!</div>
