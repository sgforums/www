            <div class='col-md body'>Oh, the audacity of it all ...<br><br><blockquote>here is something amazing.<br>there are nations that have lots and lots matured adults<br>even without a national service! </blockquote>There is? Name me one, preferably one with a 4m population or so &amp; also self-reliant on its own sovereignty defence.<br><br><blockquote>of course no ns does not mean a seamless transition into working life.<br>but then again, if we are to take those 2 years,<br>then either way you do mature.<br>hmm..<br>how do i teach the concept of relativity?<br>------ps----ss--ts--ns--un-------------------------------------------------------wk<br>------ps----ss--ts--un--wk-------------------------------------------------------wk </blockquote>Convince me: How do they exactly mature, if I set the bar at age 20-21 (usual ORD time)?<br><br><blockquote>yeah, teens are immatured.<br>but when they are forced into the working world,<br>within a year, they realise, damn! daddy and mummy were right! </blockquote>No, that's a fallacy of slothful induction, since our NS is neither novel or recent. See my earlier post. The pre-enlistment social mores &amp; occupational trends I highlighted have historical precedent, objectively studied by local sociologists &amp; psychologists (eg. Leong Choon Cheng's late-'70s "Youth in the Army") to help profile youthful aspirations for the area of policy-planning. While ever evolving, it's still already a case of been there/done that. Hollow point unless you're arguing from experience, which you're not.<br><br><blockquote>and if ns is really that educational,<br>why not send girls in too?<br>not for direct ns,<br>but for the experience it grants?<br>unless you like having double standards of course. </blockquote>Deja vu - seems like it's every year that letter writers would comment the same to the Straits Times forum age. To clarify (again): NS is primarily for military defence; that's separate from even nation-building designs (local context), let alone as vehicle for "educational experience" or gender emancipation. The top priority is a fighting-fit organization - &amp; hence why the SAF doesn't call up not just females, but also 1st-generation naturalised citizens &amp; the older new permanent residents.<br><br><blockquote>sense of patriotism, national consciousness - patriotism is childish. you should go for ns not because you love the country, but because you want to protect your loved ones. =) </blockquote>I think you're confusing patriotism with something else - that worked up? ~roflamo~ P.S. I "go for ns" cuz I answered the call, that's all. So, on behalf of all who's served/is serving the country, we have to "explain ourselves to a man who rises &amp; sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom we provide, then questions the manner in which we provide it"? (paraphrasing Jack Nicholson.) Lemme guess, you're gonna be like one of the selfish ang-mo who sneaked away back in January 1941.<br><br><blockquote>let me tell you something.<br>its effective, but ns is not the only place where people mature.<br>it does work very well,<br>but if you are going in for that,<br>well, you will like it,<br>OTHERS DON'T!<br>AS AMAZING AS IT SOUNDS!</blockquote>Well, you're not making a strong case for convincing at all.</div>

Our country adopts defending attack , that means if neighbours attack,<br>our forces will fight in our homeground , wherelse the other forces<br>will fight in their country, tit for tat etc..<br><br>3. The tanks are not for deployment in urbanised areas..<br>Green tanks in urban areas...( very bad camo i would say)<br><br>4.

To clarify (again): NS is primarily for military defence; that's separate from even nation-building designs (local context), let alone as vehicle for "educational experience" or gender emancipation. The top priority is a fighting-fit organization - &amp; hence why the SAF doesn't call up not just females, but also 1st-generation naturalised citizens &amp; the older new permanent residents. </blockquote>isn't that my point?<br>ns is not the only place to mature.<br>but because it is compulsory, so we have to make full use of it.<br>girls don't have to do it precisely because they are not suited for ns, i agree.<br>but you completely missed the point, which is that ns is not the only place for maturity.<br>i was attacking the idea that ns is the only place where guys mature.<br>thats ridiculous.<br>otherwise our girls will be immatured!<br>i was only giving a hypothetical situation, in accordance to your claims of only ns matures people.<br><br><blockquote>I think you're confusing patriotism with something else - that worked up? ~roflamo~ P.S. I "go for ns" cuz I answered the call, that's all. So, on behalf of all who's served/is serving the country, we have to "explain ourselves to a man who rises &amp; sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom we provide, then questions the manner in which we provide it"? (paraphrasing Jack Nicholson.)

Leong Choon Cheng's late-'70s "Youth in the Army" to help profile youthful aspirations for the area of policy-planning. While ever evolving, it's still already a case of been there/done that. Hollow point unless you're arguing from experience, which you're not. </blockquote>ns did all those because it was compulsory.<br>like me explain.<br>in france, there was a rebellion because the king, louis XVI, was a imbecile( more or less)<br>your argument is that there was a rebellion because of king louis XVI<br>my argument is that there was a rebellion because the king was an idiot.<br>i agree, ns does mature people.<br>i never said it doesn't.<br>but to say it is the only way to mature people is a moronic thing to say, in my honest to hell opinion.<br><br>*or maybe a "what to do when buggers try to takeover our country and  intend make us slaves" six months course, with a BMT before that.<br>training in counter terrorism. by using thier terrorist methods against them.<br>civillian army.<br>really civilian.<br>fighting terrorism with their very tactics..<br>ah hahaha~!<br>and then we have caches of weapons stored in hidden places, which will only reveal themselves when the govt opens them up.<br>they will come out of anyway, like even the pavement. or even the playground in your neighbourhood. or those tables sliding away at the void deck to reveal a passage down into a tunnel full of weapons.<br>to prevent people from trying to seek them out, a camera will be installed at the caches of weapons. and an alarm. very very loud alarm.  a specific alarm that warns people to do the right thing.<br><br>well its just in case our frontline defense somehow fails to protect us.<br><br>ok.. that was too radical.<br><br>but better than mrt trains transforming into giant robots, and coming out of their tunnels to protect us.<br>=S</div>

It's simply devotion to one country &amp; its fundamental values &amp; principles, plus it's also parochial in outlook. Civil ideals, good citizenship, public-spiritedness, community-mindedness, loyalty - all of them are patriotic values.<br><br>Only when you add in another element does it sometimes mutated into nationalism (good &amp; bad) or chauvinism.
