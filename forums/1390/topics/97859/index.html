            <div class='col-md body'>I've gone to Khatib Camp a lot since '85 - but not for RT! - &amp; its front gate was notorious for accidents. SAF vehicles, in particular, always seemed to langgar something when turning in from Sembawang Road (Yishun-heading side). So-much so that the camp authorities authorized elaborate directional instructions for individual or convoy drivers around that vicinity.<br><br>Hope the Tekong boys are alright. The papers reported some fractures &amp; facial injuries, &amp; they were supposedly "transporting stores". Wouldn't have liked a heavy ammo box (or whatever) crashing into me ;-(</div>

I read the incident report for this incident. It's a tonner from one of the SAR that starts with 4 (haha, its 4X SAR)<br><br>anyway, till investigations are completed, i guess we should not comment further. But the incident happened around Permatang.<br><br>but i was really impressed by the sound system in Pulau Tekong's IMT....  i did not know there was an heli-evac until i heard it from news later on. I was surprised to find out the incident happened in Pulau Tekong, I was in IMT then and totally heard nothing.<br><br>The recruits who reported sick told me that the heli-evac was damn swift... the heli landed not longer than 45 secs.</div>
