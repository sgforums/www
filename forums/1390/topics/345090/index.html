              <p>Evening all, I just received a letter from cmpb telling me to go to Hendon camp for a vocational testing. This, I presume is for the commandos. My dad as a former commando NSF has been pressuring me to bring up my sensitive nose(ie. some form of running nose in the morning and very cold airconditioned rooms) and try to get out of commando selection as according to him, the cons (injury, physical and mental strain/torture) outweigh the pros. Any views on this and whether if it's worth it to cont? I'm on the fence, i don;t have a strong inclination towards it as my interests lie in Piloting and military/Govt Intel. Which brings me to my 2nd qn, would a commando selection (if successful) inhibit my chances of being chosen to take the compass test? I intend to sign up during the military open house @ ngee ann city in march.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many thanks.</p>

              <p>Your problem should be call sinus and its pretty common so i am unsure whether it would really affect commandos selection.</p>
              <p>If you choose to sign on as a regular, what vocation you been assigned to would not matter at all.</p>

              <p>Even if you end up in commandos, when you qualify for pilot, they will still have to let you go.</p>

              <p>wanting to be a pilot, and wanting to be in Intelligence are quite far apart. Suggest you try to decide what you want before you go for the interview or sign up.</p>
              <p>Everyone wants to be a pilot at 18yr olds, but after 1 contract, most wanna get out........</p>
              <p>A career as a pilot is about flying  XXyears and not only during your NSF days</p>
              <p>Requirements for CDO and pilots are, fortunately/unfortunately quite similar. As you have seen a doc, and you dont seem to agree with his opinion, then seek advise from another one or see a specialists. BUT, if you nose really got problem, then it might affect your pilot dreams...................... think carefully.</p>

              <p><br>Thank you all. Yup i do know about the compass tests and medical, and also that being a pilot would mean a career in the RSAF with a 12 year contract. I'm 20 this year by the way, and no you won't read about my undying zeal about being a pilot as i'm sure most of us here have alr read about it from other TS'  =). I'm glad to hear that if I qualify for piloting the commandos(if so) would have to let me go. thanks again. I would post my commando related qns in the sticky.</p>
