            <div class='col-md body'>wah...looks like a history essay...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> <blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by equlus84:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmmmm..... Huaqing...<br><br>For once, u need to do some reality check on the issue of Chinese ppls dying to serve in the PLA......... Firstly, let me explain why so many ppls here are letting out these negative comment abt the NS, which has seem to amaze u abt why ppls are reluctant to do NS. To u, it may seem tat Singaporean are not Patriotic or sense of belonging.<br><br>First of all, I have completed my NS 2 yr terms in one of the Guards battalion. So I can more or less explain the sentiments faced by some of the ppls here who have done NS alreadi.<br><br>Firstly,  to let u the truth, the pay one gets during his NSF and NS term is veri MISERABLE. Of course, if u believe 100% into wat the Govt say, " increase welfare and pay",...... then, I realli hope u can go in and have a first hand experience. The pay, we receive do not realistically reflect the true market rate outside. This is also true for the regulars. I once heard my 2nd sgt back during my NSF days commenting that the pay he receive could hardly sustain him his wife and two kids. He still needs to pay for his three room flat, CPF, Electrical and water bills and his Children education. After paying all those, he hardly have any savings left. Another reason is when this regulars get old and must retire, they find difficulty getting jobs outside in the REAL world. Unless u are those lucky handful that eventually become consultants in ST Engg, or become OM of Schools...... most of those lao cik have difficulty getting employed bcos they are in the army too long and have been totally detached from the workforce. They may not have relevant skills like IT, Marketing, management which is going to be a hinder for them. More-over, companies are looking for leadership roles or skills in coporate rather than ur army skills!!<br><br>Secondly, is the general attitude ppl around us, and the general picture, impression of ppl in Green. Unlike in China, which the ppls see their troops as an icon or a poster-boy, something ppls look forward to with pride..... we do not have this in Singapore. To tell u the truth, most ppls around the world join the armed forces due to the Iron rice bowl, and lack of relevant marketable job skills, I believe this is true for China. Most ppls in the forces, especially the NCOs sign on bcos of their low education level and they cannot get employed. In China, most of the senior leaders in the CCP, also hold military titles or appointments. Furthermore, there are many 'propaganda' movies aired on TV in China, potraying their troops in a veri postive manner, some wat like a prima dona. Also, it is a common knowledge that if one serves in the armed forces in China, it opens up a window of opportunities for them. From wat I know from my PRC classmates, getting into the forces is like having a Uni cert in Singapore. In China, if u serve in the forces, even if u are an NCO or u are on a short term contract, the chances of u getting employed and getting a better job in the Government owned enterprise is very high. Besides, u will also receive lots of subsidies and incentives, which is something u will never get in Singapore.<br>Thus with this in view, one could understand why China ppls are dying to get a place in the PLA.   </div></blockquote></div>

Those never<br>served opinion is different. Although a serviceman never got injured, sometimes he might had a pyschological breakdown. I wonder if anyone of u here in forum had fren kena pyschological breakdown, basically it is the same as being injured but in the brain.</div>
