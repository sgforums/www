            <div class='col-md body'>If I remember correctly (I orded in Dec 05), there is no hard and fast rule on your ICT must be 7 Hk and 3 Lk. But you must serve at least 10 work year worth of ICT. So what do I mean by that?<br><br>For example, SAF work year start from Apr 07 - Mar 08. Within this year, you are called up for 1 LK and 1 HK. This does not mean that you had cleared 2 ICT, it will be only consider as 1 ICT cleared.  Do not forget that you are liable to be called up to a max of 40 days a year. So for example, you are called back for a Lk this month, they can still sent you a SAF 100 for another Hk in Feb. And it will only be count as 1 ICT for work year 2007.<br><br>Once you had served 10 work year of ICT, you will most likely to be posted to MR list. There is no more BIT, unless they had changed the 10 year cycle back to a 13 year cycle.<br><br>For example, I was called back for my 1st ICT in Nov 2006, and my 2nd ICT is in Feb 2008. Noted that my 2nd ICT is in 2008, but it will be consider as an ICT for work year 2007. Therefore, in year 2008, I will have another ICT any time after Apr.<br><br>So just think this way, you are 24 when you had your 1st ICT. Barring any major issues (went overseas study, work), you will finish your 10 year cycle by the age of 34. At that time, remember to push your unit to post you to the MR list, so you would not need to go for IPPT anymore. Otherwise, you will still have to attempt your IPPT until you are 40, even thou you had completed your cycle.<br></div>
