            <div class='col-md body'>As a medic spec, I've done a number of duties at the SAF ward at Alexandra Hospital. Seen plenty of such cases before.<br><br>Among some of the more notable cases I've encountered:<br><br>1. There was one Malay REC who went into breakdown during BMT. He said that he had asked a bomoh to place a curse on his poly lecturer before he enlisted. If I remember correctly, he had also supposedly placed a curse on one of his instructors during BMT.<br><br>He now regretted what he did. He went into breakdown mode over the fear of God's wrath for what he did. As a fellow Muslim, I gave him some advice regarding repentance and God's mercy.<br><br>2. One REC was warded over a suicide attempt. He went up to his instructor with a knife and threatened to slash his wrists. His commander taunted him and dared him to do so. In the end, the REC dropped the knife.<br><br>In my POV, what the instructor did was absolutely wrong - you should never, ever take a suicide threat lightly, and worse still, challenge him to do it. It could have gone terribly wrong, leading to the REC slashing himself.<br><br>Reverse psychology does not necessarily apply to all situations.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
