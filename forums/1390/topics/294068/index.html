Regardless, its just the military equivalent of a jail. The amount of days spent in CC will depend on the offence and how high ranking is the officer who sents you there. Duration of over a month is not uncommon if its the CO or higher.<br><br>All NSF gets 14 days of leave a year and besides that, you get off on all public holidays and return to camp like any normal working adult on the next working day. You can earn extra offs etc if your unit happens to burn some of your weekends but in most cases, its easier to burn weekends than claim offs.</div>

Granted, u may find the going tough throughout ur NS life, but after u come out, you will have fond memories of it.<br><br>Remember, just do whatever u have been told by ur sergeant and Platoon Commander, and u should do just fine. Try to get along with your platoon mates and section(people who sleep in the same room as you) mates, and help them whenever u can. Basic Military training will finish in a flash, and after that when u go unit, its another whole new experience.<br><br>Overall, stay positive. Don't be negative. Any personal problem u face, feel free to tell ur section mates or your sergeants or PC. They will try 2 help. The worst thing is to bottle inside u, and let it affect u, which in turn may cause harm to those near you.</div>

However since you are in tekong, they might let you bookout on sat instead of fri so you won't book in on monday and bookout again on mon night due to the holiday on tues. Such arrangement will be plan by the CO or OCs so you don't really have a choice.<br><br>If you want to go back thailand, i think it would be best to wait till you finish your BMT and go during the block leave period since its longer and you won't need to rush back after returning for just a day or 2.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Try to slowly learn the NS lingo .... you should have also received an introductory recruit's handbook.<br><br>BMT is always "stay-in" whether in BMTC (Tekong) or "mono-intake" (at the combat unit itself). I'm not familiar with the exact timetable for Enhanced BMT, Modified BMT or PTP (Physial Training Phase) BMT. But the standard one, if the system hasn't changed: first two weeks shall be "confinement" (no weekend bookouts), then a Parent's Visit Day (relatives can bring sinful food in to feed you). Thereafter, you can book out during the weekends &amp; may also occasionally get "admin time" (no night training). The reverse can also happen: "burning" a weeknight or weekend due to extra lessons or something.<br><br>If you're enlisting on Dec 15, it appears you may enjoy a super-long weekend ahead with CNY (Chinese New Year) due next year on a Thursday &amp; a Friday (7-8 Feb). New Year's Day &amp; this Xmas are also public holidays, both on Tuesdays. Not sure if you can go overseas without an "exit permit" during BMT; better check with your commanders. Hang in there, the SAF usually schedules a few days of "block leave" at the end of BMT, so as to process all the recruits' vocational/leadership postings &amp; also to synchronize the enrollment at the various units.<br></div>

Your parents/relatives will only 'visit' tekong on your 1st day and on your POP day.<br><br>You're abit big to be crying right :p Its not so bad, take the time to know your sectionmates etc well. Even though i didn't exactly enjoyed my BMT days, the experience i must admit is quite unforgetable.<br><br>Its best to know the anthem so you can sing when required and not be single out by your commanders for not singing since BMT commanders especially likes to be particular about whether you shout, sing etc etc.<br><br>Just for your info, as mentioned there is alot of public holidays on tues and thurs etc but unlike what was said, i can tell you reality will normally be you will loss your weekends more often than getting long weekends since 1 of the ways tekong plans your bookout is they will rather say eat your sat and give you off on monday or worse eat up your sat and sun to get monday off. Regardless, you will not earn extra offs/leaves etc so the more offs you get during BMT, the shorter your block leave as block leave is simply the period where they return you all the days you have burnt due to weekends etc.</div>

For my BMT batch that had 8 days of block leave, I had 4 leave and 4 off while others were clearing all 8 days of leave.</div>
