              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A national service defaulter, who had been sentenced to
               18 months' jail, had his punishment reduced to a S$5,000 fine instead 
              on Wednesday. </span></p>
              <p><span> Seow Wei Sin, who's 48, had defaulted on his NS liability for more than 23 years and was arrested last year. </span></p>
              <p><span> But his lawyers argued that the jail term was excessive as he had left 
              Singapore for Malaysia when he was just one year old and had not enjoyed
               any benefits as a citizen here. </span></p>
              <p><span> Since leaving, Mr Seow had set up a business in Malaysia, married a Malaysian and had five children, who are all Malaysians. </span></p>
              <p><span> His lawyers also argued that previous similar cases were also given fines. </span></p>
              <p><span> Taking these previous cases in account, Justice of Appeal Chao Hick Tin felt Seow's case did not warrant a custodial sentence. </span></p>
              <p><span> He will issue his reasons for doing so in a written judgement later. </span></p>
              <p><span> Under the Enlistment Act, NS defaulters can be fined up to S$5,000 or jailed up to three years. </span></p>

              <p>Those who are liable to serve national service but refuse are
              charged under the Enlistment Act. If convicted, they face three
              years' imprisonment and a fine of S$10,000.</p>
              <p>Controversy arose when the penalties were increased in January
              2006 after <a title="Melvyn Tan" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvyn_Tan">Melvyn
              Tan</a>, who was born in Singapore, received a fine for defaulting

              later acquired British nationality.

              punishments defaulters would face:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the default period exceeds two years but the defaulter is
              young enough to serve his full-time and operationally ready NS
              duties in full, MINDEF will press for a short jail sentence.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot serve his
              full-time NS in a combat vocation or fulfil his operationally ready
              NS obligations in full, a longer jail sentence to reflect the
              period of NS he has evaded may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot be called
              up for NS at all, a jail sentence up to the maximum of three years
              may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Each year, a small number of people are convicted for their
              failure to enlist or refusal to be conscripted. Most of them were

              court-martialled and sentenced to three years' imprisonment, but
              they are usually held in a low-security detention facility and
              separated from other conscription offenders. The government does
              not consider <a title="Conscientious objector" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector">conscientious objection</a> to be a legal

              <p>This case is a little disturbing. It seems to be implying that
              every male citizen born in Singapore has an obligation to serve
              right from the day of birth.</p>

              <p>Boys born to mixed-nationality couples are still expected to serve even if they grow up somewhere else.</p>

              <p>I think it would be more fair to default his citizenship. Since he's claiming to not enjoy any benefits of being a citizen since he practically never really resided in Singapore. If he really feels that losing his Singaporean citizenship is no big loss then, by all means let him go off with a light sentence. Actually, take away his fine altogether and let him walk scott free.</p>
              <p>Its odd that the government expects people of this background to serve NS despite his close ties to malaysia but still routinely discriminates against Malays and Muslims.</p>
