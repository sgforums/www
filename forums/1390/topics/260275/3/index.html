Thanks.<br><br>I dun understand though, yes u an get charged if you dun respond to a mobilization. But I can still go back when i'm in school what. I can even skip lectures and stuff if they want me back. Is there any grounds to charging me just because I entered school?</div></blockquote>why will you wan to do that? your CO can be a bastard to take away all your off(off is prilvillege) leave if can be rescheduled to give you scatterred for 2 months. then what can you do?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Clearing block leave/off DOES NOT entitle you to pursue other fulltime commitments such as jobs or education. This is simply because you are still a fulltime NSF during this period of time. If your CO let's you do it and this matter gets out, he will get it.<br><br>The only way (and it has always been this way) to go about this problem is to disrupt your NS for 1 month and then serve the 1 month during the univeristy holidays. For now, please go file for disruption asap before it's too late and stop wasting time here trying to justify your actions.<br><br>And after the application for disruption, please discuss with the relevant authorities on how you can distribute your leftover leave between now and the final 1 month. I dont think they will allow you to take the entire 1 month off. Maybe half or 3/4, something like that. This i'm not so sure.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I read most of replies in this thread. Many of you actually sympathize with the threadstarter and think that the CO does not allow him to go for his university education. But please get your facts right.<br><br>- The army does not deny anyone from further studies. This is why there is the deferment option.<br><br>- The CO did not say he wont allow the threadstarter to go for his university education. He only rejected his request for starting school while on leave, because the proper procedure all this while is to request for deferment, be it 1 month or 3 months. Many of my frens went through this.<br><br>- If the threadstarter solves this problem the usual way by applying for deferrment, he wouldnt have to wait for one more year to enter university. He just die die dont want to apply for deferment. Cant you all see? So the "wait-for one-more-year-to-enter-uni-just-becos-of-what-my-CO-did" argument is not valid.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm.... I think you should disrupt, otherwise you will waste one whole year. If he wants to go law by law, then abide it.

            <div class='col-md body'>the saf hotline is just a saf unit so that any problems can be kept within the saf.<br><br>Speaking as a ord person who play the system alot of times during his nsf days,<br><br>Tell u what, just take your leave and go for your studies. I doubt your co will know where u are when on leave, just say u are at orchard or whatever with friends or sentonsa and see what he can do. First your CO i doubt will be so free to check on a clearing leave gonna ord person.<br><br>Also i have no idea why u even considered yourself liabable for recall during your leaves and off. It is call leave and off for the reason that unless there is a bloody good reason, the unit should not contact you. The only form of leave when they can check up on you is where you are taking MC. which i don;t think you are.<br><br>So just ask your parents to say you are out when the unit call your house cause you can switch your hp line off and ask your parents call u on another hp if the unit claim something really important you  must go back. If ask why hp off, say no battery lah.<br><br>If you feel this is too risky, then disrupt lor. Or else you waste another year is worst than anything.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, thank you very much for all the replies and advices I've received. I have called the 1800 hotline on the ns.sg website, and the person on the line told me that the CO has the final say in such matters. I didn't use any threat like going to MP and stuff though.<br><br>The point here is well I do have offs AND all my leave left. Even if he decides to remove my Offs, he shudn't stop me from studying during my leave either rite?<br><br>I mean if your CO says "No you can't go clubbing while u r clearing your leave and off" it's a direct invasion of personal rights. However I know going for studies is different, but how different is it to warrant a charge? After all, I'd still go back to unit and skip classes if there's manpower issues or any recall. Heck my friend even offered to return to the unit to help out during days without classes (even when on off/leave) but was rejected as well.<br><br>Returning-from-disruption people in my unit will undergo extremely long and unmanly hours as the current batch will always be looting them. It's always like that. I've seen them come back and go.<br><br>There are people in worse scenarios than me, those going SIM. They can't go and study and they can't apply disruption either because SIM is not recognized in SAf for disruption. Of course, my CO doens't give a damn and said a flat NO to them. Heck some of them has even paid school fees and now they're in this predicament.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hows ur overlapping period? Few days? 1 week?<br><br>If it is just few days it is ok, u skip the 1st week in NTU, atmost 2 weeks, download the notes and read on ur own. For tutorials, although start on 2nd week, u still can skipped it because most 1st tutorial are quite easy and straight forward.<br><br>For labs and tutorials, just speak to the respective lecturers so that u can join  another class timing. NTU labs are divided among the classes so u can still join other class or even the part-time labs in the evening.<br><br>If the overlapping is 3 weeks and above, please do go for disruption. Because based on my experience (in NTU) if u skipped more than 2 weeks it becomes very hard to catch up especially if u are taking 6 to 8 modules per sem.<br><br>If u desperate, u can join the part-time slots (that is, if ur course has part-time such as EEE/MAE etc in NTU) which is held in the evening. Although not all modules available at night because part-timers only take 3 modules per sem. I dun think Ur CO is so on until evening also check on you ba?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>very simple. just take leave and go for your studies.<br><br>the predicament here is your CO will never openly say it's OK to go for studies during your NSF period (even though on leave). It's written in black and white liao. i believe your CO is not that heartless to hold people back, he wouldn't gain credit or promotion from such minor issues. but just to cover his own ass, he has to make a stand to follow the directive.<br><br>i'm sure everyone know this common saying in SAF <strong>"wanna do anything, just dun get caught." </strong>beneath this saying is alot more depth to it.<br><br>give you an example.<br><br>when i was in taiwan for excercise, the ninja vans are all over whenever you're outfield.

I mean what happens if SAF personals were to kenna food poisoning? kenna bird flu? who is going to answer?? that is when the cover-backside rule comes in effect. you kenna food poisoning, your own pasar. dun expect SAF to compensate you for food poisoning when ur parents come complain, write letters to papers yadda yadda...

[/b]</blockquote>Well said, which was the point i raised in my post also. Just go for your studies and don't worry about it. Seriously, on your leave days, nobody will bother you unless something important. Trust me. Only MC then they will check you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by powser:</div><div class="quote_body">First of all, thank you very much for all the replies and advices I've received. I have called the 1800 hotline on the ns.sg website, and the person on the line told me that the CO has the final say in such matters. I didn't use any threat like going to MP and stuff though.<br><br>The point here is well I do have offs AND all my leave left. Even if he decides to remove my Offs, he shudn't stop me from studying during my leave either rite?<br><br>I mean if your CO says "No you can't go clubbing while u r clearing your leave and off" it's a direct invasion of personal rights. However I know going for studies is different, but how different is it to warrant a charge? After all, I'd still go back to unit and skip classes if there's manpower issues or any recall. Heck my friend even offered to return to the unit to help out during days without classes (even when on off/leave) but was rejected as well.<br><br>Returning-from-disruption people in my unit will undergo extremely long and unmanly hours as the current batch will always be looting them. It's always like that. I've seen them come back and go.<br><br>There are people in worse scenarios than me, those going SIM. They can't go and study and they can't apply disruption either because SIM is not recognized in SAf for disruption. Of course, my CO doens't give a damn and said a flat NO to them. Heck some of them has even paid school fees and now they're in this predicament.<br><br></div></blockquote>aiya i think you dont understand SAF. going clubbing is different from studies. Just like why you cannot work doing NSF?<br><br>This is the reason why.</div>
