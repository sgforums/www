Or maybe you really have problems understanding what others are trying to put across to you. If that's the case, please get someone more intelligent to explain all the replies in this thread for you.<br><br>It has always been in the directives that you are not allowed to have other fulltime commitments as long as your are still a fulltime NSF! GET it?! Get it?!!!!!!!! Doesnt matter whether you are on leave, off, MC or wat the fcuk excuse, you are still a fulltime NSF!!!!!!! Your CO cannot verbally allow you to officially go for your studies while you are on leave! Get it?!!!!!!!<br><br>So you either apply for deferment or just go to school without getting caught! Just clear your leave and go to school! Why did you ever raise the matter to the CO in the first place?! Oh gosh!</div>

Remember that the best solution is a win-win solution. Try to give in a little at the same time. Dont expect them to totally give in to your demands.<br><br>Try to contact mindef and see what they have to say. If you are attended by those clerks who will give u answers from the book, dont waste your time. Just ask to speak to someone with higher authority. Last resort is to seek your MP's help, but really try to keep this as the last resort. And NEVER do those stupid things like write to newspaper or any other forms of media because you will not benefit from it in any way.</div>

Its common in saf.Charging someone is not use mouth to charge.They have to do lots of admin work,write report lah,edit here and there lah,obtain all the relevant signatures lah,run here run there lah(got this info from a friend who was a clerk).U think ur CO so free meh?Seriously i nv heard of pple being charged cos of pursue uni studies.More like those drug addicts or awol cases.<br><br>Your CO was really just covering his backside by telling you the directive.No other motive.You want to do what during your leave is really your problem.Just don get caught.or if you get caught,don push the blame/prob to saf eg.saying ur CO give permission.Thats probably wat ur CO is afraid.<br><br>Just take leave and go for ur studies.If you r not confident of not getting caught,then just defer lah.I think calling saf hotline and all those stuff is bs.The issue will bounce here and there then finally bounce back to ur CO.Whats the point? Anyway go back 1 mth during sem break,time passes very fast oso mah.Some more u got leave,who noes go back 2wks onli.Ur unit so jialat until cant stay even for 2wks meh?<br><br>Btw,IMHO,if you wan to complain to MP/write in ST forums/or do anything to publicise this encounter u have to the whole world,be sure to do it only AFTER you ORD.That way,u can really blast ur CO/saf mindless directive blah blah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ermmm i personally wonder how did yr CO ever get to know abt this. In the 1st place you u talk with yr PC or OC and 99% they tell u to go ahead and dun get caught. They say by right cannot this ... cannot that .. Have you not learn in yr army time that its a place where every assholes cover their assholes. Comfirm if i CO if u come and ask me silly stuff that is stated in directive , i will say no. But will i charge a person that is going ORD for studies reasons. Definate no no, if u do get charge i am sure u be the 1st and all the media will know about it and make a big bang. I am sure yr CO knows abt that too. And its only one month what u think will happen in one month.<br><br>Situation so simple just take overseas leave for as long as yr leave allows and then off or whatever way u like.<br><br>Before i ORD i had little leave left having gone for 2 holidays during NS, i told my QM and RQ that i be clearing MC. I had like almost 4 weeks of MC and was outside almost everyday during the last 3 weeks. I am proud to say in my 2 years of army i never went to tekong once , never pass my ippt and never went to a single outfield. Yet i did my work well and did others work too. Once i had medical appointments the whole week but my work was done and nobody bothered me. If u can do your own work and sometimes other's , do whatever u want, dun get caught , dun abuse and you be fine.</div>
