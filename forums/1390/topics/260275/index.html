            <div class='col-md body'>hello.<br><br>Recently our CO told us that he will not hesitate to charge anyone going into university to study by clearing leaves and off.<br><br>Is there really such new directive to it?

I have enough leaves and offs to clear myself in time to enter the course.<br><br>I understand that under leaves and offs i'm still liable to mobilizations and recalls, and I'm fully comply to coming back if my unit requires me to.<br><br>However, does the CO have the right to charge us just because we are using our leave to study?<br><br>And if there is really  anew directive to it, isn't it  alittle unfair to throw one out at a time where everyone is going to study?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i can be on standby in school what.<br><br>Anyway disruption means having to come back for one more month... and looking at all the disruptees that came back to my unit, I have to say I wanna avoid it at all cost. They are treated quite badly and there's nothing you can do abt that.<br><br>But oh well. Looks like I have no choice. If anyone else can offer some viable options, do let me know. Thanks.<br><br>I dun understand though, yes u an get charged if you dun respond to a mobilization. But I can still go back when i'm in school what. I can even skip lectures and stuff if they want me back. Is there any grounds to charging me just because I entered school?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the offer LazerLordz.<br><br>I have a friend who has already went to see the CO regarding the matter. The CO refused to let him study even though my friend offered to return to the unit (during his block leave/offs) on days he has no lessons to attend.<br><br>He was rejected.<br><br>So yeah. My CO is deifnitely a nobody out there to most people, but me being under him his word is absolute.<br><br>Feels sad to be overpowered by a nobody.<br><br>-----------<br><br>It's hard to "not get caught". All he has to do is check. Of course you may argue that he probably WON'T check, but then again he has already made the threat so I'm "liable" for getting charged rite.<br><br>I belive the CO has all the power to "stop his men" from studying if he's still in NS. I have asked the S1 for help already regarding this matter, but she is unable to do anything. Bleah.<br><br>I guess I really can't do anything about it. Sigh. Thanks all for the help. Just have to resign myself to the crappy system.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My advice is "Just Go Ahead with your studies".<br><br>But be discreet about it. Pretend that you have resigned to your fate and inform some of your superiors (incl. S1) that you've got no choice and decided to stay at home and rot during your lve/off period. Just so that if your CO asks around, then maybe they'll say you are doing what he wants you to do.<br><br>This may be deceiving, but you must understand that this is the only way you can protect yourself from ruthless and unreasonable people.<br><br>Of course, do your best to be on standby mode during the crucial period. Leave a set of uniform and boots in camp just in case you've to rush back and change quickly.<br><br>I certainly see no point in following mindless orders from mindless people.</div>

I have enough leaves and offs to clear myself in time to enter the course.<br><br>I understand that under leaves and offs i'm still liable to mobilizations and recalls, and I'm fully comply to coming back if my unit requires me to.<br><br>However, does the CO have the right to charge us just because we are using our leave to study?<br><br>And if there is really  anew directive to it, isn't it  alittle unfair to throw one out at a time where everyone is going to study?</div></blockquote>If your predicament is true ... you should get your parent to go to MP for help ... if your CO really charge you ... you can publicise it and his career definitley gone liao ...<br><br>believe me it is just empty threat</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Thanks for the offer LazerLordz.<br><br>I have a friend who has already went to see the CO regarding the matter. The CO refused to let him study even though my friend offered to return to the unit (during his block leave/offs) on days he has no lessons to attend.<br><br>He was rejected.<br><br>So yeah. My CO is deifnitely a nobody out there to most people, but me being under him his word is absolute.<br><br>Feels sad to be overpowered by a nobody.<br><br>-----------<br><br>It's hard to "not get caught". All he has to do is check. Of course you may argue that he probably WON'T check, but then again he has already made the threat so I'm "liable" for getting charged rite.<br><br>I belive the CO has all the power to "stop his men" from studying if he's still in NS. I have asked the S1 for help already regarding this matter, but she is unable to do anything. Bleah.<br><br>I guess I really can't do anything about it. Sigh. Thanks all for the help. Just have to resign myself to the crappy system.</blockquote>Hi powser,<br><br>Firstly, I feel the same way as LazerLordz; it is indeed sad that your CO is denying you your privilege in clearing your block leaves and make it time for the NTU enrollment after the months of dedicated service that you provided for both unit and country. Do note that i used the word "privilege" as going to school during your leaves is in no way a "right".<br><br>That being said, I would highly suggest to you to exhaust ALL possible options to fight for your privilege and making it in time for enrolling into NTU. And by ALL possible options, I mean seeking out a second opinion from your neighborhood MP or even submitting a written article to the Straits Times Forum page and bring this issue into the light.<br><br>Those 2 methods are NOT guaranteed to work but at least you have the satisfaction of knowing that you did your best and probably "wake up your CO's idea" should he wish to pull out stunts like that in the future.<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth..</div>
