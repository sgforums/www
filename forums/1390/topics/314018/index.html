              <p>ok. I was recently charge on 07/04/08 for not attenting RT..</p>
              <p>Long before my charge date, upon receiving my notice to turn up, i on that day call my unit for an appeal. My unit mdm told me as SAF unwent some revamp, they have no authority to waive off charge but to go for the charges. (LL not given much choice)</p>
              <p>I went for my charge on 07/04/08 13hrs @ CMPB. I was inform by the JDO that i can actually do an appeal via my unit for a waiver. I was like wtf. They deny me of the chance of appeal. Since already charge LL go back office.</p>
              <p>Here comes the joke, @ 1445hrs, my unit clerk call me stating that my unit will waive off the charge &amp; told me no need to go for the charge. I screw that burger &amp; told him to get the dept head to call me as he mention he thought the dept head have called me up to tell me of the waiver.</p>
              <p>Since 04/07/08, i have drop alot of email to my unit via ns portal. To date not much response. I am very pissed off at the fact that they spend too much time sitting on issue rather than solve things. I have also sent out an email via Ns portal to mindef for clarification, but i do not know if they have hijack my mail..</p>
              <p>Any channel to mindef directly other than media?</p>

              <p>totally agree why screw the clerk? he is following instructions?</p>
              <p>u did something wrong in the 1st place by not going for RT. Not happy with RT then jolly well attend , train and attempt IPPT. If u fail IPPT then take Rt as a good training Dont be a weakling n drag a helpless clerk</p>
              <p>If u got injuries or wadever then go see MO to request for excuse.</p>

              <p>actually, i am not pissed off at the fact that i need to go RT..</p>
              <p>Pissed off at the fact that they did not discharge their rightful duties when i call them up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. when i called up my unit long before the charge date, i was inform by the head that due to the restructing , unit NO LONGER have the power to appeal/ waive off the charge.</p>
              <p>However, when i attend charge, the JDO inform me that unit STILL have the power to waive off the charge.</p>
              <p>This i was denied my rightful chance to appeal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. when the clerk call @ 1445hrs to inform me of the wavier, it alreeay past my charge time @1300hrs which is a major screw up. He told me the unit head, is suppose to call me &amp; tell me no need to attend charge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. I did apply for medical review since my ORD 2001. Nothing was done, no sound no pic. This is a screw up which cause me to attent charge a few time, &amp; have been explaining to the officer all the time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>after my charge date 7/4/2008, i sent no less than 12 email to the <a href="mailto:contact@ns">contact@ns</a> &amp; my unit to ask about what the hell is going on but on receive ONE pathetic reply of will look into it &amp; revert. well. I fail to mention that my unit medical centre also did a big screw up. i went for medical review on 20/2/2008 &amp; was given a memo to go SGH. But the memo itself did not state to which dept/doc/ or wad time/date! I rush off &amp; did not see the memo as i waited for FIVE(5) freaking hour in the medical center just for the memo. i query them but NO response.</p>
              <p>And for that medical review, i was entitle for claim on loss of income as inform by NS payment dept but not my unit!  The transport claim for my medical review came in only on 12/4/08. 2 months to process the claim? Inform by the office from Payment dept that the claim only came in few days back which make me believe my unit really screw up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today i receive a call from my PAC &amp; inform me to go down my unit in CV to meet up with the CO LTC xxx to discuss this issue.</p>
              <p>If i am in the wrong would SAF go all out to neg on this issue? Yes i make mistake by not attenting RT but i did nothing to deserve this screw up?</p>
