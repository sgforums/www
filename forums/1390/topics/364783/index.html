              <p>I'm sure you know by now that the compulsory 2-year NS system for men is important as Singapore needs a defence force to sustain survival. This is due to its small size and its surroundings.</p>
              <p>But I just want to gather feedbacks about the nasty happenings in your NS. Over these 4 decades, with many evil things happening around, don't you think that it can be a very political issue?</p>
              <p>You see. My dad told me that in the 70s, when NS was still young, during BMT, some recruits would be given nicknames by their sergeants. The nicks are even more severe than 'blur king'. Suicides were committed as a result.</p>
              <p>Not only this, many were rumored to have died during trainings and this would go unpublicised and unpublished. It was only recently that about 10 years ago, deaths from dunking incidents for example started surfacing in the press.</p>
              <p>Now, do you think that if Singapore were to be as democratic as HK, Japan and South Korea, people would have gone to Hong Lim Park to stage demonstrations and protests regarding the harsh and sometimes unreasonable and abusive authority.</p>

              <p><br>Firstly, people are still given nicknames now. It might not be as bad as before. it still exists. I have been labelled with 101 nick names and i am still well and alive. <br><br>Since training deaths are now open than before, what are you afraid of? The regulars training you are even more afraid of their ricebowl than u dying. While accidents still do occur, i am pretty sure that a reasonable amt of safety measures have been taken. <br><br>If not, there are proper channels to seek, although the effectiveness is still greatly debated ...</p>

              <p>Sometimes, I really wonder if our troops are so soft as to become depressed over what is essentially parade-ground nicknaming.. something which every military in the world has.</p>
              <p>Our boot camp is tough? Wait till you check out the USMC's boot camp at Parris Island</p>
              <p>Politically speaking, there's really nothing much anyone can say against this system, because liberal or conservative, we've realised that NS is still a neccessary evil..</p>

              <p>I have to agree with fudgester...our NS here is already very relax liao..comparing to Israel and Taiwan. No change parade, no this no that..... Actually during the early days of our NS they were tough cos Israelis train us...anyway what's wrong with giving nicknames in NS...in schools you are given nicknames by your friends as well. In return, I'm sure many of us give the PS, PC, CSM nicks as well.</p>
              <p>As for democratic.....it depends on how u looked at it, like HK and Korea so good meh? btw TS, u said it yourself, in the past all these death cases were not published but now all these are published doesn't it so it's more democratic now?</p>

              <p>If you got to serve, then go and serve it.</p>
              <p>I have no idea about hongkong or Japan but you better be glad that you are not in Korea. Training is super tough because North Korea would be harassing their borders every now and then. You life is in constant danger. If not why do you think so many actors tried to avoid army.</p>
              <p>You should be happy because Singapore army is constantly upgrading to provide a better environment for you. Army life gets easier with good food, beds, and enough time for sleep. SO be glad</p>
