              <p>Hi all, this has been at the back of my mind for some time and I have never been really able to find an answer for it. Ippt, we all know that it is compulsory to be taken, but when does it exactly stop? My neighbour, who is 38 years old, recently booked an IPPT, and when I look at him, beer belly, thinning hair, it is a scary thought to me.</p>
              <p>According to SAF, Nsmen are excused from IPPT once they are into Mindef reserves, which means, either completed 7 high key ICTs plus 3 low key ICTs or when one has reached the age of 40. So, my unit is pretty much confirmed to have an ICT every year, on a side note, we were a best combat unit during active time, so very on unit, I guess that's why we have it every year..... Anyway, I have already gone through 3 ICTs, I'm 24 this year, and therefore, I should complete my 10 year cycle by the age of 32, which also spells the end of my IPPT cycle, right? It would be great to end this earlier than most people, at least I can focus on other things in life.</p>
              <p>Just for your info, I'm a spec, so the officer thingy doesn't affect me.</p>
              <p>So, for my friends, who are also 24 this year, they haven't been called up to a single ICT as of now, and they hear no news of a call up, so they will probably have to do IPPT till they are 40 unless the medical board exempts them?</p>

              <p>Right, so I'm safe to say that I can stop taking IPPT once I end all the 10 ICT cycles?</p>
              <p>Well, so it seems that having regular ICTs is not that bad afterall......</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NS Liabilities Related Issues</span></strong> </p>
              <p><strong>Q1 How will my participation in IPPT activities be counted towards my NS liabilities of 40 days a year? <br></strong>If the IPPT is initiated by your unit (e.g. during ICT), your call up is already covered within the call-up period as stated in your SAF100 served. If you book and attempt IPPT on your own at any of the FCCs or SAFRA EnergyOne Gyms (i.e. non-ICT IPPT), you will only be paid service pay (SP) and Make-Up-Pay (MUP), when applicable, for the first 3 sessions you took within the same qualifying window. Each of these non-ICT IPPT sessions is recognised as a half day call-up. Further IPPT attempts within the same qualifying window will not be counted towards your NS liabilities.</p>
              <p><strong>Q2 How do I prove to my employer that I am attending a non-ICT IPPT since there is no SAF100 to be issued? <br></strong>With your NRIC No. and date of birth, you can log in to your NS booklet on <a href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a> where your record of IPPT can be found. With this you can proof to your employer that you have indeed signed up and attended the IPPT. Alternatively, when records have not been updated, you can call 1800-eNSNSNS to clarify. Also, you will be issued an IPPT result slip at the end of the test session, which can also be used to confirm your attendance.</p>
              <p><strong>Q3 Must I notify my unit when I take my IPPT? <br></strong>No. There is no requirement to inform your unit when you take IPPT. Your unit will be able to view your detailed results and training history through the backend systems.</p>
              <p><strong>Q4 I was initially disrupted and now I am posted to a NS unit and I am required to take IPPT. When will my qualifying window starts?<br></strong>You can start taking your IPPT from the effective date of posting to the new unit. Provisions to allow the early opening of your qualifying window ahead of your next birthday. Any IPPT attempts, incentive award achieved during this early opening window is considered as within the same IPPT qualifying window.</p>
              <p>The example below best illustrates this early window opening policy:<br>LCP (NS) Roger was born on 20 Feb 1985. After he has ORD, he was disrupted from NS due to ITE studies. After his ITE studies, he received a posting letter informing him that he will be posted to an NS Infantry Bn with effect from 1 Dec 2004. With the early opening of the qualification window policy, LCP (NS) Roger's extended window is now from 1 Dec 2004 to 19 Feb 2006. All IPPT attempts, incentive award achieved from 1 Dec 2004 to 19 Feb 2006 is considered as within the same IPPT qualifying window. <br><br><strong>Q5 If I am posted to MINDEF Reserve, am I still liable for IPPT?<br><span style="color: #ff0000;">NSmen who have been posted to MINDEF Reserve will receive a letter from the respective unit. Once posted to MR list, your status as active NS will cease and you are not required to take IPPT.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Q6 I am a DXO, can I take IPPT with the active unit that I am working in? Will I be paid service pay/make-up pay? <br></strong>As a DXO, you can take your annual IPPT with the active unit. However, you will not be paid service/make up pay but you can qualify for monetary awards if you meet the required standards. The IPPT session taken with the active unit will not count towards the 40-day NS liability or one of the three self-initiated non-ICT IPPT sessions.</p>
              <p><strong>Q7 I travel frequently in and out-country for overseas assignments, am I still required to take my annual IPPT?<br></strong>As long as you are still deployed in an IPPT eligible NS Unit, you are required to fulfil your annual IPPT requirement within your qualifying window. As the booking system allows for advance booking and booking via the internet, you can forecast your return from overseas and attempt the non-ICT IPPT.</p>
              <p><strong>Q8 What happens if I need to be overseas for work commitment for more than 6 months to less than a year?<br></strong>As long as you are still deployed in an IPPT eligible NS Unit, you are required to fulfil your annual IPPT requirement within your qualifying window. However, in such an instance, you are required to apply for Exit Permit. As part of the application process, <br>it is clearly stated that you need to ensure that you do not have to fulfil any NS liabilities within the period of departure before applying for the exit permit.</p>
              <p>Your IPPT and RT (if applicable) is one of such NS liabilities that must be fulfilled, failing which deferment must be granted prior to Exit Permit approval. You are advised to attempt your IPPT prior to your departure. If you are undergoing Remedial Training (RT), you are to seek deferment from RT, similar to seeking deferment from ICT. Hence, you will need to ensure this before you leave for work and assignment.</p>
              <p><strong>Q9 What happens If I need to be overseas for work commitment for more than 1 year?<br></strong>You should apply for disruption from National Service. Once disrupted, you will not be required to take IPPT. However, as part of the administration to process your disruption application, your IPPT history will be checked to ensure that you do not have any outstanding IPPT/RT related offences.</p>
