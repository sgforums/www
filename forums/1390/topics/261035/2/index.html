            <div class='col-md body'>The mitilary career seems to be one of the most mis-understood one. Its really not what you think it is after you have went through it. Dear friends, ask yourself..what do you see in the job that interest you and what is it that you can contribute by being in that position.<br><br>This military path is a kinda one way path..Dont choose it and regret halfway..<br>Ask around and you can roughly figure out whats it like... But live it before chosing it...Hope that helps....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

What i feel is important is that before one commits to the defence of the nation, that his intentions are right.<br><br>As mentioned, it's not about pay and certainly not about glory. The job is critical and an officer holds the lives of his men in his command. Such is the scope of work, the nation would be better off with well informed people who join the service out of passion, sustainable interest and a right mentality to adversities one might face.<br><br>I don't forsee a lack of committed men and women who will join the officer corp or WOSE Corp... or even as regular men. Having been through the army, i've noticed more people signing on because of money... and thus we're just want to try to give a good balanced perspective to signing on.<br><br>IMHO, the lure of easy money makes for a defence force that has people in it for mainly monetary benefits.. thus i hope to never see the regular force be akin to mercenaries.<br><br>cheers</div>

That is why ppl take part-time ususally when they are 2SG and above (sorry for not mentioning this earlier). This is about 3 to 5 years into the service. Usually, as you progress up the ladder, your duties reduce, for example, the warrant officers in my unit kena only duty officer and only do 2 times per month.<br><br>Furthermore, your camp and unit places a part because not all units or camp kena extra duties. For example, my active unit last time are not included into guard duties for the whole camp because our unit's manpower is already severely  limited with most men (below 3SG rank) are PES C9 or E.<br><br>I mentioned from what I observed in NTU that part-timers are usually from Navy and air-force ususally from service/tech vocations due to more stable timing. There are also ppl from the police force also.<br><br>I want to stress that it is not impossible to do part-time (or else I will not be seeing ppl doing part-time in NTU liao) but your timing during your tour of service must fit into the schedule. Of course, you may lose lessons to duties but you got your part-timer frens to help you also wat. Because the part-timers are few so the community is more cohesive.<br><br>The only whining I hear from them is studying is getting "sibei boring &amp; sian" because it is a 5 year course, they only graduate next year while I graduate this year.</div>
