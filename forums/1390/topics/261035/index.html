Hear say, now quite hard to reach because SAF kick ppl out at the end of the 1st 10 year bond.<br><br>For sign on, ONLY consider after you have served at least for 6 months (inclusive of BMT and unit life). Only by then if you find that that kind of life suits you and you find it interesting then go ahead.<br><br>Once sign on, it is black and white, you can't easily break bond one.

            <div class='col-md body'>but wad abt air force n navy? they should be considered less regimental right? i even heard abt pple in navy who doesn't really give a shiit abt ur rank but ur seniority. i am considering signing on as specialist but i will take up a part time degree so as to sort of "save" myself when i get kick out after the 10 yr bond. but wad im afraid is tat u will be required to work unexpected shifts which may disrupt ur lessons. any regulars care to share some light abt tis?</div>

It is how they want to enforced in your unit. Example: In my active days, I experience a cross over period of 2 RSM. One is more "close one eye" and have more leeways. The other enforced regiment to the core.<br><br>So you might have heard that some units less regimental but might not be the case when you enlist.<br><br>For sign on, I still stand by my words: Experience first then decide. (I have frens who all regret after sign on and now they are stuck in a job they find it sucky)<br><br>You are right on part-time studies. Take NTU part-time EEE, typical 3 modules per sem, taking atleast 3 days per week (could have more depending on schedule such as lab lessons and all weekday class). Starting from 7 to 10pm.<br><br>So basically once you are on duty (be it COS/BOS/duty officer/etc) you are stuck in camp and miss lessons unless of course you volunteer to switch all your duties to weekend duties (then alot of your army buddies will super thank you and you basically have no life <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>Part-time for SAF from I observed, they are ususally from air-force and Navy (non-sailing) mostly from tech/service vocations. And it is not easy and requires alot of commitment from family/work, drop out rate for part-timers is quite high by the end of the final year, one lecture hall could only seat less than 10 students per module.</div>
