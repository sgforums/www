I was like  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Later the MO gave that "Bo chup" attitude and cleared my FFI without even mentioning about my blood pressure. Before I had a chance to talk to him, he ask me to leave the room. wtf?!!! I have no qualms about BMT but I was like  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  about my high blood pressure as I don't have it previously.<br><br>So later when I book out and went to my GP and ask.

I was down graded subsequently.<br><br>So if you have a real condition make a big fuss out of it. What if ppl think you chow keng, it is your life we are talking here.</div>

I have never encountered such a person? Are you sure?<br><br>If you do have recurrent chest pain, it is important to investigate your condition. Generally your specialist will arrange some test to look at the structure of the heart and the flow of the blood vessels. This will generally give a reason as to why you are having these reccurent problems at such a young age. If your condition is not that severe then your specialist might do a threadmill stress ECG.. They kinda monitor your heart when you are running.<br><br>Coming back to your PES status. Did you bring any osrt of documentation to CMPB?? If you did not well you asked for it. You have had lots of time to arrange for them.. If you did and it shows you have esrious heart problems, I cannot imagine CMPB giving you a PES B. Sometimes they give a temp PES D until you are sorted out. No need to talk to your MP. Just prepare your documents, and on the first day inform your OC to allow you to report sick and show the MO your stuff. They will surely out of course you and put you up for a medical board<br><br>Hope this helps<br></div>
