              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I was wondering about how to file a Claim for lost of income in the event I am recalled back to Camp by SAF during working hours?</p>
              <p>Do I go to http://ns.sg to write the Make Up Claim form only after the call-up has happend?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or do I declare my working income first, when they call-up for Mob-Briefing/Ops Manning/ Mobilization Manning, than I can take back the lost of income due to excuse from work from the SAF?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>My situation:</strong> I've just ended my 3 months work probation, so the pay is increased. Than how do I notify SAF so in the event of claim, they will know the correct amount to be caluculated and compensate NS Man?</p>

              <p>i dun see any part that ask u claim from employer. Claim from employer is same as asking them to pay you salary. actually for those 1/2 day or 1 day event, it all depend on your company on whether they still willing to pay you your normal salary and let you go to camp. if they willing to pay, then no need to submit make up pay.</p>
              <p>usually mob briefing is only 1/2 days on weekday.. if you are issue SAF100 , then u can claim make up pay before the briefing... for mobilization, no SAF100 will be issued and usually it will happen on sat or sun (so if you are  not working on weekend, then no make up pay claims).</p>
              <p>you fill in part 1 of that form. your company fill up part 3 (if u have detail, u can fill in also). and your employer must certified what is filled in part 3 is correct... then faxed it over. that it.</p>

              <p>My first Mob Briefing was on a Friday, but the make-up Mob Briefing was on a Saturday. Both days I missed with valid reasons.</p>
              <p>So I just need to wait for my camp to notify me of the next Mob briefing right?</p>
              <p>can i ask how did you find that form?</p>
              <p>i don't know where to click in the ns portal when i login.</p>
              <p>can tell me the steps?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>=== Side track as about Mobilization ==</p>
              <p>Btw: is there any particular period for Mobilization that they will call/sms your hp to test our responsiveness?</p>
              <p>Like will they call in 4am or 12midnight when majority of people are already asleep than push the fault to us?</p>
              <p>Or will they call like only within reasonable hours? I was very worried and checking the hp for my 1st Mobilization Manning. Is there any advice that you can give me?</p>
