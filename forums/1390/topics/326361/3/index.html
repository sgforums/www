              <p>1) Did i say that the who's who in the SAF do not have people under

                  including private ones, it's a pyramid shaped? Of cos the who's who on
                  top have 1000x more people under them lah. Did i say that they exist on top
                  without a bottom?</p>
              <p>2) I was answering what the Bear said. Pls
                  reread all the antagonistic, derogatory and inflammatory statements he

              <p>I think changing the uniform will bring the 59% singaporean
              babies further down.. no more attraction but turn off.. more
              divorce cases coming up because husbands no longer smart enough in
              the new number.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the concern to the guys is not only it's lame to change uniform
              standards every now and then, go beach road sew stupid tags and now
              change uniforms. those seasoned uniforms so shuang now have to
              change. so er xin.</p>
