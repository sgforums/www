              <p>They changed it for a good reason ArmyWife .. deal with it,
              sounds like your husband wears it 24/7 too, smell much ? . Wearing
              it to bed , you have a uniform fetish</p>

              <p>What good reason?? ok really i saw the pic of the MARPET uniform. I don't think it can camo well in our forest. Our forest is all leaves. its green. The new uniform is brown. It stands out more. And the camo print of the old no.4 has the same color scheme as the south east asian forest. how do you know it will camo better when you have yet to wear it in the field?</p>
              <p>Of cos he does not wear it 24-7 unless he's outfield on exercise lah. Everyday he change 1 set when he comes home. I wash for him mah. In bed, he wear new one. So no worries, no smell problem</p>
              <p>Something else an army wife can highlight to you men, the army no.4, even after washed freshly got one smell.. it's not a bad smell, not BO type (the BO smell is quite pungent after a long day in the field.. OMG). But even when washed it has this smell i think is due to the fabric lor..</p>
              <p>I love the buttons on the pants, the buttonfly opening and I love the 4 pockets on the shirt and the pockets on the pants..</p>

              <p>What good reason?? ok really i saw the pic of the MARPET
              uniform. I don't think it can camo well in our forest. Our forest
              is all leaves. its green. The new uniform is brown. It stands out
              more. And the camo print of the old no.4 has the same color scheme
              as the south east asian forest. how do you know it will camo better
              when you have yet to wear it in the field?</p>
              <p>Of cos he does not wear it 24-7 unless he's outfield on exercise
              lah. Everyday he change 1 set when he comes home. I wash for him
              mah. In bed, he wear new one. So no worries, no smell problem</p>
              <p>Something else an army wife can highlight to you men, the army
              no.4, even after washed freshly got one smell.. it's not a bad
              smell, not BO type (the BO smell is quite pungent after a long day
              in the field.. OMG). But even when washed it has this smell i think
              is due to the fabric lor..</p>
