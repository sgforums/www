              <p>Before you slime, look into the mirror first. Are you qualified? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/sleep.png" alt="sleep.png"> That's how people look at you wor.

              <p>Do you know why somebodies have no time to watch tv or see their family? Cos they have to justify their paycheques. Maybe we're talking about different people here. If the 'senior management' you're referring to is very free, then we're barking up the wrong tree.</p>

              <p>Do you know why somebodies have no time to watch tv or see their family? Cos they have to justify their paycheques. Maybe we're talking about different people here. If the 'senior management' you're referring to is very free, then we're barking up the wrong tree.</p>

              <p>ok the Bear it's simple. No need to talk so much abt your gripes. You can't seem to tell me anything I asked you abt who you referred to, as well as YOUR OWN lot in life.</p>
              <p>The info must have escaped the vacuum in your peanut brain because you had coordinate your mental faculties to type that rant to me.</p>
              <p>Don't worry. I give you time.. when you finally collect your thoughts enough to remember who you are in life, come back and tell me. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
