              <p>honestly Beautiful, I cant say abt you, because you did not slime anyone yet. you could well be very happy.</p>
              <p>But if you want me to compare the Bear/the like of him, and the SOMEBODIES, hahaha I can confirm to you the latter are happier by one billion times. First, they are somebodies and have power. Second, other than being nobodies and having achieved nothing, I know the former is unhappy based on their actions of sliming. Slimers are never happy people.</p>
              <p>That's why because you didn't slime, I believe you could be a very happy person.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Gottt. the Bear has still hidden away from my question. He wrote a long cheong hei list of tirade (of which I didn't read at all), to rant against the SAF without daring the name names and appointments.</p>
              <p>ok the Bear it's simple. No need to talk so much abt your gripes. You can't seem to tell me anything I asked you abt who you referred to, as well as YOUR OWN lot in life.</p>
              <p>The info must have escaped the vacuum in your peanut brain because you had coordinate your mental faculties to type that rant to me.</p>
