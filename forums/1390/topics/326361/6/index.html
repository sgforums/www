              <p>sorry you said this while quoting what I asked the Bear?? it's separate points right?</p>
              <p>anyway what are you saying? pls tell me directly instead of hinting. I don't have to tell you my husband's unit in order to air my views about the new uniform, which was my initial and sole intention. so i wondered why you asked, while trying to phrase that they're related.</p>
              <p>If you didn't mean for them to be related and was genuinely curious about where he is for the sake of it, then its quite funny that you'll think i'll tell you who he is.</p>
              <p>btw I really doubt you can't google camp pass color when even the security car decal for army personnel's personal cars are meaningfully designed to look civilian. they're more careful than that. I probably know more about certain parts of the army than you, being with an army officer for quite long.</p>

              <p>ArmyWife: i personally feel you're getting out of hand and this discussion is getting nowhere. you're here to voice your opinion not to flame people who don't agree with you <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"> this is a public forum for goodness sake. accept comments and criticisms!</p>
              <p>the point mentioned about the fugly looking army uniform.</p>
              <p>1) are you wearing it?</p>
              <p>2) you think fighting a war is like walking on a stage during a fashion show? you think your uniform nice enemy won't shoot you is it <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>
              <p>please take your sexual fantasy to your own private blog or something and spare us the ranting. goodness gracious me. what right do you have to want SAF to change the uniform to the old one? you're not even serving the army. you're just an 'outsider' who's a wife of an army personal. i don't understand your logic behind creating this thread. just to vent your fustrations? showing that your life revolves muchly around the army uniform? damn it. people out there are worrying about so many other things and here you are here worrying how ugly your husband will look in the new army uniform.</p>
              <p>i tell you something. ugly means ugly. handsome means handsome. you think beckham will look ugly if he wears our new singapore army uniform? think about it <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>

              <p>i asked him who he was referring to. So the Bear, tell me (though it vastly deviates from my initial topic), who are you referring to? Have the balls and spell it out. Afterall this is just a forum and it's anonymous, gives you the license to say what you don't have the guts to say in camp.</p>
              <p>You referring to who huh...which senior management is not good enough for you?So how much do you earn? Where do you work? What did you study? What's your CV like? Where did you study? Whats your future? Do you have a job now? if you do, what's your CEP in your company? you referring to who huh? CDF? COA? Which Div Com?</p>
              <p>Tell me and perhaps one day I can even relate your 'valuable' feedback from your 'educated' and 'elite' experience and perspective of your present state and lot in life to the big shots should i see them one day in a dine-in.</p>

              <p>If I may say, you have not given people a chance to know you before you start airing your opinions. It may be a little better if you have idle chatted on the crapbox and had a friendly talk with the people around this place before going into topic so quickly. Because maybe it would have given you time to understand how this place works.</p>
              <p>Just my humble opinion.</p>

The fact that you only seem to care about the appearance of your husband in his uniform proves you that you have some kind of fetish. If i was a guy , i would hate to have a woman like you for a wife, only caring about appearance. Shouldn't you be thinking of his health rather than how he looks.</p></div>
