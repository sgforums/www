              <p>Of cos I won't say that to those people!!!!!!!.. I was just responding to you when you said that firemen and policemen's uniforms are supposedly sex symbols and more women like them. I can tell you it's not true. Police is possibly the worst.</p>
              <p>Do you HONESTLY think these people and their partners think the new uniform is nice? Look its almost unanimous agreement in every forum that the new uniform is fugly. I bet they can see that?? Its ok. I know a lot of other wives feel the same as i do.. but no one voices it because of the kind of reaction they fear they'll get, like how you all have reacted..</p>

              <p>Stocks, bonds and commodity investment I leave to my hubby. My kids are very obedient and are not in primary school yet. They're doing well, happy..my hair and nails are great.. my hair is rebonded so it's fuss-free..as for my nails, they're healthy. I do have manicures every few weeks but have lost interest in the last few years in manicures after I got married.</p>
              <p>The no. 4 (now) is PERFECT. My hubby wears it everyday. It is important.</p>

              <p>i agree totally.</p>

              <p>TS, as much as you don't like the new uniform, there's NOTHING you or us can do to change it. All you are doing now is getting ppl to flame and laugh at you. You can still keep the old uniforms right, Why worry? :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think i have a rough idea what the new uniform looks like, it will take some time to get used to it. I just dislike the prospect of having to sew all the tags over again, waste money, cos i NSman seldom wear....</p>

              <p>Who changed the title of my thread?!?!??!? Grrr!</p>
              <p><br>I have not heard of such officers before. I mean, if they want to do that, it's just career suicide. If such people if they exist in the 1st place love to get stuck and retire as a CPT or MAJ, haha by all means.</p>
              <p><br>I mean anyone can do anything they like to knock their own sucks off, even in the private sector, if you want to sleep in your office when your boss is talking to you and even drool on him, also can. It's just a matter of what you want to achieve in your time anywhere.</p>
