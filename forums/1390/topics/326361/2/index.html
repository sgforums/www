              <p>Ok now I have a better idea of the kind of 'reception' i will
              get if I raise the issue casually to the wife or an officer of
              general level or to officer themselves, something i considered
              seriously. This matter is so frivolous and funny to you? It's not
              to me.</p>
              <p>None of you are regulars I believe? It's one thing to wear
              something hideous for 2 yrs, but another thing to know you'll be
              wearing it everyday until you're 45. And as wives, we have to see
              the new ugly uniforms on our husband everyday. Its so ugly really..
              I think the enemies will laugh their heads off when they see our
              soldiers on the battlefield.. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>The manly one now is already very stealthy and is a very good
              camo. We will not be doing many urban ops. When war breaks out, it
              will primarily be fought in the jungle. Also, the landscape and
              fighting zone of our enemies are all jungle. That is why we have
              only 1 unit doing FIBUA compared to 5 infantry units specialising
              in jungle combat. And with the new digital print uniform, does SAF
              expect its soldiers to draw digital patterns on face too?</p>

              <p>No. I am not a clone or troll or whatever!! Arrrrgh!!!!</p>
              <p>I am serious!</p>
              <p>Look, if you guys who are actually wearing the uniform can find it ugly, (yup I've done my research in this forum and hardwarezone, all unanimously say that the new uniform is fugly and hideous) do you think the WIVES of the men (being women and more aesthetically inclined and sensitive) feel nothing?! Think about it.</p>
              <p>Plus, the army fatigues uniform has always been a symbol of attractiveness. That's why it's featured in some gay/straight porn. The other uniforms such as the no.1 and no.5 are always featured in movies as dashing symbols. And FYI many many wives love the no.4 together with the BOOTS.</p>
              <p>If the military uniforms have such a connotation in the public eye as well as pop culture among civilian women and men, do you honestly think that the real life wives of regulars did not realise this, or you honestly think they don't feel anything towards the uniforms?! Puh lease.</p>

              <p>To the Bear: Your IQ can't drop any further. Don't think it was due to the uniform so don't blame it. Your default IQ of 60 probably went up by 20 whenever it received a jolt of stimulation from beer. When the hangover is gone, it goes back to 60 and you blamed the uniform.</p>
