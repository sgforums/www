              <p>Hi. I asking this question on behalf of a friend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My friend right now is a poly diploma holder, with a slot reserve for him in the local unis. He pass the first few stages of the pilot test, and is currently awaitng for enlistment before going overseas for training to become a qualified pilot.</p>
              <p>As a RSAF pilot, what will be his pinnacle rank? He want to become a BG, but as far as I know, you need to be SAFSO scholar in order to become at least a colonel (do correct me if I am wrong here). His poly results are not excellent, hence he is not able to clinch it. As a result, is there any other possible path to become a BG? How about a scholarship after his uni studies?</p>
              <p>Else, what will be his rank progression like if he dont have a scholarship?</p>

              <p>Wait for him to pass his flight school first in <span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Australia</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> </span>. Which have a super high failling rate of 87%</p>
              <p>Assume he can get his training wings he will go to 3 areas</p>
              <p>1) Fighter pilot ( best of the best) </p>
              <p>2) Aircraft transport pilot</p>
              <p>3) helicopter pilot</p>
              <p>Even during his air unit stint he might not get his wings cos there are many things that the trainer look out for and he might get grounded.</p>
              <p>My advise before looking at rank, get your wings first.</p>
              <p>Hint : flying your training aircaft 10cm too near your wing man can cos you to get kick out of flying school. Refusing any order also get kick out  </p>

              <p>i read before that in the whole SAF there are about 40 generals, and it's too many for a force of this size. given there are 3 or 4 SAFOS every year, there should be at least twice as many SAFOS around at any one time (in service). with a higher CEP policy dictates that they be given the chance first.</p>
              <p>i would say realistically, very very hard. you have to be superhuman to attain it.</p>

              <p>There are tons of farmers in the whole of the civil service, not just the SAF with local degrees. So your friend doesn't quite have any command of differentiation. Like someone aptly said, you can fly the death star and won't get past COL rank if you are deemed not intelligent enough. Management of the armed forces goes way beyond the technical skills possessed by technical vocations like MOs and pilots.      </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the reason the estab for chief medical corp is just BG, and I don't think every single one of the past chiefs of air force were pilots. Soooo..getting to be a pilot doesn't bring one close to becoming BG. There are tons of pilots compared to the number of people with calibre high enough to be earmarked for general. Most of the pilots do retire at MAJ or LTC, and this is quite independent of their qualifications if they are good pilots. There are diploma holder pilots who are LTC and local uni farmer pilots who leave as MAJ.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The pilots who are farmers do earn quite well for their level of intellect because Air force pilots still earn far more than most jobs in the private sector with the same level of qualifications and calibre. This is a fact.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So tell your friend not to have such pompous dreams. If (and that's a big IF) he manages to go through the entire selection process which no one can be sure of, as someone has said earlier, he is only at the beginning of the road, and face a &gt;70% probability of getting axed along the way.   </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I personally know about 5 guys who were axed by the pilot training and went off feeling very sore and bitter against the SAF. Till today they are still telling everyone how they're doing so well as sales men and property agents despite getting axed by the pilot programme. They're carrying a lot of baggage, I always advise them to seek counselling. I hope your friend doesn't go that way if he does get axed. Back to your friend, I'm sure many people in Timbuktu also wish they could become the President of the United States. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, there is no difference between a farmer who went the poly route or JC route to university, so tell your friend NOT TO EVER feel inferior to a JC grad farmer who went to local university. In fact, there is hardly even any difference between a local university farmer (whether from JC or poly) and a poly grad with no degree.</p>
