              <p>Hello forum ,</p>
              <p><br>So im out of the 2 week adjustment period and i must say , the PTP training does get tiring at times. They however , dont train u <strong>that</strong> much on upper limbs though (Pull Ups) so im still having problem trying to break that zero. Everyone will always go through the standard timetable , even if they need much more help on a certain area.</p>
              <p>I read about the resistance bands which are portable and simple. Does the forumers have any idea on where i can look for such stuff ? Any websites ?</p>
              <p>I understand that the best way to improve on pull up is just by doing pull up itself but there is the motivational factor involved. If all i do everyday is hang and do zero , i wouldnt know if im improving(getting stronger)</p>
              <p>I was hoping the resistance band would help, i.e. i can slowly reduce the 'weight' it helps/carries when doing pull ups if there are different varieties of resistance bands.</p>
              <p>PS : Sorry if i posted on a wrong section. I can't find another decent section to ask regarding fitness.</p>

              <p>Im still a zero fighter. The OC doesnt allow recruits to use the pull up machines near the pull up bar themselves for no reason (lol).</p>
              <p>I use the grip in which the palms face me , as i heard that it is easier. I've also heard different advices too. One coming from the PT/Gym instructor that push-ups doesnt help improve the muscles required for chin ups/pull ups.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi RuiQi, from my personal experience training some of my guys who started out as zero fighters, you can probably benefit from doing inclined chin ups first or if you have help, assisted chin ups. Keep going at it whenever you have the chance. It shouldnt take long before you break the zero barrier and then it's easier to progress from there.<br><br>I was from PTP myself and have seen LOTS of guys break the zero. Go for it!</p></div>

              <p>Hello , thanks for the replies.</p>
              <p>I can only pull up  till my elbows are at 90deg , then i wont have enough strength to go further/higher. I was wondering if dumbells might help ? Since we do have access to dumbells. Also , ive been following advice from a friend, i.e. to pull up as high as u can and hang in that position for as long as u can.</p>
              <p>But other then that , id really like to try out the resistance bands and dumbells(if there is a method that helps for pull ups)</p>
              <p>Not being able to even pull even 1 does get demoralising at times.</p>
              <p><br>EDIT : Im currently following an advice from a friend who can do 21 pull ups , i.e. during free time , id pull up as high as i can and hang there for as long as i can. Do it 3 times , with 1min rest in between. Afternoon and Night.</p>

              <p>If you're doing it with palms facing u, your biceps are doing most of the work. Do dumb bells, particularly training the biceps, do wonders.</p>

              <p>Let me give you some of my layman knowledge. Push ups don't help pull ups? I find that dubious because push ups train your triceps and upper shoulder muscles, both groups deemed necessary for a successful pull up. You need more work on your overall strength, start investing in some weights or go to the gym to do all the exercises necessary for upper body muscles. Train your biceps and triceps too.</p>
              <p>I used to do about 10 easily, then slacked for a number of years and got a shock when like you, could only go 90 degrees lol aka zero. Then I started weights training and now even with 10kg more meat due to over eating haha, I can still do 10 easily.</p>
              <p>Tip: Lift some weights for 10 mins every morning and your strength will up itself tremendously.</p>

              <p>I was also a 0 fighter before, I was able to do about 2-3 but in PTP so shacked, that I cannot do even a single one. But after doing dips and some wt you get to break the egg. Btw I saw some gym had this machine with you standing on some weight and as you pull yourself up, the weight will push you help as well, you can try using 1/4 of your body weight 1st then start reducing it.</p>
              <p>Btw I think palm facing you is easier, but now does not matter to me, either way I also can do about 6. But for training purpose I like to use palm facing away from me.</p>

              <p>i going to poping soon...</p>
              <p>so share a few pointers with you : ) ,</p>
              <p>dun worry i too start off as a 0 fighter , i can do 9 now , there are ppl doing 12,13 reps and they too are 0 fighters at the start.</p>
              <p>undergrip uses chest and bicep , so all the tekaning session ,push ups u kena will have some effect..if not u can use ur coy's gym , do the bicep curl and lats machine.</p>
              <p>for over grip , its more diffcult to train but easier to accumulate reps once you have the correct technique and muscle memory</p>
              <p>then its also ur diet,i brought protein shake to camp,mine oc allowed it,maybe i really helps? .u need to check with ur sgt what snacks can be brought inside</p>
              <p>but our coy we had forced training till very late each day, 10 pm, then wash up,10 min admin time,thats all we have at certain days......</p>
