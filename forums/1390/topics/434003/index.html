              <p>Hi, will make this short. I have submitted a specialist Memo from NSC few weeks ago regarding eczema. The specialist wrote that i should be excused uniform and outfield but did not state how long.</p>
              <p>I saw the MO and he gave me one month and told me to come back after my status end. One month has ended and there's still patches of eczema on my arm and legs and neck albet not serious because i have not been carrying out outfield related activities for months. THe MO say it's not so serious and he only gave me a few days status until i go my new unit. However, my problem tends to flare up outfield and under excessive sweating or heat and its been causing a lot of trouble for me.</p>
              <p>It may not be the very serious kind but the intense itch is driving me crazy and obviously the lovely cream did not help much. The nxt appt is like 2 months later... and im going to enroll in a combat course soon. Should i seek a private specialist instead, and any recommandtions? Thanks a lot.</p>

              <p>MO probably view it as skin allergy, which is a temp problem.Wait, for it to become serious then see MO.</p>
              <p>Usually eczema would have been discovered as early as teens ages. You should have a
               stack of specialist memo before you go to CMPB. They did not give you 
              pes C then?That means it is not serious.</p>
              <p>I have seen eczema patient with obivious ugly skin at the neck, yet he is a SAF officer.</p>
              <p>NSC sucks. It takes months to get to see the doctor. I dont know how serious your problem but if it is bothering you. The concern will be to maintain your beautiful skin, rather than let it to leave ugly scars. See private specialist. Get the proper MO. They have  better drug to permanent STOP the eczema.Go go go see doctor now.</p>
