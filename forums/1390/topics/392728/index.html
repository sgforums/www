              <p>Hi all, just a question. I was slapped with a charge of 10 days DB, for taking my exams on mc. My leave was not enough to cover the full duration of my exams den my unit don't allow me to use off also. If a paper is missed, the whole subject will be deemed as absent.</p>
              <p>So i bo pian go take exam during my mc, then now kena charged. Somemore i have specialist letter stating it is very important for me to take my examination. So my OC charge me but i don't plead guilty, transfer to CO, charge me but i also don't plead guilty, then to court martial.</p>
              <p>Questions, are.. how long will i receive the letter to go for court martial?</p>
              <p>Is my offence justified for 10days DB? (my CO was planning to give more)</p>
              <p>I got discharged (PES F), expecting to get my IC next week, den if go court martial found guilty still under military rule?</p>
              <p>Any advice for hiring a defence lawyer??</p>

If every single nsf like u, use mc go take exam, test blah blah blah, than where is the order? If you know u hav an important exam coming, u should hav save up ur leave for it or at least, talk to ur oc NICELY beforehand. IMO, hire lawyer aso no use, waste of money.

              <p>Apparently both of you are deluded into believing that you have a God given right to take exams or even moonlight during your NS days and that the SAF is obliged to bend over backwards to accommodate your personal endeavours.</p>
              <p>Heres news for you. Wake the fuck up Betty!</p>
              <p>First, if every NSF adopts the same attitude, the unit won't be able to function. These are active units, not playtime unreal training schools. They are meant to be mobilised in times of war or social crisis. The commanders in charge, in this case the CO and OC, are shouldering the responsibility for ensuring this gets done.</p>
              <p>The fact that you have zero insights into the workings of running a unit other than oneself, or the ability to understand the responsibilities of commanders is unsurprising. People like you would never have been given leadership positions or deemed to have leadership qualities, in NS and in life. A lot of what is expected and the politicking in NS is a mirrored translation to real life. People like you who fail in the system fail everywhere else. </p>
              <p>Second, The times when OC allows men to go off because of their family problems, or closes an eye to their part time job, things like this, it's because he is KIND, and wants to be understanding to the various problems that his men have. It is not a license for idiots like you to climb over their heads, or believe that it's your God-bestowed birthright. It was never a right. It was a privilege. </p>
              <p>Thirdly, for TS unless you have a track record of malingering and always giving your officers problems, officers will normally close an eye and allow their men to do what they need to do, IF it is very urgent and can make a big difference to their life after ORD AND provided there is no ops. Your officers sound like they have marked you, because you must have given them a lot of shit. A lot of PC are also NSF and just want to serve and fuck off. When their men are problematic, it antagonises them as well. They too, want to have a problem-free and smooth NS life without being antagonised. The pain goes both ways.</p>
              <p> Finally, from what I know you can still be court martialled after you're discharged. And of course court martial = military law. But penalties to people who have been discharged are usually more lenient, depending on mitigation. Your reason was really fucked up, so most likely won't be lenient. <span style="white-space: pre;">Good luck to you. Heard they no longer make people carry sandbags anymore. Dunno whether true or not.</span></p>

              <p>Hi all, just a question. I was slapped with a charge of 10 days
              DB, for taking my exams on mc. My leave was not enough to cover the
              full duration of my exams den my unit don't allow me to use off
              also. If a paper is missed, the whole subject will be deemed as
              absent.</p>
              <p>So i bo pian go take exam during my mc, then now kena charged.
              Somemore i have specialist letter stating it is very important for
              me to take my examination. So my OC charge me but i don't plead
              guilty, transfer to CO, charge me but i also don't plead guilty,
              then to court martial.</p>
              <p>Questions, are.. how long will i receive the letter to go for
              court martial?</p>
              <p>Is my offence justified for 10days DB? (my CO was planning to
              give more)</p>
              <p>I got discharged (PES F), expecting to get my IC next week, den
              if go court martial found guilty still under military rule?</p>
              <p>Any advice for hiring a defence lawyer??</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Do note that Leaves are
              mandatory but Offs are Privilege. The offs are given by your unit
              either based on your conduct, the importance of event or off-in-lieu
              and the stamp of approval is usually given by your OC.</p>
              <p>If NSFs are all granted offs for private examinations, how would the units function? If you're granted off for your private examination, tomorrow you'll see a queue of NSFs requesting offs for Basic Theory Test, Piano Test and stuff.</p>
              <p>And as pointed out before, what kind of specialist letter is that? Why is it so important for you to take the exam? Care to put more details?</p>
              <p>You should have pleaded guilty when you're first charged because you have no grounds to fight for your case, judging from the inputs you gave. You broke the law, you pay the price. Because an MC is to justify that you're sick and unable to return to camp, you're liable to rest at home. Stepping out of your place without valid reason can constitute to an AWOL case and Malingering. You can be double -charged for that.</p>
              <p>And yes, since you plead not guilty and the case is passed to a higher command each time you plead not guilty, the sentence gets heavier each time. Your CO has every right to add on to the number of days you serve in DB.</p>
              <p>And yes again, your service will be lengthen so long as you broke the law while serving. It doesnt matter when you'll be ROD. And if your CO is determined to nail you down, be prepared to go down to your camp in your number 3 earliest today or monday.</p>
              <p>There is no point getting a lawyer, your records will be blacklisted no matter what happens.</p>

              <p>Yeah, it makes you wonder just how low these specialists will go. As long as you pay them, they will write anything for you. Even rubbish. Have you checked out the stories from expats on how they are fleeced left right centre by these specialists in private practice who anyhow quote prices, or recommend unnecessary treatments? One of my friends was quoted by a specialist in Mt E $8k for a simple blood sample test. When the specialist found out she's Singaporean and only speaks like an American cos she was away for 7 yrs since she's 17, he said ok just for since you're Singaporean, $4k. Later my friend went to SGH and got the test done for $25.</p>
              <p>I think the specialists business is kept alive by a sizeable number of NSFs here. I remember one soldier who got his specialist to write that his skin was allergic to the SAF bed, (not mattress, but bed) so he can't stay in and another soldier who managed to get a specialist dumb enough to write that the soldier is "allergic to officers".</p>

              <p>Exactly. What does that say about the state of private medical practice in Singapore? A bunch of hackjobs. Its only not moderated because MOH believes that its not right to be telling private practice specialists how much they should be making. Afterall private practice is subject to demand and supply of market forces. So all it means as long as there is a continuous stream of super idiots willing to be chopped and a pool of malingering NSFs from affluent families, the hackjobs will continue to thrive.</p>
              <p>TS, if you wanna argue that what your do in NS and what you did isn't a reflection of your core character, and what you will very well do in corporate life, think again. NS is not called a liability for nothing. Everyone knows that. The difference is that responsible men know that responsibility means doing what you don't like to do, because you have to do it. Responsibility is not doing what you like to do, like roller coaster rides or a fun night out at the Bellagio in Vegas. Its taking care of a sick father who may bleed your finances but no choice, what to do, you have to do it or soldiering on in a job you hate because your wife has just tested positive for cancer. This is real life. And this is what people go through.</p>
              <p>If you can take MC for your private exams and feel quite justified and smug doing so, you're the same kind of men who later in life think nothing of taking MC to get yourself rest when there's a lot of shit to do in the office, or taking MC to run your family errands during a high key period in office because "you have no choice".</p>
