              <p>Hm. I'm wondering if TS leave actually still have balance, then will he still have a chance to defend himself? And, as most men in a battalion they have no access to OA in offices to check they will have to depend on their admin specs to check on their behalf. If the spec chose to hide the real balance to him, then it is really such an unfair case.</p>

              <p>People read it and understood it fully. You didn't.</p>
              <p>The bottom line is, like it or not, you were totally in the wrong. You should have simply pleaded guilty to your OC because an MC does <strong>not</strong> give you the right to take an exam outside. Simple as that.</p>
              <p>Like I said before, National Service <strong>Full-Time</strong> is exactly what it sounds like - you are a <strong>full-time</strong> soldier. If you want to take a course outside, then do it at your own time without letting it get in the way of your duties as a soldier. If you get time off to pursue your studies, then it is a privilege and not a right. If you do not get that privilege, then really, it's just too bad.</p>

              <p>Commanders will normally close an eye when it comes to good
              soldiers, I know you're illiterate and dense, which is why you
              failed to pick this up repeatedly even though it was said by at
              least three NS officers here. TS is obviously a marked case and
              those fucked up soldiers who caused headache and trouble for his
              officers. If I'm his PC, i'll also make sure my OC whacks him big
              time and send him to DB for life.</p>
              <p>I find it amusing how you are totally self justified over
              something that is not allowed. It's been said by so many people,
              some officers and some not, that its not allowed and he did it. But
              as usual your failure to understand English due to your illiteracy
              is a stumbling block to a normal life for you.</p>
              <p>I know a lot of commanders who have sent lots of people to DB.
              Nothing happened to them as a result of that. It's the fucked up
              soldiers who paid the price for being fucked up, and I'm quite sure
              they'll carry their deep seated character flaws into their post-ORD
              life..after they serve out the rest of their extended NS days after
              DB. As for TS, i'm sure you'll enjoy the lovely exercise, pleasant
              ambience and nice gourmet meals you are about to enjoy in your 10
              day holiday. Have fun!!!</p>
              <p>Through this forum, I found out the mentality and psyche of
              these fucked up soldiers that I've to deal with in camp. Most of
              them however don't reveal their real feelings to me of course, now
              I know these fucked up and marked soldiers actually feel so much
              self justification about their misdeeds and bad attitude,don't
              think they did anything wrong and think its all the commanders'
              fault. I will make sure that such soldiers suffer and get whacked
              with harsher consequencies from now on and recommend to my OC
              maximum charges for them every time they even try to pull a fast
              one.</p>

              <p>dont mind me asking, what's your job position in your camp? 1 thing i observed, the power to recommend charges can be quite varying across various services/formations in the SAF. perhaps due to different scope of operations? basically as long as A is of a higher rank than B within the guidelines of the SAF Act, A can recommend?</p>

I totally agree with some of the responses here. FULL TIME NATIONAL SERVICE MAN means FULL TIME. Doing other stuffs like studying and moonlighting is considered ILLEGAL.</p>
              <p>TS, if you are already in DB, hope you have woke up your idea by now. If you are still waiting to go to GCM, I would say: Reap what you sow.</p>
              <p>Fancy using an MC to go take exams. Now, this is the biggest joke i ever heard of.</p>

              <p>If I am you, I am no push over. I will bring every resources, I have from media, mp, SAF hotline, and EVERYTHING. Since the CO or OC or whatever is being informed I will whack every1 upside down. Anyway, EXAM and TESTs are very important events in life and it is necessary for life to go on and even after you ORD. If whoever on top is not being understanding, than he does not deserve to be a commander at all. </p>
              <p>I read somewhere that taking EXAM off, compensation leave, birthday off in the directive and handbook before,  I am not sure if it is still exists. Check it out urself. </p>
              <p>Anyway  who say taking MC must stay home AND REST? It is only written black and white on the MC say you are <strong>unfit for work and is not valid for court. </strong>Have you all ever read the MC and medical directive before? Where on paper that it is being written that you have to stay home and rest? </p>
              <p>Anyway the idea of giving an MC is not to rest, but more like isolation, because that person may be spreading the cold and flu virus around. If he is injured, it may be difficult to walk around. </p>
              <p>Good Luck to TS. I have not problem getting OFF for my scholarship interview, driving test, and other stuff before,hence therefore...   </p>

              <p>I mean, think about it. Just missing 1 subject could mean that he has to re-take his A level again next year. I dont know how many of you here have taken the A level and I must say its not easy at all. You have to be consistent in your studies all day round, throughout the whole year in order to get a good result in the As. So think about it.. how would you guys feel just because you do not have leave to cover 1 day of your exam, you have to redo this whole thing at the next year? Its practically wasting 1 whole year when within 1 year, you could do sooo many things!</p>
              <p>I believe that the TS resorted to getting an MC just to attend an examination is out of desperation. This is to try to save himself from repeating the A level again for the next year just for 1 day of the examination he couldn't attend. I do not agree with what he did, but can you guys please be sympathetic towards his situation and not flame him?</p>
              <p>Its so easy to flame others. I couldn't think of a more impactful idea, so I shall just say this. Like for me, I could even say that I dont care and curse that you and your love ones to die tomorrow without thinking of the consequences for your family and friends. But I should not. Because if I put myself in your shoes, its really saddening for that to happen. I find it quite sad to see so many responses flaming him without getting the full story.

              <p>Why don't you put yourself in the shoes of the fellows who had to deal with this fellow, put yourself into the shoes of this fellow's unit mates, who'd have to cover his duties for him and do his shit for him while he's malingering ? </p>
              <p>Don't forget, he's not the victim here. The laws are clear, no one went all the way to trap him .... he pwnzed himself. Why don't you sympathize with his army colleagues who have to put up with his shit and cover his work for him ?</p>
              <p>Are they not NSFs too ? You think what ? that he is the only chap with things to do and commitments outside ? That they have no life to live outside ? Don't you think he's making a mockery of the other fellows who just grin and bear it and put aside their own outside commitments to fulfil their duties without fanfare and with nary a complaint ? Is it any wonder then that nobody liked him in the army ?</p>

              <p>As people have said ad nauseum, full-time National Service means just that: <strong>full-time</strong> conscription in the armed forces. Any time off for any other commitments is by no means a given, and you are expected to drop everything else for your NSF duties.</p>

              fellow's unit mates, who'd have to cover his duties for him and do
              his shit for him while he's malingering ? </p>
              <p>Don't forget, he's not the victim here. The laws are clear, no
              one went all the way to trap him .... he pwnzed himself. Why don't
              you sympathize with his army colleagues who have to put up with his
              shit and cover his work for him ?</p>
              <p>Are they not NSFs too ? You think what ? that he is the only
              chap with things to do and commitments outside ? That they have no
              life to live outside ? Don't you think he's making a mockery of the
              other fellows who just grin and bear it and put aside their own
              outside commitments to fulfil their duties without fanfare and with
              nary a complaint ? Is it any wonder then that nobody liked him in
              the army ?</p>

              <p>You wrote that you were a combat medic, no ? A combat medic that has no duties ? </p>
              <p>And you know who said nobody like you in the army ? you did  ... in your very first thread ... or did your psychological condition makes you fail in your memory too ?</p>
              <p>And do you imagine for a moment that when you take MC, nothing happens in your unit ? That they don't have to get somebody else to cover your work and duties for you ? Or even if you were such a good psychotic that they don't dare to get you do do any medical coverage, others don't need to take up your slack ? Isn't it obvious that in your little mind, the whole world revolves around your own little self alone.</p>
