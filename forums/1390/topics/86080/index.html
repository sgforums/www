            <div class='col-md body'>okay, recently i just got back from the uk after studying there and during my stay there, i managed to watch a documentary about killing, titled, 'The Truth About Killing' and it talked about how mankind, in general are not naturally used to pulling the trigger in order to take another's life.<br><br>their research showed that during world war 2, only about 2% - 4% of those who fought really pulled the trigger to kill. this statistical figure is really alarming cause it made me wonder if our REGs and NSFs really have what it takes to kill another man.. especially when we live in a world where everything is kept under govt control..<br><br>many of you would say "yeah of course i would!" or "yeah especially if he's pointing a gun at me!". well those were some of the common replies given by the english blokes when interviewed, but when put through the test, they all failed miserably.<br><br>how can we be sure that our men are ready to defend the nation and really take someone else's life when the time really comes. i guess it's just by training them until it becomes second nature. i believe it is known to this community as 'war-games' but i think that this term is totally wrong, for it isn't a game but a matter of preparing your mindset. it's time we stopped using miles systems and start using simutions. why i say this is because with MILES, you know you won't feel the pain if you get hit, thus trainees may not take the training seriously while with simunitions, THE PAIN IS THERE, which would make the trainee take the session more seriously as he now knows that if he doesn't keep his guard up, he will get hit, and seriously, it hurts.<br><br>i hope this article helps. any opinions/comments/CONSTRUCTIVE critisisms are welcomed. thanks.<br><br>PALMERISED</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HereÂ’s what I think,<br><br>The training here is too safety conscious. Granted, we being a citizen army, any casualties is one too many. But training in my NS days (like 8 years ago) seems to be more concern with not getting hurt than completing the mission.<br><br>ThereÂ’s no aggressiveness in training. Again, being a conscript army and living in a apparently safe environment, trainees and trainers seems to be doing a job rather than producing someone whoÂ’s willing to kill. All training should be like unarm combat; be aggressive with your aim being to kill/bring down the other guy with getting hurt yourself.<br><br>Plenty more to say, but I believe when the first blood is drawn, all of us will be up to it. The Japanese in WWII thought the Americans canÂ’t fight. They got more than a bloody nose.<br><br>Bottom line, you have to believe in what your fighting for. I think RAH's Starship Trooper does deal with it.<br></div>
