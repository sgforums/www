            <div class='col-md body'>i think its perfectly alrite to discuss such things. as was already discussed by the ministers and also in ST.forums ages ago.<br><br>Anyway, most prob your coy didnt book the training shed, so you all have to vacate, or that you all are indeed sharing the training shed and its just that the coy has more thinking commanders/instructors to let the recruits use the benches than your coy. OR, the other coy instructors LACKED discipline, and sooner or later they are gonna be f*ucked by the PCs and OC liao... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not sure about white horse coy or such... but let's face reality.... in life nothing is fair ..  rank and who your dad / mom is ... has its privileges. The rest of us have to live with it, or if we think that being in the privileged class is great, work hard and fight for it.<br><br>From my own NS experience, all I can say is that there are "scholar" platoons. I was in one for my BMT.  There are no special favours shown to you... of course, the PCs and section cmdrs who have been specially selected to lead you are nicer ... they choose the better and more articulate officer and NCOs to lead the platoon. That is all.  They try to teach you more as they know you are trying to be an officer, hopefully a good one and a senior one in the future.  There's probably a lot more explanation and reasoning before they set you to do something then in another platoon.<br><br>As for tekanning, we got it the same, probably a bit more on the mental side, as they are trying to make sure they are doing a good job, because if the OCS instructors make a comment about the quality of BMT recruits they get... the feedback will hit the BMT CO real fast !!!<br><br></div>
