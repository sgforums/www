              <p>I've injured my lower back before from weight lifting. No papers,no checkup. Not from a financially capable of spending $$ to keep going checkup, especially back which requires xray and this and that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I figured it will be fine after a while. Seems like until now its not (been 1.5 years).</p>
              <p>Normally its fine, however, coupled with an extra bone in feet / flat feet (looks like flat feet but doc mentioned its just an extra bone), my back gets really pain after walking or standing for 30mins. And my feet can't run for more than 20mins before the ''extra bone'' gets painful.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well since i'll be entering NS from about a year from now, i was wondering if i would need to go see a specialist for my back or anything? The doctor who checked my feet mentioned it is ok / shouldn't be a problem, but i still can't run/walk/stand for long (not stamina problem, feet problem)</p>
              <p>If doctor say back no problem, won't i jialat? I pain but doctor/medical officer in ns don't know.</p>

              <p>If u are afraid then spent some money and see a specialist. Go polyclinic and its cheaper if they recommend you to visit specialist compare to you go directly to 1 on ur own.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>lol, first u gotta report to the MO, but if ure posted to tekong BMTC 1 / 2, they're real hardasses cuz they're freshly washed captains, just out of med. they'll send you for x-rays on scene at tekong and if they cant find anything wrong and youre still having problems, theyll send u to CGH (Changi General Hospital) for further investigation. Either CGH will admit you or just send you back to tekong. If they admit you, theyll take some tests in context with your back problem, then either discharge you with a few days MC or suggest you be downgraded to the SAF Medical Board. Yea and if it doesnt work, go to a specialist and see what can be done, most of the time, the MOs listen to the specialist lol, cuz MOs are considered General Practitioners. Good luck, and if you dont succeed the first time, try and try and try again till you get it. Just like ShortNinja suggested. </p></div>
