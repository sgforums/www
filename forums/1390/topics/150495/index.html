SAF gives an allowance, and hence no overtime pay. Your employment rights are not covered by MOM as you are conscripted and not employed (unless you sign on).<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SMAPLionHeart:</div><div class="quote_body">If they ask me to go overseas , must i really go overseas?<br><br>I don't like to travel to other countries for training , so i also hope they will cater for me.<br><br>I also would not want to be placed in the frontline of warfare.<br>A pay of about $500 would also be sufficient for me.<br><br>Im proficient in MS word , excel , access and VB .<br></div></blockquote>If you are ordered to go overseas for training. Yes, you must go unless you have a very good and valid reason not to (Such as next-of-kin pass away etc). The reason of "don't like to travel" is not a reason, it is a lame excuse. Nobody wants to be a the frontline if he can choose, but somebody got to get the SHIT job done, so I guess there isn't much choice. I stressed again that you are not getting a paycheck, it is an allowance. As to how much, it depends on your rank and vocation. No Big deal in being proficient in Microsoft Office applications. Throw a stone in a camp, chances are that you will strike a couple who knows them as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>K... if you are PES A or B... forget about 8 to 5 unless you end up in service side.<br><br>So if you don't want to be frontline...  that means service... so you need to get a rank of Third Sergeant (3SG) to get a pay of $500.<br><br>If you want to get $500.... then best if you become a COMBAT (front line) Corporal. But you will not get this rank until you near ORD.<br><br>Where to seek redress, they are plenty of redress avenues PROVIDED you have solid and valid reason you are treated unfairly.<br><br>This would be things like, I am asked to work day and night because i am a chinese, or i am the only one in the entire company being asked to go for field camp while the company stays in bunk.<br><br>If you are PES C, chances of getting 8 to 5 is very high. But same rules apply if you want to get $500 pay. This case only way is to get 3SG rank.<br><br>As for going overseas, do you mean posted there or go overseas for training?<br><br>For posting there, you MAY have the choice to say no. BUT if no one says yes, you will be randomly chosen. Overseas posting is the only other way you can get good pay without getting rank. A LCP to CPL may get aroudn $800-1000 monthly.<br><br>For training there, you cannot say no. but you can don't go based on medical/personal reasons. For medical, it has to be, an injury WARRANTING a temporary downgrade, or you currently have severe contagious illness. Things like flu, fever, you still go.<br><br></div>
