              <p>The days of NSmen reservist soldiers spending countless hours installing 
              and dismantling communications equipment for training exercises look set
               to be over. They are also not likely to be saddled with washing 
              armoured vehicles.</p>
              <p>According to tender documents obtained by The Straits Times, the 
              Ministry of Defence (Mindef) is looking for civilian companies to take 
              over these time-consuming tasks, to further enhance national service 
              (NS) training efficiency.</p>
              <div class="related_col"></div>
              <p>These tasks are currently carried out by armoured troops or tank crew before and after an outfield training exercise.</p>
              <p>The outsourcing to civilian contractors will free up operationally 
              ready national servicemen (NSmen) to focus on honing their combat 
              skills.</p>
              <p>According to the documents, the civilian contractors will be expected
               to handle an average of 510 tracked vehicles a year, and will be 
              responsible for mounting and dismantling equipment from the vehicles and
               washing them.</p>
              <p>For a start, staff from private commercial companies will take over these tasks for selected major exercises for NSmen.</p>
              <p>"These efforts allow for a faster turnover of vehicles required to 
              support NS training," said Colonel Lam Sheau Kai, commander of the 
              Combat Service Support Command.</p>
              <p>It typically takes nine men up to four hours to dismantle 
              communications equipment from the Bionix armoured infantry fighting 
              vehicle and hose it down.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is also increasingly handing over 
              the management and warehousing of combat equipment or stores in training
               institutes to civilian contractors.</p>
              <p>The latest contract up for bidding requires civilian contractors to 
              take over the management and warehousing of combat equipment or stores 
              in the Motorised Infantry Training Institute.</p>
              <p>Col Lam said store management has already been outsourced in units 
              such as the Army Logistics Base, Safti Military Institute and 2nd 
              People's Defence Force.</p>
              <p>Outsourcing non-core jobs is something the SAF began doing in the 1970s, to allow its servicemen to focus on combat training.</p>
              <p>Tasks such as fitness instruction, cookhouse operations and aircraft maintenance are now carried out by civilian contractors.</p>
              <p>Government agencies, such as the <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><a href="http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/civilians-now-train-scdf-police-nsmen-who-fail-fitness-test"><span style="color: #3366ff;">police, civil defence force</span></a></strong></span> and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, also do some 
              outsourcing. However, the issuance and management of ammunition is done 
              solely by the military.</p>
              <p>The SAF said civilian contractors are put through stringent security 
              checks before they are appointed, to ensure operational security is not 
              compromised.</p>
              <p>While outsourcing helps soldiers to perfect their combat skills, Ms 
              Ellen Lee, a member of the Government Parliamentary Committee for 
              Defence and Foreign Affairs, said doing some of these manual chores can 
              help toughen up soldiers.</p>
              <p>"It is through such manual work that you can build that sense of 
              discipline and pride. You also get to know your vehicle better. Such 
              knowledge will come in very useful in battle, too," she said.</p>

              <p>Outsourcing services for armoured vehicles were already in place earlier this year when I finished my last high key.</p>
              <p>At least they did the signal sets which is always a headache to us old folks. We just had to turn up to do the checks, and sign off.</p>
              <p>As for the washing, they had guys to do them, but needed us VCs to show hem the standards to be met. No better way to get a muddy vehicle cleaned without elbow grease.</p>
