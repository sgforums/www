              <p><span>With a frying spatula in one hand and a
              ladle in the other, the soldiers don their aprons over their new
              pixelised combat uniform as they psyched themselves up for a challenge
              of a different kind. <br> <br>Known as the "flying chefs", these men
              from the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) help satisfy the hunger pangs of
              hundreds of soldiers who are away on overseas deployment.<br><br>Corporal (CPL) Muhammad Faizal Bin Abd Raman who reckons his best dish is <em>nasi goreng kampung</em> or fried rice in <em>kampung</em> style, finds that his love for cooking has served him well.  <br><br>"You
              have to love cooking before you can cook for four to five hundred
              soldiers. Without the love for cooking, you can't cook well," said the
              supply assistant. <br><br>These trainees undergo a three-week Basic
              Food Handling Course where they learn to cook simple dishes in small
              servings. They also learn about the basics of working in the kitchen
              including kitchen safety, food preparation, and personal hygiene.<br><br>This
              is followed by a six-week Enhanced Catering Course where they are
              equipped with the skills of bulk cooking and are imparted the product
              knowledge of ingredients as well as being taught proper food storage. <br><br>However, not all supply assistants get the chance to attend the Enhanced Catering Course. <br><br>Only
              those who show commitment, interest, and who demonstrate exemplary
              performance and excellent conduct are selected to attend the course
              based on their superiors' recommendations. <br><br>Conducted twice a
              year, the Enhanced Catering Course only admits up to six candidates
              during each intake, with four to five vacancies already filled by the
              Food and Beverage managers from various SAF cookhouses each time. <br><br>For
              "flying chef" CPL Iman Bin Zailan, who returned from a three-week
              overseas deployment, he derives an immense sense of achievement from
              his job.<br><br>"When you cook in the jungle, you can feel that the
              atmosphere is something different. It's a once in a lifetime activity
              and even though it's quite tiring, at the end of the day, we are
              appreciated by the soldiers for the fresh rations," shared the supply
              assistant from Supply Hub (East).<br><br>"The troops were so happy, they asked for extra food!"<br><br>Once
              deployed overseas, the "flying chefs" have the Mobile Field Kitchen and
              the Mobile Field Refrigerator at their disposal when outfield.<br><br>Working in pairs, they need no more than 30 minutes to deploy and operate both equipment. <br><br>With
              the diesel-driven Mobile Field Kitchen, which allows for stir-frying,
              grilling, boiling, baking and the like, the chefs can cook simple
              dishes for between 250 to 300 soldiers (or the size of one company)
              within two hours. <br><br>The Mobile Field Kitchen is complemented by
              the Mobile Field Refrigerator comprising two freezers and two chillers
              which allow for food and rations storage of up to three days. <br><br>Indeed,
              the role of the "flying chefs" in ensuring that troops operate at their
              optimum while on overseas missions like Humanitarian Assistance and
              Disaster Relief operations, cannot be underrated.<br> <br>"When our
              soldiers are deployed overseas, without me and the other chefs, the
              soldiers would have nothing to eat so it's really important for us to
              be there. After their training, the soldiers are tired and hungry. The
              hot meals that we prepare for them will boast their morale," explained
              CPL Faizal, who completed his Enhanced Catering Course last month.<br><br>Currently,
              there are a total of 30 certified "flying chefs" in the SAF, who help
              ensure soldiers get served piping hot food no matter where in the world
              they may be.Â </span></p>
