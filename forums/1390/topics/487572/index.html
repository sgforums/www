              essential to have one parent accompany you should an appointment be
              made for you and it would greatly shorten the delay to enlistment

              officer will be in attendance together with a senior doctor from
              one of the restructured hospitals. Here we will grade you based on
              your orthopedic problems. Please bring all medical reports and
              X-ray films for this visit.<br> <br> <strong style="font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit;">Medical

              screening will be required to undergo medical review. This can take
              several forms as appropriately decided by the Medical
              Officer.<br> <br> <strong style="font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit;">Referral to SAF
