              <p>The Singapore Armed Forces Volunteer 
              Corps (SAFVC) has enlisted its first batch of volunteers – comprising 68
               Singaporeans and Permanent Residents (PRs) – on Tuesday (Mar 24), with 
              an aim to deploy them alongside active servicemen from September 
              onwards.</p>
              <p>The volunteers were among those selected from about 900 
              applicants who signed up for the volunteer corps, set up last October to
               allow more citizens and PRs the opportunity to contribute to national 
              defence.</p>
              <p>Since then, the SAFVC has interviewed applicants and conducted checks to assess their suitability.</p>
              <p>Speaking
               to the press at Maju Camp, SAFVC commander Colonel Mike Tan said the 
              response to the volunteer corps “has been heartening”. There were even 
              some over-aged applicants who turned up in person for interviews and the
               SAFVC had to turn them away, he said.</p>
              <p>The age criteria for SAFVC is between 18 and 45 years old.</p>
              <p>“Among
               the more than 900 applications received, 85 per cent were eligible and 
              we have since identified some 150 volunteers for the 2015 cohort,” said 
              COL Tan.</p>
              <p>This cohort will begin their training in three intakes on
               Mar 24, Apr 11 and Jun 15, he said. For the remaining eligible 
              applicants, the SAFVC will continue with various other checks, he added.</p>
              <p>Across
               all three intakes this year, slightly more than half (51 per cent) are 
              Singapore citizens, while PRs make up the rest. Four in 10 are women and
               those aged between 30 to 40 make up a slight majority.</p>
              <p>One in three are aged below 30, and one in 10 volunteers are above 40.</p>
              <p>Volunteers
               want to serve for various reasons, said the SAFVC. It includes a desire
               to repay society and country, set an example for their children who 
              will need to serve National Service, and interest in military life, said
               SAFVC officers who interviewed them.</p>
              <p>The applicants also believed
               that joining the SAFVC will help them feel more rooted to their new 
              home, and better identify and integrate with Singaporean males, they 
              added.</p>
              <p>On Tuesday, the newly enlisted SAF volunteers (SV) pledged 
              their commitment and loyalty to the SAF by taking an oath of allegiance 
              at Maju Camp, where the volunteer corps is based. Among them is Dr Janil
               Puthucheary, Member of Parliament for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, who became
               a Singapore citizen at the age of 35.</p>
              <p>The SVs will undergo two 
              weeks of basic training – a continuous one where trainees stay and live 
              inside the camp for the duration. The third intake will also undergo 
              continuous training.</p>
              <p>The second intake, however, will undergo 
              training from Apr 11 to Jun 14 in a “modular” fashion, where lessons are
               provided on weekends instead of weekdays. Trainees who opt for this 
              usually do so because of work and family commitments.</p>
              <p>During the 
              first two weeks of basic training, SVs will be taught how to fire the 
              SAR 21 rifle, overcome the standard obstacle course, and undergo a 
              two-day field camp, among various military skills. If required, SVs will
               also undergo one week of Qualification Training and one week of 
              Advanced Training to prepare them for their specific roles.</p>
              <p>Addressing
               newly enlisted volunteers on Tuesday, COL Tan commended them for 
              stepping forward to play their part in national defence and highlighted 
              that this was an important commitment.</p>
              <p>“By stepping forward to 
              volunteer, you are making a commitment to serve alongside our servicemen
               and servicewomen to ensure the continued peace and security of 
              Singapore,” he said “You have made the all important decision to give 
              your time and commitment, out of your own volition, to serve the nation 
              and the people who live here.”</p>
              <p>Most, specifically 67 per cent, of 
              the volunteers in the first intake will be trained as security troopers,
               guarding key installations across Singapore alongside active servicemen
               and reservists.</p>
              <p>The rest will serve in specialised roles. 
              Volunteers serving as information and media staff make up the 
              second-largest group (13 per cent), while a handful of volunteers will 
              become medical trainers, maritime trainers, defence psychologists, 
              bridge watchkeepers and deck operators.</p>
              <p>A small group, or 2 per cent, will serve as experts of command, control, communications and computers (C4).</p>
