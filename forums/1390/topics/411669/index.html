              <p>The <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=singapore+armed+forces&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Singapore Armed Forces </a>(SAF)
               wants its 20,000 regular servicemen to be fighting fit and warns that 
              those who are obese and are doing nothing about their shape will get 
              booted out.</p>
              <p>Regulars with a <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=body+mass+index&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">body mass index</a> (BMI) exceeding 29 – for instance, someone who is 1.8m tall and weighs 
              94kg – should pay closer attention to their weight and fitness levels.</p>
              <p>According to <em>The Straits Times, </em>since early this year, 
              overweight soldiers, sailors or airmen have received warning letters and
               are given a year to lose at least ten per cent of their weight.</p>
              <p>Those who fail to drop the kilos will be given a second warning and 
              have up to another three years to shape up – or risk being shipped out.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=ministry+of+defence&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Ministry of Defence </a>confirmed
               the new BMI guidelines but did not say when the stricter measures 
              kicked in. The BMI – which is calculated by dividing a person’s weight 
              in kilograms by the square of his or her height in metres – provides an 
              estimate of a person’s body fat.</p>
              <p>SAF regulars claim they were aware of the measures only at the start 
              of this year. A circular obtained dated April this year informed them 
              that those who do not shape up after three years would be subjected to 
              “admin action as this is considered a BMI failure”. It is unclear how 
              many are classified as “BMI failures” even as all 20,000 regulars in the
               SAF undergo compulsory BMI screening.</p>
              <p>Defence Ministry spokesman Desmond Tan revealed that regulars with a 
              BMI of 30 and above will be referred for “weight management by medical 
              specialists at a hospital-based weight management clinic”.</p>
              <p>Those with a slightly lower BMI of 27 to below 30 will be enrolled in
               a different weight management programme that “comprises health 
              screening, dietary counselling and an exercise regime”. The ministry 
              first introduced this weight management programme in 2002.</p>
              <p>The BMI is used as a health indicator “to reduce weight-related health risks among regular servicemen”, Colonel Tan said.</p>
              <p>He added that the SAF also takes into account other factors like the measurement of percentage body fat and the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=individual+physical+proficiency+test&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Individual Physical Proficiency Test </a>(IPPT) as health and fitness indicators for SAF regulars.</p>
              <p>“The SAF is committed to helping its uniformed regulars maintain a 
              healthy lifestyle to ensure that they are able to perform their required
               tasks and contribute effectively to the SAF,” Colonel Tan said.</p>
              <p>According to the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=health+promotion+board&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Health Promotion Board</a> (HPB), Asians with BMI scores above 27.5 are at a  “high risk” of 
              developing cardiovascular diseases like hearth attacks, hypertension and
               diabetes. A BMI score between 18.5 and 23 is considered healthy.</p>
              <p>Although other military units, like those in the United States and 
              Britain also watch their troops’ waistlines and gauge combat 
              performance, studies have shown that BMI does not accurately reflect 
              whether a person is unfit or carrying excess fat.</p>
              <p>Ms Kalpana Bhaskaran, a nutritionist and spokesman for the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=singapore+nutrition+and+diabetics+association&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Singapore Nutrition and Diabetics Association</a>,
               said that although the  BMI is a convenient tool, “it does not take 
              into account different body types or gender differences and also the 
              amount of body fat, and lean body mass”.</p>
              <p>She explains, “Because muscle weighs more than fat, it’s possible for
               a muscular person to have a high BMI, but that doesn’t mean he or she 
              is overweight. Likewise, it’s possible for someone to have a low or 
              ideal BMI but still have too much body fat.”</p>
              <p>Chris Chew, a fitness instructor, thinks the  BMI benchmark of 30 and above is quite lax.</p>
              <p>“To have a BMI of over 30, you are either a really serious 
              bodybuilder or just obese… Anyway, you need fit and healthy people to 
              have a strong military,” he said.</p>
              <p>A serviceman who tips the scales at 89kg and is 1.72cm tall revealed 
              he has been told by his superiors to lose weight to avoid being served a
               warning letter. The technician, who declined to be named, told the 
              paper that he has been doing more workouts and cutting down on fatty 
              foods and carbohydrates in hope of shedding a few kilos within the next 
              six months.</p>
              <p>“If my weight is going to affect my career progression and may even 
              make me lose my job, then it’s worth the effort and the pain,” he added.</p>
              <p>Latest figures from HPB show that in 2004, 6.9 per cent of adults 
              aged between 18 and 69 were obese, an increase of 0.9 percentage point 
              over the figure in 1998 and up from 5.1 per cent in 1992.</p>
