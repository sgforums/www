As those who were in charge of the meals would know, meal preparation was not as simple as it seemed.<br><br>The cooks, besides having to cook the food and then clean up afterwards, also had to go personally to the vendors, choose the food they wanted and ensure its quality. After that, they had to pack and transport it back to the cookhouses before starting the cooking. The cooks were thus also the marketers, quality controllers and transport personnel of the meals they prepared!<br><br>The cooks also had to be hard at work when soldiers Â“eat freshÂ” in the outfield. They had to set up their own tents and bring along their cooking apparatus and ingredients, and with their makeshift kitchen provide piping-hot food for the troops.<br><br>With many cooks needed to provide food in all the SAF camps in Singapore, the vocation took up a substantial portion of full-time national servicemen. From the mid-1980s, the SAF saw the number of national service enlistees per year gradually decrease. A study was done in 1984 by the SAF that projected a 38% shortfall of cooks in three years. There was thus a need to increase productivity and make better use of the manpower in the SAF.<br><br><strong>1984: SAMPLING A CATERING SYSTEM</strong><br><br>To combat this shortfall, the SAF adopted a Centralised Catering System, allowing commercial caterers to supply food to our soldiers. Following a successful pilot project between May and December of 1984, the SAF engaged two commercial caterers- Chrisvic Pte Ltd and Changi International Airport Service to supply the meals. Together, the two companies supplied food for around 10,000 men.<br><br>With various checks in place at all stages of the food preparation, good, clean and halal food was guaranteed. The change also meant a greater variety of food being served, and a reduction in manpower at cookhouses by 50 per cent.<br><br><strong>1988 AND BEYOND: EXPANSION AND COMMERCIALISATION</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/armynews/image/issuePic/2_132.jpg"><br><br>By 1988, the SAF implemented the Centralised Catering System in all its camps in partnership with the Singapore Food Industries. Cooks were gradually phased out from their role of preparing food and were retained for handling the pre-cooked food and for the washing up afterwards. The SAF planned to reduce the number still further and decided to completely commercialise the catering system.<br><br>The main concerns for the SAF, besides reducing the number of cooks, were about system sustainability and training requirements. The system had to be secure, especially during periods of tension and war. It also had to cater to all training needs like out-rationing and mass mobilisations.<br><br>The confidence the SAF placed in the commercial system has been well-founded. Nutritious and tasty food is served while the system has helped to solve the SAFÂ’s manpower concerns. Our cookhouse food has indeed come a long way!</div>
