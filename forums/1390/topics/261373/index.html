As a principle, MINDEF ensures that you do not suffer a loss in employment income as a result of having to attend NS activities. NSmen who suffer a loss in employment income after payment of service pay can claim make-up (i.e the difference between employment income and service pay) from MINDEF.<br><br>Service Pay<br><br>Service Pay is equivalent to the NS allowance, which is dependent on the rank the NSman is holding. If you are holding a combat vocation, your service pay also includes a combat allowance (ranging from $100 to $300, depending on the type of combat vocation). Depending on the duration of your NS training, you will be paid pro-rated service pay. A minimum sum equivalent to half-day service pay will be paid for NS activity of 4 hours or less.<br><br>In addition, you will be given an increment in NS allowance (subject to the maximum of each rank scale) for every 40 days of NS activity that you attend. An example pay computation is given below:<br><br>For Example:<br><br>Monthly Service Pay of an Infantry 3SG : $710.00<br><br>Period of NS activity : 4 Apr - 5 Apr 2005<br><br>Service Pay for the NS activity : 2/30 days x $710.00 = $47.30<br><br>Make-up Pay<br><br>Make-up pay is the difference between your employment income and service pay for the NS training. An example of make-up pay computation is given below:<br><br>For Example:<br><br>Monthly Service Pay of an Infantry 3SG : $710.00<br><br>Period of NS activity : 4 Apr - 5 Apr 2005<br><br>Service Pay for the NS activity : 2/30 days x $710.00 = $47.30<br><br>However, when the NSman attends the NS activity, his employer deducts 2 days' pay that amounts to $200.00 from his income for April.<br><br>Deduction made by employer for te NS activity : $200.00<br><br>As such, he effectively suffers a net finanical loss of $152.70 ($200.00 - $47.30) after taking into consideration the deduction by this employer and his service pay for the training.<br><br>To ensure that does not suffer a net finanical loss of $152.70, he can submit a make-up pay claim to MINDEF for this amount.<br><br>Make-up Pay for the NS training<br>= Loss in Civilian Income - Service Pay<br>= $200.00 - $47.30 = $152.70<br><br>Awards &amp; Allowances<br><br>You may be also eligible for various awards &amp; allowances such as IPPT and Marksmanship awards, Flying allowances, Key Appointment Holder allowance, etc :<br><br>IPPT Award ($100/$200/$400)<br>Marksmanship Award ($200)<br>Key Appointment Holder (NS) Allowances<br>Responsibility (NS) Allowance<br>Aircrew (NS) Allowance<br>Commando Jump Award<br>Diving (NS) Allowance<br>Flying (NS) Allowance<br><br>How to Claim for Make-up Pay?<br><br>Make-up pay claim can be submitted online via www.ns.sg or manually using designated claim forms. To reduce processing time, you are strongly encouraged to use the online service to file claims. Online claim submission also provides immediate acknowledgement of your claim &amp; eliminates the possibilities of postal delays or loss of claim.<br><br>If you opt for the manual mode, the claim forms can be obtained from th following sources:<br><br>www.ns.sg<br>SAFRA clubs<br>NS Units<br><br>Employed NSmen: What are the Available Make-up Pay Claim Options?<br><br>There are 2 options for employed NSmen to claim make-up pay:<br><br>Option 1:<br>Direct Reimbursement to Employers for NS Training (DIRECT)<br>[Optional Scheme for Employers]<br><br>Your employer will continue to pay you as per your company's pay schedule when you attend NS training. Thereafter, your employer will seek reimbursement (service pay and make-up pay) directly from MINDEF. Your employer can file the claims online via www.ns.sg or manually using the Employer Claim Statement.<br><br>Option 2:<br>Reimbursement to NSmen<br><br>Your employer will certify your make-up pay claim &amp; submit to MINDEF. You will be reimbursed by MINDEF thereafter. Make-up pay claim can be submitted online via www.ns.sg or using hardcopy claim forms.<br><br>Self-employed NSmen: What are the Available Make-Up Pay Claim Options?<br><br>As a self-employed NSman, you have 2 options to claim your make-up pay. Choose the option that best suits you as an option, once made, is irrevocable.<br><br>Option 1:<br>Average Income Option<br><br>Your monthly income will be based on your average income earned in the 6 months before the NS training. If you are a doctor or bus driver, you can claim replacement fee incurred as a result of engaging a locum doctor or relief driver respectively to take over your duties during your absence.<br><br>Option 2:<br>Income Tax Option<br><br>Your monthly income will be based on the average monthly trade income shown in your Income Tax Notice of Assessment (NA) for the year of NS training.<br><br>Since the trade income for the year of training will not be available at the time that you submit a claim, a provisional payment will be made based on your latest available trade income. An adjustment will then be carried out later when the trade income for the year of training is available.<br><br>If you are underpaid, arrears will be paid to you while any amount overpaid will be recovered from you. If there is another outstanding claim from you, the overpayment will be used to offset that, before paying you for the second claim.<br><br>The trade income for the provisional payment as well as the final adjusted amount will be obtained directly from IRAS for claimants using this option.<br><br>What is the Deadline for Submitting Claim?<br><br>Make-up pay claim should not be submitted too early before NS training, as the pay details may not be accurate and current. The following serves as a guide:<br><br>e-MUPclaims (via www.ns.sg)<br><br>3 days (for local training)/14 days (for overseas training) before training commences.<br><br>Manual hardcopy claims<br><br>21 days (for all training) before trainnig commences<br><br>How will I be paid?<br><br>All payments due to you will be credited into your bank account number which was used during your full-time National Service or regular service. To ensure payments are credited into the correct bank account, you must inform MINDEF of any changes immediately. Changes can be updated via the eSelf-Update module in www.ns.sg.<br><br>Contact / Feedback<br><br>Address:<br>NSmen Payments Centre<br>D'eXecutive Services<br>5 Depot Rd #13-01 Tower B<br>Defence Technology Towers<br>Singapore 109681<br><br>Fax:<br>Employed Claims - 6373 1464<br>Self-employed Claims - 6373 1449<br>Customer Service - 6373 1477<br><br>Hotline:<br>1800-eNSNSNS (1800 367 6767)<br><br>Email: contact@ns.sg<br><br>Last updated on 17 Jan 2007<br><br></span></div>
