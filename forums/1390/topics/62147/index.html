However, behind that tough face, there is a softer and more understanding side to these instructors that we do not know of.<br><br>BMTC Â“BÂ” Company Platoon Sergeant, 2SG Samuel Choo shares with Army News some of the challenges and interesting moments that he faces when he is on the job. Army News: What is the biggest challenge of an instructor in BMTC?<br><br>2SG Samuel Choo: We need to know each recruit well as they come from very different backgrounds and need to be managed differently. Some recruits do not learn as fast as others do and we need to be more patient. Occassionally we will also get recruits with disciplinary problems. It is hard to handle such people as we have their interests at heart but they do not listen to us. We have to be very patient and give a lot of guidance.<br><br>Army News: If there are so many different personalities in our Army, how do you unite them and achieve cohesiveness in your team?<br><br>2SG Samuel Choo: When the recruits first come to us, we try to arrange activities that require the men to interact and work with each other. When the men sweat it out together, they will bond faster. The instructors will also try to find time to get to know their men better. It is through more interactions that everyone gets to know each other better and work gets done faster. There is greater teamwork.<br><br>Army News: You have handled 5 batches of recruits to date. Does it get boring sometimes?<br><br>2SG Samuel Choo: You are right. It can get boring sometimes, as I have to do the same thing over and over again with each batch of recruits that comes in. But I enjoy my work. I get to interact with different people with each enlistment and it is a learning experience for me too when I interact with them. It is also very fulfilling as many of the recruits who have trained under me remember me even after they graduate. It is nice to meet them on the streets, they are like brothers to me.<br><br>Army News: What is the most common misconception of instructors?<br><br>2SG Samuel Choo: Many think that sergeants are here to abuse their power and authority. It is a very negative point of view as most sergeants just want to do their job well and care for the recruits under their charge. We want them to benefit from their basic training and be more disciplined people. We are not trying to make their lives miserable and give them a hard time.<br><br>Army News: Can you share with us your most memorable experience as an instructor?<br><br>2SG Samuel Choo: Things often get interesting when I am outfield with my recruits. Many of them are not used to the rugged outfield environment and they do pretty funny stuff. Take camouflaging for an example, some of my recruits will put colourful flowers all over themselves and end up decorating themselves.<br><br></div>
