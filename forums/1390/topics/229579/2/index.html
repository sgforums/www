No. That is like LMIS or it's replacement Enterprise System, managed by Army NMC/SMC. If the SNCO is unhappy, he can feedback to his unit's IT manager or brigade NMC. In any case, such feedback may reach the Formation HQ or G4/G5 Army person responsible much later on.<br><br>Add in the turnaround time for system tweaking, and the usual committees that have to be drawn up to recommend changes to SAF-wide systems, you still won't get it done immediate.<br><br>So I recommend we all take into account the delay, and try to be early for their FFI, RSI or what not. The Medical Center is run with it's flaws, and while bureaucracy takes their time to improve things,  why not be creative and think of ways to maximise your time while waiting? </div></blockquote>i think the most important is for patients to book appointments...most tend to jsut come n expect quick service..there was sometimes when i have to entertatian 5-6 FFIs, PHEs etc amongst are enciks, officers...when they come i also cant ask them to leave since they never book appointment. N those who came for FFIs, PHEs   n did book a appointment will complain why they r served so slowly even though they had book appointment</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The people working within the medical corps, military or civilian, will tend to accept that patients deserve to wait. Look at our Polyclinics and Hospitals. Even with appointments, you spend a lot of time waiting as well.<br><br>For SAF Medical centres, the MOs, clinic assistants, and the patients know that the objective is an MC. So, be nice to everyone. Afterall, if there is a delay, better still, you still got off training even without an MC.</div>
