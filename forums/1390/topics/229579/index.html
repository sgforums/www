In this case, a simple "system is slow" will not suffice. He is a SNCO. The least that could be done is to tell him in detail why it is so slow and suggest to him steps to take to help remedy the situation. At the same time, what are you medics doing to remedy the situation. Have you told the CoC that the system is shite?<br><br></div>
