              <p>I had drinks with an old friend, who was an officer in NS. he brought a few others who were also mostly officers, and some specialists. They all say that guys who chao keng for their NS are irresponsible and whiny types of guys, with self centredness in their characters, with poor values and principles as humans. And in their experience, these guys also turn out to be useless in their career as civilians after they ORD.</p>
              <p>In other words, chao keng in NS signals very very high chance of becoming a useless deadwood at the worst, and at best having an unspectacular career.</p>
              <p>This applies to 90% of the PesC and E that are chao kengs, and not the exceptional minority where there is a genuine serious medical condition that disallows him to be combat fit.</p>

              <p>but how can this be when for them to first be selected for command school it already means they are responsible and did not try to chao keng. And to finish command school it indicates that they have mental strength, determination and are responsible. As you know, there are a lot of job seekers, graduates and otherwise who indicate in their CVs that they went to OCS or just command school in general in NS. Why would they do so?</p>
              <p>I am sure you know this, IF you have finished NS and have friends who have. if you're still in NS, then it's understandable that you're ignorant about Singaporean males who indicate that they were NSF commanders, especially officers in their CV.</p>

              <p>Oh yeah i know this guy who chao keng during his NS and was a storeman. Anyway he really became a big time deadwood as a civilian too. and is now far behind his peers in earning power and job appointment. Another friend who is a (NS) officer agrees and say his sec and JC mates who were kengsters all became career failures or laggards too and he too agrees there is a correlation.</p>

              <p>I've seen officers who are with self centredness in their characters, with poor values and principles as humans.Some officers are quite dumb too and they don't do proper planning in advanced. For example, an officer punished the entire company by asking them to be in push up position and go down and hold it there. He still isn't satisfied as some people are not doing it. If even the strongest guy in my coy can only hold it for a substantial amount of time then what about the rest?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In my opinion, there are some offiers who are kinda sadist in nature and egoistic in the way they do things. Is that a good thing? i doubt so. everything has its pros and cons. Not all pes c and below really wanna chao keng. If you got a knee injury and during the check up, would you declare it? What would you do TS? This is to tell you that different people each has their own thinking. Some just wanna sound off and get downgraded to Pes C for fear of aggravating their injury while some wanna act "gung-ho" by trying to get PesA/B.</p>
