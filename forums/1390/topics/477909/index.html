              <p>I am a Singaporean living in Brunei, studying 'A' Level. I am turing 18 at the end of February. I might quit school to come back to serve my NS because I failed my Final Year Exam very badly and the school might retain me. Thus, I only have my 'O' Level with me and is it true that most 'O' Level holders get into mono-intake instead of going to Pulau Tekong. If so, am I allowed to choose the vocation that I want to enter. I really want to be a commando.</p>
              <p>I am wondering if I quit school now, when do I have to report to CMPB and when do I have to enlist?</p>
              <p>Futhermore, do I have to sit for the NAPFA test before my enlistment.</p>
              <p>Thanks!</p>
