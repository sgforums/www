              <p>Hi, I was just wondering about the university admission for u RSAF pilots. I understand that u need 2 be a Cat. B pilot or sthg like that to be able to go uni right? From my syfc talk with a RSAF pilot last time, I was told that to be a Cat. B pilot would require a few years of service; i.e. you would be abt 25 yrs old or so by the time u are allowed to go uni.</p>
              <p>I'm not entirely sure whether I remembered all these info correctly. So can someone please enlighten me on this? Also, what does it actually feel like when u enter uni so damn late? U have been away from studies for so long, so what kind of difficulties do u face then? A typical pilot who took the JC route would join the force at 19, so he would have these 6 years or so where he aint studying anything abt differentiation, integration etc. For those who applied for chemistry courses, its even worse cos I'm pretty sure the pilot trng doesnt teach organic chem.</p>
              <p>I'd just like to know ur opinions, and how u coped with it. For ur info, I'm a J2 student now.</p>

              <p>why would u wanna be a fighter pilot? it may be cool &amp; all to fly the f-15 eagle. being a pilot in RSAF means u work under the govt. but if u go into commercial flight, u work in a private sector, like SIA or sth like tat. and when u work in private sectors, your pay is higher.</p>

              <p>if u look under FAQ, the academic requirements is only O levels. im nt sure how true tat is.</p>

              <p>Eh, the reason y i am asking now is becos I'm not inside yet, so I'm just asking questions. I'm sorry if u cant answer my question, but u dont need to be so hostile. Is it wrong to clarify???</p>
              <p>Anyway, I'm not so far from joining the air force. I've already completed all my medicals, MAPAS and COMPASS test last year. All thats left now is my interview. So, I'd put my chances of entering the force of being quite good.</p>

              <p>At this point of time, I already know what I want to do in life. I like the military kind of life, being in NCC since Sec 1 until now. Going to SIA is completely different. Sure, it have more perks. U get more women, u get more money, etc. But if I really do go there, I wouldnt be as happy as when I go to RSAF. Anyway my ex-flight instructor has kinda indoctrinated me into joining RSAF, since he was an ex-RSAF pilot himself.</p>
              <p>Back then in the syfc, he was telling me about the syfc just being ur passion, but the rsaf being ur CAREER. And then he also mentioned the amount of actual flying that a commercial pilot gets during each flight. The autopilot relieves much of the pilots work; i.e. he doesnt get to fly as much. Compare this to the air force, where u get to fly 100% of the time. If ur passion is truly in flying, u'd join the force. If u prefer the money over the flying, then u'd go over to SIA.</p>
              <p>Anyway, RSAF pilots can go over to SIA once their contract is over, provided they are not very happy being in the force...<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/greggman.com/confused.png" alt="confused.png"> If not, I was told that after they retire, they can also hop over to SIA Cargo. So, either way, u'd get to fly commercial eventually. My flight instructor said that its better to join RSAF 1st, and fly until ur 40+, then u can enjoy ur life and relax in SIA until u retire at 60+. So I set my mind to join the air force.</p>

              <p>u need a minimum of Cat B for pilots to go study. for WSO's its Cat C i think.</p>
              <p>anyway on average for an A level student  that joins, u probably leave to study when u're 26/27. around that range.</p>
              <p>of course going back to uni aruond that age is a challenge. but its your choice to go to uni, so even if its hard, u'd have to work harder to catch up. and before u leave for study u'd prob do some preparation right, like find out about what basic info is needed and maybe practice so that you get back on track faster??</p>
              <p>anyway u'd be a mature (relatively) student so you have more focus and more to lose out if you don't do well in your uni degree, so thats some motivation for working hard in uni.</p>

              SIA... If its true that a substantial of rsaf pilots hop over after
              their bond, then the normal civilians would have a vertically
              uphill task joining SIA cos these air force pilots in the very
              least have the flying hours and experience.</p>
              <p>And just wondering, do u need a degree to join SIA?</p>

              <p>yeah its hard.. if i'm not wrong there is like a special package to hop over to SIA once their 10 year bond is over.. yeah and the airforce pilots have a shorter training or conversion time.. especially those flying the kc135s etc.. so easy for them..</p>
              <p>i'm not sure bout that, but if you're joining a coporate company, always better to have a degree if not can't climb!</p>

              SIA only takes Singaporean citzens older then 26. This was put in place to allow the RSAF 1st pick on all aspiring pilots.
              
              So usually if you wanna be an SIA people would serve NS then go study by then you should be 26 or so and set to go. =D

              <p>Caleb, sometimes I think its better if u act a little more polite. Its not really very nice to tell people that to want to become a pilot is their 'wishful thinking'. U do not know what peoples abilities are, yet u make this kind of comments. Its just not very nice I think.</p>
              <p>And cheeze, do u mind saying what aircraft u fly? I'm curious.</p>

              <p>Actually the ones that are most similar are the KC-135. Those are the modified 707s, 4 engined. Its the closest to SIA's fleet of aircraft. However, if u are talking about commercial aircraft worldwide, then the F-50 also fits the bill. Some airlines operate the F-50 to ferry people around.</p>
