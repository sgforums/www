            <div class='col-md body'>My 1st road march... Though was VERY SIONG but the scenery was really NICE....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>One time when our M113 was trapped by the 'cliff' and ALMOST fall back and overturn to the grounds below... All of us dare not move a bit... Just SLOWLY passing the items and weapons from the back of the vehicle to the front and SLOWLY climbed out of the vehicle...<br><br>Another time, our driver on a 3-tonner was taking us on a 'joy ride'... Spinning the thing around... Was REALLY FUN until the vehicle ALMOST overturned to the slope below to our right... All of us know that if any of us are to place our weight slightly to the right, the vehicle probably would have lost its balance....<br><br>Night range... Too many stories... 2 that's still FRESH in my mind...<br><br>1. One of the VERY BLUR recruit had his helmet knocked and the sergent talked to him... He turned his body around to face the sergent, swinging the weapon all around without putting the weapon to 'safe'....<br><br>2. Some of the guys were collecting empty shells from the butt area... In a hurry to commerce the 'live' firing, they didn't realise that there was still one guy at the butt area... The guy was squating down when the firers gave off their 1st round, someone saw the guy and stopped the 2nd round of firing.. During the firing itself, only the sound of the firing and announcer could be clearly heard...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There was once when i was the safety spec at an ORD shoot. We are doing the run down. The target will come up once and then down to signal us to run to the second position. There is this joker who miss a target at the previous position and thought that the signal target is a target. He fired off when the rest of us is running to the second position in front of him!!! Fucking shocked when the rest of the firers and me heard the shot goes off!

            <div class='col-md body'>We had a foreign general visiting our division, thus the usual vehicles and arnaments came on show. Can't remember if it was before or after the visit but witnessed from second floor of the HQ, a slow straying FH2000 running over the driver's legs. It seemed like the arty gun wasn't fully disengaged before he jumped off and when he realised and tried to rectify, his boots got caught and he fell and got dragged under. Tragedy.</div>
