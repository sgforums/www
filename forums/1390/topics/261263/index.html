Was told if you did not serve a minimum percentage of days you are suppose to serve, it will not be counted and will have to do make up ICT. If you missed too much, you could be posted into new unit which most likely be super on. Then by the time your pals finish their cycle and go into MR, you will still have to go through all the trouble of getting MC and trying to get out of ICT all the way till  50 years old and together with very young chaps fresh out of NS. And if a particular ICT cannot get excuse, you will suffer.<br>Furthermore don't forget that after going into MR, no more recall manning while you will have to do manning every few months.</div>

Was told if you did not serve a minimum percentage of days you are suppose to serve, it will not be counted and will have to do make up ICT. If you missed too much, you could be posted into new unit which most likely be super on. Then by the time your pals finish their cycle and go into MR, you will still have to go through all the trouble of getting MC and trying to get out of ICT all the way till  50 years old and together with very young chaps fresh out of NS. And if a particular ICT cannot get excuse, you will suffer.<br>Furthermore don't forget that after going into MR, no more recall manning while you will have to do manning every few months.</div></blockquote>Come on lah. You are already a reservaist and there are so many reservaits in singapore. CPC won't be so free to takan you by what posting you to a new unit which will be super on lah and blah blah.<br><br>Unless you are a big fart or you purposely call your unit and be qui lah and tell them I chao keng take mc to siam reservaists than people will wanna takan you..</div>

Some even lost their job.<br><br>Furthermore, MC so easy to keng ah?
