Eg in our SAF cookhouse,should the Sgt/offr queue up right at the end of his platoon or should he go to the permstaff corner to grab his food? Last time during BMT,my SGT always queue up together with us,talk cock with us while queueing,then when the whole platoon had got their food,then is his turn to be served.He also ate together with his men...</div></blockquote>in field yes but i dun see the need to when you are in camp.<br><br>as for your example in/during BMT... some SGT do do that but what's the point? want to know the man more, that is just not the time. after meal, back in the office or in the bunk, better still if a smoker than in the smoker corner.</div>
