PL SGT? and in this case the sect 2IC where?<br>Guess what happened at Platoon level, the PC down? the whole platoon stop moving... wtf. they dun even know how to move back or take cover but stay in the open. well maybe no rounds are firing at them.<br><br>Now the question i really want to ask CDF but will never happen unless he read this... lol<br>Can the Platoon SGT of today take over command from the PC?</div>

During the evening at the mess, he was relating to us what consitutes a well oiled Infantry Bn. He posed the question to us, YSL ( the whole lot of us just got posted there) " Are your section commanders ready to lead his men ?"<br><br>From his prespective, once the section commander is able to lead his section as he was taught to, with the PC letting his section do their work while ensuring the Coys intent,thats the way the battle should be fought.<br>.</div></blockquote>there should not be an overemphasis on one single role for junior commanders.If the PC is down, the PS or the next senior specialist must be able to think on the move and get the engine running again.<br><br>Overdependancy on one individual runs the risk of catastrophic mission failure and overgrown egos.<br><br>This can be applied very aptly to running a country too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A good officer is one who knows when and what to do when required - thinking officer/soldier.<br>- doesn't falter when a clear decision or direction is needed in a very short time (command and control).<br>- thinks like his men and put himself in their shoes when there is work to be done.<br><br>Rank is what you wear, respect is what you earned.<br><br>The soldiers know very well which PC, OC, CO they want to be with when the button is pressed!<br><br>Care for others (troopers) and others will care for you (commander). A soldier is willing to help his officer clean his rifle if the officer is willing to help clean the platoon's GPMG.<br><br>I once read in Pioneer a story when Lim Neo Chian was still the Cdmr of 3 Div. He route marched with his division in SBO helmet rifle. He was not in the GP car or landrover.<br><br>In any case, I feel that it is improper for an officer to ask his men to clean his rifle for him even though he is not free. Since he is an officier, he is paid more and therefore should do more, even this means giving up his sleeping time to clean his own rifle.<br><br>I think, sometimes, people forget that we are in national service. We go to the army to serve the country and not to serve the rank that someone wears.  May be this is why some NS units are better motivated that NSF units.<br><br></div>

PC still get runner to draw arm for them and best still sign for them as well. well maybe PC can do the can not.<br><br>post ex... coy line... all guys... clean arms... S3?<br>have you had your 1st ex. or were you one who ask runner to clean your rifle? before the man can clean arm, they have store to clear.<br>wat operational culture is at work here? clean weapon half way, S3 call... assemble the rifle, bring it along to see S3. any problem? do the S3 call everytime after an ex? i dun think so.<br>"staff work takes precedence over the individual soldiering duties of a PC very often" than he is very ineffective as a PC all at all and it oni in the camp we are talking now, in field how? forget that.<br><br>Let just talk about after BN ex. which end on friday late afternoon.<br>back in camp,<br>for offr ~ CO might want a AAR right away but most of the time will be the next day.<br>~ OC want AAR form all PC right away.<br>~ PC never do AAR with the platoon.<br><br>for CSM, he want the coy store to be clean and return of which most are draw out by the platoons.<br>for PS, he want the platoon store to be clean and return to coy store.<br>for sect comd he want the sect store to be clean and report any damage or lost.<br>anyone in here ever saw a PC help in clearing store? I never.<br><br>PS get the whole platoon (take away runner) clean the store together. those need to wash and air dry will leave it in the sq to air. all man clean weapons together.<br>PS check weapon, clean and ready to send arm. after declare and send arm and still need to collect the dry store and send in store. all still in no.4, no one goes up bunk at all till all things need to be done are done.<br><br>so where is the PC all this time? well no AAR from CO till next day, OC AAR was short, he din do AAR with the platoon, just pass the weapon to the runner tell him to clean for him, he went back bunk, take a good bath, a short nap, change and ready to book out.<br>btw if S3 need to look for him, he must have super cockup somewhere during the ex. or a excuse to get away.<br><br>let just say CO want an AAR right away, he should pull through a few time, oil it well, send arm or safe lock than clean the arm at a later time or the next day draw arm and carry on cleaning.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok lah, to be fair for all PCs in the SAF, not all are like that lah<br><br>at least during my active unit and now reservist unit, the PCs that took over my platoon have done a good job.<br>what i mean by good job, they will show us the leadership by doing it first, and the platoon to follow him.<br><br>example, the first PC for my platoon took the initiative to come down every morning to do 5BX with the sect comds and men. that i truly respect...<br><br>he also tries to clean his own weapon, but if he is really not free and if someone in the platoon was excused from the exercise, he'll arrow them to clean the platoon weapons while the rest who came back from exercise do the stores. This has been our culture till now in reservist and everyone is happy about it.<br><br>this first PC downgraded halfway thru' due to injury and 2nd PC took over. though more slack, but he will take the responsibility if ever the platoon screws up... therefore he had taken alot of arrows (extras) on behalf of the platoons and ended up doing quite a few DOO.. heheheh...<br><br>this 2nd PC then signed on when we ORD'ed and his NSF ending coz' at that point of time job market not very good<br><br>now comes the last PC, he joined us last year during our 2nd yr ICT. although it's his first time taking a PC role in a unit (previously an instructor in school during NSF), he have shown that he have what it takes to shoulder the responsibility to motivate the men and the cmdrs' by going to their level and talking to them.<br>and it was also during this ICT that he took the blame for a stupid screw up caused by the Bn HQ and ultimately the S3 putting the blame on our platoon.<br>feeling wronged, the PC and us (sect comds) went to reason with the CO but ultimately have to take some shit (coz' he is CO)...<br>initially the CO wanted to punish the whole platoon, but our PC and us decided that we'll take the responsibility and be punished instead of the men.<br><br>so, respect have to be earned. don't just talk the talk.</div>
