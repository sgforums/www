PC and not S3 we are talking here. next point you went out is we are talking about end of ex and not during an ex.<br>cleaning of own personal weapon. even so it during an ex or better still in a ops, i dun think you will like someone else to clean your weapon, will you when in a ops? if in a ops you will and ex will not, ie you dun take your training seriously enough.<br>i agreed on the organisation did pay his subordinates to "assist" him. him as in S3 not a PC in Coy line as he dun have that.<br>just to clear, "assist" in "work" not "personal favour"<br><br>get back to the point own "personal" weapon... can the S3 subordinates go in his place to the toilet for him, ie to say the ops SGT peed for his S3?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>segregation of roles... platoon runner dun clean weapon for his PC as it is a personal weapon. PERSONAL.</div></blockquote>well. your reply did not offend me. i was just wondering how i offended you in the first place to make you make personal attacks on me in your reply. there is nothing wrong with being direct in delivering a point. but that does not mean you need to attack a person in the process. perhaps that is your style.<br><br>so what is the difference between a PC and an S3 (other than their rank and amount of responsibility)? arent they both officers? then, arent they both suppose to fulfil functions as such - different degrees maybe, of planning and actual command.<br><br>as i mentioned in my very first post, the PC SHOULD clean his own weapon, if he has nothing else urgent that he has to attend to. if the weapon (and whatever other personnel directly or indirectly related to it) can wait, then of course, he SHOULD attend to the business, and return to clean and send it himself. i apply this even to the S3, and in fact, EVERYONE.<br><br>the same division of labour applies for the PC too, but of course he has less assistants since he has a smaller job scope (than the S3). but his runner is supposed to assist him. and if there is a need for the runner (or any assistant) to help clean the supervisor's weapon, that is not favour, but responsibility. we may argue over this definition of need, but i think it is pointless, just as how it is pointless to argue over how one prioritises his time.<br><br></div>
