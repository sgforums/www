            <div class='col-md body'>this thread really grew leaps and bounds within a day! i had to muster all my speed reading skills, and even that wasnt sufficient!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>anyway, from my quick skim-through, it seems that some of us have very <strong>strong feelings</strong> against officers, esp. in terms of them <strong>delegating work</strong>.<br><br>i guess this is inevitable - power corrupts, we all hear. so it tends to get misused. so people start to make their subordinates do what they should not ask them to. but do remember - that is not to say superiors cannot make subordinates do ANYTHING! if that's the case, why the differentiation between superiors and subordinates? might as well all be equal. cheaper this way too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>i used to feel very awkward and even guilty to delegate jobs to subordinates too. i would try to help as much as i can. but i later realise<br>1. the subordinate may not want you to "help"! in fact they may think you are doubting their competencies, and you are being nosey!<br>2. its IMPOSSIBLE to have a hand in everything, while still performing your functions wrt your peers and bosses effectively.<br><br>so it boils down to -<strong> what to delegate</strong>? and i guess that is the crux.<br><br>but if the rage and vengeance is against the <strong>system </strong>(of defining and selecting superiors and subordinates), i guess there really can be nothing much gained out of this scholastic and academic discussion.<br><br>let's all keep calm and not reduce this so far rather well-argued thread into a flaming arena.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

Your experiences are difinitely greater than what i gone through, u might have even trained my brother and his frens when he enlisted in 7 BTS back in July 1996 for his BMT if you were still in 7 BTS.<br><br>I empthaise with u for the kinda of officers u have met and worked with. I know your going to cringe when i say this but during my time as a cadet, my PC was a Guards Officer who converted from a Specialist. Therefore he imparted his knowlege of being a specialist and how it will affect our command and command in terms of the Plt, Company and Bn.<br><br>He demanded alot from us as cadets as he knew how the specs will look upon the PC for command and the standard we would demand next time. during your tour, u might have met him in 3rd Guards as a PC back in 1998. He was posted back as an OC back in 2003 with 3rd Guards.<br><br>Well with regards to the transformation of the WOSE core, i do belive the current changes made to it will be of greater impact than ever , since all commanders have to attend SISPEC before embarking on to OCS.it should provide them with better understanding of specialist role, allowing them to excel in section leadership, before embarking for plt leadership training.</div>
