              <p> </p>
              <p>How true is both of these myths? What i am actually thinking is,
                  if you ORD as a recruit, you will reservice as whatever vocation
                  you are in and just be call as "Recruit ABC" when a higher ranker
                  calls you.</p>

              <p>For 1, they no longer/ ceased to do a modified BMT recourse anymore. </p>
              <p>For 2, it depends on your vocation.</p>
              <p>Regardless of your rank/ PES, if you are in those "lobo" vocation, you may/ may not be called back for reservist. The NS unit, which you are assigned to as a NSman, may put you under their temporary reserve/ holding list. While some people might get reposted if their PES met the cut-off minimum PES requirement for vocations that lack manpower in the NS reservist units, others with some other reasons or so who can't be sorted out/ can't fit into available vocation/ manpower establishment quota may also not be called back. You will be surprised to know that for some "lost soldiers", they go for their very 1st ICT in their 30s/ 40s.</p>
