            <div class='col-md body'>Universities should woo with PR, not advertising<br><br>I REFER to the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School's television commercial in which a student in the United States chose NUS over top US universities.<br><br>As an alumnus of one of the three main business schools in Singapore, I have followed with interest the promotional efforts of each business school since competition for the best and the brightest intensified with the incorporation of the third business school in 2000.<br><br>All of a sudden, lecturers and school administrators are talking about 'building a brand' to strengthen their image and attract prospective applicants.<br><br>While the intention behind the NUS advertisement is laudable, it is a timely marketing lesson for any university aspiring to build a world-class brand. Universities should ask themselves what is their key selling point to their target audience. To be 'different'? To be 'preferred around the world by tomorrow's elite'? Brand-building has to start with the fundamentals.<br><br>Faced with more choices, applicants now have to cut through the hype and they are savvy enough to judge for themselves with today's proliferation of information through Internet mediums such as online forums and blogs.<br><br>Public relations, such as publicity and word-of-mouth from employers and the marketplace, is a whole lot more credible and believable than any advertising. For example, graduates from my alma mater are typically associated by employers with traits such as 'diligent', 'technically stronger' and 'better work ethics'.<br><br>While terms like these may not find their way into advertising messages, such testimonials affirm what employers truly value.<br><br>In the book, The Fall Of Advertising And The Rise Of PR, Al and Laura Ries made references to how universities like Harvard, Princeton and Yale have become educational brands. These universities became brands not by advertising but 'by massive publicity even if the publicity efforts were not self-directed'.<br><br>The book cited examples of universities using advertising in brand-building, the most noteworthy being Long Island's Adelphi University. Adelphi ran campaigns consisting of full-page newspaper ads with headlines like these:<br><br># Harvard: The Adelphi of Massachusetts.<br><br># Does anybody need an education this good?<br><br># There are three things everyone should read before entering college: Plato's Republic, the complete works of Aristotle, and this ad.<br><br>Adelphi didn't become the Harvard of Long Island but what did happen was that its president got fired.<br><br><span class="large">Even when I was serving national service, there was competition for talents. Recruitment ads were posted around the camp and officers from different combat arms would make the rounds to talk about the critical role their unit plays in the Army. Yet what left the deepest impression on me was not what the recruitment ads or the officers said. It was a modern version of a poem quoted from General Sir Archibald Wavell.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">'When it was victory,' remarked Field Marshal Wavell (1883-1950), 'the Cavalier claimed it outright, the Gunner boasted of his calibre, the Engineer and Signalman publicised their worth, but the Infantryman stood silent with victory at his feet.'</span><br><br>Needless to say, I was an infantryman.</span><br>Su Yuxiong<br>Shanghai, China</div>
