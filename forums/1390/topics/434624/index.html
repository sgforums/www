              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">Hi all</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: black;'> I need some advise
                                          as  to what to do re: a deferment application. The whole story is a little
                                          long, so please bear with me!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: black;'>I'm a Singaporean doctor who left for overseas for studies some time ago, and was working and completing
                                          some specialist studies part time up to the start of this year, when I was
                                          called back to serve my NS.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: black;'>Upon registering for at
                                          the CMPB, I was told that I would be enlisted as an MO due to my medical
                                          training. However, a week later I was notified that I could NOT serve as an MO;
                                          although I am registered in Australia as a fully qualified doctor, I am not in
                                          Singapore. Hence, if I were to enlist, I would have to serve in a non-medical
                                          capacity for 2 years (which would result in me <em><strong>losing my medical license</strong>)</em>. In
                                          order to be registered locally, I would need to work in a government hospital
                                          for 2 years under supervision. I was advised by a CMPB staff member to apply
                                          for get a job and apply for deferment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: black;'>Fast forward 5 months -
                                          I have signed a contract with MOH to start in September, and have been granted
                                          conditional registration to work. I have also sumbitted my deferment
                                          application (through a CMPB staff member who is "handling my case").
                                          However, despite all this, I got an enlistment letter for the end of August.
                                          The CMPB informed me that this was because I have not yet been deferred.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: black;'>I have recently
                                          contacted the staff member again, and all that I was told was that "the
                                          documents are forwarded to the relevant department, and the application is in
                                          processing and is still subject to approval". Now, it's been almost<strong><em> <strong>2 months</strong></em></strong>, and this wait is pretty
                                          frustrating, for obvious reasons.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: black;'>One, my wife and I have
                                          been literally living off our savings for the last few months (she has just got
                                          a job, thankfully, but visa issues have been a pain because she is a
                                          foreigner). Two, I am  receiving a lot of pressure from different
                                          departments to give confirmation of clinical practice. The MOH has confirmed my
                                          employment and informed my hospital that I am arriving in september (so that
                                          they can organise their staffing), the Australian Medical Board is wanting to
                                          check that I am doing clinical practice, and Sydney Uni (where I was doing
                                          specialist studies) wants to know I am resuming studies this half year</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: black;'>Obviously all this
                                          depends on whether I actually get deferred or not. With barely a month left to
                                          the enlistment date, I need to know how/who I can speak to in order to
                                          expediate the process. I've asked the CMPB staff member I've been liaising with, and
                                          she doesn't give me any details as to what department exactly/who is processing
                                          my deferment. Any ideas what I can do/who I can contact to help?</span></p>
