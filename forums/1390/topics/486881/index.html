              <p>With the need to conduct a full spectrum of operations, the 
                  Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is seeking to expand our operational 
                  capabilities especially in niche areas of expertise. The Expertise 
                  Conversion Scheme (ECS) was thus conceived as a scheme that allows the 
                  SAF to tap on Singapore's talent pool. It provides more opportunities 
                  for our Operationally Ready National Servicemen (NSmen) with deep 
                  civilian professional expertise to voluntarily continue contributing to 
                  the nation's defence by enhancing operational capabilities in areas 
                  identified by the SAF. Examples of such niche areas of expertise include
                   law, medicine, engineering, psychology and info-communications.</p>
              <p>The ECS is based on the Military Domain Experts Scheme (MDES), which 
                  is premised on civilian professional expertise in key military domains 
                  and comprises a rank structure organised according to qualifications and
                   experience. In recognition of the expanded scope of responsibility in 
                  their new roles, NSmen converted under the ECS will be emplaced to the 
                  rank of Military Expert 4 (ME4) upon full completion of training.</p>
              <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eligibility</span>. Under this scheme, NS WOSEs (Warrant 
                  Officers, Specialists and Enlistees) holding specialised professional 
                  qualifications identified by the SAF as operationally relevant will be 
                  recommended to join the ECS. Interested applicants can also register 
                  their interest with the NS Relations Officers in their Formation or 
                  Division Headquarters. This scheme is primarily for NSmen who have 
                  completed their Operationally Ready National Service (ORNS) commitments.
                   NSmen with existing ORNS commitments may also be considered for 
                  conversion to meet SAF's operational requirements. Such applications 
                  will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rigorous Selection and Comprehensive Training for ECS Personnel</span>. 
                   Besides stringent qualification and background checks to ensure that 
                  they possess the appropriate expertise for the roles, shortlisted NS 
                  WOSEs will need to possess sound leadership qualities and good character
                   attributes. After passing the selection board interview, they will 
                  undergo training comprising three components: (1) Specialisation 
                  Training; (2) Leadership Training; and (3) On-Job-Training (OJT). This 
                  is to level up the skills set of ECS personnel with that of their 
                  military and MDES counterparts. Upon completion of the training, ECS 
                  personnel will be emplaced to hold the ME4 rank.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Minimum Obligation</span>.   As ECS personnel will be holding senior 
                  MDES ranks, they will have their NS statutory age raised to 50 years, 
                  similar to their NS officer counterparts. They will be required to serve
                   in their new rank and roles for a minimum period of three years. As per
                   the SAF Act, they are liable for call up for up to 40 days per year.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Implementation Timeline</span>.  The inaugural batch of ECS personnel
                   will complete their required training and attain their new ranks of 
                  ME4(A) in July this year. They will then undergo OJT in the next few NS 
                  years before attaining their ME4 ranks. Henceforth, depending on 
                  operational requirements and availability of suitable candidates, there 
                  will be up to two batches of ECS conversions a year.</p>
