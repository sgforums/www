              <p>Guns, grenades and iPads for Singapore soldiers</p>
              <p>Source:<a href="http://old.news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110627/tc_afp/singaporemilitaryinternettechnologyipadusapple"> Linkie</a></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE (AFP) – New recruits to Singapore's military, air force and
               navy are to get a new standard-issue item of equipment besides their 
              rifle -- the iPad.</p>
              <p>The defence ministry said Monday it will be issuing "about 8,000" of the
               sleek, touch-screen tablet computers -- already wildly popular with the
               city-state's tech-savvy youth -- to recruits from November.</p>
              <p>The ministry said it was also planning to issue the devices to other 
              servicemen next year. The cheapest iPad2 device currently retails in 
              Singapore for Sg$668 ($538).</p>
              <p>Defence chief Neo Kian Hong said adopting the iPad would allow the 
              Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) to take advantage of the technological 
              abilities of the city-state's youth.</p>
              <p>"By exploiting the use of popular and current information and 
              communications technology, we are able to harness our advantage of 
              today's technologically savvy servicemen," the Straits Times newspaper 
              quoted him as saying.</p>
              <p>Troops can use the iPad's built-in camera to take photos and video clips
               in the field which can be uploaded to the SAF's online platform, 
              LEARNet. Soldiers can use these photos and videos to carry out 
              post-mission assessments, the newspaper said.</p>
              <p>Soldiers can send questions to their commanders through a live messaging
               system and group chat discussions can be held, it added.</p>
              <p>The SAF said it was working with private contractors to design apps -- 
              micro-programs tailor-made for mobile devices with a wide range of 
              functions -- for servicemen.</p>
              <p>Singapore maintains a conscript-based military and its armed forces are 
              among the best-equipped in Asia. Every able-bodied male citizen and 
              permanent resident aged 18 and above must undergo two years of military 
              training.</p>

              <p>I quote the Yahoo article:</p>
              <p><strong>1.</strong><strong><em> Troops can use the iPad's built-in camera to take photos and
                                      video clips in the field which can be uploaded to the SAF's online
                                      platform, LEARNet. Soldiers can use these photos and videos to
                                      carry out post-mission assessments, the newspaper said.</em></strong></p>
              <p>Ahhh.... sure boh? That should be the job of instructors and assessors, NOT recruits!</p>
              <p>And they can just use an el cheapo (and more rugged and portable) digicam for that! Hell, my brigade commander once attached a few photographers and cameramen to my battalion during an exercise just for that purpose!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><strong>2. Soldiers can send questions to their commanders through a live
                                      messaging system and group chat discussions can be held, it
                                      added.</strong></em></p>
              <p>So... group wireless chat in the thick of battle? You want to chat with your OC while you're charging an enemy firetrench? Certainly not.... it would make more sense to just have a face-to-face AAR after the exercise.</p>
              <p>In which case..... wireless group chat for fcuk? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
