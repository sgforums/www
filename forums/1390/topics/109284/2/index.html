To create better mission responsiveness and a high-readiness core, the 6th Battalion Singapore Infantry Regiment (6 SIR) was designated to be the first Protection of Installations (POI) battalion, vigilant round the clock. A new chapter in 6 SIRÂ’s history began as the unit held its turn-operational parade at Maju Camp on 19 November.<br><br>At the parade, Chief of Army, MG Desmond Kuek and many senior commanders witnessed as Commander of 2nd PeopleÂ’s Defence Force, BG Tay Swee Yee, declared 6 SIR operational. The soldiers of 6 SIR also put up an impression display of their operational proficiency acquired after months of specialised training.<br><br>6 SIR will work round the clock and enhance security at four key civilian installations Â– Changi Airport, Jurong Island, Sembawang Wharf and Exxon-Mobil. The men, rigorously trained in rules of engagement, will have the capability to deal with higher security threats when needed.<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/armynews/image/issuePic/2_217.jpg"><br><br>Commander of 6 SIR, MAJ Kong Kam Yean, said, Â“This will be a new challenge for the battalion. We do not have guiding posts to look for, our enemies will always have new tactics. We must learn to leap ahead, and be able to fight tomorrowÂ’s war with tomorrowÂ’s strategy and tomorrowÂ’s tactics. That is what we are trained to do, and Singaporeans can now be more assured knowing there is a dedicated force that can carry out its mission of protecting installations well.Â”<br>[/b]</blockquote>wah lau...6SIR turn operational n do duty at vital areas n key installations like very "sart" then last time i do basinet like banghra like tat....somemore stil on armynews leh.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
