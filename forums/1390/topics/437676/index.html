              <p>i have a skin condition - facial eczema - which will be exacerbated when i go for outfield training. so duh obviously i have no rashes now since im not out in the field. it is precisely because i will get rashes if i go for outfield training in australia (since i went there before and got it post-outfield training due to the dry climate) that im trying to get myself exempted. FYI i have a memo from the NSC to certify my condition and it is the reason i failed my FFI at first. thanks for your ostensibly apathetic and grossly inane remarks which are essentially unnecessary though. </p>

              <p>My advice to you is that just suck thumb and go, or go get MC.
