              <p>I would say just keep your mouth shut unless you want get into more trouble. Nothing is really fair in this world and theres alot of cover ups in the army. Unless you want to have a very miserable days leading to ORD and maybe more chances to get charge over whatever stupid thing that happen, just keep what you know to yourself.</p>

              <p>Wow... SIB.. Ok seems like ya have a crazy fellow in ya platoon...</p>
              <p>This kind of person i think he is over-stressed due to the army... sometimes you will definitely meet his sorts of people in ya life.. for my case I had a section mate who would bath after all the trainings and soc and then dump his wet socks/singlet right back into his locker... and this fellow even vomitted during 5bx and he lay down on his vomit during the crunches and vomitted while doing push ups.. you meet all sorts of people...</p>
              <p>So my advice to you is to have a nice talk with ya section commander or your PC, bring along ya friends the one that you tried taking off his pants, and the one who was with ya.. and any others that are around at that time... go and see ya PC and relate to him what actually is happening....</p>
              <p>If everyone knows about that weird guy behavior... then it is going to be fine, because everyone know he is weird and funny... but if everyone trust him then i think you will have to get ready...</p>
              <p>But I seriously think that nothing will happen to you unless ya are charged with masturbating</p>

              <p>Based on what you said, it doesn't seem serious to me. What is the formal charge/grounds for the investigation?</p>
              <p>My guess is that your RSM just bluffing you to flex his rank, esp when you (and your batch) is about to ORD. So just stay cool and wait to see if the RSM does bring it up to formal investigation.</p>

              <p>If a matter is under investigation, do not disclose the details of the investigation.</p>
              <p>And secondly, there is a likelihood that Kilfer is right, and that its just a bluff.</p>
              <p>However, in any case, better to go chain of command before you seek external advice.</p>
