              <p>yes,platoon commander  get shot dead and followed by suicide of recruit by a bullet thru  the head.</p>
              <p>For roundhouse kick to the knee,i think its called bullying.as a man i suggest the 2 dudes who have problems put gloves and fight in a boxing ring for a few hours with everyone watching.because normally if u break someones knee in camp next thing would be the other person end in a coma for a few years.</p>
              <p>i have come across south korean marine and south korean special force folks in the past along with other south korean army people.they were all ok.pretty much like any singaporean.</p>
              <p>in all army camps be it in the usa or sporean or korean army,u would sometimes find a bully or a few of them.</p>
              <p>and what and why does a soldier need to slap?they should punch like real men.i only expect a girl to slap me when im.......too horny.so slapping actually gives a wrong message to a guy.</p>

              <p>What happens if the junior soldier returns the senior soldier's slaps and kicks? Will he be found guilty?</p>
              <p>And do you guys really make soldiers stand on their heads?</p>
              <p>The worst we have on a daily basis are senior conscripts hiding out on their duties with the connivance of career soldiers, leaving the burden to junior soldiers. it happens especially when the junior conscripts are more educated than the senior ones and the career soldiers.</p>

              <p>Soldiers are charged for revealing abuse or any complaints to external party under the pretext of "leaking military secrets". This is the army's way to keep dirty secrets within the army.</p>

              <p>Well.. I'm living in South Korea of course. Few privileged North Koreans </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>can have access to the internet.. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course, some Korean soldiers do punch his junior soldiers in the </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>stomach.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The junior soldier's counterattacking is usually unimaginable.. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, some unique guys do retaliate by shooting their senior </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>soldiers and officers. Every Korean soldier is armed with a rifle </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and two grenades.. The result of that retaliation is of course </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I've seen plenty of that in Korean movies, it's outrageous. The stuff that set Korean soldiers apart seem to be: standing on your head, standing post without moving, pointing every available weapon at a target, even if the target is an aircraft and your weapon is a rifle, and being significantly more professional than your commanders.</p>
              <p>In all other things I have great respect for the ROK military.</p>

              <p>Anyway in Singapore, nobody in the right mind except those "extreme-mind" will try to commit an offence while serving in the Singapore Armed Force. This is mostly because just like in school day where you will have an report book to update your marks and conduct for "improvement", those Singaporean who service national service also know that at the end of their service, once the unit clearance form is signed by every military and admin staff in the department for "unknown" reason to ensure you return the camp belonging like access pass to them, an certificate of service will also be issue to us where inside the certificate it will stated your conduct and performance in either "positive" or "negative" by the overall commanding officer.</p>
              <p>This is where the seriously or harsh reality come in if you are charged with an "criminal" offence in army and found gulity, this  certificate of service will reflected on your behaviour, and even if you get discharged from "early" than normal period of national service from misconduct (not cause harm to other of course) like AWOL or bring handphone camera and taking photo of fooling aroound of "pretending" to use rife to shoot yourself , and this certifcate will be just like an label on your forehead that you are an emo bully or an slacker.</p>
              <p>Not only that, if you want to find an job especially in Singapore, mostly of the employer would require you to produce your certificate of service as an evidence that you have completed your service to nation.As mention above, if your conduct is poorly stated on the certificate, you might already guess whether you can get an professional job in the end, if you are lucky, maybe you can end up as an cleaner, road sweeper or toilet cleaner, if you know what is best for yourself or in other words what consequence of commiting an offence will led to and if you care about your future, you didn't try to act anything risky like an retard ruffian call Naruto the pang sai.And I am sure it the same logic in any society</p>
              <p>Finally I think the only complain for the national service which I am not sure if it is the same as in korea are (I would not mention our founding father of course) under 2 year of national service, the NS men were poorly pay and had to endure "physical" hardship like change into your uniform in an very short time and fall in,route march, drink whole bottle of water etc (known as water parade in Singapore), therefore if there is any area of comfort, they are mostly likely not to create trouble, e.g, it is well-known fact that in Navy, for those personal who are off-duty, they are allow to watch DVD video in an resting area and even play Playstation game inside the ship, or if their officer would organised activities like having an paint-gun battle or an golfing session for their unit.<span style='font-size: 11pt; font-family: "Tahoma","sans-serif"; color: #0f243e;'> </span></p>
              <p>And not to forget, anther famous complaint from fellow singaporean are during their army days mostly likely they will lose their girlfriend if they found a new "interest" in their working place, or after they completed their service, they find themselves lose out in term of career promotion in the corporate world where foreigner or "little" girl younger than you get an senior position and order you around. Is this the same situation as well in Korea, Mr  Daeho0228 ?</p>

              <p>I'm glad to know what people in other countries think of mine, and often find it better or worse than reality.</p>
              <p>In this case I think Lee's propaganda machine has been very successful. Singapore has not only bankrupted political opponents but detained them indefinitely through the Internal Security Act. The longest was detained for 37 years. Last year our Home Ministry revealed for the first time that more than 2000 people have been detained without trial. This law has not been exercised of late, but the Government has indicated it will remain on the books for future use. By contrast, the days of your KCIA ended a long time ago. Kim Dae Jung became President only one term after Korea's transition to democracy, preceded by another opposition leader. This is unthinkable in Singapore. Our electoral system is theoretically democratic but loaded with built-in advantages.</p>
              <p>What irks me the most is how the Government sees fit to play God with every aspect of our lives. Nothing is sacrosanct, from how many years we work to pay for a government flat of a size decided by the government to what we may study in school to how many immmigrants we share our country with to what the sole newspaper reports. Non-compliance is either illegal or very expensive. At one time, long hair or western styles were illegal.</p>
              <p>Thanks to government intervention, we remain a much less mature democracy, unware of the exercise of our rights and responsibilities.</p>

              <p><span>Beating the bully is quite unimaginable.. Koreans are so much used to</span></p>
              <p><span>physical violence.. They just think being punched in the stomach or</span></p>
              <p><span>kicked in the knee is something not unexpected especially in the armed</span></p>
              <p><span>forces.. The Korean marine who shot his senior soldier and was</span></p>
              <p><span>sentenced to death did that because his senior soldier set fire to his</span></p>
              <p><span>bible saying, "I'm your senior soldier. So I am greater than Jesus."</span></p>
              <p><span>As the marine was a pious Christian and got mad.. So he opened fire</span></p>
              <p><span>on his senior soldier and threw grenades into the barracks..</span></p>
              <p><span>Well.. Ok I see. Then I can call him His Excellency Senator</span></p>
              <p><span>Lee Kuan Yew then..</span></p>
              <p><span>I still think he is quite a benign leader..</span></p>
              <p><span>General Chun, one of Korea's military dictators, killed more than 5000</span></p>
              <p><span>people in Chunnam province because they protested against Kim Dae</span></p>
              <p><span>Jung's being sentenced to death..</span></p>
              <p><span>Yes.. imprisoning many people is by no means a good deed..</span></p>
              <p><span>Nevertheless i still think it's much better than airdropping Special</span></p>
              <p><span>Operation Forces in Chunnam province and ordering them to kill</span></p>
              <p><span>anyone they saw..</span></p>
              <p><span>You say His Excellency Senator Lee put many people in jail..</span></p>
              <p><span>However, was any of them tortured? Korean dictators, especially</span></p>
              <p><span>Generals Park and Chun imprisoned much more people.. and most</span></p>
              <p><span>of them were tortured.. A typical Interrogator usually put his prisoner's</span></p>
              <p><span>head into a basin full of water making the prisoner unable to breathe..</span></p>
              <p><span>Some of them were practically castrated by being tortured</span></p>
              <p><span>electronically.. Can you even imagine what being tortured</span></p>
              <p><span>ellectronically is? Chun Sang Byung, a Korean poet was an infertile</span></p>
              <p><span>man because he was neutered electronically when he was imprisoned..</span></p>
              <p><span>Moreover female prisoners were tortured sexually.. I am unable to describe</span></p>
              <p><span>how they were tortured because that's so very obscene..</span></p>
              <p><span>That's why we Koreans think His Excellency Senator Lee is such a great</span></p>
              <p><span>leader.. You know what? The incumbent president of South Korea, Lee</span></p>
              <p><span>Myung Bak proudly showed a photo he took with His Excellency Senator</span></p>
              <p><span>Lee when he was running for president. Many Koreans voted for Lee Myung</span></p>
              <p><span>Bak because they saw the photo in which Lee Myung Bak and His Excellency</span></p>
              <p><span>Senator Lee were shaking hands smiling..</span></p>
              <p><span>Lee Myung Bak's predecessor, an ex human rights activist Roh Moo Hyun</span></p>
              <p><span>frequently quoted from His Excellency Senator Lee's memoirs during his</span></p>
              <p><span>debate with president candidates.. He was elected as president because</span></p>
              <p><span>so many Koreans agreed with his quotations from His Excellency Senator Lee..</span></p>
              <p><span>President Roh Moo Hyun even mimicked His Excellency Senator Lee by</span></p>
              <p><span>sueing many newspapers for defamation..</span></p>
              <p><span>In my view, Singapore is just like a grocery store that sells only apples..</span></p>
              <p><span>It's true that you can buy only apples(meaning the PAP cadidates) at the</span></p>
              <p><span>grocery store.. Anyways, all the apples are good... fresh, sweet and fragrant..</span></p>
              <p><span>South Korea is a grocery store that sells apples, pears and durians..</span></p>
              <p><span>The problem is that all the fruits in the grocery store are rotten.. Even</span></p>
              <p><span>apples in the store smell just like durians and the durians there smell</span></p>
              <p><span>even worse..</span></p>
              <p><span>Former president Roh Moo Hyun commited suicide by jumping off a</span></p>
              <p><span>cliff because he was about to be prosecuted for corruption..</span></p>
              <p><span>Presidents Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo were all imprisoned..</span></p>
              <p><span>President Park, also known as Takagi Masao, didn’t go to jail because</span></p>
              <p><span>he was assassinated by his henchman before he was sent to jail..</span></p>
              <p><span>That’s why I say South Korea is a grocery store at which only</span></p>
              <p><span>rotten fruits are available..</span></p>
              <p>&lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;</p>
              <p><span>Korean soldiers are equally underpaid and they usually split up with</span></p>
              <p><span>their girlfriends while they’re doing military service. Usually draft</span></p>
              <p><span>dodgers and black haired foreigners(meaning Koreans who have</span></p>
              <p><span>American or Canadian Citizenship) have fun with their girlfriends..</span></p>
              <p><span>A good example of those people who are allegedly draft dodgers</span></p>
              <p><span>is Park Hae Jin.. He got exemption from doing military service</span></p>
              <p><span>because he claimed that he was suffering from schizophrenia.</span></p>
              <p><span>Maybe he was really a lunatic.. However, he seems to be perfectly</span></p>
              <p><span>ok on TV.. He’s an actor..I heard many American Soldiers</span></p>
              <p><span>in Afghanistan and Iraq are suffering from psychiatric problems but</span></p>
              <p><span>still doing their job taking medicines such as Prozac.. Maybe he’s a</span></p>
              <p><span>lunatic but he doesn’t seem to be bad enough to be exempted</span></p>
              <p><span>from doing military service..</span></p>
              <p><span>Most Koreans suppose he must have bribed doctors to get exemption</span></p>
              <p><span>from military service.. Corruption and bribery are everywhere in South</span></p>
              <p><span>Korea.. So their doubt is not totally unfounded I think..</span></p>
              <p><span>Unlike Singapore, in which every singaporean son has to do military</span></p>
              <p><span>service, South Korea is a country in which every korean son whose</span></p>
              <p><span>parents are rich enough to bribe doctors don’t have to do military</span></p>
              <p><span>service.. For some mysterious reason, few congressmen and cabinet</span></p>
              <p><span>members in Korea did military service and even fewer of their sons</span></p>
              <p><span>did military service.</span></p>
              <p><span>A good example of black haired foreigners is Tablo the singer..</span></p>
              <p><span>He was born to Korean parents in Korea, lived and is living in Korea..</span></p>
              <p><span>He is a singer in Korea but a nobody in Canada. He earns money</span></p>
              <p><span>in Korea but spends money in Canada.. Anyways he’s a Canadian..</span></p>
              <p><span>He married a Korean actress.. I presume she may have had a</span></p>
              <p><span>boyfriend who was doing military service.. And I suppose</span></p>
              <p><span>she’ll give birth to another Canadian who has the same rights</span></p>
              <p><span>as all other Koreans but has no duties such as military service..</span></p>

              <p><br>and thats why u koreans have a tough time in the army.no one ever fights back and wins.thats why u needed the united nations to fight the war for u back in 1950s and the americans till today.why?because u folks arent serious.</p>
              <p>trying to say a despot from another country is great is not going to help people from getting bullied in and out of the army.takes all sorts.</p>
