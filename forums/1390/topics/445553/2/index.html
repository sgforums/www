              <p><span>Beating the bully is quite unimaginable.. Koreans are so much used to</span></p>
              <p><span>physical violence.. They just think being punched in the stomach or</span></p>
              <p><span>kicked in the knee is something not unexpected especially in the armed</span></p>
              <p><span>forces.. The Korean marine who shot his senior soldier and was</span></p>
              <p><span>sentenced to death did that because his senior soldier set fire to his</span></p>
              <p><span>bible saying, "I'm your senior soldier. So I am greater than Jesus."</span></p>
              <p><span>As the marine was a pious Christian and got mad.. So he opened fire</span></p>
              <p><span>on his senior soldier and threw grenades into the barracks..</span></p>
              <p><span>Well.. Ok I see. Then I can call him His Excellency Senator</span></p>
              <p><span>Lee Kuan Yew then..</span></p>
              <p><span>I still think he is quite a benign leader..</span></p>
              <p><span>General Chun, one of Korea's military dictators, killed more than 5000</span></p>
              <p><span>people in Chunnam province because they protested against Kim Dae</span></p>
              <p><span>Jung's being sentenced to death..</span></p>
              <p><span>Yes.. imprisoning many people is by no means a good deed..</span></p>
              <p><span>Nevertheless i still think it's much better than airdropping Special</span></p>
              <p><span>Operation Forces in Chunnam province and ordering them to kill</span></p>
              <p><span>anyone they saw..</span></p>
              <p><span>You say His Excellency Senator Lee put many people in jail..</span></p>
              <p><span>However, was any of them tortured? Korean dictators, especially</span></p>
              <p><span>Generals Park and Chun imprisoned much more people.. and most</span></p>
              <p><span>of them were tortured.. A typical Interrogator usually put his prisoner's</span></p>
              <p><span>head into a basin full of water making the prisoner unable to breathe..</span></p>
              <p><span>Some of them were practically castrated by being tortured</span></p>
              <p><span>electronically.. Can you even imagine what being tortured</span></p>
              <p><span>ellectronically is? Chun Sang Byung, a Korean poet was an infertile</span></p>
              <p><span>man because he was neutered electronically when he was imprisoned..</span></p>
              <p><span>Moreover female prisoners were tortured sexually.. I am unable to describe</span></p>
              <p><span>how they were tortured because that's so very obscene..</span></p>
              <p><span>That's why we Koreans think His Excellency Senator Lee is such a great</span></p>
              <p><span>leader.. You know what? The incumbent president of South Korea, Lee</span></p>
              <p><span>Myung Bak proudly showed a photo he took with His Excellency Senator</span></p>
              <p><span>Lee when he was running for president. Many Koreans voted for Lee Myung</span></p>
              <p><span>Bak because they saw the photo in which Lee Myung Bak and His Excellency</span></p>
              <p><span>Senator Lee were shaking hands smiling..</span></p>
              <p><span>Lee Myung Bak's predecessor, an ex human rights activist Roh Moo Hyun</span></p>
              <p><span>frequently quoted from His Excellency Senator Lee's memoirs during his</span></p>
              <p><span>debate with president candidates.. He was elected as president because</span></p>
              <p><span>so many Koreans agreed with his quotations from His Excellency Senator Lee..</span></p>
              <p><span>President Roh Moo Hyun even mimicked His Excellency Senator Lee by</span></p>
              <p><span>sueing many newspapers for defamation..</span></p>
              <p><span>In my view, Singapore is just like a grocery store that sells only apples..</span></p>
              <p><span>It's true that you can buy only apples(meaning the PAP cadidates) at the</span></p>
              <p><span>grocery store.. Anyways, all the apples are good... fresh, sweet and fragrant..</span></p>
              <p><span>South Korea is a grocery store that sells apples, pears and durians..</span></p>
              <p><span>The problem is that all the fruits in the grocery store are rotten.. Even</span></p>
              <p><span>apples in the store smell just like durians and the durians there smell</span></p>
              <p><span>even worse..</span></p>
              <p><span>Former president Roh Moo Hyun commited suicide by jumping off a</span></p>
              <p><span>cliff because he was about to be prosecuted for corruption..</span></p>
              <p><span>Presidents Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo were all imprisoned..</span></p>
              <p><span>President Park, also known as Takagi Masao, didn’t go to jail because</span></p>
              <p><span>he was assassinated by his henchman before he was sent to jail..</span></p>
              <p><span>That’s why I say South Korea is a grocery store at which only</span></p>
              <p><span>rotten fruits are available..</span></p>
              <p>&lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;</p>
              <p><span>Korean soldiers are equally underpaid and they usually split up with</span></p>
              <p><span>their girlfriends while they’re doing military service. Usually draft</span></p>
              <p><span>dodgers and black haired foreigners(meaning Koreans who have</span></p>
              <p><span>American or Canadian Citizenship) have fun with their girlfriends..</span></p>
              <p><span>A good example of those people who are allegedly draft dodgers</span></p>
              <p><span>is Park Hae Jin.. He got exemption from doing military service</span></p>
              <p><span>because he claimed that he was suffering from schizophrenia.</span></p>
              <p><span>Maybe he was really a lunatic.. However, he seems to be perfectly</span></p>
              <p><span>ok on TV.. He’s an actor..I heard many American Soldiers</span></p>
              <p><span>in Afghanistan and Iraq are suffering from psychiatric problems but</span></p>
              <p><span>still doing their job taking medicines such as Prozac.. Maybe he’s a</span></p>
              <p><span>lunatic but he doesn’t seem to be bad enough to be exempted</span></p>
              <p><span>from doing military service..</span></p>
              <p><span>Most Koreans suppose he must have bribed doctors to get exemption</span></p>
              <p><span>from military service.. Corruption and bribery are everywhere in South</span></p>
              <p><span>Korea.. So their doubt is not totally unfounded I think..</span></p>
              <p><span>Unlike Singapore, in which every singaporean son has to do military</span></p>
              <p><span>service, South Korea is a country in which every korean son whose</span></p>
              <p><span>parents are rich enough to bribe doctors don’t have to do military</span></p>
              <p><span>service.. For some mysterious reason, few congressmen and cabinet</span></p>
              <p><span>members in Korea did military service and even fewer of their sons</span></p>
              <p><span>did military service.</span></p>
              <p><span>A good example of black haired foreigners is Tablo the singer..</span></p>
              <p><span>He was born to Korean parents in Korea, lived and is living in Korea..</span></p>
              <p><span>He is a singer in Korea but a nobody in Canada. He earns money</span></p>
              <p><span>in Korea but spends money in Canada.. Anyways he’s a Canadian..</span></p>
              <p><span>He married a Korean actress.. I presume she may have had a</span></p>
              <p><span>boyfriend who was doing military service.. And I suppose</span></p>
              <p><span>she’ll give birth to another Canadian who has the same rights</span></p>
              <p><span>as all other Koreans but has no duties such as military service..</span></p>
              <p>&lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;</p>
              <p><span>To sum up, You Singaporeans should be proud of your leaders, especially</span></p>
              <p><span>His Excellency Senator Lee Kuan Yew. If His Excellency Senator Lee</span></p>
              <p><span>were to run for president here in South Korea.. I’m sure he will win by</span></p>
              <p><span>a landslide. If Koreans are able to vote for any of the PAP candidates,</span></p>
              <p><span>they surely will do so because all other candidates are incompetent,</span></p>
              <p><span>corrupt and unscrupulous.</span></p>

              <p><span>A good example of those people who are allegedly draft dodgers</span></p>
              <p><span>is Park Hae Jin.. He got exemption from doing military service</span></p>

              <p><span>Most Koreans suppose he must have bribed doctors to get exemption</span></p>

              <p><span>Korea.. So their doubt is not totally unfounded I think..</span></p>
              <p><span>Unlike Singapore, in which every singaporean son has to do military</span></p>

              <p><span>did military service.</span></p>
              <p><span>A good example of black haired foreigners is Tablo the singer..</span></p>

              <p><span>He married a Korean actress.. I presume she may have had a</span></p>
              <p><span>boyfriend who was doing military service.. And I suppose</span></p>
              <p><span>she’ll give birth to another Canadian who has the same rights</span></p>
              <p><span>as all other Koreans but has no duties such as military service..</span></p>

              <p>Hi, you mean in Korea 's army, if an soldier is incompetent said for example he is an lousy shooter, he can still bribe his way to get top markmanship performance ? And do korean men lose out in career advancement after they finished serving the army ? Still I resumed that basic welfare will be given to your people like medical, insurance or maybe some leisure activities like the playstation game for break time etc. Also if it an korea 's minister 's son will to serve in the army, will they given special treatment like extra break time or maybe their senior sergeant carry his army bag for him things like that ? <img id="yui_3_2_0_13_132686938429250" src="http://mail.yimg.com/ok/u/assets/img/emoticons/emo29.gif" alt=":)) laughing"></p>

              <p>Daeho, I think Korea has a fearsome military in part from such practices, but it would be better if senior soldiers did not treat their soldiers' loyalty as limitless.</p>
              <p>Correct me if I'm wrong, I think the behaviour of senior soldiers is something they learnt in school, and is a reason some Korean girls prefer Koreans of foreign nationality.</p>
              <p>And I've always wanted to know about Chunnam. Precious little is written in English. What was the true number of dead and missing? Is it true that paratroopers from the northern and central provinces were chosen for their antipathy towards people of the south? Or did they massacre their countrymen out of blind obedience, being told they were all communists?</p>

              <p>Thanks for the info. I indeed have read chapters of this book before.</p>
              <p>I think our Singapore system has produced good results before, but because we can have only apples, we cannot change them when the apples go bad. Our leaders have been neglecting our country of late, they have closed their ears for too long and only awoken at the year's elections. The upcry was that life has been getting worse and in large part due to their conscious action. Of our three leaders I must accord Lee Senior the most credit, I would credit Goh with only a weak continuation of his course of action. Lee Junior has done better than Goh, and has been more liberal, but has inherited most of the problems stewed on Goh's watch. Goh denied our country continued investment but the costs became apparent only after he stepped down.</p>
              <p>Lee Senior has fists of iron but had somewhat functioning ears. Goh has somewhat softer fists, but his ears are airtight.</p>
              <p>I have this personal theory about the soldiers in Chunnam being slapped around for two years, "paying back" what they saw as a bunch of arrogant college students. Far from being communist, to the soldiers the students represented everything about upper class society.</p>

              <p>Thank you Mr Daeho0228 for your informative reply, anyway to keep this thread alive, I would shared with you some insight of our Singapore Armed Force and maybe we will see if there are any similar in Korean armed force :</p>
              <p>1) Most singaporen if they decided to sign on to SAF, the most important reason is because of good salary. (Through I would not agreed with the work scope) Link : <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/careers/job_opportunities/io/officer/salaryscale.html">http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/careers/job_opportunities/io/officer/salaryscale.html</a><br>and this does not included the overtime done on guard duty etc. And for people who want to further your university study, there is an SAF Scholarship for them which they have to sign bond/contract and served their unit for about 6 years : <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/content/imindef/careers/scholarships/scholarships/SAFOS.html">http://www.mindef.gov.sg/content/imindef/careers/scholarships/scholarships/SAFOS.html</a> Because for those singaporean who signed on either because of salary or scholarship, they have an "common" mindset that their choice is part of climbling their career ladder, so they would "try" not do anything that jeopardize their future, didn't your country have similar monetary/work as you study reward to attact talent to the army, especially facing the threat from the north ?</p>
              <p>2) During my NS day, I observed that only homosexual/gay recruit are the one that are commonly being "pushed" and been tease of. For example I have seem recruits who march back to their room (not from my unit) , some rascal push one sissy recruit back to hurry "him" up for the march. In korea, any interesting similar case happen to the gay as well? Didn't tell me they get beaten as well?</p>
              <p>3) In Singapore where girl didn't have to do National Service. I think because of curiosity that why singapore girl want to sign on the Singapore Armed Forced to experience what is army 's life whether is it fun or "adventurous", usually nothing negative had been heard from them being "bully". In fact their physical exercise and test is much more relaxed than boys, and since they are considered to be "extraordinary" to take up the challenge of SAF as their career, the ladies' SAF personnel are always well-respected and most possibly they will be featured in the media or newspaper. Is this the same phenomenon as for the korean girls that they shared the same interest to join army cos I cannot imagine what will happen to Jessica Jung (one of the vocalist of Girl Generation) if she choose to sign on korean army for "adventurous or patriot" reason instead of pursue an entertainment career. Even if there are korean lady who really wanted to join army or police force just as in the movie "My Girlfriend Is An Agent", would they be well respect in their fields and free from violence ? (No offence to girls).</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>
