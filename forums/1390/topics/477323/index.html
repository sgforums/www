              <p>Second Generation Permanent Residents are required to go through 
                  compulsory full-time national service as well as reservist duties after 
                  they have completed their full-time national service and turns 
                  operationally-ready (ORD).</p>
              <p>Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen stated in Parliament that between 
                  2006 to 2011, about 8,800 males who had become permanent residents under
                   the sponsorship of their parents were enlisted for and served National 
                  Service (NS). On the other hand, 4,200 males who had become permanent 
                  residents under the sponsorship of their parents renounced their PR 
                  status prior to serving national service.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_service_in_Singapore#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> Their failure to serve NS will be taken into account to have adverse 
                  impact when they subsequently apply to study/ work/ visit/ travel in 
                  Singapore. These ex-PRs were sternly warned about the dire consequences 
                  of their actions at the point of renunciation.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_service_in_Singapore#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>After completing full-time national service, they are eligible to 
                  apply for Singapore citizenship. However, citizenship is not guaranteed 
                  for all applicants, as there are certain criteria that must be met such 
                  as educational qualification, income qualification and NS work 
                  performance/ conduct appraisal in the NS Certificate of Service upon 
                  ORD. From 2006 to 2010, about 2% of 3,000 Second Generation Permanent 
                  Residents who completed full-time national service and applied for 
                  Singapore citizenship were rejected.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_service_in_Singapore#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>If the person does not hold Singapore citizenship but still holds 
                  Singapore permanent residency, he is still required to serve the service
                   requirement, i.e. reservist duties after he turns operationally-ready.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_service_in_Singapore#cite_note-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Singapore Permanent Residents who served national service but did not
                   acquire Singapore citizenship will be treated equally to those 
                  permanent residents without service obligation; they would not have 
                  access to the privileges granted to Singapore citizens.</p>

              Hello Gerard. 
              
              You can apply with the SAF once you are a Singaporean. I admire your inspiration. However, you have a long journey before you can make your dream come true to become a serviceman of the SAF. You have to become a PR first in Singapore and then the second step is to apply for Singapore Citizenship. This application is not under SAF jurisdiction. You have to go to ICA to apply for these status.
              
              In the past, I had a colleague from Perak state serving in the same SAF Unit with me serving full-time NS. He was about 25 years old and he was a PR. What happened was he told me that he was offered a Singapore Citizenship by the Singapore Government but he needed to serve full-time NS before he could become a Singaporean. However, this policy has changed now. You can still be on PR status after full time NS, its optional to the individual whether to remain as a PR or become a Singaporean.
              
              My advise, why not you finish your study first. Then find work here. Apply for PR status and then maybe you can consider approaching the SAF regarding about your dream to make SAF as your professional career.
              
              Good Luck to you Gerard.

              <p>Under the Enlistment Act, all male Singapore Citizens and Permanent 
                      Residents, unless exempted, are liable to register for National Service 
                      (NS). Following the completion of full-time NS, they will be required to
                       serve up to 40 days of Operationally Ready National Service (ORNS) per 
                      year for the duration of their ORNS training cycle till the age of 50 
                      years (for officers) or 40 years (for other ranks).<br> <br> Male children who are granted 
                      PR status under their parents' sponsorship are liable for NS under the 
                      Enlistment Act. They are required to register for NS upon reaching 16½ 
                      years old and will be scheduled for enlistment at the earliest 
                      opportunity upon reaching 18 years old. If they are pursuing full-time 
                      studies, deferment from full-time NS may be granted only if they meet 
                      the deferment conditions stipulated by the Ministry of Defence which can
                       be found at <a href="http://www.ns.sg/">www.ns.sg</a>. All
                       NS-liable males aged 13 years old and above, are required to obtain an 
                      Exit Permit (EP) when travelling overseas for 3 months or more.</p>
              <p>NS-liable PRs are expected to serve NS. Renouncing or losing one's PR
                       status without serving or completing full-time NS would have an adverse
                       impact on any immediate or future applications to work or study in 
                      Singapore, or for Singapore citizenship or PR status.<br> <br> Males who are granted Singapore PR, and who were previously Singapore 
                      Citizens or Singapore Permanent Residents, are liable to be called up 
                      for NS regardless of the type of PR status they have been granted. For

I visited this Nanyang city once only in 2009 to instantly fell in love at first sight with this Lion City.

              recognise National Servicemen in light of continued immigration and
              the need to preserve a Singapore core. In recent months, members of
              the public have responded to the news by calling for greater
              monetary incentives, including subsidies for transport, education
              and health, and time-off to rest after reservist in-camp
              training.</p>
              <p>Over the next six months, Singaporeans will be asked for
              feedback on how to beef up National Service.</p>
              <p>The Committee to Strengthen National Service, announced in
              March, will lead focus group discussions and town hall sessions
              while also conducting online consultation sessions via a new
              website, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/strengthenNS/index.html">www.strengthenNS.sg</a></p>
              <p>The Committee meeting for the first time today, expects its work
              to be done within a year.</p>
              <p>Made up of 20 members, including Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen,
              Members of Parliament,military top brass and private sector
              employers, the committee will use the feedback gathered to
              recommend measures to enhance National Service as a critical
              institution for Singapore's continued survival and success.</p>
              <p>The measures are meant to motivate servicemen to give their best
              in serving, help them balance their duties with family and work
              commitments, enhance support from families, companies, new citizens
              and the broader community, and promote recognition of servicemen's
              efforts.</p>
