              <p>After posted to my company in 5SIR, he started complaining this and that, saying he's too good to be a rifleman. We got fed up with him...eventually put him to be armskote assistant. And he got abused by the whole company :p</p>

              <p>this is what i feel, may not be true: any vocation that has empty slots will be filled up by eligible soldiers. Performance both in and out of BMT counts for nuts, they will post you to whatever units that require manpower. To me, eligibility is more than performance, i feel that human psyche and family background(security clearance) is more impt in determining who gets into which formation/vocation. Basically, its luck, where you get posted to, after you've met the eligibility criteria. I also feel CMPB's computer aptitude test play an impt part.</p>
              <p>Since your posting order states RIFLEMAN, i guess you got no chance to join support company liao, cos the vocation/job scope of support coy is more in-depth than being labelled as RIFLEMAN. It's true to an extent that support coy only takes in Tekong's PTEs. Maybe SIR got ppl OOC from their own BMT, that's why you are selected(you might think that you are unlucky?) to fill up the hole. That's the only logical explanation.</p>
              <p>well, army is about meeting people with diverse background. you will learn more about the army as you go along :)</p>
              <p>please take care!!</p>
