            <div class='col-md body'>The initial 3-year-3-month stint at the Kranji DBs is common knowledge, but JWs being exempted from reservist seem to be an urban legend. I can't verify this myself but, from a fairly influential outside source (US Department of State report), it says that:<br><br>"The initial sentence for failure to comply with the military service requirement is 15 months' imprisonment, to which 24 months are added upon a second refusal. Subsequent failures to perform required annual military reserve duty result in 40-day sentences; a 12-month sentence is usual after four such refusals."<br><br>http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2003/24320.htm<br></div>
