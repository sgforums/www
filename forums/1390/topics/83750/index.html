            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, because you excused 40 days, it really depend what you do or did not do in BMT that will determine whether you pass BMT.<br><br>As you may now know or dunno. IPPT, Range and IFC are not veto factor in passing BMT anymore.<br><br>What MO is trying to do is maybe during BMT time you participate in all activities regardless if you pass tests. This way you NEED NOT repeat BMT.<br><br>If you OOT/OOC in midst of BMT you WILL re-BMT.<br><br>There are 3 outcomes from BMT.<br><br>Completed BMT (passed all test + IPPT, SOC, IFC) = met all requirements and eligible for leadership training (OCS/SISPEC).<br><br>Attended BMT (pass some, failed some, failed at least 1 of 3 in IPPT, SOC, IFC but overall 75% attendance of all lessons) = NEED NOT repeat BMT, not eligible for Commander. And block leave burned.<br><br>RE-BMT = poor attendance and attitude towards BMT training. WILL REPEAT BMT.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ah-soh, think you would have booked in by now... but anyway...<br><br>just to let you konw that you may request not to be OOT'ed but excuse yourself from SOC/IPPT.<br><br>But if it is physical activity that is hurting your back and stuff, then suggest you downgrade. However, it most probably mean PES C recourse.<br><br>It's better to take part moderately in your current Enhanced BMT if you can take it.<br><br>If you really want to konw more.. talk to your PC...  or PM me... there are many ways around this thing. Worse to happen is they OOT you when you needn;t have to and later suffer in recourse.<br><br>In recourse BMT, it isn't a really fun experience as they are less forgiving for they assume you know SAF rules by now. And you tend to be mixed with a greater variety of ppl.</div>
