              <p>not all forumers are young kids (w/o even go thru NS).. i had even completed my reservist cycle... ( received my watch from SAF for the years of service and appreciation ).</p>
              <p>that's why when you mentioned <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Private not eligible for reservist</span></strong>... (<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>this must be a joke</strong></span>).... maybe they have changed the policies... but it is impossible.... that's why even you wanted to dream about it.... ( i advice you not to dream ).. in every war games.. men are vital resources.</p>
