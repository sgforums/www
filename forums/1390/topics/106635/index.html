Let me add... So that you are better prepared...<br><br>30sce (aka Polar bear unit cause unit logo is polar bear -_-!) comprises of 5 main companies... Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta and Plant... You of course will be posted to plant... Plant has 4 platoons.... 1 to 3, and a company HQ...First, living conditions at 30sce is hell if you compare to tekong... so don expected much. Cupboards strink to half... bed strink 1/4 also... no more bouncy matress... no more big bunks... toilets have limited cubicles and spoiled doors(especially plant platoon 1 toilet... ( cause 99% you will go to plant platoon 1 after the basic course at delta... the current Plant platoon 1 ording soon... the timing just nice... ) showers have no doors... basically, everything is old.... old.... and old.... so prepare yourself for some cutural shock.... BUT... the food there is so damn superb though... definately one of the best around amongst the other camps...<br><br>As mention by mohanraj0085, you will first have to attend a combat engineer course at 30sce... most probably at delta coy... cause the recruits just POP last friday... ( get prepared... the Specs at delta is not that nice... reason because there's a few regulars there... even the nsfs specs seems garang...) But dont do anything funny, dont try any stunts, and you will be fine... Anyway... the Basic course (think its call CECC) is about 2 to 3 months long... tahan through that...<br><br>Next, you will go to Nee Soon Camp (PECG wing) for plant training... there, the living conditions revert back to tekong style... hahaha.... happy?<br><br>*going out liao... will continue when im free....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Next, you will go to Nee Soon Camp (PECG wing) for plant training... there, the living conditions revert back to tekong style... hahaha.... happy?<br><br>ok... am back...<br><br>the bad thing about nee soon camp's PECG wing is that it has too too too too many regulars... 4 - 5 first sergants... just imagine that.... all trying to impress the big boss... so just imagine the life there... oh... every meal over at nee soon will be followed by pull-ups beforehand...  take note... the first 3 weeks at PECG will be slack... all lectures... theories... about field plants.... (chainsaw, generator, water pump) and then heavy plants... (shover, bulldozers, excavater, compactor, JCB, Motor grader...) after that will be a bit siong.... cause the rest of the 7 to 8 weeks will be every day outfield.... dont panic first though... outfield is not physically siong... just sian...  you need to prepare stores... load stores... go there.... unload stores....stand in the hot sun... learn how to use the heavy plants...(this will be very interesting and fun.<br>considered a new skill aquired...).... through out the day... you and your mates will take turn operating the different machines...Point to note: outfield ends at 1600 - 1700 hrs daily... even before night falls.... because plants have limited operating hours.... hahaha... ask the field engineers what time they return from outfield... hahaha...so that provide amble time for you guys to wash up the stores... wash yourself up... and relax in the bunk.... *nights off will be few and rare once you go outfield.... might have some during the first 3 weeks...) so.... life at PECG is considered ok and acceptable.... once you complete the course and return to Plant Coy, the real fun starts...<br><br>[/b][/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Take it in the right spirit, lah. They normally push the drivers &amp; such vocation people harder when on course, exposing them to all conditions &amp; situations in order to master them. It'll be less stressful when you get to the unit, where your value is the acquired skill (which you'll be proficient in) &amp; you'll probably regale the peng with how so-&amp;-so was much tougher when on course!<br><br>As for sweat/dirt &amp; the overall blue-collar skill, it comes with the territory of a combat soldier.
