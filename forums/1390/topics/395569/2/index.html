              <p>kia,</p>
              <p>usa for thread starter he can go take flying license at any registered flying school in the usa.</p>
              <p>thread starter is almost about to complete his degree...another 2 years he can get his masters from the many universities there in the usa.its up to the thread starter on how resourceful he is in the usa.im sure the threadstarter is rich and resourceful otherwise he wuld be stuck in some 3rd world country where salary stinks big time.</p>
              <p>for $$$ making courses...there are aplenty in the usa.</p>
              <p>kengkia...i see u still need lobang even with all those internet in todays werld.i know about those even without the internet in the old days.its for u to find out and build your resourcefulness.....that cant be taught!</p>
              <p>lemme give u a tip on how to be resourceful...u dont eat.....u doint shit and u dont sleep until u get it. of course everyone is resourceful....i could get  the singapore army tons of processed beef cheap from australia if it wasnt for their red tape.  as from what djususkavili stated $5/meal!those kinda meal from SAF is only worth $2 at most.from me.they could get 500 grams of beef or pork($3...$.50 rice and bbq sauce n vegertables....$4.right now SAF food  seems to be like 100 grams strange meat($1.50)....20cents vege ...vomit sauce(free)</p>
              <p>if u had been a soldier ................u should already know the seriousness of resourcefulness as thats the difference between life and death.</p>
              <p>threadstarter should join the united states air force if he wants to be in the miitary without being in iraq often.</p>
              <p>anyway this thread is not to show how resourceful in getting a simple flying license...or applying for masters degree based on what u have in yer head .....or selling food to the pathetic singapore army menu.</p>
              <p>its about why u should come back and if so....why and what are u going to do there in spore in the future?</p>

              <p>Ok im just gonna clarify again that im not American. Far from it, Im Canadian. </p>
              <p>btw, i was reading stuff about PES faqs (i have a lot of time on my hands at the moment), and i'm still not too sure about a couple of things.</p>
              <p>a) when are you given your PES status? I thought IPPT is the first test that you do? </p>
              <p>b) would having an eyesight degree that requires you to wear glasses affect your PES status? And if so, say i get lasik eye surgery, which i am going to do (either before or after ns) will that improve my PES status (if affected by my eyesight~ its all that damn studying)?</p>

              <p>u sure u can run in the tropics????its really hot in singapore.....if u cant run a 4 mile run nonstop at recorded time which is 10 minutes......then that will be a hard time for u when u reach singapore.</p>
              <p>have u tested it at some nearby gym??i assure u singapores physical fittness training is a cross between the japanese imperial army mixed with the israeli system physical fittness level.....in some cases its more like special forces units in most armies.in my past basic trainings there....they made us do 1000 push ups in one hour...yes....1 hour!!!..and they are good  fast ones or we get to run 3 kilometres or more as group punishments by the hundreds of soldiers.....And thats for basic military training!try to see if u are able to do 500 pushups in one hour first in a sauna...and run around a football field 15 times in summer in one hour.they made most of us run 15 times around a football field and do 1000 proper pushups  at the same time in 60 minutes.thats basic military training in spore.if u can do that n badly need to come back to spore...then go ahead n come on back then......</p>
              <p>many have said they can pass the entire 3 mths basic military training.....some commited suicide within first few weeks.....some ended up heatstroke on the first day......half the platoon developed microcracks in various bones....some developed eye problems.....plus the fact that island training ground is reputated to be haunted doesnt help much in training a soldier for war.</p>

              <p>if u are from medical degree background....u will be posted to be a medical officer.  after that u might not do much in your units.despite your degree u will not be sent to any special unit with lower training or easier time.in the past there was one guy who had a medical degree in my comopany....think he was posted straight to navy unit as a medical officer.</p>
              <p>perhaps they would treasure u for your medical background....however there had been a recent suicide case where a foreign trained  well off medical  captain officer from  singapore military flew off to australia after AWOL in spore n killed himself in australia under some bridge. the reasons are still unacceptable and curiously strange on how n why he died.</p>
              <p>as u see....u are there just to get some kind of rank and uniform for 2 years only.u would simply be looking at sores.....flu..fever ....deep cuts....not much of anything else.for med schools...</p>
              <p>u should try to get exposure in the medical line in canada.dont waste the 2 years!!!!because if u do waste it......u may end up mainly issuing panadols  and referals to civilian doctors in spore hospitals who are more qualified than military doctors for most of your 2 years in spore ns.</p>

              <p>lol. well i dont have a med degree. its a life sciences degree, which is premed in canada. so tht sucks tht i wont be a MO. guess my life will be worse huh? i mean with 16 laps in 10min, thts like 30 sec per lap, i think only usain bolt can do tht. wow, no wonder singapore doesnt send all their NS men to the olympics, cuz they would wipe out the competition with their 30 second laps. 1000 pushups in 60min?! omg, thts ridiculous, thts like 17 pushups per minute. I think my cousins who went through NS only could do 17 pushups per hr. lol. A cross between the Jap and Isreali army? I guess thts why Singapore has the hidden rank of being the number 1 army in the world; with the Isreali army currently in the number 1 position.</p>
              <p>man, this sounds really tough, im gonna hit the gym today. thanks for the advice, i really didnt know how fit NS men were until now. They sound even fitter than the varsity guys in Queens. Man with those 1000 push-ups in 60min done consistently, i would expect every single Singaporean guy to bench at the very least 200pounds.</p>

              <p>whyisever,</p>
              <p>oops...i made a mistake...it should be 1.5miles in 10 minutes.converted wrongly !the rest are correct in their training methods.but they dont often force and yell at people to do 1000 pushups per hour as PT trainings.i had no idea why they made us run and do 1000 pushups in one hour.this are some of the stuff u wont get to read about anywhere.....u need to experience it physically oveer there!</p>
              <p>the push ups,runs and star jumps etc in one hour is correct for PT trainings.i remebered there were other stuff in that hour.....but all i rmebered was the running and 1000pushups which was agonising!asians arent really fond of sports...not the outdoor kind.after 1000 pushups no one  wants to do that again......its forced of course with yellings and punishment by physical training instructors in white shorts and shirts!</p>
              <p>their nonstop training schedules start from 5am to 6pm mon-fri.sat depending on your platoon.</p>
              <p>im not a terminator....i think my life could have been shortened by that training.</p>
              <p>the rest should be same as what yer dad described.</p>

              <p>yes its insane...some guys there complained too on why the physical training instructor forced is to that extent......entire pes b or pes a company.not obese pes but normal guys.</p>
              <p>there are even worse cases...</p>
              <p>its bullshit??maybe 16/f/lonely is a female and wont even go thru it.simple maths will tell you that a normal guy in ns will have to do 1 proper push up in 3 seconds....so 20 proper push ups will be 60 seconds.....</p>
              <p>and in 60 mins we would have been forced to do 60mins X20 push ups =1200push ups but it was noted by platoon commander and a few angry guys who went thru it.maybe my officer was made outa bullshit too??!!!his officer's sword must be encrusted with crap too trying to protect spore or whatever!!</p>
              <p>but we didnt do 1200 push ups.....we only did 1000push ups along with various running around the parade square ...so 200 push ups would be like an extra 10 mins....it takes around 1 min for guys to run  around a football field...so its probably accurate to say 1000 push ups and runnin 10 laps or so............i might as well say 16/f/lonely needs to brush up on her maths as its unremarkable.</p>
              <p>all i got to reward me  many years later are gals saying its bullshit...callin me to go and die....etc.i expected something like im sorry....could u describe it or something.....but nothing from sporean kids who hail from great sewer pipes and filthy canals!</p>
