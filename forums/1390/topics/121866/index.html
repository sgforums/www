ATRGHHH</div></blockquote>the idea of synchronised breathing is to make your breathing rhythmic, and follow your steps. so you should be comfortable with the breathing rather than forcing yourself into a certain rhythm. for starters, you may need to breathe quite frequently even though you have only run a short distance. but as you build up your fitness and endurance, you would be able to sustain longer distances with infrequent breaths, all the time still maintaining synchronisation between your breaths and your steps.<br><br>you would also need to get shoes that are fitting and comfortable, and socks to go with it.<br><br>and intersperse your 2.4 runs with longer distance endurance runs, and vary your routes and times and durations to make it more interesting.<br><br>sometimes you may even wish to add some challenge by adding weights to your legs or, as i have seen people do from time to time, carry a backpack while running.<br><br>njoy!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
