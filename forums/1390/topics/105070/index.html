            <div class='col-md body'>hi im new here.  been reading alot on the procurement of new equipments by the SAF and i have a question... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>lets say a NSF arty unit uses the primus hor.. then after they ORD and when they go back for ICT or mobilisation hor.. will they also still be using the Primus? if yes hor... does it mean that every reservist unit will use the same equipment they have train with during their nsf days? but wouldnt tat mean that the SAF will have to buy ALOT of new equipments every year for the new intakes because in the event of war everyone would have to have somthing to use? or would some older reservist units not get any equipment because ? if this is the case izzit the same for all other vocations?<br><br>any replies would be appreciated thanx. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not sure the 1st batch of Primus-trained gunners have even ORD'd yet - have they?

I myself joined another (IHL) unit after ORD, but my former NSF BN couldn't continue with the old M113 SP Mortars cuz they don't have it for reservist.

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm betting the Primus will become a service mainstay like the FH2000, if only cuz the former doesn't have enough detachment personnel to convert to other weapons (which need a bigger crew). IMO The Primus may also be the catalyst for a local mechanized - read: armour-based - division someday.<br><br>As for the Arty arsenal, sorry - only on a need to know basis. Try your luck asking at the next AOH, but no go on a message board. The most I'll hint is that a mortar battery has more weapons than a howitzer-gun one.<br><br></div>
