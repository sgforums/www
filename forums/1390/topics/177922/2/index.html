            <div class='col-md body'>I completely agree with Ah_Tee, this is exactly what i would tell anyone who wants to go through NS. The thing is the stupid guard duty thing. If u follow excatly what is written , u should not be doing any guard duty. Like me, i have never done any guard duty on tekong before and this is possible if u know how to stay low. A few more points to add on to the list by ah tee<br><br>1. forget about makng bosom buddies in BMT.They are only with u for at most 3 months.after POP, everyone will scatter like sand and communication will be futile. This is when the bastards will appear to try to get OCS. If u wan to survive BMT, look out for ur own safety and fuck everyone else. If u go around like mel gibson in we were soldiers, i tell u, ur name will be the first for sispec and other nonsense. Stay as low as possible.<br><br>2. Flunk ur SOC and SIT like mad but borderline pass ur ippt and marksman. If ur SOC is extremely fucked up, do u think they will send u to sispec where they train platoon leaders??at most u go SIR, but it is also quite lobo and not yet BMT. Of course if u go 2 sir then good luck to you.<br><br>3. Make use of the SAF hotline and PC interview to let them know of ur present situation. Say things like u miss ur girlfriend and that u wish to be a medic where u can learn life -saving skills and etc..Express ur desire to learn things and life will be better.<br><br>4. Be very careful of backstabbers. They can even be ur buddy so if they even try to play punk with you, play them back during the PC interview by saying that he wishes to go sispec or 2 sir. Be a bastard to those who bastard u discreetly and u can laugh when they get posted to sispec while u get posted to medic. the look on their faces was priceless. If u wan to sabo, sabo a few dun sabo the whole platoon<br><br>5.The best friends are found in your unit, learn who ur true friends are and u will sail through smoothly.<br><br>6.

Among the good things..Made lots of long term friends, Opened up my horizons and see how are things done. Learned to be independent and gained a lot of self confident.<br><br>Had ORDed many years ago, but once in a while, still have bad dreams of booking out, then reach home, open up bag or boot of car, find a M16 inside. dunno what to do with it. Wah... can still feel the stress in the dream, wake up in in cold sweat.

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree. BMT frens are good while Bmt lasts. The best frens you meet are in your unit coz you will be with them for the longest time.<br><br>Also, there is no stress or competition about going/not going to ocs,sispec or crap. If everyone there auto do their own work, it will be easy for everyone and life will not be bad. The better times are when u go into your unit so juz perserve past the training phase.</div>

But somehow, they will know when to buck up, and be cooperative, because if they don't, and they drag the whole platoon down, they will not only kenna confinement, extra duties etc, but the whole platoon will 'blanket party' that guy, or ignore him, making his NS life a living hell.<br><br>But generally, the tips to surviving BMT are really simple. Listen carefully, and do whatever u are told. NEVER try to talk back, but when possible, call SAF hotline and complain, but that's ONLY if u really cannot take it anymore. Usually, the 3rd sergeants, Platoon Commandeers are Poly/JC students who will go to Universities after ORD, and they will NOT want to do anything STUPID to kenna bad record, so they will treat u all as humanly as possible. But of course lah, they will scold vulgarities at u, but that is to be expected, so don't call SAF hotline just because they scold #$^%&amp;%&amp;% at u. The operator will probably laugh his/her head off, and ask u to f*** off too.<br><br>And be careful especially during range shooting, and grenade throwing, u don't want to walk in by urself and be carried out. Other than that, BMT is mostly about making u understand teamwork, cooperation, and racial harmony, and is a breeze.</div>

It was not that he was slack or anything, but because he was being an arsehole to everyone, and caused my platoon to have to run around the field at 9pm at night till 10 plus.</div>
