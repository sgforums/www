The hatred for NS can be seen very clearly for those who have gone thru a not so satisfying and fulfiling experience.<br><br>What i can say is, yes, not everyone will have the same experience...Be it the working style, the culture, the treatment, training..etc<br>But what can one do...To me, if the thoughts are all about negativity....then i guess you will defintely not have an enjoyable 2years...I will not talk about those great ideals of surving the nation and repaying them as i believe only one who believe in in will believe it..No point chaing their view...<br><br>To the vast mojority who feel that the 2years is a waste of time...At least go thru it happily..thats the least u can do...even for yourself...No point holding all the dissent and spreading it aroung like a disease...For the fortunate who would eventually have a good experience ( i believe there is )...Good luck to you...2years to be proud of and definetely a part of ur future memories..<br><br>To that chap who said all the cap abt what dun bother to make any frens...<br>Let me tell u thats not true..i made at least 3 or 4 frens that i dare say now will accompany me as time goes by...You only see real frens when the going is tough...Good luck guys</div>
