            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, Im 19 this year, think of going into army soon liao. Whenever I hear anything about NS, my heart will jump  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  I  have seen, heard whether if it froms media, TV shows or from friends, I found it very hard to accept that im gona go through all this. Even after all the while tat i know tat sooner or later guys have to go to NS. I felt insecured, worried and fear of the unknown in NS, the main object of fear is not the hardships but rather the complete lifestyle in which i hav ever face in life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Anyway I would like to ask if any pple who have went through NS before entering army itself hav this kind of fear jus like me? After u been through it do u realise that ur fear is not warranted like "Nah it is not as scary as it reali is" or " I served the army with constant fear all the time and hav no intention to go through it again"?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Jus wanna know wats ur thoughts and fear BEFORE entering and AFTER coming out is the same? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haha I just finished my BMT field camp, you can read about it in another topic.<br>physically NS is very tolerable i guess. I guess it may be tough at times but definitely not over the limit. Why? there are always weaker guys than you.<br>For me whenever I feel tired during route march I just look at the smaller guys in my platoon, those &lt;50kg who are carrying the same damn field pack, and I just feel much more energetic.<br><br>mentally? NS is definitely challenging. Gotta find your own motivation and direction and be independent. GOtta tell yourself it is worthwhile serving 2 years of shit while others continue their studies or work in higher paying jobs. gotta tell yourself ure doing it for the country. Gotta force yourself to do more so that your platoon mates can do less( or rather, do more even when your platoon mates decide to slack)<br><br>But of course im not the most experienced here, but these are my thoughts from a month-old recruit. As for tekhaning and one-one screwing by commanders, just remember that tough times dont last, tough men do. The only serious enough punishment you get is Detention in DB. unless you kill someone or intentionally steal stuff esp millitary equipment or go AWOL, you wont kena, lah.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NS is tough, maybe not as tough as before as some people like to complain, but still it is tough and suxs. Tekan for no reason and sometime you will feel, wtf am I  even doing here? You will feel many injustices and sometimes you cant really do anything about it. Some people also like to pull rank but just tell yourself once you are out of NS, so what if he is a warrant officer or captain or whatever, who cares about their rank.<br><br>However, one thing that is really great is about Ns is that you are sure to meet really good frens. Seriously, I think that is the only thing that is good about it. For me, I find the monthly pay good, esp when you are doing nothing...^^<br><br></div>
