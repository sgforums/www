              <p>When I was a trainee in the signal operaters course back in 1995, we used to go to a place called "Poyan Temple" for exercise deployments. I remember that the temple was probably built in the early 1900s, no electricity at all, and was supposed to be the temple facilites for holding funerals for the surrounding cemetery. Very nice traditional Taoist architecture, all made from wood and hand painted.</p>
              <p>I'm planning to head over there to take pictures of the architecture on my upcoming visit to Singapore, but can hardly remember the route to get there.Does anyone know if this temple still exsits, or has it been demolished?</p>
              <p>I also had my first NS paranormal  experience there, and I'm curious to see if it's as spooky now after 14 years as it was back then.</p>
              <p>I kind of remember that it was off a road from Lim Chu Kang cemetery that dead-ended into some Air Force camp with a huge fence.</p>

              <p>Hmmm... as I recall, I think I've heard ppl call the fenced up Air Force area "Missle Hill" when I was in NS. I know it was Air Force because the guards that stopped my Rover last time were wearing berets with the Air Force crest, not army. My memory is fuzzy, but I think the way to get there was to go on old Chua Chu Kang road, then when it intersects with Lim Chu Kang road, just keep going across and carry on the same road. I miss the old Chua Chu Kang rd hawker center...char kuay teow only $1.20 per plate back in 1995! Soy bean drink only 20 cents per cup!</p>
              <p>Oh well, I thought I'd try to SGForums to see if there were any recent Signals trainees who visited the Temple recently. I remember it was one of the Exercise Endurance task stations, the one where you throw a halyard to set up a big HF antenna. The temple grounds were a good spot because they have really tall angsana trees.</p>
              <p>Well, I've been living in the US ever since 3 weeks after ORD, so it's been a long time since I went back to the SAF training areas. I'll be visiting SG soon, so I was turning nostalgic and thought I'd go see if the old training grounds were still around. Besides, my wife, who is American, wants to see this place because of the ghost stories I'm always telling her about! Bt I think it'll be a good idea to visit only in the day...</p>
              <p>I tried looking at these various places with Google Earth, and saw that Pasir Laba camp now was a parade square with huge sergeant stripes on it!</p>

              <p>I am not sure if a temple I encountered while in NS somewhere behind
                                  the hills of NTU is the poyang temple.  An old run down temple with
                                  some sort of tall chinese gate structure at the entrance to the
                                  compounds, where the chinese call "ç‰Œå�Š"(<a title="ç‰Œå�Š" href="http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%89%8C%E5%9D%8A">http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%89%8C%E5%9D%8A)</a>.
                                  Then it is surrounded by old graves where many tombstones have fallen
                                  or leaning sideway. To top it off, the place is over run by creepers.
                                  Looks like the set right out of " A chinese ghost story" (<a href="http://baike.baidu.com/view/47805.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>å€©å¥³å¹½é­‚</strong></span></a>) movie. Unable to go there
                                  to visit as a civilian as I think it is in the temple is within the live firing area and not
                                  accessable to the public.</p>

              <p>I was a signal spec trainee back in 98'. Yes, I remember Poyan Temple. A small temple along the exercise area. Unfortunately, I have no info if the temple still exists today. During my past reservist exercises at LCK, I didn't have a chance to locate there, so ditto. But the way to the temple is along the road to National Shooting Centre http://www.singaporeshooting.org/nsc/location.html</p>
              <p>It may be out of bounds to the public or fenced up on the small road leading to the temple. </p>

              <p>Wow, thanks for the info madcampus. At least I have a map of the National Shooting Center, so I'll go check out to see if the temple is accessible to civilians.</p>
              <p>Maybe I'll post pictures if I'm able to get there!</p>
