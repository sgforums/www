            <div class='col-md body'>To TS: Your worries are unfounded. Don't worry so much. I used to worry also before enlistment cause I was also rather skinny then. Then I realised that SAF isn't that tough, although at times can be straining. As long as you can do some decent chin-ups (well even if you can't, you'd be trained to) and have enough stamina for those runnings, then you are well and safe. And you will also realise there will be people like you.<br><br>Seriously, SAF has become rather mellowed, especially now with all the 3rd gen army cra.p.<br><br>And yeah. I am also a testimony to growing fat after army. Most of my camp mates also ballooned when ORDing that time. Haha.</div>

UGH. n i noe bout the stereotype against mono intake. dunno wad la but i got hrd frm some 'OTHER' men in green in personally know of. well anyone dumped there as well?<br><br></div></blockquote>Have friends who are Platoon Commanders in 3 SIR...am a PC myself...ORD OH!!!<br><br>Actually there is no difference between mono or enhanced intake...(aka Tekong) You will still go through BMT proper with your fellow friends in 3 SIR. You wont go through the teruk training ah...anyway, its the same...<br><br>Don't be afraid of the stigma because its nonsense...yes there is a presence there, but they are not bad guys. they are excellent friends and companions to have when you're going through NS. You will have a more enjoyable time if you can work and trust ur platoon mates...Trust me, you'll have lasting memories about NS...(both the BAD and the GOOD i must say)<br><br>I can't discuss with you what 3 SIR is doing, you'll find it out yourself, Don't worry its nothing teruk like the Guards or Commando. In fact its kinda exciting...enjoy!!!</div>
