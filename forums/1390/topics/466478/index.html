              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><br>The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) is a 2,000-bed acute tertiary psychiatric hospital situated on a 25-hectare campus at Buangkok Green Medical Park. Set amidst serene surroundings, IMH offers a comprehensive range of psychiatric, rehabilitative and counselling services for children, adolescents, adults, and the elderly.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">IMH’s tradition of care started in 1928. We were the first mental hospital in Singapore, starting with some 1,000 patients. Since then, many advances have been made in treatment, training, and research. Our treatment integrates evidence-based therapies, supported by the departments of clinical psychology, nursing, occupational therapy, and medical social work, to provide holistic care for our patients. IMH is equipped with modern facilities, with 50 wards for inpatients and seven Specialist Outpatient Clinics.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">IMH was the first mental health institution in Asia to receive the Joint Commission International Accreditation in 2005, a highly coveted international accreditation for healthcare organisations. </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Over the years, IMH has gained a reputation for quality research. In 2008, the Ministry of Health, Singapore, entrusted IMH with a S$25 million research grant to implement translational and clinical research into the causes of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">IMH also plays a key role in training the next generation of mental health professionals in Singapore. We train psychiatrists and mental health professionals through the NHG-AHPL Residency Programme for psychiatry and through collaborations with the local tertiary institutions.</span></p>

              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Minister of State for Health Dr Amy Khor announced in Parliament on Monday two new community-based mental health initiatives designed to improve Singaporeans' access to mental healthcare.<br><br>"We are developing Assessment and Shared Care Teams (ASCAT), which are specialist-led mental health teams based in the community, in order to improve access to mental health care. We are also developing Community Mental Health Intervention Teams (COMIT) to provide improved access to counselling and psychotherapy services in the community," said Dr Khor.<br><br>Dr Khor also said that the Institute of Mental Health's (IMH) occupancy rate for the past three years averaged at about 80 per cent and that the hospital has sufficient capacity for new patients.<br><br>There are currently about 2,000 beds across public hospitals in Singapore dedicated to mental health patients, with the majority in IMH.<br><br>Responding to queries from Member of Parliament Mr Hri Kumar Nair on the criteria for admitting patients to IMH, Dr. Khor said those with conditions such as schizophrenia and depression may be admitted for closer monitoring.</span></p>

              <p><em style="font: inherit;"><strong style="font: inherit; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Being psychologically prepared is all about knowing what to expect and being prepared for it.</strong></em></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">To be better prepared, you can participate in Total Defence activities and Open Houses organised by the SAF/SPF/SCDF.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Perhaps you should also talk to your family members and friends who have lived the NS experience. The more you discuss with others, the more comfortable and mentally prepared you’ll become.</span></p>
              <p><strong style="font: inherit; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Because NS life is different from civilian life before enlistment, there are many adjustments you need to make.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">A good way to cope is to get support from your buddy and fellow recruits. They are going through the same tough training as you, so talking to one another will help relieve some tension.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">In most evenings during your leisure time, you’ll also have some time to call your family or loved ones to talk. They can give you emotional support during NS.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">You can have a one-on-one interview sessions with your officer to highlight any problems you may have.

              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Life in NS revolves around structure, routine and discipline. This helps us stay united as a uniformed organisation as well as imparts the rigours necessary to protect our nation and citizens.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">This does not mean there is just work and no play. In fact, after a few weeks in NS and you’ll find new friends and new reasons to smile!</span></p>
              <p><strong style="font: inherit; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">As a soldier, one of the biggest adjustments you’ll have to make quickly is in regimentation and discipline.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Being in a uniformed organisation, you’ll have to obey orders from your superiors. Thus some of you may feel a sudden lack of freedom to do what you want and you may find yourself having difficulties accepting authority initially.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Regimentation and discipline build strong character and toughness, so that you’ll be tough enough to handle difficult combat, crime-fighting or rescue situations without giving up or breaking down.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">When you first enlist into NS, you may have concerns of being in a new territory, with new faces and new things to do. But don’t let this get to you. Just remember the saying that “when the going gets tough, the tough gets going”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><em style="font: inherit;">Following are some tips on what you can do to prepare yourself psychologically:</em></span></p>

              <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: initial;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Adopt a positive perception</span></li>

              <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: initial;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Develop good working attitude and habits</span></li>
              <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: initial;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Overcome psychological stress</span></li>
              <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: initial;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Adopt teamwork spirit</span></li>
              <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: initial;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Learn to be independent</span></li>
              <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: initial;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Set realistic expectations</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">You can also speak to your friends or family members who have been through NS. Ask them to share their stories. The sharing will help you reduce some of your fears, uncertainties and doubts.</span></p>
              <p><strong style="font: inherit; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">During NS you’ll be living with different people.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Because these people come from different backgrounds, they may not think like you do or react to situations like you would. Instead of trying to select your type of people, you should cherish the diversity. This is a chance for you to learn more about your fellow mates and their cultures.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">You’ll find that you have many opportunities to absorb the different cultures—during training, eating, chatting or just seeing and listening. Take these opportunities and learn from people around you, you’ll have a much better appreciation of Singapore’s cultural diversity.</span></p>
