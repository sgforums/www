              <p>Hi! You which poly? I also planned to sign on at first as a <strong>Military Police / Guards </strong>under Army. (Guards damn xiong, I know... at first I cancelled then Guards call me to cmpb &amp; keep psycho me to join <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif">)</p>
              <p>So guys need serve 5 years ah? Coz the officer told me I only need to serve 4 years. but actually u got advantage leh. Guys need to serve NS (2 years compulsory) and so u serve 3 years extra. I no need NS so I serving 4 years. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>
              <p>Actually i oso v blur... but at last i didnt sign. I worked w SAF for this NDP as a leader and I can tell you, SAF is not organised at all and its like shit. Everything push to other ppl. Esp u sign now oni 3rd sergeant rank and <strong>no chance go OCS <em><span style="color: #ff0000;">AT ALL</span></em>. </strong>Got shit ppl push to you u oso must suck it up coz SAF is a hierarchical organisation. Truth be told, w 3rd sergeant rank in SAF u cant really do much, except to take orders from higher-ups (from my understanding).</p>
              <p>But if u need $ (like me) or really want a cool job (like me)<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">or really dw deskbound job (like me),</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> maybe can consider signing? Plus poly grads now hard to find jobs and starting pay all ard $1800 - $2000. Join starting pay is $2000++ And when studying they pay for our sch fees and still give $1200 allowance every month plus $10000 sign-on bonus (or isit $25000???) If u do well for semester exams they pay us extra $1000 or so. The $ is actually quite a handsome sum. (depends on what vocation you sign for) </span></p>
              <p>Anything PM me! We can discuss since both of us are in dilemma <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              It can be a good stepping stone for you. I've a brother in law who had signed on with RSAF for 6 years contract for that same position you mention after his JC in the 80s. He held a sgt rank then he was sent outstation to the U.S. in Arizona for further upgrading with RSAF F16 squadron personnel that were stationed there. Then he had completed his contract with RSAF, he worked for a private airline company there. He has migrated with my sister and niece there and now working in Dallas with manager position. It can happen to you too.

              I am ex regular. stay out depends on your unit.
              definitely will have monthly duty spec duties once or twice.
              stay in definitely out for married personnel.

              <p> Hi varadero! You're ex-regular, do you mind if I ask which vocation are you in and how's the life as a regular? Why do you leave the force...? </p>
              <p>Hi guardsmen74, actually I don't hate army, quite like the life of it but just the stay in part abit sian. Thought regulars get to chose To stay in / out. As for the sign on bounty, thought I'll get it once I passed out as a 3sg? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks all all for the advices and information.</p>
