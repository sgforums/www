The S1 branch didn't want to give me the service injury form and kept giving me excuses etc and I suspect it's that one of two bad apples in the lot that is causing all these. When I finally did get the service injury form and dillgently filled up everything to find out 3-4 months later they lost the form! Wah!<br><br>It's not so much that I want to claim for compensation but I want my injury to be recorded down as a service injury.
