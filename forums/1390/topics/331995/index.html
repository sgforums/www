              <p>I think I am currently suffering from depression, I feel sad, anger and things. 2 of my family members is having medical issues, one has been diagnosed with tumor and the other kidney failure. I should be only feeling sad, I don't know why am I angry and is often kicking and jabbing in my bed to relieve my stress level. I do not feel like doing anything much, and is dropping tears in my bed for no apparent reason, it just drop. In addition, I have been hearing noises and voices over the past few days after seeing "something" in camp, I am in deep fear every night, causing me to lose sleep and have difficulty breathing, my heart bounces so fast that I'm scare it'll explode, sometimes, I couldn't control my trembling. Because of this, I had report myself to IMH as I had thought of sucide and after one night of observation, I was discharge, currently awaiting for SAF psychiatrist appointment.</p>
              <p>Secondarily, I am so scared they would charge me, they would lock me up, people would think I'm crazy and I am really sensitive to words like "siao, crazy" right now. I am worried that I would really go crazy if this continues, and is also worried about my future records.</p>
              <p>Can anyone tell me what they would do to me? Am I mad? Is my future ruined? Please <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">do not</span></span> discourage me and help me.</p>

Its easier said than done to tell you to relax and not think so much but that is what you need to do. It is not easy to have your loved ones suffering from sicknesses especially a long suffering one like tumours. But seek help and see what happens. As coming from me, when my father passed away, it was a terrible time for me too but the only thing that kept me going is the thought I need to be there for other people I love like my mum and sister. I cannot afford to break down.</p></div>

Because I hear things at night, I feel like dying but because of my love ones like you said have prevented me from doing so, however, I will go crazy if I go back to the camp where I see things, I cannot face darkness like I used to be. I used to be a happy bird, but now I have no interest in my past activities. Due to my dad's encouragement, I went out for a friend's 20th birthday, I tried to forge a smile, but as it happens at night and it is at a park, i felt slight tremble and become worried, I told my girlfriend that I am not feeling well and I went home. Is trembling normal? Or am I dying? My BP is above 140 and my heart beat rate was 132 when measured at IMH, I have difficulty breathing recently. I cannot overcome my fear and my worries. HELP! What will they do to me?Is my future ruined!?</p></div>

              <p>TS, go get a referral to whatever psychologist/psychiatrist. I'm no expert in this field, but you sound like you're under immense stress. Either way, you may want to see your MO very soon before the problem escalate.</p>

              <p>Okay, first things first.  Anno, you've asked a number of times if your future is ruined.  Your immediate problem is the present, not the future.  I'm pointing this out because your concerns for the future may lead you to rejecting treatment options that can help you now.  So far you've done well to seek treatment, so keep it up and be open to the treatment that the professionals offer you.</p>
              <p>Given the symptoms, my gut feel is that a psychiatrist would be of more help than a psychologist.  Clinical work is not my field (I'm an organisational psychologist), but the hearing of voices and anxiety responses may be better addressed by psychiatric intervention, at least in the short term.  If a psychological approach is required, psychiatrists can take care of basic counselling and refer your case to the appropriate psychologist is necessary.</p>
              <p>At present, the bottom line is that you're on the right track in seeking treatment.  As with any other referral system, your appointmentment may take a bit of time to arrange, but make sure you hang in there and get the help that you need.</p>

              <p>Hi Anno,</p>
              <p>From what you have stated in your post, it seems they are 2 main problems:</p>
              <p>1)  Hearing voices (auditory hallucination) is a symptom of some serious underlaying mental ailment &amp; you must immediately seek help from the professional who should a psychiatrist rather than a psychologist.</p>
              <p>2)  Depression - likely to be reactive depression rather than endogenous depression possibly due to "2 of my family members is (are) having medical issues".  Reactive depression is not as serious as endogenous depression but taken together with your auditory hallucination, the more so that you must seek expect psychiatric help.</p>
              <p>The expects, each in his/her own fields, will be able to give you professional, relevant, systematic &amp; effective therapeutic management &amp; you will definitely have very high chances of a complete recovery.</p>
              <p>Life always has its highs &amp; lows, ups &amp; downs &amp; so in the meantime try to think positively &amp; I wish you all the best.</p>

              <p>Today I went back to the camp to endorse my MC, I was having difficulty breathing and when speaking to the MO about "seeing things" has made my body tremble. He immediately endorse my MC, however, I had forgotten to bring my psychiatrist appointment letter, so I have to go back again. This really stressed me out. I am very glad to see no negative comments and thanks for the encouragement. In present, I am very fearful that I would be like my grandma who had the same type of illness like "hearing things" none of my family members believe it or rather, we don't know its a mental illness, eventually, it escalated to "bonkers' situation"</p>
              <p>In the appointment letter, it stated depression and doesn't state anything like anxiety attacks. </p>
              <p>I think my depression is because of my family issues and my trembling and stuffs like hearing is because I'm scared.</p>
              <p>1) Anyone knows what will the SAF psychiatrist do?</p>
              <p>2) I fear of going crazy</p>
              <p>3) My family members are worried, increasing my stress level. (real stressful)</p>
              <p>4) My headaches are in 3-4 out of 10, however, its a whole day issue.</p>

              <p>If IMH can 't help much, try Hypnotherapy. It may cost a little (S$200 per session, require 4-6 sessions usually) but it works! I dare to said it because my son happen to have the same issues like yours and Hypnotherapy work better for him. IMH usually will just give medication + talk therapy and Dr. Alex Su is the only dotor that I will said is good. The rest.......believe you been have a seesion or two with them, you should know better.       </p>

              <p>IMH treated my case as genuine, however, what will the SAF think of this? In the end, I don't know how they can help me and what will they do to me. They will charge me? They will ignore me? I don't know. I am worried and fearful each day. I think in SAF, I would jump or go crazy sooner or later.</p>
