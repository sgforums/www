            <div class='col-md body'>It really depends on your personality. But have to warn you first. With a diploma, don't expect to be a high-flying officer and retire as a high-ranking officer. Even with a degree, there is little chance of you doing very well.<br><br>SAF is an organisation that rates paper more than ability. No matter how fit you are or how much leadership quality you have, the prospect of your promotion depends on your paper qualifications. Suffice to say, the scholars are the ones who will have their career paths laid out nicely for them to reach the top in a very short time. So much so that I would reckon that a lot of our generals were scholars. These generals, and higher ranks (Colonels) have cushy jobs waiting for them in GLCs after their retirement from the army.<br><br>If you are satisfied at being a middle man and can take regimentation, then go ahead. But make sure you experience BMT life first before signing on the dotted line. Be mindful that after your compulsory retirement (45?), and when you are in the civilian market, you are left with very little real skills, unless you upgrade yourself.<br><br>I think most regulars have a pretty decent standard of living in their 20s to 30s, 40s. A lot of them married young, set up families, bought cars and stuff due to the pretty generous bonus and stable pay. But what happens after they reach their lifecycle is up to you to guess. I reckon some made it good outside while others fumbled with a totally different way of life, and very little applicable work skills.<br><br>Personally for me, I enjoy army life only when I go back for reservist, like two-three weeks a year. It's refreshing, no-brainer and gives me a good break from work. Plus, I get to meet up with old pals.<br><br>But to do what I do as a Combat Engineer, day-in, day-out, for 365 days a year is a no-no. This probably explains why I am more on-the-ball during reservist as compared to during my active service.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Eh...frankly, the military ain't for everybody. My friend signed on as a pilot, just on Monday, he kena 21extras for 2 small mistake. Feel that he's quite pitiful as he says that for nw, he's gt no social life, no girls, and can go Uni only at 26. He felt like breaking his bond after 4 months as he's offered the contract in Dec last year. And he told me frankly,the pay is not very good either, so he questions if its really worth all the crap he's getting. Thus...think carefully first before signing the dotted line yeah.<br><br>For me...if get into OCS...I figure I did sign 3-6yrs and get a part-time degree.

My friend signed on as a pilot, just on Monday, he kena 21extras for 2 small mistake. Feel that he's quite pitiful as he says that for nw, he's gt no social life, no girls, and can go Uni only at 26. He felt like breaking his bond after 4 months as he's offered the contract in Dec last year. And he told me frankly,the pay is not very good either, so he questions if its really worth all the crap he's getting. Thus...think carefully first before signing the dotted line yeah.<br><br>For me...if get into OCS...I figure I did sign 3-6yrs and get a part-time degree. Sad thing...local unis are such a b*tch to get into.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote> wah what mistakes? y so jialat?</div>
