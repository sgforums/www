              <p>Hi Guyz,</p>
              <p>I completed my NS abt 2 years ago in Police. After completeing I started doing my Bachelor Degree @ SIM and currently in my 4th sem.</p>
              <p>My course structure is in this manner 1st year (Sem 1 &amp; 2) is full time. 2nd &amp; 3rd Year(sem 3-6) is part time.</p>
              <p>While I was doing my 1st sem, i got called up for a briefing for my reservist from KINS &amp; I went. There they had asked me to come for abt 3 weeks stay in camp a few months later. But since I was a full time student i was able to defer.</p>
              <p>then while i was in my 3rd sem a few months ago, i got called up again. This time I cant defer since I am only a part time student. But I defered succesfully as my exam and stay in period clashes.</p>
              <p>Now I am in my 4th sem. They might call me anytime. Well, my problem is, not going 4 my reservist. But the real problem is in KINS, while I am in camp, I am not allowed to attend my night classes. Some of my frnds who were not in kins are able to go for night lessons. But in kins a strict no.</p>
              <p>So what to do ? I am a very average student. If I could not attend my classes I might fail in my modules. Since I m not a very inteligent student I will not be able to pick up those topics I missed on my own.Â  My in camp is almost a month including remedial as i cant pass my ippt. So i will be miising a huge portion of my studies. For me studies is very impt. It is the most impt thing. I want to put my full concentration in it. Thats the main reason for me not to even go for a work although i m a part time student.</p>
              <p>So what can i do ? The most I want to defer completly till I finish my degree in 1.5 years time so that I can fully concentrate on studies. THe least is, I go for camp but also go for my night lessons.</p>
              <p>Plz advice. THnx</p>
