              <p>1. Vest slack is not an official attire. Let alone, he wear outside camp...</p>
              <p>2. There is MP who don;t wear unitform. SIB.</p>
              <p>3. It will not be very serious. Probably kena extra or SOL. No court martial.</p>

              <p>MPs are often in plain clothes and its part of their job scope to look for people breaking rules outside of camp. MPs generally only wear their uniform when they are going on official investigation in camps etc.</p>
              <p>SOL is unlikely but extra is hard to avoid.</p>
              <p>I doubt they get off for catching people but if u ignore them or try to run, be prepared to have your punishment increased. MP is 1 of the few vocations where they can charge someone above their rank.</p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>an advice for your friend. as long as he is holding on to the SAF Smart Card he is to follow the SAF Act and comply to all standing Orders. If he chooses to break the law, tell him to prepare to take the punishment. Nothing to worry about, cos he should think of the consequences before doing such a stupid thing.</p>
              <p>Military Police duties is to enforce the discipline and uphold the image of the SAF. Be it in civilian attire or uniform, with the warrant card any SAF offender is to cooperate with MP. If not you can try asking CID and CNB officers to wear uniform out to perform their duites.</p>

              <p><br>I noticed that SAF MP often caught servicemen smoking or drinking in uniform, there is a funny but silly regulation that servicemen in uniform not allowed to hold hand with their girlfren. They should do more to send MP to units with cases of alleged bullying.</p>
