              <p>My vocation was autotech so we don't wear number 4 when working in camp. We also book in in CV so i hardly ever really wear my uniform. Dropping on the floor might scratch it if its the badge that hits the floor.</p>

              <p>Got silver de ah? Mine i went to buy from E-mart and mine was gold. It doesn't really cost too much to get using credits so it might be easier to just replace it if u find too many scratches on it. Maybe use the new 1 only for parades and such and leave the old 1 for daily usage.</p>
              <p>Autotech all wear coverall so we do not ever need headdress for our attire.</p>

              <p>The badge is just quite a minor thing so don't get so worked up over it. U should have alot of excess credits so just go to the e-mart and buy a new badge. Silver or gold shouldn't really be that important. There should be better things for you to feel worried about rather than just that right?</p>

              <p>i'm trying my best now to forget about it. no point crying over
              spilled milk, whats done cant be undone. i just have to be very
              careful in future not to leave my stuff lying ard in order to
              prevent further damage to my badge. i wana maintain the
              current condition of my badge from now till the day
              i ord.anyway thks for all the advice and guidance you have
              gave me, it sorta enlightens me to a certain extent. i feel
              much better after reading what you've said. people are crying
              over the loss of their loved ones and yet, i'm making a big
              fuss over a piece of badge. i think i'm real crappy
              sometimes...  </p>

              <p>Its ok. There are more problems u might face later in life that are alot tougher to handle than that so get yourself ready for them by being able to get over the minor issues 1st.</p>
              <p>Should be less than a yr till u ORD i believe since there was no update about your enlistment date after the change in enlistment date last year.</p>
              <p>Good luck and take care.</p>

              <p><br>i got 11 mths left before receiving my pink IC back in oct next yr. i just wana enlist and ord in 1 piece, carrying on with my life and hopefully face the many obstacles with bravado in my future endeavours. life can be so unpredictable these days, i learn to cherish my loved ones more after enlistment; going thru national service can really change a person both mentally and emotionally.
