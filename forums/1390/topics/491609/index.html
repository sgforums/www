Im only aware of chicken pox and influenza, any medics or MOs know waht other vaccines were provided? Also, for the ORD FFI blood test, its to detect haemoglobin levels right? Sometimes feel abit faint, not sure if i should do harmoglobin test cos i think oxygen not flowing around my body well. If the ord ffi is to test for anemia then ill hold till then. Thanks everyone!</p>

              <p><strong>Q1. Are there measures taken to ensure the safety of recruits with past medical history?</strong><br> A1. Yes. During the initial interview, their Platoon Commanders 
                                will verify their medical history and the section commanders will be 
                                informed accordingly. Preventive measures will then be taken. For 
                                example, recruits with a history of heat injuries or asthma are required
                                 to put on a colour tag for the purpose of identification and 
                                monitoring.</p>
              <p><strong>Q2. What happens when the recruits fall sick?</strong><br> A2. We have a fully equipped 24-hour medical center to attend to 
                                recruits reporting sick. Our duty Medical Officer will diagnose the 
                                recruits’ conditions and provide the necessary treatment. In the event 
                                of an emergency, evacuation to the nearest hospital via the Dedicated 
                                Harbour Launch Crafts or helicopter will be activated.</p>
              <p><strong>Q3. What if the recruits need to book out for interviews or appointments? How will they seek official approval?</strong><br> A3. They will be allowed to do so (subject to exigencies of 
                                service) and provided that they inform their commanders in advance and 
                                produce the necessary supporting documents for verification.</p>
              <p><strong>Q4. What medical facilities are available on Pulau Tekong?</strong><br> A4. Pulau Tekong is served by two medical centers, one located at 
                                Ladang Camp (serving BMTC School 1, 2 and 3), and the other at Rocky 
                                Hill Camp (serving School 4). In addition to providing medical 
                                consultation services, there are also dental, physiotherapy and X-ray 
                                services at Ladang Medical Centre during office hours.</p>
              <p><strong>Q5. What happens if medical care is required after office hours?</strong><br> A5. Ladang Medical Centre is a 24-hour facility, which caters to 
                                all servicemen on the island. Similar to the A&amp;E departments of 
                                hospitals, a doctor is on duty at all times of the day, 365 days a year,
                                 to provide medical consultations and treatment whenever needed.</p>
              <p><strong>Q6. Are the doctors and medics well trained?</strong><br> A6. All SAF Medical Officers are trained to exacting national 
                                standards and are fully registered with the Singapore Medical Council. 
                                All the Medical Officers also have prior working experience in the 
                                restructured hospitals. Likewise, SAF medics undergo realistic training 
                                at the SAF Medical Institute to ensure the highest standard of medical 
                                care provision for servicemen.</p>
              <p><strong>Q7. What happens if a serviceman needs to be sent to a hospital?</strong><br> A7. Ambulances are on 24/7 standby on Pulau Tekong and at the SAF 
                                Ferry Terminal at Changi. Dedicated Harbour Launch Crafts are also on 
                                standby at all times to ferry any patients rapidly to the mainland. 
                                Should there be an emergency, helicopters will be activated to provide 
                                responsive heli-evacuation to mainland hospitals.</p>
              <p><strong>Q8. What measures are in place to prevent spread on diseases on the island?</strong><br> A8. All Recruits will receive vaccinations for tetanus, 
                                poliomyelitis and seasonal influenza. For those who have not contacted 
                                varicella vaccine will also be administered.
                                      In addition, adequate ventilation in the bunks, emphasis on the 
                                practice of good personal hygiene, and medical leave for servicemen who 
                                are unwell also serve to reduce the spread of respiratory diseases.</p>
