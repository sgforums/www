If we do not take a tough stance on certain issues, guess we will not have such a respected judicial system. For example the tough stance on armed robbery and kidnapping.<br><br>Imagine the case where the 3 armed robbers land in Tekong. If the gahmen mentality is , " Aiya, only 3 armed robbers with 2 pistols nia, in Tekong somemore.Accounted for. No worries no worries ."Then the next thing you know, armed robberies in Pasir Ris , DBS in Shenton way being emptied etc.<br>Remember the May Bank in Bukit Timah being robbed by a robber with fake pistol ?<br><br>I'm glad the gahmen is tough on these few areas though there are other area where the gahmen can improve on.</div>
