Thats for true. I heard the comms through my signal set during Wanderer. The detail was resting in a clearing and they exchange carrying the signal set. This maybe the time the rifle was left on the ground.<br><br>When we went back to the night end point, our CSM was checking all the rifles butt numbers... A small search party was activated soon. Next morning 2 coys were activated to conduct a carpet search in the probable lost area. The location we combed is very bushy and swampy... The whole area were guarded by Provost.<br><br>Afternoon, dogs from combat engineers and pioneer platoon metal detectors were dispatched. 2 more coys were tasked to join the search. The other coys which have booked out are being called back as standby.<br><br>At night, the Ops order are given and 3 coys were sent to lay cylum sticks at checkpoints to facilate the 3SIR. Midnight, 3SIR arrive with search lights.

Surely he would be willing to move heaven and earth to stop such an incident from happening.
