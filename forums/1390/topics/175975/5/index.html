            <div class='col-md body'>Since the news of this incident is on TV I shall tell you more!! hehe...<br><br>Yes M16 rifle was lost. Thats for true. I heard the comms through my signal set during Wanderer. The detail was resting in a clearing and they exchange carrying the signal set. This maybe the time the rifle was left on the ground.<br><br>When we went back to the night end point, our CSM was checking all the rifles butt numbers... A small search party was activated soon. Next morning 2 coys were activated to conduct a carpet search in the probable lost area. The location we combed is very bushy and swampy... The whole area were guarded by Provost.<br><br>Afternoon, dogs from combat engineers and pioneer platoon metal detectors were dispatched. 2 more coys were tasked to join the search. The other coys which have booked out are being called back as standby.<br><br>At night, the Ops order are given and 3 coys were sent to lay cylum sticks at checkpoints to facilate the 3SIR. Midnight, 3SIR arrive with search lights. Morning, a 3sgt found the rifle near the night start point, which is out of the probable areas.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Everything in SAF got written SOP for example :<br><br>1) lost weapon or other controlled item , within certain hrs, need  to inform up the chain of command , and eventually after certain hrs, Mindef must be informed.<br><br>2) likewise for lost man during training etc.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>So when the incident has crossed certain hrs , Mindef will be informed which means all the big shots in Mindef will know, therefore the Div commander must be on the ball.<br><br>When such thing go up the chain of command, that guy suay and will get jailat one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>why 3 sir? anyone can explain?<br><br>btw, it seems that many here think activating 400 men to search for a single m-16 is overkill. what i would like to point out is that wat was lost was a real, useable weapon, one that can potentially cause harm if fallen into the wrong hands and used for the wrong purposes. how much assurance are we going to get of our saf, if, after such an incident happens, the commanders decide to activate like 40 persons to conduct the search? a swift and decisive action needs to be taken here for controlled equipment. i hope the cavalier attitudes of some does not reflect their attitudes when they are in possession of weapons or similar equipment themselves.</div>
