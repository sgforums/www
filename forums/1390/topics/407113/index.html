              Hi all. I am a pre enlistee and hence my NAPHA test results in jc2 will determine my enlistment date. I have been failing 2.4 this year because i dont run regularly due to other commitments like prelims/ A level revision.
              
              The date line to pass NAPHA in my school is next week latest. Right now i am doing 1430. I have read previous threads like the one started by fellow poster january, and the most common advice given to him at that time was interval training.
              
              Considering that i passed 2.4km last year, what do i need to do to pass 2.4km in two weeks? How exactly should i carry out the interval training?
              
              Thanks.

              <p>Can be done.  Just jog everyday, aiming to improve your timing everyday, even if it is just 5 sec.  When the end is in sight, just dash.  Just think of attending the 2 months PTP (is there still such a thing now?) and multiply the torture by 10 times in your mind and you will naturally feel motivated.</p>

              <p>HI TS. I've tried running everyday for a month on a threadmill for 20minutes. And manage to pass my 2.4</p>
              <p>Since you mentioned that you passed your 2.4 last year, your standard must already be there. Hence i recommend you to pay a visit to the gym everyday, till the big day.</p>

              <p>Hi, aim not to jux run 2.4km for ur training..maybe u could cover 3km with constant pace and u shld be able to improve ur timing..</p>
              <p>Perhaps for the first few days or 1st wk, u will be shacked out..Rest ovr the wkend with no strenuous exercises and perhaps jux 1 more run covering 2.4km on the Mon or Tues assuming ur IPPT is on Fri..Let the remaining days be recovering period for the big day..</p>
              <p>I myself run 5km when im free to prepare myself for my IPPT even though it may still be 6 mths away..</p>

              <p>It's <em>deadline</em>. And just so that you know, you sprint one lap as hard as you can, and rest for 2 minutes. Repeat 5 times. Do it only every alternate day, and rest for 2 days after every 2 sessions.</p>

              <p>Interval training on track:</p>
              <p>Stretch</p>
              <p>Jog for 2 rounds to warm up</p>
              <p>'Sprint' 2 rounds at mile pace (or basically the speed you would chiong your 1.6km at)</p>
              <p>Jog 2 rounds to recover. May I emphasise, recover, but don't stop. This counts as one interval.</p>
              <p>Repeat the 'sprint' intervals for another 2 times, total 3 'sprints'.</p>
              <p>Finally, jog to cool down.</p>
              <p>Intervals on treadmill are the same distance-wise. I trust you know how to do la. Easier to do on treadmill though, IMO. Controlling the speed mechanically actually forces you to run. :D</p>
              <p>Do on alternate days, preferably 3 times a week. It is important to rest.</p>
              <p>Every week, add one more interval to the training session. 3 weeks and your fitness would have improved dramatically as long as your diet isn't extreme.</p>
              <p>On alternate days, you can do light jogging just to maintain fitness.</p>

              <p>If all else fails, use someone else as a pacer.</p>
              <p>No, seriously. Identify one person who you know can pass his 2.4 with a comfortable margin (e.g. 11:50). Then keep pace with him throughout the entire run at all costs.</p>
              <p>My sergeant once ordered one of my platoon mates who could not pass his 2.4 km to use this tactic. He ordered the fella to chase after another guy who could pass comfortably.</p>
              <p>End result: the fella's timing went from 12:40 to 11:20.</p>
              <p>It's siong, but it's possible. Half the battle is in your mind.</p>

              <p>This is a useful tactic but you must know who to chase, but this method is not useful while practising becos most of the time u ran alone.</p>

              <p>yes... the best method on the day  is to have a pacer n follow him..</p>
              <p>but of cos before the pacer can help u .. u need to help yourself.. if not u end up giving up</p>

              <p>Well, like I said, half the battle is in the mind. If you already feel like giving up, then no tactic is ever going to work. </p>
              <p>The pacer tactic can work, but it can be pretty siong. This is especially if the guy you're chasing wants to shake you off and decides to speed up. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Also, you must choose your pacer wisely. Of course you cannot hope to keep pace with someone trying to get a 9:30 timing. Likewise, trying to follow someone with a just-passed 12:20 timing is dangerous as well.... if he has an off-day, you're screwed.</p>
              <p>In the end, it is all up to you. If your pacer is too slow, by all means overtake him and chase someone else. If you continue to follow the slowpoke and fail as a result, then it's all your fault for not changing your pacer.</p>
              <p>In the end, whether or not you pass is up to you and not your pacer. The responsibility is all yours.</p>

              <p>In addtion to SGporkz, just measured your time to cover 1 min 40 s per round on the track and during the last round you start sprinting during the last 150 m. Get yourself a good pair of asics shoes.Remember to breath deep in and out.</p>
              <p>There is no shortcut to physical training. Good luck.</p>
              <p><br>So sugar loading, drink 100 plus, creatine, redbull.</p>
