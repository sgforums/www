It is a noble vocation and you will make a difference one day. So why not change that attitude and see your job as something thankful instead of complaining?<br><br>Okay, maybe the instructors are too rushed in their coursework. Seek help from your seniors, your peers. You guys are in it together. Clarify your doubts and it will be fine. Over time, you will get used to it.<br><br>You've got to serve your time, so why not serve it with less pessimism?It will make you feel better.</div>

But hey, you're not the only person who's undergoing all that sh*t. Work hard, and work together with your fellow medics if you feel that you're lagging behind in learning.<br><br>You are in a highly noble profession, and that is something for you to be proud of. You save lives on a daily basis; even I don't get to do that sort of thing. I've rarely been called upon to do life-saving intervention. More often than not, I handle more mundane injuries out in the field like sprains and lacerations.<br><br>The difference between you and me is that I have to go out into the battlefield and walk up to 20km at night with a 28kg full battle order. In times of war, I'm far more likely to die than you are.<br><br>Your position is similar to that of SCDF paramedics. In my Spec II course I had the chance to spend a couple of days doing ambulance attachment with an SCDF paramedic team. Day in and day out they save lives and reduce the suffering of people. It can be extremely tiring on them, and yet they do not waver in the sight of all that blood, broken bones, and the occasional death in the ambulance.<br><br>They are on standby all the time throughout their shift, and yet they take it in their stride and have a positive attitude on all the time. I can still remember how I had to break off from my packed chicken rice lunch halfway and run off to the parked ambulance when the fire station siren went off.<br><br>Really, if you choose to stick with this pessimistic mentality of yours, then your vocation will forever be hell. You will forever look at platoon medics and wish that you could have the 'good life' of theirs and platoon medics will always look at your and wish that you could have the 'good life' of yours.<br><br>The way I see it, we medics all have a good life. We are the people who save lives and reduce the suffering of others. And that, I believe, is something that you should start being proud of.</div>
