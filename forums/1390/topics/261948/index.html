            <div class='col-md body'>In the corporate world, the employee is very dependant on the boss. He/she must please the boss. If the boss is not happy with him/her, the boss can sack him/her anytime and find someone else to replace him/her. So the boss is always at a advantage. It is a Employee-Boss relationship.<br><br>In the army, it is not a Employee-Boss relationship. It is a Subordinate-Superior relationship. The difference is that the Boss is the 1 paying him/her his/her salary while the Superior is not paying him/her salary but merely supervising him/her. The superior cannot sack a person if he does not like him/her while the boss can. The superior can only transfer him/her to another unit if he does not like that person or give him poor grading for his/her performance. The superior only have a slight advantage over the subordinate in the sense that he can ask the subordinate to do work for him.<br><br>In the corporate world, the boss can sack you anytime. You basically have no form of protection against being sacked.<br><br>In the army, the superior can't sack you. He can at the most only recommend to CPC to sack you. It is highly unlikely that you will get sack before your contract ends. Your contract with the army offers some kind of protection for you.<br><br>In the corporate world, everybody is working hard not only because they are rewarded for their performance but also because they do not want to get sack.<br><br>In the army, the nsf can't be bothered. They are here just to serve the 2 years and than fuck off. For the regulars, 80% of them also do not like the army. Some will even purposely have poor performance so as to force their superior to recommend to sack them.<br><br>In the corporate world, if you are able to be promoted and achieve your target, you are considered as smart and capable.<br><br>In the army, you are only considered smart only if you know how to chao keng.<br><br>In the corporate world, many people will be jealous if they see you being given alot of work and responsibilities by your boss. This means that there will be a high chance of you being promoted or given pay increment.<br><br>In the army, many people will be happy to see you being given alot of work and responsibilities by your superior. This means they will be given less work to do.<br><br>In the corporate world, bosses are good in giving rewards to their employees.<br><br>In the army, superiors are only good in giving punishments.<br><br>In the corporate world, bosses use rewards to motivate their employees.<br><br>In the army, superiors use punishments to motivate their subordinates.<br><br>In the corporate world, bosses can chose their employees.<br><br>In the army, superiors are given their subordinates and they can't chose.<br><br></div>

One obvious example is dealing with difficult people, whether they are superiors or subordinates. We'll no doubt meet difficult people inside or outside the army.<br><br>You may think that there is no incentive - low pay, lousy people around you, etc - but yet in the end you are no better. They probably have no better impression of you; a scheming, skulking, pretentious, untrustworthy, slacking individual.<br><br>Alternatively, you might do well to do your part well. You will gain positive skills and insight when you come out. You are in a different league from the kengsters. Not to worry if you think you are doing more than others - you gain their respect. Yet you learn tact, to prevent yourself from getting pushed around. Then again, don't be a sycophant.<br><br>Nevertheless, most Sillyporeans can probably understand the 'chao keng' logic better than any other logic.</div>
