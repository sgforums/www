Afterall, <span style="font-style: italic;">a pint of sweat will save a gallon of blood</span>.<br><br>however, seeing that no regulars signed on for the right reason imo a year ago (loyalty to country), and they basically do nothing other than play PSP all day (SAF pay them a handsome sum of money every month to play PSP), though i admit good ones dont.<br><br>...or dun even appear without the need of deducting their offs, they can do things slow while NSF have to be on the ball... if they dunno how to use the equipment, they ask us... but if we dunno, we get pushups or extras... if they think A is B while A is really just A, and punish u for saying the right thing and after they find out the truth, they dun even apologise and wanna smoke out, that kinda dampens the patriotic spirit in me. a lot.<br><br>however, i still performed to the best of my abilities and a year later, now, i try to think how my patriotism has affected my unit... and nation. and i do not see any difference because one man can not make a difference.<br><br>therefore, i'd say, let the chao keng ones keng, let the patriots serve.<span style="font-style: italic;"> the well's water dun go n offend the river's water can already</span>. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
