            <div class='col-md body'>Once upon a time, there was a place where 3 kingdoms resided, they were called Vigilantes, Aggresory and Complacention.<br><br>Aggresory was, among the 3 kingdoms, the most reclused and hardly traded or communicated with the Vigilantes and the Complacentions. And the other 2 kingdoms hardly knew that Aggresory was actually an aggressive and warlike kingdom. They were ruled by a despotic and bloodthirsty king who had evil ambitions. They were the most powerful of the 3 kingdoms and had a large number of warriors ready to go to war at anytime.<br><br>Complacention was a rich kingdom because they had many natural resources and traded widely. Their citizens were very wealthy and indulged in all forms of luxury. They were very complacent about their position and never thought about the danger that they were facing and never realised how vulnerable they were. Complacention did not have any army to protect them. They did not even have any weapons or soldiers.<br><br>Vigilantes was also a wealthy and prosperous kingdom and traded widely with other civilizations. Though they too enjoyed their wealth and had good lives, they did not take their success for granted and realised only too well that they were in a vulnerable position and that other kingdoms, if they wanted to, could easily invade them and destroy their kingdom and ruin their way of life which they cherished very much.<br><br>Their king ordered that all the male citizens had to spend a certain amount of their time to train to learn the skills of a warrior and to be skilled in weaponry and combat. The female citizens did other things like first aid and working in factories to manufacture weapons and other equipment. Though many of the citizens were unhappy about having to do combat training for a period of time, they accepted that they had to do it for the security of their kingdom.<br><br>The Vigilante citizens also held exercises to practice defending their kingdom (in case of an invasion) on a regular basis. The kingdom was very well equipped with chariots, horses and all kinds of weapons stocked up ready for use at anytime.<br><br>The citizens of Complacention and Vigilantes were very friendly with each other and visited each other's kingdoms regularly for commercial, trading and other purposes. Often the Complacention citizens would see the Vigilante citizens training and practising their combat skills and laugh. "Look at them, why are they training so hard for? Come drink, party and be merry with us!"<br><br>There came a time when the Aggresory king decided that he wanted to expand his empire and his thirst for conquest made him decide to invade and take over Vigilante and Complacention.<br><br>One morning his band of warriors raced towards both Complacention and Vigilante. The larger part of his army went to conquer Vigilante and the other to Complacention. The Agresory warriors charged into Complacention and begin a bloodthirsty murder and pillage of the kingdom. The citizens were terrified but could do almost nothing to stop the murderous warriors of the Aggresory kingdom. Their valuables were taken, citizens were murdered and city burnt to the ground.<br><br>As the other batch of the Aggresory warriors charged towards Vigilante, they were spotted from afar and the whole kingdom went into action stations. Virtually all the able bodied men donned their body armour, took up their<br>weapons and equipment and rode on their horses to meet the warriors outside the city. A ferocious battle started. After a long hard battle, the Aggresory warriors were finally defeated and the Vigilante army, though suffering many casualties, had emerged victorious. The Aggresory warriors were stopped outside the Vigilante's city and no damage was done to their kingdom.<br><br>A messenger from Complacention arrived to inform the Vigilante king of the invasion of Complacention. The king immediately ordered his soldiers to go to Complacention to liberate the city and help chase the invaders away. So another fierce battle happened at the Complacention city and again the Vigilante soldiers emerged victorious. The Aggresory troops returned to their kingdom. The evil king was so shocked and stunned by his defeat that he never contemplated invading Complation and Vigilante ever again.<br><br>In the meantime, Complacention begin the long and painful road to recovery and Vigilante sent many soldiers, builders and medical personnel to their city to assist them. Over a few years life begin to go back to normal for Complacention but they never had the complacent kind of attitude again and just like Vigilante, had their citizens trained and ready for combat.<br><br>The Vigilante soldiers who survived were welcomed back to their kingdom as heroes and their king gave all of them a royal reception, medals of honour/bravery and all kinds of rewards.<br><br>THE END<br><br></div>
