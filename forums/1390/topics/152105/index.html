              <p><strong>Why are some doctors are vocationalised as medics in the SAF when 
              they are serving their National Service. Why has the SAF allowed this, 
              especially since doctors from the Ministry of Health are seconded to the
               SAF every year because of manpower shortage in the SAF Medical Service? </strong><br> <br> <br> The need to utilise doctors in their professional role has always been recognised by the SAF. <br> <br> National Servicemen with recognised medical qualifications to practise 
              in the SAF will have to be trained to operate in the military 
              environment before being commissioned as Medical Officers. Most doctors 
              are able to do so, even those with medical problems so severe that they 
              are unable to complete the medical officers' course, are utilised as 
              para-medical personnel where their medical knowledge is still put to 
              good use. Only in an extreme case such as that of a person who fails the
               course because of his poor attitude to military training or 
              disciplinary problems, would he be used as a medical orderly. This is 
              because his attitude may affect his behaviour and practice towards 
              soldiers. <br> <br> To ensure that good quality healthcare is given to SAF servicemen, it is
               necessary to have sufficient doctors in SAF Medical Centres so that 
              adequate time can be given to each patient. Doctors from the Ministry of
               Health have been seconded, including women doctors, to assist the SAF 
              when the numbers in the SAF have temporarily been low. The women doctors
               have been particularly welcomed by servicewomen in the SAF.</p>
