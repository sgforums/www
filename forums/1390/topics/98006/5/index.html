The run was more than just a normal run to keep fit it carried extra significance as the trainees' Advanced Section Leader Course graduation run.<br><br>The 22-km run takes the trainees around the island of Pulau Tekong and past landmarks and places that they would be familiar with from their Basic Military Training (BMT) and SISPEC experiences. The trainees thus get to relive the journey they have taken so far in the Army.<br><br>Past the halfway mark, the trainees are reminded that it is a mind game they have to overcome. Nearing the end of the run, the trainees will their bodies on through a gruelling uphill run before they finally reach the finish line at SISPEC. Commanding Officer of SISPEC, LTC Ng Heng Chew said, Through the run, we want to send a message to the trainees: that the mind is very powerful. After the run, they come out with a tremendous sense of achievement.<br><br>CPL Alan Phua said, As I ran, it was a time to recap all I did in BMT, and a time to understand how much I've grown. CPL Calvin Ng also noted, The run has taught us how to lead our men and how to mentally and physically prepare them. Hopefully they can also look up to us and say, if our instructor can do it, we can do it as well!<br><br>At the end of the run, COA congratulated the sergeants-to-be on finishing the run.

The run was more than just a normal run to keep fit it carried extra significance as the trainees' Advanced Section Leader Course graduation run.<br><br>The 22-km run takes the trainees around the island of Pulau Tekong and past landmarks and places that they would be familiar with from their Basic Military Training (BMT) and SISPEC experiences. The trainees thus get to relive the journey they have taken so far in the Army.<br><br>Past the halfway mark, the trainees are reminded that it is a mind game they have to overcome. Nearing the end of the run, the trainees will their bodies on through a gruelling uphill run before they finally reach the finish line at SISPEC. Commanding Officer of SISPEC, LTC Ng Heng Chew said, Through the run, we want to send a message to the trainees: that the mind is very powerful. After the run, they come out with a tremendous sense of achievement.<br><br>CPL Alan Phua said, As I ran, it was a time to recap all I did in BMT, and a time to understand how much I've grown. CPL Calvin Ng also noted, The run has taught us how to lead our men and how to mentally and physically prepare them. Hopefully they can also look up to us and say, if our instructor can do it, we can do it as well!<br><br>At the end of the run, COA congratulated the sergeants-to-be on finishing the run. He said, Soon you will be in charge of other soldiers their welfare, their lives.

Probably about the most useful thing to take out of SISPEC. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Not to diss SISPEC; I learnt quite a bit of things, toyed with more and enjoyed most of it. But it's the damn silly things and 'significant' nonsense that I think is an awful waste of time.<br><br>edit: Removed the image.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This i disagree. Not every ADF men is that bright.  Not every SISPEC trained Sect comd is a capable leader either.<br><br>This is where our system has failed.  Failure to recognise men with leadership potential and equipping them to lead.  Failure to recognise men who CAN'T lead and sending them to Sispec and God help us, OCS.</div>
