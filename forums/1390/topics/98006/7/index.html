            <div class='col-md body'>Currently attending Platoon Sergeants Course.<br>The info you have on PS Course is quite old. The current course is now more like 6 weeks long and is divided into two phases, namely, the Common Phase &amp; the Operations Phase.<br><br>Common Phase teaches drill &amp; ceremony, safety and administration related courses and is attended by trainees from all Army formations including the Combat Support formations like Armour, Engineers etc. A team building element consisting of a technical field camp has also recently been added.<br><br>After Common Phase, personnel from Infantry, Guards, Intelligence and Military Police stay behind for the Operations Phase which teaches Infantry tactics up to Plt Commander level. Trainees are assessed when they hold PC or PS appointments on exercise.<br><br>Another note, if the proposal goes through, the current PS course is being revised and will soon be much much longer. The duration will be revised upwards to around 2 months or longer so that a Plt Sgt will have been on course (including BSLC &amp; ASLC) for at least as long as his Officer counterparts in their OCC. An overseas element will also be added and this may take place in Brunei or India. ASTW is currently sorting out issues like how this will affect NS Men PS Course trainees due to the 1 month call-up limit (...maybe a seperate NS Men PS Crse??? NS MEn are already excused from the Common Phase...).<br><br>All these changes are expected to come into effect sometime next year.</div>
