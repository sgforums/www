              <p><span>MWO</span> Lee is a great OC, just remember to shout <span>GOOD MORNING SIR</span>!!!!!!!!!!! the moment you see him come out of his parked car.</p>
              </div>

              <p>Â </p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>I still can vividly remember the times when MWO Lee was my OC in Mortar Commanders' Course in the Armour Training Institute. He was a regimental OC, made us doÂ arduous and insane morning exercises to train up on our physical endurance. Every morning, we woke up at 5am and ran countless number of times round the track and immediately after that pushups, situps and chinups. He placed much emphasis on our physical fitness and discipline. </span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Many of my platoon mates complained because the training was really intense, but it was not in vain, asÂ allÂ of us besides 1 other guy achieved gold in the IPPT!!! In fact, 95% of us got gold onÂ our first IPPT!!! The last guy got a sliver, and of course, MWO Lee wasn't going to let a perfect record be gone to waste. So, the guy, poor chap, had to undergo physical training 3 times a day, and by golly, I accompanied him during his training since I was his buddy. He didn't manage to get the gold but missed out by just seconds in his 2.4km if I am not mistaken. We were even surprised by our own records, as there were people attaining a pass in BMT and now a goldÂ on their 1st IPPT in the specialist training wing!!!</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Our Armour Specialist wing was split up into 3 wings, Tankee, Mortar and AI, and mortar was the dominant one during our batch. This was the golden age of Armour Mortar Specialists, whereby we won the very 1st Challenge Trophy and dominated the IPPT!! I still remember the Mortar cheer which he made us shout every water parade and this made us stand out from the rest of the wings, it was our special trademark.</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>MWO Lee came in as a new OC in the Mortar Specialist Wing and we too came in as new trainees. Never did we know that we would achieve things beyond our expectations during our time as trainees there. I remember his shouting was insanely loud and when things 'cocked' up, we would be given hell. But it instilled discipline and perseverance in us. I remember when I was made the trainee Platoon Sergeant, I totally freaked out cause the previous guy was given total 'hell' and non-stop shouting from MWO Lee. As we were a pretty small group, no more than 30 trainees, every move and action of us were monitored and scrutinised such that mistakes can be corrected and at the same time, mistakes were 'rewarded' byÂ insanely loud shouting and pushups. All of the appointment holders also had to write down the reflections and thoughts in a scrap book during their stints as platoon sergeants. My stint was a short one, fortunately, and I too had my share of 'beasting'. Lol. </span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>After our 4 months course, we passed out as 3rd Sergeants and we heard that MWO Lee was transferring to SISPEC after our batch. We were a little surprised as he was only here for the 4 months and was immediately posted out. I can say that we respected him for his efforts in instilling discipline and determination in us. </span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>After saying our farewells and goodbyes to each other, we were separated and posted to different units. Oh, and did I mention, we did our mortar commanders' course with 3 other 2LTs, whom would become our future PCs. And there was another MWO, who also did the course together with us. I felt a little out of place when we were practicing our field exercises, when I look down and see that my planter is a MWO...Lol... All of us had to rotate roles in the vehicle.</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Anyway, we heard that SISPEC had moved to SAFTI and MWO had been posted there as hotel company OC. I was from 35th BSLC and SISPEC was still in Tekong then. So,Â I was wondering, did MWO Lee push allÂ of you to getÂ gold in the IPPT? For I believe he would do so, cause the physical training he conducted was insanely intense during MCC and it definitely paid off. If you guys did manage to get all gold, then he would have finally managed to hit a perfect record.</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Anyway, I was an NSF and I will always remember the good old days I had spent with my mates during my days and never will I forget the times I spent with my band of brothers....</span></p>
