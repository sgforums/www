              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>So I have a question that I hopefully can get your advice on.</p>
              <p>First some background information:</p>
              <p>I went for my first CMPB checkup in Feb 13' and because I was morbidly obese and had a suspected high blood pressure condition, they made me come back for check ups that lasted till June. They finally gave me a PES BP and my enlistment date is coming up on 27 Nov.</p>
              <p>Since then though, I've lost almost 50kg and can qualify for PES B1 because my BMI is within the range they set (my NAPFA still fail so lol). I've battled going back for a re-classification because I have holidays sceduled on the first two weeks of Nov but scanning through the forums it seems the next B1 intake is happening on the second week of December. As such my questions are:</p>
              <p>1) If I do go back for reclassification, would there be a chance that the intake is already full and I'd have to wait till the next intake in 2014?</p>
              <p>2) Will they do anything if I appear on my BP enlistment date in Tekong and I actually don't qualify for the Obese BMT programme? Make me turn around and go home or carry on? </p>
              <p>Thanks so much for the help in advance! :)</p>

              BMT</span></strong><br> This 9-week programme trains combat-fit recruits in the basic
              military skills to prepare them for advanced vocational training.
              The programme includes weapon training with the SAR 21 rifle which
              will teach recruits technical handling and marksmanship skills; a
              Battle Inoculation Course that simulates a real battlefield; a
              Field Camp which develops basic survival skills; progressive
              training to complete a 24-km route march which builds combat
              fitness and endurance; and hand grenade training.<br> <em><span style="font: inherit;">For those who fail to achieve the
              NAPFA test silver award, they are required to undergo an 8-week

              BMT</span></strong><br> As evidence has shown that obese recruits are able to achieve
              optimum fitness levels and weight loss in about 19 weeks, the new
              BMT programme for recruits with Body Mass Index (BMI) scores
              exceeding 27.0 will be 19 weeks. This BMT programme is designed to
              help obese recruits improve their physical fitness progressively
              while equipping them with basic soldiering skills and
              knowledge.</p>

              programme. The new 9-week PES B2 BMT programme will be conducted
              for recruits who are medically fit for deployment in selected
              combat and combat support vocations, such as signal operators,
              combat medics and naval system operators. These recruits will be
              given a new medical classification of PES B2, in place of the
              existing PES C1 classification. This is to ensure that the medical
              classification of our soldiers is consistent with their deployment.
              The new 9-week programme will include customised physical training,
              as well as basic combat training to prepare them for their combat
              and combat support roles.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES C
              BMT</span></strong><br> The 9-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES C recruits. This
              programme will include light physical training and vocational
              training to prepare them for combat service support vocations, such
              as service medic, and those related to logistics and
              administration.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES E

              <h2 class="news_brief"><em>Source: Newspapers, ChannelNewsAsia.com</em><br><em>12 October 2013</em><br></h2>
              <p><em>Be a guide, friend and mentor -- that is what 307 new SAF Officers were told to do for the men they will lead.</em></p>
              <p>National
                           Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan said this at their commissioning on 
                          Saturday, which took place after they underwent nearly 10 months of 
                          rigorous training at the Officer Cadet School.</p>
              <p>Among them is 
                          Second Lieutenant Muhammad Idris Sadli, who lost his mother to cancer 
                          just two months after being enlisted to the cadet school.</p>
              <p>Shortly after, his younger brother died from leukaemia.</p>
              <p>Second
                           Lieutenant Muhammad Idris, an infantry officer, said: "My dad will 
                          always tell me that my mum will be very proud of me if I just carry on 
                          with where I'm going."</p>
              <p>Second Lieutenant Silas Neo had trained to be a pilot, but did not make the cut.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old then opted to become a weapons systems officer, but was again unsuccessful.</p>
              <p>But
                           with the support of his family, he is now Overall Best Trainee, and 
                          will join the Republic of Singapore Air Force's (RSAF)'s radar systems 
                          team.</p>
              <p>Second Lieutenant Neo, C3 Radar, RSAF, said: "I had to put in more effort in whatever I did, so I guess all my effort paid off.</p>
              <p>"I
                           guess the Best Trainee was just a bonus for me because I gained a lot 
                          more through this journey, you know like my personal values, and I could
                           be a better leader."</p>
              <p>Second Lieutenant Loh Ying, meanwhile, stood out from the crowd as one of three women officers in the cohort.</p>
              <p>The Mass Communications graduate was awarded Best in Physical Training in her vocation.</p>
              <p>Second
                           Lieutenant Loh Ying, an artillery officer, said: "In the army, a lot of
                           different people come together, from different backgrounds, so 
                          everybody brings a fresh, new perspective.</p>
              <p>“It doesn't mean that just because you're a woman, you bring a certain kind of perspective."</p>
              <p>National Development Minister Khaw urged the officers to be good role models for National Service recruits.</p>
              <p>Mr
                           Khaw said: "Many of them have grown up in a period of relative peace 
                          and stability and may not understand why we need a strong defence and 
                          NS.</p>
              <p>“As their commander, help them find their commitment to 
                          NS. Instil in them the belief that they can play a part in defending our
                           home and our way of life."</p>
              <p>Mr Khaw also told the officers that the strength of the SAF lies in its people. </p>

              <p><strong>Enlistment schedule </strong></p>
              <p>Pre-enlistees will be required to complete pre-enlistment procedures 
                      and medical screening before they are scheduled for enlistment.</p>
              <p>They will be scheduled for enlistment into the respective enlistment 
                      intakes based on numerous considerations such as the medical &amp; 
                      physical fitness and educational qualifications of the individual, as 
                      well as the manpower and operational requirements of the various 
                      intakes.</p>
              <p><em>In general, pre-enlistees from the same 'A' level/International 
                      Baccalaureate (IB) or polytechnic cohort are enlisted over two intakes 
                      due to capacity constraints at the NS training schools. For example, 'A'
                       level/ IB holders who graduate in Nov/Dec are typically enlisted in the
                       Dec and Mar quarterly intakes. Polytechnic diploma holders who graduate
                       in Mar/Apr are typically enlisted in the Jun and Sep quarterly intakes.
                       ITE certificate holders and pre-enlistees with other qualifications are
                       enlisted throughout the year. </em></p>
              <p>Pre-enlistees can only be assigned to an enlistment intake after 
                      being certified medically fit for enlistment at the pre-enlistment 
                      medical screening.  Pre-enlistees will receive Enlistment Notices to 
                      notify them of their enlistment date about 2 months before their 
                      scheduled enlistment.</p>

              SAFTI Military Institute on Saturday evening.</p>
              <p>Minister, Prime Minister's Office, Second Minister for the

              rigorous training at the Officer Cadet School.</p>
              <p>The newly commissioned officers will go on to assume command, instructional or staff appointments in the SAF.<br> <br>Ms
               Fu congratulated the graduands for successfully completing the Officer 
              Cadet Course and reminded them that the strength of the SAF lies not

              the Royal Thai Army and one from the Vietnam People's Army. Ms Fu said

              Ministry of Defence officials and SAF officers, as well as families and

              <p>542 officer cadets were commissioned as officers of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) on Sunday evening.</p>
              <p>Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security 
              and Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Teo Chee Hean, reviewed the officers 
              at the commissioning parade at the SAFTI Military Institute.</p>
              <p>This cohort of graduands comprised of 441 Army, 55 Air Force and 46 Navy officer cadets.</p>
              <p>Speaking at the parade, Mr Teo emphasised the important role that the
               SAF officers play as commanders in developing a sense of mission in 
              their men and women.</p>
              <p>"Lead by example and demonstrate a strong sense of conviction in 
              whatever you do… Help them to adjust to life in National Service, and to
               take personal ownership over national defence," he said.</p>
              <p>The parade marked the completion of 38 weeks of rigorous training at the Officer Cadet School.</p>
              <p>The newly-commissioned officers will move on to assume command, instructional or staff appointments in the SAF.</p>
              <p>Also present at the parade were Members of Parliament, senior

              <p>Well, at least now you are using your brains to think more about when the intakes are.</p>
              <p>Therefore, that is, <br>The enhanced leadership batches' enlistment months + the length of the PTP/BMT periods = OCS/ SCS intakes.</p>
              <p>See, now you are able to switch on and have just enable the use of your brains to think.</p>
              <p>If you still cannot think, then you know that you just might not have the ability and quality to make the cut to make it to command schools (OCS/ SCS). The selected ones for OCS and SCS need to think more, hard and long to plan and action.</p>
              <p>Perhaps it is better for you to just switch off your brains to be posted to a vocational school to trained as an enlisted man. Because as enlisted men, there are much more longer free time (admin time) for men to relax/ sleep in bunk/ canteen breaks when the commanders are still working to plan and do more things in the planning room.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
