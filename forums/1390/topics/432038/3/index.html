              <p>Recently I've went for my medical checkup and they told me to
              come back, since I had two specialist appointment letters. I just
              went to my specialists for my skin and for my foot, I wonder if
              anyone could estimate what PES I'll be in. </p>
              <p>So the skin specialist say that I have "Severe cholinergic
              urticaria with physical dermographism, and is triggered by heat,
              sweat, physical activity, and temperature changes." </p>
              <p>I also have flat feet, which is pretty bad not sure what my
              doctor wrote in the letter because he sealed it up. My Canadian
              doctor said that I have severe pes planovalgus and Posterior Tibial
              Tendon Dysfunction, and also said repetitive jumping could injure
              my foot condition.</p>
              <p>So if anyone could help me out I'd be very appreciative, my
              second appointment with the M/O is coming up soon.</p>

              <p>Hey guys,</p>
              <p>I had a couple of questions and I was wondering if anyone can
              help me out. I'm going to start off with a background on my
              situation.</p>
              <p>I'm enlisting to BMTC HQ on November 24 for Obese BMT. I've been
              studying in the US for the last 3-4 years and had my education
              listed at "A-Level Equivalent". Apparently in the SG military
              system, they also logged that I requested deferment while I was
              still in school because I studied for a semester at Harvard. I did
              pretty decent in school and was president of a couple of
              societies. </p>
              <p>My questions are:</p>
              <p>1. Is the PES BP BMT going to be as chill as people make it out
              to be? -- what should I expect?</p>
              <p>2. Being a foreign student, I heard that I'd get a lot of shit
              from the commanders, how true is this? </p>
              <p>3. What can I do during BMT to not get totally shit all over and
              marked for being a foreign student?</p>
              <p>4. Will my past record that is logged into their system play any
              role in determining if I get put through the "leadership" batch or
              not, despite being in PES BP?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks and I really appreciate all the advice I can get.</p>

              <p>Correct me if I'm wrong but in the past they used to tell you which school you were in. But now they just state BMTC HQ. Only when you report will you know which school you are in - whether school 1/2/3/4. I take it you're the PTP JC Batch? <br><br>From what others have posted on other forums the "unofficial rumour" is that the earliest intake tends to be school 4 but once again, nobody knows for certain. Alternatively you can check http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/army/About_BMT/Enlistment_Dates.html</p>

              <p> Don't worry most probably you may get it in December. I have a friend in PES B2 who also has not received his letter.</p>
              <p>You can refer to this http://iprep.ns.sg/enlistment-schedule.html</p>
              <p>I think your enlistment is most probably in 9th May (as the schedule indicates). It may be Feb though but I have a friend who graduated last year who's also in PES B2 who received his letter around December and enlisted in May. Don't worry too much! All the best for A Levels! :D</p>

              <p>guys, would appreciate if you can help me on this.</p>
              <p>i am 22 this year, was suppose to be in june intake this year, however due to some unfinished school stuff was forced to make a deferment. (retained a year, sec 5 for sec sch, poly held back 1 sem. that explain my old age.)</p>
              <p>on 1st of september i went down to cmpb immediately to cancel the deferment after finish settling stuff from my school, the office told me to call next week for my enlistment date.</p>
              <p>i'd been calling for near 2 months and yet the enlistment office couldn't give me my enlistment date, i failed napfa and i know the next possible intake will be on december.</p>
              <p>I would really wish to get in on the next possible intake which is december because i am really very old and wish to get out at a younger age which is 24, if i were to drag any longer i would ORD at age 25 and that's way too old.</p>
              <p>i am pretty desperate to try almost everything i can if i am able to get in earlier. is there anyway i can do to secure my enlistment date on dec this year? (real life example of people that can get early enlistment)</p>
              <p>any help would be very much appreciated. Thanks for reading</p>

              sem. that explain my old age.)</p>
              <p>on 1st of september i went down to cmpb immediately to cancel
              the deferment after finish settling stuff from my school, the
              office told me to call next week for my enlistment date.</p>
              <p>i'd been calling for near 2 months and yet the enlistment office
              couldn't give me my enlistment date, i failed napfa and i know the
              next possible intake will be on december.</p>
              <p>I would really wish to get in on the next possible intake which
              is december because i am really very old and wish to get out at a
              younger age which is 24, if i were to drag any longer i would ORD
              at age 25 and that's way too old.</p>
              <p>i am pretty desperate to try almost everything i can if i am
              able to get in earlier. is there anyway i can do to secure my
              enlistment date on dec this year? (real life example of people that
              can get early enlistment)</p>
              <p>any help would be very much appreciated. Thanks for reading</p>
                            </div>

              I guess that will depends on whether or not have you cleared your medical check up at mcc, you're not cleared and not given a pes status then the enlistment branch will not post you for any form of enlistment as of now. If you're done with the check up it will take approximately 4 months to receive your enlistment letter. I went for my check up in June 2011 and received my enlistment letter in October 2011. In addition, if you fail Napfa then you'll be in the PTP phase in december, however, if you're classified under obese you're be enlisting in May next year. So I don't know whether or not have you cleared your medical check up cause you mentioned only deferment from NS. I hope the above information helps.

              <p> Don't worry most probably you may get it in December. I

              <p>You can refer to this

              <p>I think your enlistment is most probably in 9th May (as the
              schedule indicates). It may be Feb though but I have a friend who
              graduated last year who's also in PES B2 who received his letter
              around December and enlisted in May. Don't worry too much! All the

              <p>Haha yea looks like the schedule was correct!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hmm from Mindef's definition B2 is fit for some combat positions but since there's the land code L3, it probably means that the stations that you have to be excused from rules you out from combat since it stated "combat service support"as opposed to someone who has B2L1 maybe?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Combat Service Support can be logistics, driver, medic perhaps?</p>
              <p>B1 basically means fit for most so aside from combat service support B1 can go for combat vocations also. B1 has to take full IPPT while B2 can be excused for 2 static stations so yea. Being B2 will probably mean you can't qualify for command school though but there may be some outdoor activities just a little more limited? I'm not sure though.</p>
