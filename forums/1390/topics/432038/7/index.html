              <p>1) don't pack so much because BMT u'll are required to book out in your full pack</p>
              <p>2) since you are not bringing a lot, a small back pack with your daily usage things like toothb brush/paste, underwears etc.....</p>
              <p>3)I'm sure you can but why don't bring your family?</p>
              <p>4)Just a couple of shirts here and there. Use hand lah.</p>
              <p>5)Bunk? normal king koil mattress bed lah...no air con.</p>
              <p>6)keep doing until u get some results, or else stay back for RT.</p>

              Hi
              
              My son just completed his BMT.  I managed to gather some info from my colleagues and my comments as follows:
              
              1. Follow the list given by SAF
              2. 2 to 3 electrical tapes preferably black
              3. Permanent markers
              4. Ball points
              5. 2 to 3 toilet rolls just in case you need more
              6. Non camera HP with spare battery as they don't allow you to bring charger
              
              Hope it helps.

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I am enlisting on the 5th of September. But however I have some issues with my knee as they tend to hurt whenever I walk around, not neccessarily when I do rigorious exercises and activities such as squats would really hurt my knee. I have seen my local doctor and done several X-rays on my knee, but to no avail. My doctor recommends me to do a MRI, which is expensive, to further diagnose the problem.</p>
              <p>I am not sure whether I should head down to CMPB to have my medical condition revaluated as my date of enlistment might be pushed back. </p>
              <p>What further action is recommended?</p>

              <p>Ok this is really late/ irrelevant but I have got to try. </p>
              <p>I was graded PES B2L3 for Lazy Eye and thus, was also excused range. I am enlisting on the 9th May 2012, the earliest batch at 0845 hours. So I am going to ask some questions and I hope to receive some replies ASAP because I've only got 6days of civilian life left. I looked up the stuffs on MINDEF and it is very vague.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) What exactly is excused range? Does that mean that i must handle rifles and grenades? </p>
              <p>2) The impression that I have on MINDEF website is that only PES A/B1 recruits go through the Battle Innoculation Course. But my friend said we have to leopard crawl as well. Im confused. So do we go for the BIC as well? </p>
              <p>3) Do I get to go back company line during field camp? Because I am L3. </p>
              <p>4) I didnt know that we have to go for IPPT/IPT/RT every year after we ORD until 40 years old( or I would have fought against it) - which is complete bullshit imo. Im chronically unfit (ill be happy hitting 16 mins for 2.4) so I can see the hassle of RT for 3 months every year. Plus I dont foresee myself being placed on the MINDEF Reserve List by the age of 30 given the limited service vocations that is offered to me. So is there anyway I can just downPES to PES C2L1 using slight flatfoot as an excuse?</p>

              <p>Thanks in advance. Its very hard to get information because mine is a relatively new PES</p>

              <p>Good questions. I can't answer them, but I can tell you that the IPPT time tables will give you an extra 20 seconds to complete your 2.4 run for every 5 years you age.</p>
              <p>And if you don't pass IPPT as a reservist, you will do RT which is conducted on saturdays. Mindef is authorized to call you up to a maximum 40 days a year, all training included.</p>
              <p>Can't you find something to downPES yourself with?</p>

              <p>This is with respect to reservist, you have 2 years to figure this out.</p>
              <p>As for your NSF period, they do have weekend training for those who don't pass IPPT. I think SOC (run + obstacles wearing equipment and rifle) will be a problem for you too. So try and hurry.</p>

              <p>Hi People,</p>
              <p>I do have a urgent question that i hope someone is able to enlighten me about.</p>
              <p>My question is this: Lets say MinDef has alr sent a letter to you stating you are to report for enlisting on 8 June for Physical Training Pharse for not clearing the Napfa Test.</p>
              <p>Is it  possible to retake the Napfa Test and get a Silver award to avoid the Physical Training Phrase and let the enlistment to be rescheduled to a later date for the actual BMT itself?</p>
              <p>Cuz i have heard that some friend of another friend of mine has done soon a couple of years back.. about 2 years back. Not really sure if it stills applys now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ThankYou very much</p>

              <p>Hello everyone! </p>
              <p>I was just wondering about the issue of shaving in during BMT cos I'm a person who has to shave every morning.</p>
              <p>Is it a must to shave everyday or is the stubble-ly look allowed?</p>
              <p>Thank you!</p>
