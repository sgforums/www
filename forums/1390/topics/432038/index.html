              <p>Here on an island off the coast of Changi, the journey from a
              civilian to soldier begins, the symbolic rite of passage from Boys
              to Men. Recruits take a Ferry into Pulau Tekong and are enlisted
              directly to their respective companies, where they will spend the
              next few months training beside their fellow comrades and
              commanders .<br> <br> It is a tough, but rewarding journey, recruits not only learn
              military skills, but life skills in the process that will benefit
              them many years ahead.<br> <br> Basic Military Training (BMT) marks the beginning of military life
              for all Singaporean males at the age of 18. It is the transition
              from fresh-faced teenager to combat soldier.<br> <br> They learn basic soldiering skills, which include weapon handling,
              individual field craft, etc to enhance their survivability in the
              battlefield.<br> <br> Besides the training in basic military skills, Physical Training
              (PT) lessons are also conducted to build up the soldiers' physique
              and stamina, to instill a firm sense of discipline and teamwork
              amongst the soldiers.</p>

              <h1><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Deferment and Disruption</strong></span></em></h1>
              <div id="left">
              <p><strong>Q1. What is the difference between deferment and disruption?</strong><br> A1. Deferment occurs before one enlists while disruption occurs during the course of
                    National Service.<br> (i)One is eligible for deferment to continue his studies if he fulfills the necessary criteria.<br> (ii)One is eligible for disruption for GCE ‘A’ Levels/Local Medicine Studies if he
                    fulfills the necessary criteria (refer to the disruption for GCE ‘A’ Levels below[1a &amp; 1b]).</p>
              <p><strong>Q1a. What are the criteria for one to disrupt National Service (NS) to retake GCE ‘A’
                    Levels (Local)?</strong><br> A1a. To retake GCE ‘A’ Levels, one must meet one of the two following criteria :<br> (i)A fail in General Paper (GP), i.e. score of ‘S’ and below,<br> (ii)A fail in 2 or more H2 subjects, i.e. score of ‘S’ and below.</p>
              <p><br><strong> Q1b. How can one go applying for disruption?</strong><br> A1b. The servicemen must first seek approval from the school to take him in for the
                    retake. Then, with the letter of confirmation from the school, he must submit it to the
                    Recruit Management for processing purposes. Once the application is processed,
                    NSREC will inform Recruit Management of the outcome. Servicemen will be notified of
                    the outcome thereafter, and any out-processing needed will be carried out (exchange of
                    SAF 11B for NRIC, overpayment and etc.).</p>
              <p><br><strong> Q2. Where can one enquire/apply for deferment?</strong><br> A2. As mentioned earlier, since deferment occurs before one enlists, one should contact
                    CMPB to enquire/apply for it. One can call the NS Call Centre: 1800 3676767 should
                    he want to enquire/apply for it.</p>

              <p><br><strong> Q2. What is the selection criteria for OCS/SCS?</strong><br> A2. It is every aspect of BMT, like the MAPAS, training, education level, medical status,
                    peer appraisal, SIT Test, EI End that constitutes to the selection. CPC and NSPD
                    consolidates the results and the selection is done after evaluating the results.</p>

              <p><strong>Q1. Can time off be allowed for trainees to attend interview during BMT?</strong><br> A1. No time off will be given. Interviews cannot interfere with the training programme.
                    Trainees are advised to rescheduled their interview to their block leave period after
                    BMT.</p>

              <h1><strong>FAQs (General)</strong></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <div id="left">
              <p><strong>Q1. Are the recruits allowed to use their handphones in camp?</strong><br> A1. Yes, they are allowed to do so during their free time after meals and between
                    lessons. However, they are not allowed to bring handphone chargers to camp. This is to
                    prevent electrical overloads if too many recruits charge their handphones at any one
                    time. Instead, they are advised to bring additional handphone batteries.</p>
              <p><br><strong> Q2. Will the recruits get to book out every weekend?</strong><br> A2. No, it depends on their training schedule. An example is the initial two-weekends
                    adjustment period where recruits are adapting to military life and will not be able to
                    book out.</p>
              <p><br> <strong>Q3. Why are recruits not allowed to board and alight from vehicles outside SAF Ferry
                    terminal?</strong><br> A3. The road outside SAF Ferry Terminal is very narrow, as such, alighting outside SAF
                    Ferry Terminal will be a road hazard and pose a danger to the recruits. To ensure the
                    safety of recruits, we have catered for scheduled buses to ferry the recruits to and from
                    Pasir Ris Bus Interchange.</p>
              <p><br><strong> Q4. Can the recruits go for overseas holidays during the block leave period?</strong><br> A4. Yes, however, some of them may have to stay back for make-up training or to
                    perform scheduled regimental duties. They have to seek their commanders’ advice prior
                    to making any arrangements for overseas holidays during this period.</p>
              <p><strong>Q5. What are the telephone numbers to call in case of an emergency (e.g. NOK warded in ICU)?</strong><br> A5. Your son will provide you with a company assignment slip. It includes the contact
                    number of the Company Office. In the event of an emergency, you can call your son’s
                    Company Office. Alternatively, you may also call the Ops Room which is manned 24
                    hours. Additionally, you can click the ‘Contact Us’ on our sub-page to view important
                    contact numbers.</p>
              <p><strong>Q6. Where will recruits be posted to after their BMT?</strong><br> A6. The recruits may be posted to either Command Schools (e.g. Officer Cadet School
                    or Specialist Cadet School) or other training Schools where they continue with their next
                    phase of vocation training, e.g. as medics, signallers or admin support/supply assistants.</p>
              <p><br><strong> Q7. Is there such a thing as the “Tekong Cough”?</strong><br> A7. We would like to assure that there is no form of infection that is specific to the
                    island. Nevertheless, it is known that any increase in physical stress can affect a
                    person’s susceptibility to infections. New recruits also require time to acclimatize to
                    Tekong’s weather and communal living with common spaces. The SAF Medical Corps
                    conducts regular respiratory disease surveillances on Pulau Tekong, and there is no
                    evidence that the incidence of cough or other respiratory infections on the island are
                    higher.</p>
              <p><br><strong> Q8. Is the tap water in Pulau Tekong safe to drink?</strong><br> A8. The water supply in Pulau Tekong is subjected to the same standards as that on
                    mainland Singapore. The Public Utilities Board (PUB) performs regular testing of the
                    water on Pulau Tekong, which is piped from the mainland. Water tanks on the island are
                    also washed and maintained regularly by a certified contractor.</p>

              <h1><strong>Use of Religious Apparels</strong></h1>
              <div id="left">
              <p><strong>Q1. Are the use of Religious/Cultural Apparels allowed in the SAF?</strong><br> A1. No, they are not as long as they are visible and it affects one’s performance,
                    safety, hygiene and uniformity and image of the SAF (Chapter 2, Section 2.33 of G1’s
                    Army Dress Instructions).</p>
              <p><br><strong> Q2. On what occasion is one allowed to wear the Religious/Cultural Apparels?</strong><br> A2. One is allowed to wear as long as they are not in the SAF uniform and when they
                    are outside of camp. The use of such apparels are strictly not allowed in camps and
                    during training.</p>
