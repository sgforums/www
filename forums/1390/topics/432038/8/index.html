              <p>Hi! i'm quite new here, but i'll be enlisting directly to 1st Singapore Infantry Regiment at Mandai Hill camp, which means i'll skip pulau tekong and go do my ptp and then bmt at mandai hill camp, as i never take my napfa test but still manage to get Pes B1 combat fit.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> Now my enlistment is on 06/09/2012 but from now that i'm posting to my enlistment day, i need to do re-module for 2 modules only for my year 1 Diploma course at Lasalle which starts next year 2013.(i suppose to be year 2 by now)</p>
              <p>Now the thing that confuses me is that, i've already applied for deferment last year and was accepted, and then i had to go for a 2nd medical check-up after that as my previous medical screening and napha test results had expired. Then this year, i got a letter stating for direct enlistment but i still want to go for studies, so how? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>From now July til September 2012 got some time left to clear things before i get another approval for deferment or, i can't get another deferment again? Plus i'm 21 this year. </p>
              <p>So basically, i dunno whether cmpb still have a record of my (previous approval of deferment), (or there was a slight error), (or there wasnt any error and i really have to go in). And my previous qualification is Nitec from ite.</p>
              <p>And previously after i ended my napha test in ite, i got my gold standard, went for medical screening, and got posted to Police force but i choose to defer as i already got into Lasalle in August 2011 and the deferment was approved. (Which leads back to the first 2 paragraphs of this post)</p>
              <p>Any very very kind soul willing to clarify with me? help me understand more? or any tertiary people out there that understands my problems? i hope someone replies. Thanks! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
