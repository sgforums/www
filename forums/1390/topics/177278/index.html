As for other procedures, go to your unit S1 branch and ask for advice. They will know.<br><br>They will usually give you a clearance form and tell you to go for your FFI. Its a very uncomplicated procedure.<br><br>In addition, talk to your OC and CSM and try to resolve this issue. Make it clear to the officer that you do not appreciate this nonsense. Can talk to unit S1 as well. He will prabably be interested to know about this admin rooster-up. But i do not think you need to go this far. Your OC/CSM has careers to think about, so i think they will be willing to put a stop to this nonsense.<br><br>Remember, the squeaking gate gets the oil.

            <div class='col-md body'>3sg, use ur own initiative to find out from ur medical centre whether the docket is with them or not.  And whether they recieved it or not.  They have to track who  took these documents one.<br><br>2ndly, u can inform the medical centre urself abt ur impending ord ffi thats not done yet.  U must also let ur chief clerk know. Not everything must go thru officer.<br><br>finally, clearance form also can get from ur chief clerk one, aka orderly room. Just request for one copy.  Start getting signatures and returning stores 1 week b4 ord.  The final 3 signature, eg CO, CSM, RSM can get 3 -4 WORKING days before ORD.<br><br>In otherwords, DIY!</div>

No, you schedule it yourself. Go to the medical center and make an FFI appointment.<br><br>2. Your docket is already in the medical center records room. If it isn't, inform your superiors and demand an investigation. Someone is gonna get serious sh*t. Luckily, it isn't going to be you.<br><br>3. Go to medical center and schedule an FFI.

I highly recommend what the others have said. Make noise. Lots of it. What that officer is doing to you is extremely unethical and conduct unbecoming of an officer.

Any ideas anyone?</div></blockquote>hee.. can i join in ... haa..<br><br>1. i have never heard of officer schedule FFI for NSF, its done by the clerks.  Talk to your chief clerk, and curry favour abit, for info chief clerk usually quiet powerful in unit.  Every CO / Head / blah blah.. also give face to her, coz of her yrs of service plus lots of admin have to go thru her.  She is the best person to get help.<br><br>2. The clerk will be the one to send dockets to medical centre usually lah.. And yes there are time where dockets get lost in unit, and sorry such things usually will not get charge.  But will have lots of problem on admin side, they will redo the dockets without much back date info of your medical only..<br><br>3.  If all the above don't works, then sign on lor.. wahaha.. kidding..<br>you can always request higher interview with CO or etc.. If all these people try to be funny, go to the MP.  MP Letter shoot to camp, by 24 hr have to return with good answer by the CO or etc... which ever is higher authority...<br><br>p/s: Last not least, to my experience units are very afraid of MP letter.  Coz very ma fan.. lots of explanation to be done.  But before going to MP, get all evidences or etc.. records of threats from your officers.  So that the MP know what to do..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>hope all these can help you..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Since then, it has fuelled his dislike towards me. The torn ligament is a legit problem, by the way.<br><br>One side of the story? Even if i am a chao keng (which i am not), even if there are problems with my character that i am unaware of, and which causes him to be mean to me, <strong>NOTHING</strong> can explain and warrant why he can abuse his power as a Regular officer to make petty things like ORD clearance hard for a NSF. For the past few months especially after my long MC, he has threatened me with stuff like making sure no local University will accept me or making sure i won't get a COS, just to see my reaction.<br><br>Please understand, the reason i only quoted "one side" of the story is because it is irrelevant as i am asking for advice about this situation now, not to complain about what a tyrant my officer is.<br><br>And thanks for all the advices. I can schedule my medical FFI on my own, but for my dental FFI, as i will need to go to other camps, i still need them to schedule it for me. Much appreciated for all the help again.</div>
