Since then, it has fuelled his dislike towards me. The torn ligament is a legit problem, by the way.<br><br>One side of the story? Even if i am a chao keng (which i am not), even if there are problems with my character that i am unaware of, and which causes him to be mean to me, [b]NOTHING</strong> can explain and warrant why he can abuse his power as a Regular officer to make petty things like ORD clearance hard for a NSF. For the past few months especially after my long MC, he has threatened me with stuff like making sure no local University will accept me or making sure i won't get a COS, just to see my reaction.<br><br>Please understand, the reason i only quoted "one side" of the story is because it is irrelevant as i am asking for advice about this situation now, not to complain about what a tyrant my officer is.<br><br>And thanks for all the advices. I can schedule my medical FFI on my own, but for my dental FFI, as i will need to go to other camps, i still need them to schedule it for me. Much appreciated for all the help again. [/b]</blockquote>hi.. no worries about dental appointment.. u can always book it urself de.  You can try calling 63813543 to book a dental appointment at paya lebar air base.<br><br>for ffi, and other issues regarding clearances, like what the above mentioned messages, u can get it from ur s1 branch and do it urself.<br><br>for certificate of service, no worries. it is something that will be given to u when u ord. its part of a package.<br><br>for a pc.. he dun have much in turns of power when u are about to ord.. unless u argue, fight with him.  no one can stop ur ord clearances unless u are charged and send in db.<br><br>for the uni part, dun worry. i assure u, as long u are not charged and court marshalled under the penal code, u can always get into a local uni. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>i understand u are not here to complain about anything etc.  But i suggest u follow this up by asking ur RSM to request an interview with CO regarding this.  If he is this unreasonable and picking on u, if im u, i fuck up his career.  after an interview by CO, u can follow this up with ST forum or with ur MP.<br><br>Some people dun deserve chances.  if he get away with it, another guy will suffer someday.<br><br>ur chocie nia! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>happy ord~ cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with LazerLordz on the part where you need to get along with the S1 Branch Clerks. Among all the staff branches, they are the most useful to you as they can advise you on your welfare benfits, leave, discipline matters (pertaining to Summary Trial) and ORD Matters. Try not to find the Chief Clerk as she is usually swamp by work. If you want to talk to someone with a bit of weight one leh, try the Asst Chief Clerk (Usually a NSF holding the rank of 3SG) or the DYS1/AS1.<br><br>Thumb of the rule, NO ONE IN THE UNIT CAN EXTEND YOUR ORD WITHOUR YOUR AUTHORISATION.<br><br>It is a criminal offence to hold anyone NRIC, hence the unit is not allow to hold your NRIC and not return you upon ORD. However saying this, we do need you to complete your Medical and Dental FFI and the Unit clearance form to ensure that you do not suffer from any long term injury besides those prior ur enlistment and that all stores had been returned or paid for. IT IS NOT A MUST FOR YOU TO PASS YOUR IPPT/SOC TO ORD, but it is for your benfit if you can attain a GOLD for IPPT...extra $200 leh.<br><br>BTW, go through the chain of command if you want to complain ya. At least you won't get further blacklisted.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just make sure that your officer isn't going to be following you to your reservist unit before complaining about you.
