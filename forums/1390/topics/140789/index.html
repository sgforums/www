            <div class='col-md body'>Three to four companies share a gym at Tekong. For my BMT coy, we were lucky cuz we had a lecture theatre which we shared with the neighbouring company. The other companies had to conduct lectures in training sheds :p<br><br>anyway, i do agree that the time spent on waiting can be cut down. i had once waited for 1 hour for a lesson to start. :s waiting for 1 hour for a VIP to arrive (e.g. CO) is fine as long as there is someone (e.g. instructors) to interact with while waiting (think this is the SOP?), but for lessons, we can just fall in about 10-20 minutes before lesson start and proceed. the other times can be better spent resting in bunk or non-official admin time.<br><br>imo i feel that i'm somewhat detached from the outside world since i enlisted, partly because of the lack of newspapers being supplied to my training unit. Back at tekong there will be daily supplies of TODAY newspaper. In the present world it's important for everyone to be informed of current affairs hence newspapers can be supplied to everyone, not only to the specs n officers..</div>
