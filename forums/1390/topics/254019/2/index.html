I believe it is a entire new ball game.<br><br>For example if you put on a drawing board for 7/24 deterrence. than what kind of deterrence we are lookin at or threats? Function of units to be capable of deterrence to response within certain time frame. how many man etc....recalling....etc.. unknown human factors delay factors.<br><br>after your planing, you can almost throw in a dice to caculate probabilities. i think limited resources and structure of SAF does play a part. After all Defcon and Recon does required resource to support and communicate down chain.  As for SAF it has huge responsibilities especially at the top.I am sure the information they received does not filter down.<br><br>So apply some imagination to assume u r seating at the top and look down. What situation to be in this Security threat level ? is there higher or lower level?<br><br>Also transforming an institution like SAF also takes time its still learning. It probably could be better as there are always room for improvement.<br><br></div>

So, if you have 3 workers rotating, you achieve 48 man-hours in 3 days.<br><br>I would rather have a 3 x 8-hr shift. Workers can go home and sleep all they want, and I am not going to pay them for sleeping in. This way, I can achieve 72 man-hours in 3 days.<br><br>Maybe, you still don't see the difference, because time is not of a concern to you. </div></blockquote>Because it is not possible to do that.<br>For example i have 6 teams.<br>1 team on standby<br>2 teams on reserve<br>2 teams on training<br>1 team on off.<br><br>How to rotate like that?<br><br>Anyway believe me when i say some units like my is getting something like that and it's not fun but u cant do it anyway else.<br><br>Otherwise you'd be using almost 3 teams to cover 24hrs instead of 1 team.<br>and considering u gotta give them rest time and stuff.If you get an activation during the change over from team 2 to team 3 then you will send out team 3 fair enough.But then team 2 will need rest and team 1 will be resting still.<br><br>Leaving you with 3 teams and 2 half dead teams..so if u can 3 activation how to respond?then the next day how?who does the duty incase of activation?<br><br>You would seriously need more manpower to put 3 shifts a day.Considering u have to rotate the shifts if not the men will kpkb <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And really the SCDF and even Police guys are actually doing more then the SAF on a daily basis<br><br>PS:im trying to put my point across without ermm......letting out classified info so pls spare me if it doesnt look as impressive.But trust me it's because of this 24hrs on 1 or 2 days off that we're kept safe <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
