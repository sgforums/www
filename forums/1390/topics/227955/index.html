Anyway, mindef is rich. My brother's unit was once based in suntec office. But the rent is too expensive, therefore they recently move to cmpb.<br><br>I would not be suprised if they really increase it.

That is why I am asking around if anyone heard any rumors on it.<br><br>Secondly, I am confident that the last increase from $240 to $350 was in 2002. It is because I enlisted in Aug 2002, and my 1st allowance was more then $500, 2 weeks for Aug plus 1 month for Sept.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Thirdly, I might have make a mistake in TCH's son, I apologise for that. But I sort of remember that when they announced the reduction in NSF serving time, TCH's son was serving, and the news on the ground was that is it because his son is serving, that is why the serving time is reduced? But the offical reason that they give was that SAF is moving to a 3G army and as they will be a influx of Dragon year people enlisting, therefore, there is enough manpower for the next 10 years.<br><br>Lastly, Gahmen increase everything on a silly reason. Just take a look @ the GST.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>PS: Do not assume that all people are naive.
