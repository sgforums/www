Don't worry about it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>For some people I think it'll do them a world of good. Give them more opportunities to mature and once they realise how hard life is in the army they won't waste their time when they can get back to studying. If you go to Poly or take your As after NS you can go straightaway for further studies in the local Unis or work without having to waste anymore time.<br><br>Anyway there's a Voluntary enlistment scheme for those who want to go in early. Minimum age is 16 i think. However it's not well-publicised or encouraged because SAF policy is to let guys finish their poly or JC studies and then enlist. To them, people who haven't gone to poly or JC are not considered to be mature enough to handle army life. I wonder how true that is for most of us.</div>
