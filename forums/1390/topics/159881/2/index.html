If the water is clear and clean they were probably diving elsewhere.<br><br>As for jellyfish stings, don't worry it's common to get stung every now and then. Anyway you'll be wearing a full suit, so @ very least you a) have minimal protection (recommended guidelines are 5mm min. protection against jellyfish in aust, lesser is probably ok as well...) agaiinst jelly fish stings + protected from scratches from rocks. Lethal Jellyfishes are not common around singapore waters...<br><br>Don't worry so much. just enjoy yourself in NDU, but very importantly, take care!<br><br>Good luck!<br></div>
