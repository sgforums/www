The high pay, spending habits, family commitments AKA wife/kids/parents, etc.<br><br>Then getting a reality check: Are u willing to forgo the lifestyle or continue on. I have friends from the WOSE side just lan lan continue another 10 years after the first 6 years because they found out that they cannot get a job that can sustain their current lifestyle especially those who are married with kids.<br><br>So think smart, is not only 6 years, it could be ur whole life.</div>

As expected, the responses so far were what i thought to be the "mental model". BUt i personally feel that it may not be as bad, not sure though. After 6 years, one of the main take away skills might be management. How about further study in a masters related to management or something and u may get a job in the government sector like ministry of foreign affairs or etc. Not sure about the requirement though.<br><br>Also, if you get a good honours degree, can consider further study into PHD,related to management.(can tapped on to the main take away skill) and be a professor. Research area can be management related since u have 6 years of experience. The only thing is that it might or might not be late to do it at age 32(on average)?<br><br>what say u.</div></blockquote>For MBA, I meet a LTC from SAFTI who part-time in NTU as a managment lecturer when I took a management course during my undergrad studies. Basically, he did what u mentioned, part-time a masters in management. So it is possible for u to take that route.<br><br>However, I do have to make a point: I have no idea what he is going to do after his SAF career is over. I am making this point because I was a clerk handing reservists during my active days and I have meet officers who ended up driving taxi, sell insurance after the SAF career ended, therefore, I know it is not always a smooth sailing career even for officers who quit after their stint.<br><br>As for PhD, as mentioned, it is more of u got the basic requirements to get into the PhD than u think u can. At the end of the day, ur grades still count. Plus, please if u do get into PhD, please do not use SAF as an research area because SAF is totally biased organisation where rank outrules common senses.</div>

I often take taxis when in Singapore and a sizable proportion of drivers were ex- captains or majors.<br><br>Another point really is to look at what majors etc actually do. I used to work for a major (SO1) and his work is by no means what could be described as 'challenging'. The clerks in his office could almost certainly do his job - often they do!</div>
