Just as would happen if someone mentioned the cypriot army in Singapore.<br><br>The point is there are so many ex-officers with a wealth of experience floating around in these countries that 6 years in the SAF, an obscure military organization, would at best be of minimum advantage.<br><br>I take your point though - that military experience, wherever it is, is an asset. My point is that most companies would hire locals of equivalent experience and/or with relevant civilian experience over an Ex-SAF officer.<br><br>In short, he should go in eyes wide open and do his own risk assessment!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This guy didnt have plans to continue on after 6 years unless on track or already promoted to LTC so as to be comparable to the scholars (ie:SAFOS), otherwise there's no point in working till 42.<br><br>Some professors have enlightened him that, it's actually possible to do a PHD even when you are in the 30s, as long as you have the mind to do it. Seems like a good plan to him, doing a part time masters during the 6 years, and then do a PHD in the field of public policy, strategic studies or some forms of management (tapping onto the 6 years of service in the government sector)<br><br>Seems good?<br><br>Still a long way to go anyway, working abroad might also be a good alternative.</div>
