              <h1 class="clr">Good for SAF to have regular medical reviews, says MP</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: With regular reviews of its medical protocol, the Singapore
              Armed Forces (SAF) can assure national servicemen and their parents
              that the teenagers are given a thorough medical check—up before they
              are enlisted.</p>
              <p>This is according to MP Michael Palmer, who sits in the Government Parliamentary Committee on Defence and Foreign Affairs.</p>
              <p>Mr Palmer added that it is also important that the SAF is not complacent when it comes to safety procedures during training.</p>
              <p>When
              two SAF servicemen died within two days during training last week, the
              SAF took an unprecedented move of suspending physical and endurance
              training activities for three days to review the procedures.</p>
              <p>Observers
              say the two deaths are a wake—up call on the importance of adhering to
              laid—down principles and procedures in national service training.</p>
              <p>At
              the same time, Singaporeans have shown that they remain confident in
              the ability of the SAF to safeguard the country’s security.</p>
              <p>This
              is important, said Mr Palmer. "If you lose confidence in the SAF, the
              regular forces, their morale would be dampened, the national
              servicemen, their morale would be dampened and people would not want to
              go for their NS reservist training. So you are going to have a force
              that is depleted. From the SAF point of view, no commander wants to
              lose a man. In wartime, yes, but in peacetime no commander wants to
              lose a man.</p>
              <p>"So from the SAF’s point of view, every commander
              would want to make sure that procedures are properly followed and that
              we have confidence in our commanders and military."</p>
              <p>He added:
              "Most of the feedback I get is in terms of timing, in terms of studies
              and whether they would be able to catch up with their studies after
              they go and do their national service. So far, parents have not
              expressed that concern about safety. Overall, my view is people have
              that confidence and we need to maintain that confidence."</p>
              <p>The
              Defence Ministry says the SAF has also received a number of suggestions
              from the public on safe training procedures. These will be evaluated as
              part of its on—going process to ensure that training is carried out
              safely. — CNA/ir</p>
