              <p>from a logical point of view, of course accidents have to happen before the govt looks into the matter. no accident = no one sees it as a problem = no justification to look into the matter</p>
              <p>the
              accident occured while walking, and every trainee is expected to be
              able to walk (duh). also mentioned by kopiosatu, no matter how obese the trainee is, he should be able to walk if not he wont be enlisted at all. furthermore this should be a one-off incident and
              isnt a major problem worth looking really deep into and changing the
              whole training routine for.</p>
              <p>im not saying that recruit andrew cheah's death is insignificant, but it was a one-off accident and does not represent a problem in the training procedure, and even more so not a reason to dissolve NS.</p>

              <p>to add on to my previous post, after 2 death of increasing rank, who would we be seeing next? colonel? BG?</p>
              <p>and IMO, i don't think obese people should be made to run at all. mild obese maybe, but those BMI over 30, if they run sure have problems.</p>
              <p>in school, those obese people with bmi over 30 are usually given long term mc for PE, and that means that they probably have not ran for quite some time, years even.</p>
              <p>in ns, they go make them run 2.4km, etc, sure kill the hell out of them, especially when they have not ran even half that distance, for years.</p>
              <p>and regarding medical screening, i don't think it is done throughly enough. they will only note down any medical problem if the person mention it. I'm sure for most of us, we wouldn't know about any non-obvious medical condition ourselves.</p>

              <p>Totally agree to your last para. It's like I failed my last IPPT window, so made to do RT. Run and run also can't pass. Just last month, due to a chest pain and discomfort in breathing while playing basketball, which eventually led me to see a doc, it turns out that there's some abnormality in my heartbeat! I was thinking, "Heng ah! Didn't collaspe while doing RT!". Now waiting for checkup at National Heart Centre.</p>
              <p>I think most of the NSmen went through RT without proper medical screening.</p>

              <p>I had never done any ECG in my life or whatsoever. Which is the point that I had mentioned, SAF should review their medical screening rather that physical training. I think physical training was already reviewed during the previous deaths. So the relevant authorities should actuall consider the possiblility of other contributing factors.</p>
              <p>I think another forummer had mentioned, something about exposing medically unconditioned person to full combat training. How sia like that?</p>

              <p>Erm, that's why I mentioned 'medically unconditioned'.</p>
              <p>Medical and physical fit are very different thing altogether. Physical fitness can be gradually trained. However, medical fitness, say a soldier has a weaker kidney, physical or military training provided in the Army is not going to help him to acquire a stronger kidney.</p>
              <p>I was refering to medical screening, not physical screening, which is already commonly determined by our NAPFA test prior to our enlistments.</p>

              <p>i think these incidents, no matter how closely spaced they are, are still random and separate incidents..</p>
              <p>nevertheless. good to have MINDEF suspend all trg for 3 days. this will (hopefully) give the public some reassurance that things will be looked into.</p>
              <p>Our young men ( me included, a long long time ago) have faithfully served the country, so I hope a very thorough investigation is conducted into the unfortunate demise of 2 young men, and see how we can best move fwd.</p>
              <p>And I must say, SAF training is still relatively safe, as compared to the demands, safety levels (both phyisical and mental) placed on soldiers from other countries.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE : Singapore's armed forces have been sending cadet officers overseas as an essential part of training to build their confidence.</p>
              <p>Officers are sent to the jungles of the Temburong district in Brunei several times a year for their orientation training.</p>
              <p>Before their jungle training, officers are required to undergo a fitness regime. It involves a detailed assessment on the officer's medical history as well as other medical checks. Trainees also go through endurance runs and other physical conditioning activities.</p>
              <p>There are also thorough briefings and safety checks on equipment used in the training. Medics will also check on the trainees midway through their jungle survival course to assess their mental and physical well-being.</p>
              <p>An eight-day jungle survival course in Brunei will involve an air crash simulation and is carried out in three stages.</p>
              <p>The first stage is the preparation training where officers are briefed on jungle survival skills like how to trap water, how to skin a quail and identify edible plants.</p>
              <p>Then comes the part where trainees learn to "live off the land". At this stage, trainees are dropped off in the jungle and trained to survive on their own for three days.</p>
              <p>The third stage is navigation training where cadets, in small groups of 6 to 7, embark on a 4-kilometre march back to camp.</p>
              <p>It was apparently at the third stage that 20-year-old Office Cadet Clifton Lam Jia Hao collapsed while undergoing jungle orientation training in Brunei. A pilot trainee with the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF), he died one-and-a-half hours after he collapsed, despite efforts by medics to resuscitate him en route to the hospital. - CNA /ls</p>

              <p><br>i don't think they check thoroughly enough during the pre-enlistment checkup. it was kind of sloppily carried out, checking for only common medical conditions.</p>
              <p>for many people, that is their first "full body checkup", and they might not know of any medical condition they might have. i have a friend who lived normally for many years, even doing napfa tests, and finding out that he got 3 holes in the heart.</p>
              <p>i'm not saying the ecg does not check out heart condition, only pointing out that many parts of the body are "neglected" in the med check.</p>
              <p>like yamizi had mentioned, there can be problems with a person's kidneys, liver, intestines, brains etc. any of these problems can become a serious medical condition when triggered, leading to diabetes, kidney failure, etc.</p>
              <p>also, i don't think they check for allergy during med check. 1 syringe of blood certainly ain't enough to test for so many things.</p>
              <p>about bones and joints problem. do they take xrays during the med check? no. yes, they do have a chest xray, but is that enough to sieve out all problems? no. a slipped or protruding disc may most likely be left out during the checkup. when it comes to route march, a protruding disc may actually detiorate into slipped disc, which is like "ouch". one of my seniors actually suffered from slipped disc during his route march, *he got downgraded after that)</p>
              <p>but do you want to do something about it only when the problem has alr occur, and the damage irreversible (yeah, cos this concerns health, ur spinal disc isn't something you can change down and then). or do you want to do smth abt it before the problem occur?</p>
              <p>my cousin was unaware of his kneejoint problem (the joint was wearing thin). he failed his ippt  and was made to do rt, where he ran and ran and ran. it was only after he felt pain in his knees during one of his runs, that he found that his knee joint had been worn out. he now only has knee surgery to look forward to (knee joint replacement).</p>
              <p>how do you monitor ur conditions when you don't even know about them in the first place? yes, you know that you should probably stop when ur felt chest pain, but that's a bit too late, if it is the start of a heart attack. if you have knowledge of any medical condition you might have, it is easier to monitor and control ur condition. e.g. you know u got irregular heartbeat, and you can do smth abt it, like jog at a slower pace etc.</p>
              <p>so, i think that full med check should be conducted by private enterprise, when they really check for everything.otherwise, saf should step up the extensiveness of its med check procedure.</p>
