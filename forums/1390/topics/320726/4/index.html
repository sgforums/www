              <p><br>the ECG machines in the SAF is the old generation type... still using the 6 suction cup nodes n 4 limb clips... hospitals nowadays r using the silicon pads ECG machines.<br><br>if u move/figet a little/breathe nervously, will produce a false reading with the pre-programmed analysis result.<br><br>the old ECG machine got some occasional old machine faults which sometimes produce a false reading. e.g. suctions cups "dirty air", so need to use alcohol swabs to clean the nodes.</p>

              <p>I loved the military so much that as I grew passed that phase, I was glad that I cleared it in one piece. Now the only darn thing is I have ICT at 23rd July, but my Heart Centre appointment is at 25th Aug, I have no idea how to siam doing strenous activities (if there is and as advised by doctors) in my coming ICT.

              <p>And about the SGD500 for the threadmill test, all these are crap, the authorities should absorb it.

              <p><br>SINGAPORE: With the recent sudden deaths of two seemingly healthy national servicemen during training, some pre-enlistees are asking if more information on the demands of national service could be made available.</p>
              <p>Currently, the public can log on to <a href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a> for a slice on life as an NSman.</p>
              <p>Other information sources available include the recruit handbook, public exhibitions and quarterly visits by polytechnics and junior colleges to the Basic Military Training Centre.</p>
              <p>But one pre-enlistee said he and others like him want to know more than just anecdotes about life as an NSman.</p>
              <p>Joel Han, a student, said: "I think I need more information about training schedules and what's the routine like."</p>
              <p><strong>Parents have expressed confidence in SAF's medical screening process, but like Joel's parents, they are still inclined to get a more comprehensive second opinion. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Patricia Lim, mother of Joel, said: "My boy has actually gone through the pre-enlistment health screening by the army. However, I find that it may not be enough because when I run through the medical items, certain items are not included." </strong></p>
              <p><em>In addition to pre-enlistment health issues, parents are also concerned that their sons might be inclined to lie about the true state of their health during national service due to pressure from their peers or platoon commanders. </em></p>
              <p><em>They are suggesting that health checklists be given out prior to each training or exercise, so that national servicemen can give a more honest, but less public, self-appraisal.</em></p>

              <p>the medical checkup + computer test probably takes abt 3 to 4 hours.</p>
              <p>If the medics do the full body checkup, x-rays and everything, it might take the whole day.</p>
              <p>Can the pre-enlistees wait? Some complained that it is taking too long.</p>
              <p>If can't wait, don't complain and ask for more checkups.</p>
              <p>DECLARE ALL ILLNESSES. The medics will do the special cases if need be.</p>
              <p>ECG procedures, people might move or jerk during the test. This will affect the readings, if you think it's fun to redo, think again. They have to make sure the pre - en is okay before they proceed to do the test again.</p>

              <p>Pushing beyond the limits during training will make one stronger.</p>
              <p>However, do you think if the OCT will push on if he knew that he would died if he tried too hard? The thing is that, no one knows that, but everyone tries their best during training. And to consider the kind of background he's from before enlistment, it could be easily given the impression that he is a very strong willed fellow.</p>
              <p>Anyway the sad fact is that he has no way to realise his dream as a pilot now. However, do hope the authorities will genuinely learn some lessons and improve our training safety.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">SAF resumes all physical and endurance training activities</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE : The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) has resumed all physical and endurance training activities as of 7pm on Saturday.</p>
              <p>This follows the completion of a three—day time out on such
              activities after the deaths of Officer Cadet Clifton Lam and Recruit
              Andrew Cheah Wei Siong.</p>
              <p>Cheah died after fainting during a
              two—kilometre walk at Pulau Tekong on Tuesday, while Lam died on
              Wednesday while undergoing jungle training in Brunei as a pilot trainee.</p>
              <p>MINDEF said the SAF has determined that proper procedures are in place, and these are being followed.</p>
              <p>It
              added that the SAF has received a number of suggestions from the
              public, and these will be evaluated as part of its regular process of
              ensuring that such activities are carried out safely.</p>
              <p>The SAF
              medical screening protocol is also subjected to regular professional
              reviews by a panel of top specialists, including cardiologists. And the
              most recent review conducted last September found the protocol
              stringent, and in line with good clinical practice.</p>
              <p>A coroner’s inquiry will be held into the cause of both deaths.</p>
              <p>Separately, the SAF will also convene two panel inquiries into the deaths. — CNA/ms</p>

              <p> <br> </p>
              <p>SINGAPORE : Hundreds of friends and family members bade farewell to Second Lieutenant Clifton Lam Jia Hao as he was given a military funeral on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Lam died on Wednesday while undergoing jungle training in Brunei.</p>
              <p>It was a send-off befitting the dreams and aspiration of Lam, whose life was cut short so unexpectedly.</p>
              <p>Friends said Lam had dreamt of being a pilot since he was 13.</p>
              <p>As a symbolic gesture, the Republic of Singapore Air Force awarded Lam his pilot wings - posthumously.</p>
              <p>In the send-off at the Mandai Crematorium, his coffin, draped in the national flag, was carried by his brothers-in-arms. And a final volley shattered the peaceful Sunday afternoon in honour of a comrade lost.</p>
              <p>Family and friends remember Lam for his caring ways.</p>
              <p>Lin Zhi Sheng, a full-time NSman, said, "Every time I got bullied, he would stand up for me. He was a very good friend..." - CNA/ms</p>

              <p>Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean says the Singapore Armed Forces is
              satisfied that all its training procedures are in place and closely
              adhered to.</p>
              <p>This comes after its three-day timeout on all physical and endurance training activities ended at 7pm yesterday.</p>
              <p>Such activities were temporarily suspended following the recent
              sudden deaths of Officer Cadet Clifton Lam and Recruit Andrew Cheah.</p>
              <p>Mr Teo says SAF reviewed its training, medical and safety procedures during the time out.</p>
              <p>"They've completed that, looked at all the procedures and SAF is
              satisfied the procedures are in place and they are being followed. This
              three-day timeout has been very useful because it has allowed review of
              the procedures to make sure they are all there. And it also heightened
              awareness among the commanders and the individual soldiers themselves
              on the issues involved in physical endurance training."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, SAF has formed two inquiry panels to investigate the two deaths.</p>
              <p>MINDEF will be working with an independent committee of inquiries
              chaired by a senior civil servant from another organisation to look
              into the death of Recruit Cheah - a full time National Serviceman.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, a separate committee from MINDEF will investigate the death of Officer Cadet Lam, a regular serviceman.</p>
              <p>Mr Teo says a coroner's inquiry will also be held to investigate the deaths.</p>
              <p>"Separately and independently, of course, the coroner's inquiry will
              proceed and it's held in open court and the coroner will determine the
              cause of death."</p>
              <p>Recruit Cheah died after fainting during a two kilometer walk at Pulau Tekong on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Officer Cadet Lam, on the other hand, died during jungle training in Brunei the following day. -- 938Live</p>
