            <div class='col-md body'>Hi people, upon seeing so many useful tips and interesting stories in this particular forum, i decided to ask some of the general questions.<br>Am currently finishing my Diploma next week, went for the check up at CMPB (Pes Bp), would expect to be enlisted any time this year.<br>But before that, i would love to make any preparation if there is any tho... i would like to enquire from fellow forumers is that what kind of exercise i can start for starters as conditioning ? what other things i can do to prepare myself?

Your training will differ from them in the sense that you guys do things at a gradual pace, rather than going all the way right frm the start. I would suggest to TS to start jogging 2km 2-3times a week first. Later on, increase the distance, and probably ur jogging speed. If possible, go to the gym 2 train up for ur chin-up, because a lot of Bp folks cannot do chin-up at all. Ask the instructor there what euqipments can be used for this purpose. Even if before NS you cannot do chin-up, at least u will definitely lose some weight.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You can also train yourself to carry heavy stuffs and prepare for the route march by walking around with a heavy backpack. For example, you can buy a 5kg pack of rice, put in a backpack, and carry it one round around MacRitchie Reservoir. Haha. (5kg may be chicken-feet to some vocations such as signallers and medics, who often have to carry more than 20kg of equipments during route march.)<br><br>If walking is chicken-feet to you, try jogging with the heavy backpack.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes. PES BP normally starts with brisk walk, perhaps with some runs. Gradually, the jogging distance will start to increase, and probably the tempo. This is what Echo (now Eagle) used to do. Not so sure about the 15 weeks BMT. Coz previously all BPs regardless of BMI are 16 weeks.</div>
