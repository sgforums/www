I for one, will be enlisting in another 2 weeks and frankly speaking, I am looking forward to NS life because it's a new chapter for me in my life and learning stuff throughout the 2 years is once in a lifetime.

              <p>Prespective from PNSF side... People seem to keep forgeting NS
              doesn't just involve army. People can end up in SPF and SCDF
              too...</p>
              <p>I'm not they guy protecting Singapore in times of war, but in my
              POV, we still need NSmen to patrol the streets of Singapore. Most
              people in Singapore would not know what is going on outside their
              own lives. The reality is, there is a constant war against crime in
              Singapore to keep Singapore streets, coast lines and key
              installiations safe.</p>
              <p>Everyday, one patrol car can get up to 40 calls per section.
              Depending on regulars alone to take care of these calls and
              Singapore will become like Malaysia. Crime everywhere and bad guys
              out number the police. NSmen play a VERY IMPORTANT role in
              supporting the regulars so that the work is spread out and becomes
              manageable.</p>
              <p>On the Plus side, PNSF gets to see Singapore in a whole new
              light that normal citizens wouldn't normally see. And catching the
              bad guys is always a thrill.</p>
              <p>But on the minus side, its a lot of work. And the member of
              public is no help either. Constantly scrutinizing us.</p>
              <p>Its a Thankless job, but someone have to do it.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Not having NS will mean a great decrease in our defence force. Scrape that, not having NS will mean no defence force for Singapore. If our own citizens who live off the luxury of the country yet refuce to serve to protect his own motherland, then who will? Mercernaries? Regulars? Our regulars will be spread so thin that any each of them will have to kill nearly a hundred soldiers each before they die in order to bring some hope for us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Every male citizen will have to complete his NS before he can enter the working world. (With disregards to some exceptions) If they can fill the 2 years gap when they enter the working world, why can't you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The death ratio of people dying in Singapore's NS is relatively low already. As long as you follow the instructions SMARTLY and know what's the limit for everything, you'll do fine. If you can't handle NS, forget bout handling the working world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>NS provides Singapore a defence force strong enough to deter invaders into attacking Singapore. Look at it from a more simple POV for a simple minded guy like you, would you rather slap someone with a knife on his hand, or someone who is empty handed?</p>

              <p>first answer to ur previous qsn. what we are lacking in horizontal landspace, we make up for it in vertical landspace. do they have so much resources to send enough men to search all the units (housing units, building units, shops) all over singapore? bear in mind that these searchers will also be subjected from ambush during their search.</p>
              <p>Also, yes, they will kill. but, there's no point in controlling a piece of empty land with no subjects to rule over.</p>
              <p>with today's media's omnipotency, little news are left out to the world. the media will report any enemy losses to gargantuan proportion. soon, there will be public pressure back home calling for the withdrawal of their troops. enemy soldiers are also human. they have familes back home to care for.</p>
              <p>coupled with the fact that most countries nowadays, (at least in the surrounding region), are democratic, (with the exception of brunei, but they are unlikely to invade singapore at any time). any unpopular action will see to the government being  voted out of office, just like the republicans under bush.</p>
              <p>so what about the high loss to kill ratio? if enemy bomb singapore, just one bomb alone can kill hundreds(i'm not talking about atomic bomb).</p>
              <p>look at sichuan. one earthquake, their 5-7 stories buildings collapse, killing hundreds per building. here, we have 12-25 stories HDB flats. imagine what would happen if they collapse? (don't tell me that HDB designed these flats to be bomb-proof, when they already failed to include lifts at every floor in their designs.)</p>

              <p><br>What makes you think they are into Singapore to rule? The question is what if a radical regime ever comes into power that is genocidically hostile towards Singapore?</p>
              <p>You only need to take a look at what can happen in Africa, Serbia and what happened here in the 1950s to get an idea of how quickly politics can change within a space of a couple of years to something disasterous. </p>
              <p>If the idea is (to dream one up), lets say some regime with rabidly anti-chinese idealogy takes over in the region and Singapore becomes the target, the idea is not to rule Singapore but simply exterminate then you'll be in trouble if your game plan is to be an insurgent.</p>
              <p>Insurgency does not work on an enemy that is bent on destroying you and your people.</p>
              <p>Problem is it takes more then just a couple of years to build up your military to something credible.</p>
              <p>What makes you think the SAF's doctrine is to camp out in Singapore and wait for the enemy instead of taking the fight to them at the outbreak of hostilities? In terms of combined arms and mobility the SAF gears its forces towards mobile offensive warfare, and not static defensive actions. If the fight comes to our soil then we are already in trouble.</p>

              <p>coupled with the fact that most countries nowadays, (at least in the surrounding region), are democratic, (with the exception of brunei, but they are unlikely to invade singapore at any time). any unpopular action will see to the government being  voted out of office, just like the republicans under bush.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you think a regime like Burma will care about taking losses or even about the media? In fact you've chosen only one example to build your case on, and that's the Americans when the vast majority of armies outside of europe are hardly like that.</p>
              <p>You are making the common mistake of wishful thinking in warfare, where instead of decisively defeating your enemy one resorts to thinking that if so and so ambigious conditions were sastified the enemy will lose heart and give up.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>so what about the high loss to kill ratio? if enemy bomb singapore, just one bomb alone can kill hundreds(i'm not talking about atomic bomb).</p>
              <p>look at sichuan. one earthquake, their 5-7 stories buildings collapse, killing hundreds per building. here, we have 12-25 stories HDB flats. imagine what would happen if they collapse? (don't tell me that HDB designed these flats to be bomb-proof, when they already failed to include lifts at every floor in their designs.)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The question is, why even allow them to reach you and bomb you in the first place? They can do so precisely IF you don't even try to defend yourself from such threats.</p>
              <p>And how do you defend yourself? By sitting around and lamenting the fact that is it a hard task to do or actually putting your money where your mouth is and coming up with a credible military that can prevent this from happening in the first place?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I am enlisting in july 10 and frankly speaking, I cant wait to get into NS! Though i heard lots of negative comments from my bro, I was (and still is) super excited about army life. Well, I believe there are lots of things to be learned. Come to think about it, we should feel privileged to be given such an opportunity to serve our country! We can make new friends, experienced new kind of life, learn how to use different weapons, understand the importance of spending valuable time with our families, take these 2 years and carefully plan out our futures! Of cos, nothing is perfect, NS will have its pros and cons, but if you were to be more optimistic, life will be much better huh. Rather than complaining abt NS life, i tink we shld think of how to maximise the benefits that we can achieve from this valuable 2 years. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p></div>

              <p><br> What makes you think they are into Singapore to rule? The question
              is what if a radical regime ever comes into power that is
              genocidically hostile towards Singapore?</p>
              <p>You only need to take a look at what can happen in Africa,
              Serbia and what happened here in the 1950s to get an idea of
              how quickly politics can change within a space of a couple
              of years to something disasterous. </p>
              <p>If the idea is (to dream one up), lets say some regime with
              rabidly anti-chinese idealogy takes over in the region and
              Singapore becomes the target, the idea is not to rule Singapore but
              simply exterminate then you'll be in trouble if your game plan is
              to be an insurgent.</p>
              <p>Insurgency does not work on an enemy that is bent on destroying
              you and your people.</p>
              <p>Problem is it takes more then just a couple
              of years to build up your military to something credible.</p>
              <p>What makes you think the SAF's doctrine is to camp out in
              Singapore and wait for the enemy instead of taking the fight to
              them at the outbreak of hostilities? In terms of combined arms and
              mobility the SAF gears its forces towards mobile offensive warfare,
              and not static defensive actions. If the fight comes to our soil
              then we are already in trouble.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>But in reply to your previous point, singapore can't attack, to conquer a place, with your strongly recommended ' attack as the best defense strategy, it will not work,</p>
              <p>In war, to conquer a area, other than the most difficult way of ' pushing beyond the enemy line', the after math of retaining control of KL ( lets say KL) is the most important part. In warfare, they actually have the amount of personel stationed to land area RATIO, to be able to successfully control that area. We dun have the amount of people, and if we employ all the man we have( KL too big), singapore becomes a paper basket to be easily crushed, then taking care of the man we have in their land would be fairly easy without support........................</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>even if we can successfully control KL, by some miracle......</p>
              <p>due to the size of the countries around us, they can easily shift their HQ, so many states to shift, so much land, how are you ever, i mean ever gonna hit them on their head? in the short time of the war? before singapore implode?</p>

              <p>we where got dun stand a chance? we stand quite a chance. pre-emptive strike not good enough chance? juz look at the japanese...so small, yet they were able to take over asia. numbers isnt the only impt thing in war. surprise and might is. combine both nicely, and you get a formidable force. that's why our SAF is synonymous with chilli padi. enemy think its small, like a little red dot...but they know that if they take a bite they'd suffer. and in another way, the SAF is like a deterrence too. anyway, down to the basics...if you dun defend your livelihood, your family and your property, den u want who to defend? your sister? i'd rather go out there, and eat shit for 2 damn years and keep the security up. Israel is a good example. their reservists did a hell of a job defending themselves when they were invaded the second time by surprise during their kosher (equivalent to the ramadan for muslims). if it werent for the reserves, u think they cld muster strength to push back the multiple invaders? never underestimate the will of a man desperately trying to fend off murderers trying to butcher his wife and children. and if u add 2 million of such men ard...u'll haf quite a formidable force. anyway i understand there's this notion about "if war comes, i run lor." Yeah, pls tell me run where? all flights wld haf ceased, your property and money are here. where on earth wld u run to? that leaves us with no choice but bloody fight it out right?</p>
              <p>ok lets not be harsh on the TS. he is only a boy. he is definitely scared of injuring himself, but well who isnt? well TS, when the time comes...whatever happens, take it easy. there are counsellors there, you can talk to them if u feel mentally stressed out. physically wise yes u may get injured, but you most probably wun die. the injuries arent very complicated, unless you go to the CDO or some siong units, but chances are...you won't. relax. the SAF understands a conscript force isnt like a regular force. u are there not by will. and they will try to accomodate u. so relax ok? if u feel damn stressed out, always got people to talk to. right? well...the best thing u can do if u really fear alot for your safety...try screwing up in bmt. keep shooting ur fren's target board. point the gun at ur instructor by "accident", fail ur SOC and IPPT, be the worse soldier in the entire cohort and piss your frens silly. you will be posted to a very relaxed job after BMT.</p>
