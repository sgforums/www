              <p>There are always risk involved in everything we do. Walk along the streets, we risk getting bang down by a car; cross a bridge, it might collapse, etc.</p>
              <p>NS is definitely not an unnessary thing. Those who served it will remember their buddies and all the tough (and happy) times together. NS is definitely not a brainwash thing. The sense of common good and righteousness is always better because we are somehow inter-dependent on one another. Self-centredness will only lead to extinction.</p>
              <p>Look at it this way: this is your home. This is where the foundation of your memories and love are built. This place is where your families and friends are. If you don't defend it, who will?</p>
              <p>No one wish for a war of course, but should a war be fought here, I say we will lose if we have a weak mental and attitude.</p>
              <p>It's easy to be a quitter. But are you always going to quit without giving it a try?</p>
              <p>Just my 2cents worth.</p>

              <p>I think it is very unfair to call the TS humiliating names. This only reflect the character of the person who insult others to get the message across.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TS. I've served 6 years in the SAF as a regular and have been doing well. But I did not stay despite repeated offers because I realised one important aspect of our lives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'It does not make any sense to protect a country who will not protect you'. Alternatively, 'It does not make any sense to serve a master who will not take care of you.' 'It does not make any sense to keep an agreement with someone who will not keep his agreement with you.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Over the years I realised that the SAF practices dirty politics and the operational management feel that they are entitled to do it. And it is a great risk to stay employed by someone whom you know do not honour promises. I weighed the entire situation with all aspects and decided to leave the army. I am doing much better in the private sector now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But in times of war, I will still go back to serve the unit which I am already attached to. This is because I have friends still in the SAF who're doing their part to protect me with their skills and lives. Not for the sake of blind obedience to our leaders but for the lives of my brethrens fighting for me. And therefore I will support them by giving them the best maintained vehicles to the best of my capabilities. (I was a mechanic)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And on the contrary, this is only applicable if we are not the aggressors. If our leaders want us to start a war to attack and kill our neighbours, I will never abide by that and AWOL if necessary.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Know what is right and do what is right. Even though the consequences are not going to do you good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But first, I advise you to go throught the NS whereby you will make a lot of new friends and make the best of the 2 years and acquire the skill you are designated to perform which will come in handy when you are called up to fight for the brethrens who are protecting you.</p>

              <p>I gg to serve in about 2wks. Though the possibility of me being injured/maimed or die is real,I'll still do it. I know many say that my perception of the SAF will change when I'm inside, but I vow to myself, I'm not doing this for the ruling party, I'm doing this for my fellow citizens. The very citizens whom have provided me,my family,extended family and friends with subsidized housing, education and a relatively peaceful and secure environment to grow up in. They paid for it through their taxes, and it is my responsibility to stand on the fence, with a rifle and look fierce to deter any punks whom try to stirr up trouble.</p>
              <p>This is my country, my home, my past, present and the future. I fight for its freedom as it will be for myself. NS is about sweating a gallon to ensure u don't bleed a pint. Thats a fair trade off to ensure the domestic and regional security and stability. And though I'm sure there are many more people like TS whom resent and think its ultimately stupid, I'll still stand on the fence to ensure you have the privilege to enjoy your night's rest andwake up to post such postings.Because I believe it is my duty...I BELIEVE</p>
