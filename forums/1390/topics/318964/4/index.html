              <p><br> I have no issues regarding conscriptions especially if you need to
              gather enough bodies to form the deterrant force. Perfectly, the
              security of the country lies in no one else but the citizens. But
              the big issue is, if the citizens are to be sweating and shedding
              blood for the security and well being of the country, the citizens
              must first believe in doing so. Probabaly our fathers and
              forefathers see this and feel this but my generation and those
              further down? But look at today environment, we see growing
              resentment that foreigners coming here to compete on all fronts. We
              are facing high costs and pressured wages. The need is to make
              Singaporeans feel Singaporeans - greater emphasis and favoritism be
              shown to Singaporeans. There need to have concerted effort from all

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Hi Paradog I will not call u a kid u had the same perception as me before I went in army it hard to describe in word or any form of way you will have to experience it in order to understand. However, I should say this 2 years is damn worth for me, it really train me how to endure every single obstacle in life. They said you might find your best friend in the army which I totally agree I found my best friend from army we been through real shit, training is tough, you will felt no pride at start but respect is earn by other in the army.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I spent 2 years enjoying myself in the army going clubbing ,BBQ and whole lot of stunts i ever did in my life, it hard to believe the last month before i ORD i felt sad that i have to leave this place that I spend for 2 years and once out i have no chance to play so hard and i have to really start to plan. Being very lost before ORD in army 2 years they planned everything for you, all you have to do is to crack your brain on how you can play stunts instead now i have to plan my life, career and other luxury proposition that i working for. I never regret serving my 2 years I learn a lot such as even sitting on a bench to slack has a price to pay and I even treasure this kind of moment was so valuable I never though that time was important it shouldn’t be wasted, although everyone kept saying that SG most likely unable sustain much of a battle but to my perception I will rather try my best to defend my country then allowing those invader to hurt my family and my loved once think of this it really paid off during a battle . For your infor I from a combat unit and ORD for 4 years compare all the bro here many are more old bird and been through more shit than me guess they will agree with me. Every year I get to go back for ICT it a relax for your mind and gathering for old friends for a cup of coffee and talking craps. I really hope you enjoy your 2 years just like me.</span></p>

              you are right.  We won't be defending the foreigners because they won't be here, they will be long gone.  I can assure you this.  when trouble first brew, US, Europe and what not will be flying in their C130 into Changi and ferry their nationals back or US aircraft carrier will steam in and pluck their citizens away.  
              
              By that time comes, whats left are Singaporeans to make a stand against the aggressors.  I am also not sure how many leaders will remain to lead us in our war.  But I am sure, when peace ensue again, they will all be back like nothing has happened before.
              
              We see this prior to our fall during WW2 to the Japanese.  But if our troops are of high morale and with the weaponery that we have, the agressor won't even dare to take the first step because we follow the Israel doctrine ~ any sign of trouble, we will attack first.

              <p>Fighting is not about pulling a trigger or swining a knife, it has a lot more to do with HOW and WHEN you fight. Tactics and movement on the field, as well as other skills matter a lot more then simply shoot and they have to be organized and learned in the military to become a truly effective fighting force.

              <p>You once again demostrate your lack of understanding of anything military and war. Which is not surprising given you are more interested in wanting to make your first 100k by whenever, nothing wrong with that, but at least do your homework before you shoot your mouth off.</p>
              <p>In terms of military technology and mobilized capacity, the SAF is capable of going toe-to-toe with any projected/potential threat in the region. And of course our potential foes know it that's why.</p>
              <p>Unless you can come up with some bizzare situtation like China or the US suddenly decides to annex us, the SAF serves a very REAL need in security and stability in regional politics, and is needed for the survival and viability of Singapore.</p>

              <p><br>So in your mind, no matter what happen Singapore is just going to be a flat piece of land when someone starts attacking us? What if Singapore isn't flatten after the missile raid or whatever ways they decide to attack us and somehow you survive? Like many have pointed out to you and let me ask you again, how will you defend yourself, your family and your love ones? Are you gonna just tell them say, this is war we are all going to die anyway so lets just wait for our time? or will you do something else?  and i said in my previous post, going to NS is just part and parcel of being a Singaporean. If you are not happy with the way how life works for all males in SG, be my guest and migrate somewhere else. If not just suck up and go through the 2 years, be it you keng yourself through or you push yourself to the limit.</p>

              <p>So in your mind, no matter what happen Singapore is just going to
                                      be a flat piece of land when someone starts attacking us? What if
                                      Singapore isn't flatten after the missile raid or whatever ways
                                      they decide to attack us and somehow you survive? Like many
                                      have pointed out to you and let me ask you again, how will you
                                      defend yourself, your family and your love ones? Are you gonna
                                      just tell them say, this is war we are all going to die anyway
                                      so lets just wait for our time? or will you do
                                      something else?  and i said in my previous post, going to NS
                                      is just part and parcel of being a Singaporean. If you are not
                                      happy with the way how life works for all males in SG, be my guest
                                      and migrate somewhere else. If not just suck up and go through the
                                      2 years, be it you keng yourself through or you push yourself to
                                      the limit.</p>
