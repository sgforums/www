              <p>Its no point serving NS if one's heart and soul is not in it.  The need is to believe in NS and its purpose.  Like others, I served my National Service, during that time, its 2.5yrs for us.  And I am very resentful because I feel extremely DL that I hve to disrupt my studies and waste 2.5ys of my most important part of my life doing nothing useful.</p>
              <p>And when I exit the service, I have to fight with gals who are two years ahead, foreigners who came here to work and for all sorts of reasons, and not needing to serve NS.  The question I am asking is, if serving National Service is the duty and responsibility of singaporeans, are we being recognised by this?  In today's cut-throat competitive society, having a 2 year lag is a significant setback in pay.  So, you serve NS, do you then pay less utilities, less telco bills, less for food?  You go to in-camp every year for the next 13 cycles, does your children get priority in enrolment to schools over foreigners?  Does your employer grant you faster promotion over FT or someone else?</p>
              <p>Sure, you say, come on, compete based on your abilities, I am fine, ok, but I am not being able to compete on an even playing field, is it fair?  I am all for protecting the land and country - you must believe in it and its when you are fighting for what you belief that you will fight harder in times of conflict.  Throwing a group of men together and suffer is building unity - yah, but that happens in NPCC and NCC during my secondary school days too, i also feel united.  When I am playing for my school team, I feel united too.  Unity comes when everyone believe in it.  if one individual or collective group does not believe in something, its useless.</p>
              <p>If one have to serve NS and especially in our context today where more and more foreigners are coming to compete, how can Singaporeans be made to feel special and belonging to the country?  Its only when I believe I belong here and have something at stake that i will serve wholeheartedly.  Definitely not when i am camped out in the middle of night digging trench-hole when my schoolmate from China / Malaysia or India are moving ahead in their career and life. </p>
              <p>No one owes me aliving, at least put us on a level playing field.  I am not selfish but I ask why must I protect these foreigners when in the slightest sign of trouble, they will scoot off back to their country?</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">But what the heck is this? 'If a country were to attack Singapore, we
              don't even stand a chance'? What makes you think that? If we ever go to war, we
              DO have a chance if we stand up and fight. One of the guarantees to Singapore's own
              independence is the SAF. And the only way we can ever keep the SAF strong is
              through conscription.</p>
              <p>chance? if the invader is kind enough to send in only infantrymen equip with sticks and harsch language den yes we stand a pretty good chance..however,most probably they will send us million dollars worth of missile to chew on...by the time their infantrymen step foot..sg is already a scrap yard..</p>
              <p>You've totally lost the concept of National Service. It is not just to
              prepare for war. It is also to deter others from making war upon us. And the
              secondary effect of helping our citizens unite is very, very true..... in fact,
              that was the main reason why the Malaysians decided to come up with their own
              'National Service'.</p>
              <p>correction..it is only to showcase prospective investors that we have this and that..think of mocca.com the muscle guy showing off his hdb flat..( hi,i have a safe country to invest. its army is clean and green with few big guns. the missile is over there..the tank is over there..check out my matching cannons..)</p>
              <p>unitedness??go to any barracks of saf,spf,scdf..chinese 1 side, malay 1 side,indian 1 side if enough..very united..</p>
              <p>But boh pian; someone has to do the job. If I don't do the job, you don't do
              the job, and everyone else feels the same way, then who is going to defend Singapore?</p>
              <p>y do we have regulars to sign up again??</p>
              <p>If there was no National Service.... would you still have the freedom to sit
              in front of your computer to whine about it?</p>
              <p>thats a opportunity cost question...we never know..</p>
              <p>i did my time(sounds like come out from jail) in spf..im lucky im there cuz at least i learnt some stuff..but for the rest of fellow sg males..2 yrs is alot of time to be wastin in meaningless stuff..</p>
              <p>NS is for everyone NS is a crime.</p>

              I have no issues regarding conscriptions especially if you need to gather enough bodies to form the deterrant force.  Perfectly, the security of the country lies in no one else but the citizens.  But the big issue is, if the citizens are to be sweating and shedding blood for the security and well being of the country, the citizens must first believe in doing so.  Probabaly our fathers and forefathers see this and feel this but my generation and those further down?  
              
              But look at today environment, we see growing resentment that foreigners coming here to compete on all fronts.  We are facing high costs and pressured wages.  The need is to make Singaporeans feel Singaporeans - greater emphasis and favoritism be shown to Singaporeans.  
              
              There need to have concerted effort from all around to do so, just a few of us writing in this forum is not sufficient.

              <p>There will be some jokers who simply don't want to serve and no amount of talking to them will convince them otherwise, this is just part and parcel of conscription.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately Singapore's current state did not simply arise because we are rich and capable, it arose because we had a credible armed force to make sure we are a stable and viable place for investors and companies to set foot in here. Politics aside there is the very real issue of security and believe me if it wasn't for the deterrance provided by a credible military we would have been arm-twisted into making a lot of deals not favourable to us.</p>
              <p>Simply put, at the end of the day when all the bullets start flying your money isn't going to be worth squat, what matters will be the ability to show your attacker a bad time and that has to be covered first before you can really say what you have achieved is yours.</p>
              <p>I don't really see what's so bad about NS seriously. I mean yes it was a really crappy experience and times and we did a lot of pointless things, but at the end of the day it made me a tougher person and taught me to take care of myself. Two years behind the girls? So what? You're still with the guys. Suck it up soldier.</p>
