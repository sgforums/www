              <p>This dude obviously has no idea how wars are waged, his points are gross generalizations and passing the buck without actually making any logical conclusion.</p>
              <p>BTW, the only countries that have the resources to do the "missile raid" as it stands is the US, and even trying to do so will tax their resources to the limits. You do not waste expensive missiles on HDB flats, eventually you'll need conventional forces to occupy or bombard the area.</p>
              <p>In terms of OUR context, our most immediate threats are the armed forces of the closest nations, in which case we are capable of taking on.</p>
              <p>The whole notion of Singapore standing no chance simply because we can't fight toe to toe with a nation like the US is rubbish, might as well say just because I can't beat GSP in a UFC fight I don't beed to learn how to defend myself.</p>

              <p>True, no SAF personnel has fought a war, and hell nobody will want to go into a war zone, not even the spf. SAF and SPF have different roles to play, you can't compare both. if everything you must compare between SAF and SPF, then whats the point of seperating the 2 organisation? Indeed SPF is doing a great job out there keeping our nation safe from crime, but SAF is also doing its part during peace times by keeping our waters safe from piracy attacks in the Straits of Malacca, peace time mission in East timor, rebuilding efforts in Iraq, and the recent tsunami incident where SAF was the first to reach the scene and help those in need. You can't discredit what SAF has done, neither can we discredit what SPF has done to keep our nation safe overall.</p>

              <p>Well unfortunately for Paradog he does not realize that guys may be born male, but being a man is a matter of choice.</p>
              <p>Not much point talking with these kind of people, simply because they are the sheep and in their world their security is not something they want to take care of:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>One Vietnam veteran, an old retired colonel, once said this to me:</p>
              <p>"Most of the people in our society are sheep. They are kind, gentle, productive creatures who can only hurt one another by accident." This is true. Remember, the murder rate is six per 100,000 per year, and the aggravated assault rate is four per 1,000 per year. What this means is that the vast majority of Americans are not inclined to hurt one another. Some estimates say that two million Americans are victims of violent crimes every year, a tragic, staggering number, perhaps an all-time record rate of violent crime. But there are almost 300 million Americans, which means that the odds of being a victim of violent crime is considerably less than one in a hundred on any given year. Furthermore, since many violent crimes are committed by repeat offenders, the actual number of violent citizens is considerably less than two million.</p>
              <p>Thus there is a paradox, and we must grasp both ends of the situation: We may well be in the most violent times in history, but violence is still remarkably rare. This is because most citizens are kind, decent people who are not capable of hurting each other, except by accident or under extreme provocation. They are sheep.</p>
              <p>I mean nothing negative by calling them sheep. To me it is like the pretty, blue robin's egg. Inside it is soft and gooey but someday it will grow into something wonderful. But the egg cannot survive without its hard blue shell. Police officers, soldiers, and other warriors are like that shell, and someday the civilization they protect will grow into something wonderful.? For now, though, they need warriors to protect them from the predators.</p>
              <p>"Then there are the wolves," the old war veteran said, "and the wolves feed on the sheep without mercy." Do you believe there are wolves out there who will feed on the flock without mercy? You better believe it.<strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">There are evil men in this world and they are capable of evil deeds. The moment you forget that or pretend it is not so, you become a sheep. There is no safety in denial.</span></strong></p>
              <p>"Then there are sheepdogs," he went on, "and I'm a sheepdog. I live to protect the flock and confront the wolf."</p>
              <p>If you have no capacity for violence then you are a healthy productive citizen, a sheep. If you have a capacity for violence and no empathy for your fellow citizens, then you have defined an aggressive sociopath, a wolf. But what if you have a capacity for violence, and a deep love for your fellow citizens? What do you have then? A sheepdog, a warrior, someone who is walking the hero's path. Someone who can walk into the heart of darkness, into the universal human phobia, and walk out unscathed</p>
              <p>Let me expand on this old soldier's excellent model of the sheep, wolves, and sheepdogs. We know that the sheep live in denial, that is what makes them sheep. They do not want to believe that there is evil in the world. They can accept the fact that fires can happen, which is why they want fire extinguishers, fire sprinklers, fire alarms and fire exits throughout their kids' schools.</p>
              <p>But many of them are outraged at the idea of putting an armed police officer in their kid's school. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Our children are thousands of times more likely to be killed or seriously injured by school violence than fire, but the sheep's only response to the possibility of violence is denial. The idea of someone coming to kill or harm their child is just too hard, and so they chose the path of denial.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The sheep generally do not like the sheepdog. He looks a lot like the wolf. He has fangs and the capacity for violence. The difference, though, is that the sheepdog must not, can not and will not ever harm the sheep. Any sheep dog who intentionally harms the lowliest little lamb will be punished and removed. The world cannot work any other way, at least not in a representative democracy or a republic such as ours.</p>
              <p>Still, the sheepdog disturbs the sheep. He is a constant reminder that there are wolves in the land. They would prefer that he didn't tell them where to go, or give them traffic tickets, or stand at the ready in our airports in camouflage fatigues holding an M-16. The sheep would much rather have the sheepdog cash in his fangs, spray paint himself white, and go, "Baa."</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Until the wolf shows up. Then the entire flock tries desperately to hide behind one lonely sheepdog.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The students, the victims, at Columbine High School were big, tough high school students, and under ordinary circumstances they would not have had the time of day for a police officer. They were not bad kids; they just had nothing to say to a cop. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>When the school was under attack, however, and SWAT teams were clearing the rooms and hallways, the officers had to physically peel those clinging, sobbing kids off of them. This is how the little lambs feel about their sheepdog when the wolf is at the door.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Look at what happened after September 11, 2001 when the wolf pounded hard on the door. Remember how America, more than ever before, felt differently about their law enforcement officers and military personnel? Remember how many times you heard the word hero?</p>
              <p>Understand that there is nothing morally superior about being a sheepdog; it is just what you choose to be. Also understand that a sheepdog is a funny critter: He is always sniffing around out on the perimeter, checking the breeze, barking at things that go bump in the night, and yearning for a righteous battle. That is, the young sheepdogs yearn for a righteous battle. The old sheepdogs are a little older and wiser, but they move to the sound of the guns when needed right along with the young ones.</p>
              <p>Here is how the sheep and the sheepdog think differently. The sheep pretend the wolf will never come, but the sheepdog lives for that day. After the attacks on September 11, 2001, most of the sheep, that is, most citizens in America said, "Thank God I wasn't on one of those planes." The sheepdogs, the warriors, said, "Dear God, I wish I could have been on one of those planes. Maybe I could have made a difference." When you are truly transformed into a warrior and have truly invested yourself into warriorhood, you want to be there. You want to be able to make a difference.</p>
              <p>There is nothing morally superior about the sheepdog, the warrior, but he does have one real advantage. Only one. And that is that he is able to survive and thrive in an environment that destroys 98 percent of the population. There was research conducted a few years ago with individuals convicted of violent crimes. These cons were in prison for serious, predatory crimes of violence: assaults, murders and killing law enforcement officers. The vast majority said that they specifically targeted victims by body language: slumped walk, passive behavior and lack of awareness. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>They chose their victims like big cats do in Africa, when they select one out of the herd that is least able to protect itself.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Some people may be destined to be sheep and others might be genetically primed to be wolves or sheepdogs. But I believe that most people can choose which one they want to be, and I'm proud to say that more and more Americans are choosing to become sheepdogs.</p>
              <p>Seven months after the attack on September 11, 2001, Todd Beamer was honored in his hometown of Cranbury, New Jersey. Todd, as you recall, was the man on Flight 93 over Pennsylvania who called on his cell phone to alert an operator from United Airlines about the hijacking. When he learned of the other three passenger planes that had been used as weapons, Todd dropped his phone and uttered the words, "Let's roll," which authorities believe was a signal to the other passengers to confront the terrorist hijackers. In one hour, a transformation occurred among the passengers - athletes, business people and parents. -- from sheep to sheepdogs and together they fought the wolves, ultimately saving an unknown number of lives on the ground.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>There is no safety for honest men except by believing all possible evil of evil</strong> <strong>men</strong></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>. - Edmund Burke</strong></span></p>
              <p>Here is the point I like to emphasize, especially to the thousands of police officers and soldiers I speak to each year. In nature the sheep, real sheep, are born as sheep. Sheepdogs are born that way, and so are wolves. They didn't have a choice. But you are not a critter. As a human being, you can be whatever you want to be. It is a conscious, moral decision.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>If you want to be a sheep, then you can be a sheep and that is okay, but you must understand the price you pay. When the wolf comes, you and your loved ones are going to die if there is not a sheepdog there to protect you.</strong></span> If you want to be a wolf, you can be one, but the sheepdogs are going to hunt you down and you will never have rest, safety, trust or love. But if you want to be a sheepdog and walk the warrior's path, then you must make a conscious and moral decision every day to dedicate, equip and prepare yourself to thrive in that toxic, corrosive moment when the wolf comes knocking at the door.</p>
