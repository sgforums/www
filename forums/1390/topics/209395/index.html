            <div class='col-md body'>aiya.. many types of plp 1.<br><br>in my opinion:<br><br>WO is more experience in work related things. They went through the tough army life last time.  The are usually in their late 30s or some even near to 50s. They will be in a more like fatherly role. Most WO like to slack. But if there is any problems, asking them is the best way.<br><br>2LT is more of a green horn. He is usually of the same age as a private, so plp of the same age has less generation gap. Some might even be younger then u!!<br><br>For me, i would respect a WO more compare to a 2LT.</div>
