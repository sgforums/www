            <div class='col-md body'>Story by Felix Siew/ Pictures by Chua Soon Lye &amp; Chew Yaoxian<br><br>It's no coincidence that they are known as 'Specialists'.<br>On any inventory of skills and qualities required of a leader and people manager, the Specialist proves his mettle and capabilities.<br><br>The Specialist Corps is often referred to as the 'backbone of the Army'.<br><br>3SG Ong Jia Hui offers a different analogy: "If you liken the Army to a car, then the officers are the engine and the men are the wheels. But the Specialists are the pistons, the driving force behind the Army."<br><br>Whichever comparison you prefer, the message is clear - Specialists are essential in helping to ensure the smooth working of the military.<br><br><strong>Disciplined as a leader</strong><br><br>From 3SG to MSG, Specialists wear several hats: as a junior commander, people manager, welfare provider, communications link between men and upper management, and perhaps most significantly, as a dependable team player who gets the job done right.<br><br>The School of Infantry Specialists (SISPEC), currently located on Pulau Tekong, is where soldiers are moulded into junior leaders. The school runs four main programmes: Basic Section Leader Course (BSLC), Advance Section Leader Course (ASLC), Platoon Sergeant Course, and Company Sergeant Major Course (see Box Story).<br><br>According to the Commanding Officer of SISPEC, LTC Ng Heng Chew (right), every graduate of the school must be an effective and confident leader, one who commands the true respect of his men.<br><br>One way SISPEC develops such leaders is by encouraging trainees to look up to, and follow, their instructors and commanders. At the school, Warrant Officers form a majority of such senior officers, and are thus good role models.<br><br>"Many of our commanders are ex-battalion Regimental Sergeant Majors and have a depth of experience to share with the trainees. They can better relate their experiences to the training and so enhance the trainees' interest to learn," says LTC Ng.<br><br>He adds: "Of the seven SAF core values, our commanders stress the value of discipline to trainees - a fundamental value required of every soldier, more so of a leader. We want this value to be inculcated within our trainees when they become Specialists."<br><br><strong>All fired up</strong><br><br>Training at SISPEC is recognised to be both physically and mentally demanding. For instance, the school conducts numerous live-firing sessions.<br><br>"Be it section or platoon live-firing, with weapons like the Section Automatic Weapon (SAW) or the Light Anti-tank Weapon (LAW), trainees do a lot of live-firing here," says LTC Ng.<br><br>Why is this necessary when blanks can be used instead? "Exposure to live-firing in a realistic and demanding environment greatly boosts our trainees' confidence," he says.<br><br>Section Instructor 3SG Ong (left) has seen this effect first-hand. "When you use live ammunition, trainees become particularly alert because no one wants to shoot wrongly."<br><br>He adds: "In live-firing, instructors strictly monitor the situation and ensure all safety measures are in place. And trainees come out of it very confident. They realise that with safety measures and correct procedures, they can charge up a hill together, shoot well and hit the target, and yet 'cover' each other properly."<br><br>Overseas training also provides soldiers with a unique experience, with new challenges created while operating in a terrain and climate different from Singapore's.<br><br>3SG See Mite, who completed his ASLC training last month, counts his three weeks overseas in February as most memorable.<br><br>"We had a four-day navigation exercise where we had to get to various checkpoints without assistance from our instructors. There, the nights were freezing cold and we would all dream of a hot cup of Milo. And when we found a checkpoint, it was better than discovering a pot of gold! It was a fantastic experience, something we can never get in Singapore!"<br><br>While overseas, trainees also go through various taxing exercises and missions, where they are expected to function under stressful conditions. While extremely challenging, 3SG See acknowledges that it was also an immensely enriching experience.<br><br><strong>Engage and empower</strong><br><br>In recent years, SISPEC has also introduced new programmes and concepts.<br><br>LTC Ng explains the need for this transition: "Training in SISPEC 10 years ago was very different. Then, it was more 'don't ask, just do!' But now, the profile of our soldiers has changed. Trainees are more educated; they are thinking soldiers, so we have to change our training approach."<br><br>He says it is key now to "engage and empower" trainees. For example, during the BSLC and ASLC, trainees are given many opportunities to hold various administrative and field appointments. This exposure to a wide array of responsibilities is good training for them, and can also boost their confidence.<br><br>3SG Azmi Bin Rajis, who recently graduated from his ASLC, quips: "It is much easier just being one of the 'men'. You simply have to wait and follow instructions. But as a Specialist, a junior leader, people look to you to make quick and good decisions!"<br><br>He admits that learning to work and manage others was probably the most difficult aspect of his training. What he has learnt is to put himself in the shoes of his men.<br><br>"You have to understand the situation from their view, and then explain to them the rationale behind your command. You must also be knowledgeable and disciplined; lead by example. Once you are able to gain their respect and trust, the men will willingly work for you."<br><br>During their Advance Section Leader Course (ASLC), trainees practise the movements and tactics necessary while operating in a built-up area.<br>But beyond training soldiers to possess professional military knowledge and skills to become competent leaders on the battlefield, it is important to develop Specialists' leadership capabilities in other areas, too.<br><br>--Pioneer<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Tough training, fond memories</strong><br><br>To this aim, LTC Ng reveals that an inter-company cohesion competition activity was introduced for ASLC trainees two years ago.<br><br>Every batch of trainees is expected to plan, organise and execute friendly competitive games to be conducted between the companies of the school as well as with their instructors. In this process, trainees learn to co-ordinate, manage people and service support.<br><br>"Trainees are empowered to form their own committees, hold meetings, create teams, conduct safety briefings, amongst other things. Before the event, the trainee who is the chairman gives me a briefing," says LTC Ng.<br><br>This competition also allows for some fun amidst the tough training. LTC Ng adds: "When they graduate, trainees will remember that despite the hard training, they also had a bit of fun. This makes the course more meaningful and purposeful."<br><br>In 2000, a 22km run around Pulau Tekong for ASLC trainees was introduced.<br><br>While this is a tough physical test, LTC Ng explains that there is an important message behind the run: "We want to tell our trainees that, with physical and mental endurance and determination, nothing is impossible. After the run, trainees feel a tremendous sense of achievement, and we want them to take this feeling with them when they are posted out."<br><br><strong>Close to the ground</strong><br><br>Deserving trainees who do exceptionally well during the Specialists courses are given the opportunity to cross over to Officer Cadet School (OCS). LTC Ng lets on that many of such trainees perform well in OCS, adjusting quickly to the training there because of the strong foundation they have built while in SISPEC.<br><br>Interestingly enough, in recent batches of trainees, some had rejected this offer to become commissioned officers, and opted to continue training as Specialists.<br><br>"For some of these trainees, they had already adapted well to the job requirements of a Specialist. They enjoyed being able to work closely with the men, interacting and influencing them directly daily!" LTC Ng lets on.<br><br>"After all, commissioned officers are more of conceptualisers or planners. Meanwhile, Specialists are the fighting force on the ground, and their presence can make the difference. On the battlefield, when the men's sprits are low, the Specialists are the direct tactical commander with the ability to spur the men on to fight," says LTC Ng.<br><br><strong>A special homecoming</strong><br><br>LTC Ng reveals that there is currently a plan to build a new home for the Specialists at Pasir Laba Camp. MINDEF's support and endorsement of the construction of the new camp indicates the higher level support in recognising the contribution of the Specialists Corps.<br><br>The focal point of the new home will be a chevron-shaped multi-purpose square. Conceptualised as the 'heart' of SISPEC, this is where drills and parades can be held. Also planned are a Leaders' Hall and a unique entrance to the school.<br><br>The new SISPEC is designed to incorporate the symbolic progression of the Specialists. The layout of the camp is structured in a manner whereby trainees 'journey' from the BSLC and ASLC training areas onward to the Advance Specialists Training Wing, and possibly to the SAF Warrant Officers School (SAFWOS).<br><br>LTC Ng says: "I am confident that the new SISPEC camp, together with SAFWOS, will uplift the pride and prestige of all Warrant Officers and Specialists in the Army. I personally believe that there will be a greater sense of identity and that all our Warrant Officers and Specialists can truly call Pasir Laba Camp their home."<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Training Specialist forces</strong></span><br><br>Instructors 1WO Chua Song Chiang, 3SG Mohd Mahdhir and 3SG Ong Jia Hui explain the four main courses conducted at SISPEC:<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Basic Section Leader Course (BSLC)</strong></span><br>During the 10-week course, trainees are taught the weaponry in an infantry company, tactical skills like navigation, fire and movement, patrol and ambush procedures.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Advance Section Leader Course (ASLC)</strong></span><br><br>While trainees of support arms formation continue their training at their respective units, Infantry and Guards trainees continue on to the ASLC. Different parts of training at BSLC are put together. For instance, section level movement is now taught at a platoon level. Trainees also go undergo training in four types of special operations - Fighting in Built-Up Area (FIBUA), Fighting on Fortified Objectives (FOFO), Heli-Ops and Watermanship. Towards the end of this 11-week course, trainees attend a high confidence course and train overseas.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Platoon Sergeant Course</strong></span><br>As the 'right-hand man' of the Platoon Commander, a Platoon Sergeant looks into all aspects of the running of a platoon, including weaponry, rations, and welfare matters. This 25-day course better prepares him for this role through more leadership and people management courses. Full-time National Servicemen (NSFs), Operationally Ready National Servicemen (NSmen) and Regulars are sent for this course.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Company Sergeant Major (CSM) Course</strong></span><br>This follows the Platoon Sergeant Course, with both courses focused more on building upon previous knowledge. In both courses, knowledge is imparted through experiential learning and instructors guide trainees more than teach. All combat Specialists who are to hold CSM appointments attend this course. For Regulars, this includes two weeks of training in drills procedures. NSmen skip this and go for a four-week course instead.<br><br>--Pioneer</div>

Thus, they <strong>DO </strong>take in officer and officer cadets alike <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>STTS trains the groundmen, i.e. the ground guys.<br><br>However, with the setting up of ALTI, it's hoped tt all these would come together under one roof, and trainings made more comprehensive.<br><br>Does it answer?</div>

They deal only in facts, but must work for men who merchant in theories.  They emerge during war because war is very much a fact.  They disappear in peace because peace is mostly theory.  The people who merchant in theories, and who employ logisticians in war and ignore them in peace, are generals.<br><br>Generals are a happily blessed race who radiate confidence and power.  They feed only on ambrosia and drink only nectar.  In peace, they stride confidently and can invade a world simply by sweeping their hands grandly over a map, pointing their fingers decisively up terrain corridors, and blocking defiles and obstacles with the sides of their hands.  In war, they must stride more slowly because each general has a logistician riding on his back and he knows that, at any moment, the logistician may lean forward and whisper:  "No, you can't do that."  Generals fear logisticians in war and in peace, generals try to forget logisticians.<br><br>Romping along beside generals are strategists and tacticians.  Logisticians despise strategists and tacticians.  Strategists and tacticians do not know about logisticians until they grow to become generals--which they usually do.<br><br>Sometimes a logistician becomes a general.  If he does, he must associate with generals whom he hates;  he has a retinue of strategists and tacticians whom he despises; and, on his back, is a logistician whom he fears.  This is why logisticians who become generals always have ulcers and cannot eat their ambrosia.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>
