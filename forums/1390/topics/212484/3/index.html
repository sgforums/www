He called the deceased name. The head opened its eyes and looked the way of the caller. The eyes then closed and his name was called again. Again the eyes fixed themselves on the doctor. A third attempt after about 25 to 30 seconds brought no response. The doctor reported that after decapitation: the eyelids and lips of the guillotined man worked in irregularly rhythmic contractions for about five or six seconds.</blockquote>LOL! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> kinda scary sia</div>
