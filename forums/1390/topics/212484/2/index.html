Protecting our country is our business and blood is the norm when sh*t hits the fan.<br><br>If you got no guts to kill an animal for food, what makes you think you got the stomach to kill the enemy? Combat or support personnel are all in this together so everyone will have blood on their hands one way or another. We need people who have the will to fight and win battles, not target boards for the opposing forces.<br><br>That is all.</div>
