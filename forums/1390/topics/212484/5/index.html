            <div class='col-md body'>The honest truth is that while all's well and good with training, in the actual event you're much better off going for plant-based food.  You don't have to go through the hassle of chasing your food down and then killing it.  On top of that, if you get a case of poisoning because you've gone an eaten some exotic reptile, you're not mission-capable anyway.  Madness, really.<br><br>Case in point: our medic Ricky was not the sharpest pencil in the box.  When he was watching the chicken-killing demonstration, he failed to notice that as the chicken is on the upswing, you're supposed to snap your wrist down so that the head comes off quickly and cleanly.  So there he is doing a Sugar Ray Leonard impersonation for five minutes, at the end of which we've got a hysterical chicken with a sprained neck.<br><br>Ricky goes to Plan B.  He gets another bloke to swing a parang down on the chicken's neck, but at the last second he loses his nerve and lets go of the chicken.  Now we've got a hysterical chicken that's not only got a sprained neck but one that's chopped through halfway, and it's now running about the jungle spraying blood all over the place.  Eventually, one of the lads caught the chicken, gave the neck a hard tug and put it out of its misery.<br><br>It would have been so much easier just to pluck berries.</div>

If u feel garang enuff, u can have sashimi for the entire week! Eat it fresh and u won't have problem.  Unless someone has been pissing or sh!ttin upstream.

It's not as if you're talking about fugu here.  Besides, if you see how they kill chickens at the market, you'd expect them to turn out like Bridgestones if that theory holds true.<br><br>After it's demise, Ricky's poor chook ended up as Beggar's Chicken.  We packed it in sand mixed with seawater, feathers and all, and shoved it under our camp fire.  The next morning when we cleared the embers and tried to pick it up by the drumsticks, it was so tender it fell apart.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I remember baking a mud chicken pie for that.  Kinda similar to what you'all did, just that we mixed it well enough such that the entire chicken was encased in mud.<br><br>After that, we'd just dig out from the fire, crack n pull away the mud "cake" , peel away the chicken and enjoy! =D<br><br>It helps if u saved a few maggi seasoning to eat with the chicken.  But yeah, it tastes good on its own as well.</div>
