The same as any other vocation.<br><br>Critisizing government doctors is also not fair. They do have limited time and resources. Of course you can always go to see a private specialist.

Have you had any previous injury to the knee before?<br><br>Try to answer the questions so I can have a more accurate idea. But from what I gather you might have CMP. Basically this is because of over use and the spacing between the kneecap and the knee is reduce leading to increased friction and therefore pain on activity.<br><br>If you indeed have such a problem, you will be temp downgrade for about 6 months after confirming with an XRay.<br><br>Cheers<br></div></blockquote>hi , thanks for replying<br><br>yah i have a gritty feeling and the kneecap is rather tender ,.the pain is more towards the behind of the kneecap.<br><br>i didn`t have any problems before with my knee and this is the first time it`s injured ,..<br><br>ic , may i ask what do you mean by a temp downgrade , i`m Pes A now and enlisting in 3 days..haha</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You have CMP..... Chondromalaciae patellae. It results from overuse. Difficult to prove, easy to make clinical diagnosis. A side X ray of you knee will show the problem. It is considered by the SAF not to be long term so you will be given a temp downgrade. Let the MO know of your problem. They will take it from there<br><br>Cheers</div>
