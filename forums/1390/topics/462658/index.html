              <p><em><strong>Being psychologically prepared is all about knowing
                  what to expect and being prepared for it.</strong></em></p>
              <p>To be better prepared, you can participate in Total Defence
                  activities and Open Houses organised by the SAF/SPF/SCDF.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you should also talk to your family members and friends
                  who have lived the NS experience. The more you discuss with others,
                  the more comfortable and mentally prepared you’ll become.</p>
              <p><strong>Because NS life is different from civilian life before
                  enlistment, there are many adjustments you need to
                  make.</strong></p>
              <p>A good way to cope is to get support from your buddy and fellow
                  recruits. They are going through the same tough training as you, so
                  talking to one another will help relieve some tension.</p>
              <p>In most evenings during your leisure time, you’ll also have some
                  time to call your family or loved ones to talk. They can give you
                  emotional support during NS.</p>
              <p>You can have a one-on-one interview sessions with your officer
                  to highlight any problems you may have. If you have a personal or
                  family problem that need to be addressed, do let the officer
                  know—he may be able to give you some advice or time off to settle
                  your problems.</p>
              <p>Life in NS revolves around structure, routine and discipline.
                  This helps us stay united as a uniformed organisation as well as
                  imparts the rigours necessary to protect our nation and
                  citizens.</p>
              <p>This does not mean there is just work and no play. In fact,
                  after a few weeks in NS and you’ll find new friends and new reasons
                  to smile!</p>
              <p><strong>As a soldier, one of the biggest adjustments you’ll have
                  to make quickly is in regimentation and discipline.</strong></p>
              <p>Being in a uniformed organisation, you’ll have to obey orders
                  from your superiors. Thus some of you may feel a sudden lack of
                  freedom to do what you want and you may find yourself having
                  difficulties accepting authority initially.</p>
              <p>Regimentation and discipline build strong character and
                  toughness, so that you’ll be tough enough to handle difficult
                  combat, crime-fighting or rescue situations without giving up or
                  breaking down.</p>
              <p>When you first enlist into NS, you may have concerns of being in
                  a new territory, with new faces and new things to do. But don’t let
                  this get to you. Just remember the saying that “when the going gets
                  tough, the tough gets going”.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Following are some
                  tips on what you can do to prepare yourself
                  psychologically:</em></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Adopt a positive perception</li>
              <li>Build up physical stamina</li>
              <li>Develop good working attitude and habits</li>
              <li>Overcome psychological stress</li>
              <li>Adopt teamwork spirit</li>
              <li>Learn to be independent</li>
              <li>Set realistic expectations</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can also speak to your friends or family members who have
                  been through NS. Ask them to share their stories. The sharing will
                  help you reduce some of your fears, uncertainties and doubts.</p>
              <p><strong>During NS you’ll be living with different
                  people.</strong></p>
              <p>Because these people come from different backgrounds, they may
                  not think like you do or react to situations like you would.
                  Instead of trying to select your type of people, you should cherish
                  the diversity. This is a chance for you to learn more about your
                  fellow mates and their cultures.</p>
              <p>You’ll find that you have many opportunities to absorb the
                  different cultures—during training, eating, chatting or just seeing
                  and listening. Take these opportunities and learn from people
                  around you, you’ll have a much better appreciation of Singapore’s
                  cultural diversity.</p>

              <p>Yes, they are true medical professionals certified with practising licences, but keep your expectations in check.</p>
              <p>They can only write follow-up memos and refer you back to the MO to recommend PES review, do not expect them to "waive off" troubles you created in camp.</p>
              <p>What they basically do is to assist you to recover with drug medication and therapies, and as well as to help you convey your mental state/ feelings to your superiors for understanding who otherwise initially thought that you might be malingering your way out of NS.</p>
              <p>Remember, what you tell them is strictly private and confidential, and you are properly following the chain of command to get yourself treated mentally/ psychologically/ emotionally. Be frank to your counsellors since the only way to help yourself is yourself.</p>
