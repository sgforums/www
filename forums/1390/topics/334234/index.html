              <p>If you come to think of it, almost all of the EPL stars have some form of injury and would be downgraded to PES C. Imagine Roy Keane being an enlistee instead of an officer or specialist, even though people deem him to be a 'midfield general'</p>
              <p>Also, it should be conceded that there can be no perfect system for PES grading in the light of the four recent deaths</p>
              <p>This is my response to Gloater's thread on Kengsters in this forum which said that "90% of the PES C &amp; E personnels are [malingers]". Truth be told, there will be a handful of them who are fitter than the combat feet personnels if you look at the results of games day in BMT. i.e. a PES C company faring better than the other companies.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, everyone is important to the army. You can't ORD or take leave if there is no clerk in your unit, draw arms to defend your country if there's no armstokesmen and so on.</p>

              <p>the diff between EPL stars and this case is that the EPL stars have all some form of injuries but they play on. The kengsters mostly have <strong>NO </strong>medical condition, but fabricate some to be downgraded.It is the diametrical opposite.</p>
              <p>Your EPL analogy is apt in that it raises a point that professionals like footballer or a professional soldier tend to soldier on cos it's their rice bowl. I know one regular who refuse to seek further medical attention from MO's pressing because he didn't want his injuries to affect career if he ever even get close to a recommendation of a downgrade.</p>

              <p>It's not the same because it's just not the same. It's true that combat support and combat service support have their importance and also have their roles to play. Without them then we can't fight.</p>
              <p>But this does not change the fact that most kengsters are in combat service support no? If they manage to keng successfully they get posted there.</p>
              <p>Does it change the importance of combat service support? of cos not.</p>
              <p>Does it change the fact that you find many more kengsters among storemen and clerks than a 2nd yr mono intake in SIR? No.</p>
              <p>Does it change the fact that among downgraded men vs combat fit men, you find more fraudsters in the 1st group than you would in the 2nd? certainly not.</p>
              <p>Also, of cos they are not the same. who's you kidding? if they were the same, they won't be identified by different names duh.</p>

              <p>It is probably a surprise to you because I know every cohort got totally opposite types of people, but surprise, there are lots who did not try to keng you know? You will find it hard to believe from your friends, this I judge from what you said to me. you take it for granted clearly that downgraded is everyone's holy grail, and anyone who isn't must secretly wish he was. That's your world, sure I know.</p>
              <p>here's news for you. i know this hwa chong guy who was given Pes C in JC because his myopia degree is over 900 and physical rigors increase the chance of his retinas detaching resulting in irreversible blindness and he literally begged to not be Pes C because he said he MUST go OCS. He was given the chance to be Pes C and he threw himself into Pes A/B instead because he begged for it. He later became a SAF scholar and chose infantry.</p>
              <p>You also dun seem to get how the definition of a kengster is someone who wishes to be downgraded without having due cause. Not someone with a genuine medical condition. So i don't understand why you say "someone really got big problem blah blah ask him to be Pes A?" I have never met anyone with a genuine and serious medical condition like a hole in heart, given Pes B or A. In fact even flat feet or or even low blood count can get you a Pes C in the SAF easily, as I know many. So please. Dun talk cock.</p>

              <p>You also dun seem to get how the definition of a kengster is someone who wishes to be downgraded without having due cause. Not someone with a genuine medical condition. So i don't understand why you say "someone really got big problem blah blah ask him to be Pes A?" I have never met anyone with a genuine and serious medical condition like a hole in heart, given Pes B or A. In fact even flat feet or or even low blood count can get you a Pes C in the SAF easily, as I know many. So please. Dun talk cock.</p>

              <p>if the guy went to the MO and say i got this and that, and the MO decide to downgrade him then its not "keng".. At least he declared his medical status and its up to the MO to decide whether he is combat fit or not. If he's fit the MO should be able to know that, unless you are saying our MOs are issuing out downgrades to every swinging dick who have a medical condition. Then we will have an army on status or non-combat fit..If a soldier wants to be declared fit when they have a medical condition is commendable. But what if something happens to him? Will the military be accountable for it? And do you think seriously that everyone has the same mentality as the Hwa Chong fella?</p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p>We got soldiers dying due to not declaring illness and participating in training or not sounding off when feeling unwell during training.And the most probable cause in my opinion is because of these labeling of "kenging" by their peers when they miss training due to illness. It could also be due to "gung ho"ness. This just create problems for commanders cause they have to personally search out for these dudes and pulled them out of training. Sometimes they might just miss one or two. if nothing goes wrong, fine, but when it does.. Specs/officers face these problem daily. Personally i rather have a soldier excuse from training and live the next day then having to send him off in his funeral.</p>

              <p>I believe everyone at one stage of their NS have "keng" before, including myself.

They tell everyone they are kengsters, and tell everyone their plans, and proceeded to execute the plans. They pretend to be crazy, injured, they whack themselves or intentionally injure themselves or go to an array of medical specialists in Mt E and Gleneagles claiming a wider array of ailments, after they openly exchange keng tips with one another in camp, they proceeded to do it. Are you like a retard or something? In life, people slow down in their speech when talking to you...??</p>
              <p>if you have served NS at all (and you said you have), and you have no idea that these people as follow are kengsters: 1) after they openly tell each other of their plans to keng, 2) share tips, 3) execute the plans, many times repeatedly if necessary after failures, 4) proclaimed victory to everyone after they were downgraded declaring that they kenged - and that they're kenging is not something your brain cognitively registered, I'm quite sure you were exempt from NS altogether cos you must be a retard.</p>

              <p>For your info, the REC who passed away was not feeling well
                              before the activity. For some reason known only to him,he still
                              participated</p>
              <p>And how do you know the recent death is from heart failure? You
                              got autopsy report or something? Or recently slept with a military
                              official?</p>
              <p>I dont have to psycho-analyse you..your posts tell me you are an
                              idiot. My issues? i had a good 2.5 yrs as a NSF and heck do i care
                              if others want to keng or slack? Thats their problem.</p>

              <p>It was his heart, not his leg. His heart got failure while doing the chin up and then stopped. Kaput. Just because you don't know, does not mean no one else does. Quite a lot of people in SAF know by now. it doesn't matter to me if you believe it. Or if you care to, you can ask SAF people who know, if you know anyone who knows anything at all.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> not my problem.</p>

              <p>Did I meet YOU to know you're Warren Buffet? The kengsters who
              keng after telling everyone else openly that they are going to
              feign illness, proceeded to do so. They tell everyone they are
              kengsters, and tell everyone their plans, and proceeded to execute
              the plans. They pretend to be crazy, injured, they whack themselves
              or intentionally injure themselves or go to an array of medical
              specialists in Mt E and Gleneagles claiming a wider array of
              ailments, after they openly exchange keng tips with one another in
              camp, they proceeded to do it. Are you like a retard or something?
              In life, people slow down in their speech when talking to
              you...??</p>
              <p>if you have served NS at all (and you said you have), and you
              have no idea that these people as follow are kengsters: 1) after
              they openly tell each other of their plans to keng, 2) share tips,
              3) execute the plans, many times repeatedly if necessary after
              failures, 4) proclaimed victory to everyone after they were
              downgraded declaring that they kenged - and that they're kenging is
              not something your brain cognitively registered, I'm quite sure you
              were exempt from NS altogether cos you must be a retard.</p>
              <p>Retard.</p>
              <p>The only way Warren Buffet could ever be this stupid is if he
              goes through a lobotomy.</p>
