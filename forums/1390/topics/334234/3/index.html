              <p>What a coincidence. Sincerely, you as well. you also remind me
                  of a certain member in this forum. Not only that, you remind of
                  another member of two other forums!!!!!  Dare you state your
                  vocation..? tell me. Then who knows? i may find out who you are. i
                  think its quite amusing how you think anyone in a forum will
                  entertain you. Why dun you tell me the length of your penis. cos I
                  suspect you've done some gender change procedure so to prove to me
                  that you haven't pls tell me your LJ length.</p>

              <p>Funny you suddenly brought up the subject of penis length....sudden attack of brain fart and now you reminising about the weekend tryst you had with the General?  I am sure you get passed around regularly. so thats why the length of your penis is no secret among the who's who of SAF. You implied that you've done NS, so i ask your vocation.  what the big deal?</p>
              <p>     And no i am not worked up, why should i be?  You talk as if you been in the military for donkey yrs and as if you are the subject matter expert in "Keng" or "Kengsters" The whole entire thread is not about the existence of kengsters, We all know and must have known one during NS. Hell, it must have been part of SAF culture from day 1.</p>
              <p>This thread is about your <span style="color: #ff0000;">DEFINITION</span> of "keng" and "kengsters" and how you accuse without basis or facts, that guys with PES lower than A/B or CSS vocations are 90% keng or kengsters. And i believe its moral duty of someone to "educate" you, albeit using strong language on the importance of these lower PES soldiers and CSS soldiers. You can have your own thoughts, but posting crap like this only cause others to zero on you and your bullshit.</p>
              <p>its been nice, pissing you off  to make you show your shortcomings and uh, orientation. but i think this thread has run its course.</p>

              <p>Errr I was the one who highlighted to you that its your choice

              you could bugger off. You have no right to tell others what they

              approach you. I asked you WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE, because YOU

              <p>I asked you WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE to censure other people's

              <p>if you don't believe there are kengsters, or if you don't

              I never forced you to believe me. You have the choice to not

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Show me when I said 90% of PES C &amp; below soldiers are kengsters. i'd love to see you pull this out of your arse.<br></span></p>
              <p>I said <span style="text-decoration: underline;">there are more kengsters concentrated in Pes C than Pes A/B</span>. I said Pes A/B pool contains way fewer people who attempted to be downgraded and succeeded.</p>
              <p>I said soldiers who try to get a downgrade based on a feigned illness angle for a Pes C, and those who succeed do become Pes C! I said most malingerers who succeed end up Pes C2 and below. </p>
              <p>I said not all Pes C soldiers are malingerers. I even said kengsters are defined by only people who try to get Pes C
              though they're perfectly healthy and fit, and NOT soldiers who have a
              genuine medical issue.</p>
              <p>I said many Pes C kengsters are in CSS.</p>
              <p>if after a certain set of criteria is achieved, the soldier is question changes status to another or goes to a set of vocations after please explain to me how it's logically possible for this statement to be untrue. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">there are more kengsters concentrated in Pes C than Pes A/B</span></p>

              <p>Gloater, have you ever been in the army? Do you have any sound knowledge of military tactics and strategies. Such sweeping statements that CSSCOM servicemen and PES E &amp; C Personnels are kengsters shows a lack of understanding.</p>
              <p>If not for the CSSCOM units, the combat units will be wiped out within the first 24 hours of battle. An army needs a line of supply, maintenance and transport to function. Lets take the PES C vocation of a armor/turret technician as an example. In peace-time, they do major repair jobs and servicing of the armor vehicles. These are not easy jobs since most of the spares are extremely heavy. Even in base, quite a number of vehicles are in need of repair work due to combatants mistakes, wear and tear etc. In wartime or in the field, technicians provide on the spot repair (imagine using a crane to change engine/changing tracks in the muddy forest). I daresay its just as shiong (most likely more) as combat. If not for these <em>Pes C Kengsters</em>, our entire tank fleet wouldn't be a force to be reckoned with.</p>
