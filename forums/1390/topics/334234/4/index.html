              <p><em>Feign </em>an air of nonchalance?  What's there to feign?  Hello!  Earth to Gloater! How does what's written here affect me in real life?  I don't know you from a bar of soap, and as far as I'm concerned I'm just having fun trading barbs.  If you're placing weight on what's written here, you seriously need to step away from your keyboard, go get a real life and hopefully get a grip on reality.</p>
              <p>Come to think of it, you mentioned earlier that you don't need to be psychoanalysed.  You're right - you're just revealing all of your hangups by your own volition without any need for analysis, what with your pansy-ass crying about people telling you what to feel.  Don't expect me to be your therapist, though.</p>
