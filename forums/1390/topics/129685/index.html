Only if you excel during your Basic Section Leader Course in SISPEC and nominated to cross over to OCS, only then they will convert your career scheme from Premium Plan to SAVER scheme upon commission as an officer. Of course your bond and MTE will still remains.  If you performed well in OCS and plus your good result/merit from your Diploma, you can apply for the Local Study Award (LSA) or SAF Academic Scholarship (SAS) for your Uni study and the bond will be added to your previous 1</div>

He would have to first hold platoon sergeant appointment and proof in his annual reports for his excellent performance which mean about 4 to 5 years of his premium service.  Then, upon strong recommendations from his Bde and Div commanders.<br>OC and CO recommendations... Oh please... give me a break!</div>
