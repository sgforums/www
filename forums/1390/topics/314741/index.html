              <p>Don't worry too much.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if you get through the initial selection for cdo,there is no gurantee that they will put you through to cdo training after the initial bmt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have a friend who is PES A and went through the initial cdo selection thing.After he completed his BMT,he was instead posted to sispec and went on to be an infantry spec.His BMT IPPT just pass only so I guess that could be the reason.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I cannot remember which camp he had his bmt but it was not at tekong.Could it be at hendon camp itself too?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't need to purposely downgrade,just show that your fitness is only so so can already.</p>

              <p><br>Yep,basically it's not 100% gurantee.They have their own selection criteria for cdo course.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unfortunately,I don't have any cdo selection friends who went to OCS after bmt.Just men and spec only.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for OCS,I can offer you some insight regarding selection based on my experiences while in tekong bmt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During my bmt,about 11 or so people indicated interests in signing on as infantry officer,logistics officer,wso fighter pilot..etc halfway through bmt during recruitment talks.They subsequently went for health screening tests and passed them but were "warned" that they needed to be damn fit to be selected in the end.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>End of BMT came and about 10 people from my company went to OCS.Out of the 10,6 of them were guys who were interested in signing on and <strong>JUST PASSED IPPT only,the other 4 had silver or gold for IPPT.The remaining 5 who were interested in signing on?They did not pass IPPT so no contract for them.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So basically,if you indicate interest in signing on,at least pass your IPPT during bmt can already.In BMT,for those who want to go OCS but don't want sign on,IPPT must at least be silver.People who plan to sign on should at least pass IPPT,that way,they can justify giving you contract by saying "Initial pass only nvm,OCS confirm train you to gold standard"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course,the above is only my OBSERVATION.There is no gurantee it will work with every batch of recruits..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One possible case is that they send you for cdo basic course but you performed exceptionally well enough in that course to go for cdo officer course.From there,you can try to reapply for pilot selection.</p>

              <p>I don't recommend getting MP involved.Not much effect and might leave black mark.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There isn't much you can do to get away from CDO BMT other than downgrading before that..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Have you applied for Pilot already?If you did,have you gone for eyesight test,blood test,etc?Did you pass those health tests already?Have you done the interview with an Airforce LTC yet?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you did,all I can recommend is that you go through cdo bmt first.If your interview went well and your health tests all pass,Airforce should snatch you from cdo after bmt provided you pass your IPPT also.They only offer the contract after seeing the results from your BMT.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One more thing,during your SIT test,be sure to inform the officer in charge of your detail that you are planning to sign on and wayang as much in front of him.SIT test affect chances of going command school.</p>

              <p><br>CDO bmts are considered mono intakes so the numbers are usually much smaller than tekong batches.You will definitely see your friend in the same camp but most probably different company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for training,my friend says that the things taught are more or less the same as Tekong.PT training and scolding wise tend to be more on the havoc side for cdo bmt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't despair lah,do your best in basic cdo course if you get selected and who knows you will end up going for cdo officer course.From there,you can still reapply for pilot if you are still interested.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is also a very small chance that you might end up going to OCS after cdo BMT but to be trained as an officer in other arms such as arty,signal,etc.Then you can also reapply from there. </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>You rang?</p>
              <p>I don't know if it's changed since I was there, but back then the only way out was a downgrade.  If it's still the same, you can kiss OCS, pilot or what not goodbye. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Looking at the attitude, I think it's pretty obvious why the kid washed out of the pilot interview. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>I read the posts and I would like to say, there is no way to get out of the formation once you start with their training.. unless,</p>
              <p>1. down pes (Ged, this is still valid)</p>
              <p>2. attitude problems, family problems, religion issues etc..</p>
              <p>3. show total pathetic soldiering skills</p>
              <p>You might get a retry at tekong if you failed their BMT. but you will be marked and never will cross over to OCS nor SISPEC. once the outside people know you WERE from cdos, they will expect the most out of you aka everything you do.</p>
              <p>if you want to leave, do it before you pass their BMT. if you get to training company, don't expect to leave. You'll become their admin support in the end and get yourself leeched till the very end of your NS.</p>
              <p>imo, it was a memorable experience there. you can never forget the feeling of airborne. but if you decide to stay, must take good care, if not injury very sad one.. :(</p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>sometimes donno u seeking for sympathy or for advice here. if u really want to be a pilot in RSAF, i think u have to watch ur attitude. </p>
              <p>firstly, u dont go to CDO OCS after BMT, u have to go thru BCT, then leaders' cse first, then the best amongst the cse get selected to go OCS, that's about 9mths after u start BMT.</p>
              <p>u will see ur friend in BMT, cos he might be enlisted for PTP phase, and for u, BMT straight away......... there's only 1 BMT CO. at any 1 time.</p>
              <p>if u really want to be pilot, serve 2 years NSF then apply pilot again. Fyi, a CPL in CDO applied after 2 yrs in CDO, now a MAJ flying the F-16s.</p>
              <p>Frankly, u missed your first chance during ur interview. Now, u fighting for a second chance. sometimes in life, 2nd chances are not given. thats why do it once, do it right. dont go in with the half baked attitude, give excuses and expect the whole world to accomodate to you.</p>
              <p>you need to reflect again why u didn't even get to go first solo in YFC.</p>
              <p>lastly, CDO training is tough, but not hell. it's all in the mind. thousands go in, thousands come out SOUNDLY. do you see more CRAZY CDOs admitted into woodbridge? i think the disciplined training will do you some good.</p>
              <p>you can keng sometimes, most times, but ALL the time?? and do you think you can make it in RSAF like that as a career?</p>
              <p>i hope you make it a pilot, but dont complain again if u only get to fly C130 and not F-16s.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>good luck!!! </p>
