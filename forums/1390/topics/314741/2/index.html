              <p>Crossing over from Cdo to OCS without going back to the formation is tough, but you can choose not to be a commando. I have 3 friends who went for Cdo BMT, 1 eventually became Cdo officer, the other became clerk at Hendon (forgot for what reason), the other became medic at other camps because he's medic trained. He even has an airborne badge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The latter two did not became commandos, i think its their personal choice. You can tell your commanders that, maybe they can do something. For my Cdo assessment b4 enlistment, i told the Warrant Officer straight that i dun wanna kena cdo, really nv kena. Did you tell the interviewer that you dun wanna be a commando? But your situation, to get pilot quite jialat lah. You can't have your cake and eat it at the same time. Sometimes have to accept decisions going against you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Has been said many times, just take whatever that comes your way. If you are worried about siongness, i personally feel that SAF training is always tough, no matter which vocation or formation, its how you adapt. Adaptibility helped me survive NS.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>i told the warrant officer i prefer to b a pilot and he never said much...i guess i didnt gif concrete statements to convince him like my mom suffering from depression or something like this la. but i guess i will just go commandos coz i will not be the only one suffering inside, i believe there are people like me who does not want to be a commando but accept it anyway. who knows re-applying for pilot vocation as a commando helps as everyone always say being a commando is much better than being an officer.</p></div>

              <p>I've ask my friend who is a pilot trainee and he has the same conditions as you but he was reporting to NDU. He also did not did quite well for his interview but i guess he pass his other test to be a pilot. His interviewer also said he must get into OCS to be a pilot.</p>
              <p><br>So he called up cmpb and i guess he told the staffs there about his situation and he was changed from NDU bmt to tekong bmt. I guess maybe you could try this method. But if this fails, you can just enlist for cdo bmt and bring this up to your pc. You not need tell them that you failed your 1st interview or whatever but just express your interest in being a pilot. I think they'll do something about it.</p>
              <p>My friend also said being a pilot isn't that fast. Some may need to wait up to a year before they can sign the contract. There's a lot of admin work and stuffs going for pilot. You may even ord 1st before you can see the contract to be a pilot.</p>

              <p>heyo, I'm now in commando leader cse. If you think commando bmt is shiong, don't even think about OCS, because to be a commando officer, you have to go through this:</p>
              <p>bmt -&gt; leader cse -&gt; OCS -&gt; Commando officer conversion cse</p>
              <p>And trust me, leader cse is very, very tough (at least to me). Everyone I asked who became commando officers say that after the cdo leader cse, ocs is a cakewalk.</p>
              <p><br>Cdo bmt is quite like a holiday camp compared to leader cse lol. Anyway, don't worry about it if you get in, because the training doesn't get tough right from day one. They will build you up - you won't notice that it's getting tougher until somebody brings it up.</p>
              <p>Very important tho, is you must have mental strength. You will really need it. I just give you a warning that the new OC you will be getting for your BMT is quite a...scary character lol. Good luck! =p</p>
              <p>When I leave pasir ris camp, you will be going in, so I'll try to make everyone clean the bunks nicely for you guys hahaha!</p>

              <p>hey! that's very true, most of the leaders who went over ocs told us that they were, most of the time, demostrating what they have learnt in leader cse to the others. but because ocs is infantry based training, so they also have to learn the infantry fighting stuff from the others..</p>
              <p>new OC is who ah.. 2ic is Low Soon Pang? very nice man.</p>
              <p>Oh I have to add, officers suffers at OCS, but men and specs suffered like maggots at hendon.</p>

              <p>interesting! but i kinda confused. i thought everyone who passed out from commando bmt muz go thru BCT 1st before being posted to other units like cdo section leader's course, signals and stuff etc.</p>

              <p>hope someone can clarify about that though thx...</p>
