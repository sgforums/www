              <p>Behave well and most of us here are more than willing to offer help and advice. In a way, i would say u are the cause of everyone'e reaction towards you and you were not polite in certain instance as well.</p>
              <p>Almost all JC/poly grads will go to tekong and from there be posted to either SISPEC, OCS or to their vocational units. Guards is a possible but i don't think ppl go to commandos from tekong but i'm unsure about the commandos part.</p>
              <p>Until you get your vocation, don't worry so much about what you might get. There are so many different vocations out there that everyone can get to worry yourself over 1.</p>
              <p>Mono intake are direct intakes into combat units such as infantry, armour, guards etc etc which is mostly for the ITE grads and poly halfway dropouts etc</p>

              <p>Did you asked yourself Why people screw u?</p>
              <p>Typically if you have NS  jitters to overcome fear is to train and more training like running  Chin Up....swimming etc....do excerise. Keep yourself physically fit.</p>
              <p>So i suggest you get off this site and go excerise ...stop wasting your time posting junk.</p>

              <p>As i've said already, there are many vocations out there and unless you are posted to that vocation, do not worry about it. Considering there are over 100+ views of this topic and so few replies, continue to ignore listening and more will ignore helping u in future.</p>
              <p>If u die die must know, its just a guards scout and don't bother asking for more details about it.</p>

              <p>okay.. i went through tekong an ice age ago.. i'm 40 this year... that shows you how long ago it was...</p>
              <p>my OC for echo company wore a red beret.. the first things he said to us was "men, i'm not much for words. i'll tell you what i believe in.. i believe in tough training"</p>
              <p>and boy did he train us..</p>
              <p>we had to go through it all because he really led by example.. he went for a few log PTs (which i don't think exist anymore) with us... he ran a few SOCs with us.. he led us from the front in all of our route marches.. he was the primary demonstrator when we learnt the leopard crawl up Botak Hill by crawling up the goddamned hill..</p>
              <p>the company and the platoon figured we're going to go through it no matter what and stuck with it.. morale was high because we could hold our head up high when compared to the other companies who were "soft" while we were hard as nails..</p>
              <p>except for the 2 fuckers who whinged their way through the whole of BMT, the whole platoon stuck together and enjoyed our stint together... even through the defaulters' parade...</p>
              <p>now.. think of this as a rite of passage.. and be positive.. every male singapore citizen goes through it..</p>
              <p>who knows? you might even enjoy it!</p>

              <p>Let me just say this: you got hammered really good not because you asked questions. It was because of <em>what</em> questions you asked, and the mentality you displayed in asking those questions.</p>
              <p>Regardless
                  of whatever you may think, the army experience is 25% physical and 75%
                  mental. You can be at the peak of your fitness, but it all counts for
                  nuts if your mindset is not in the right place. I've seen Rambo-fit
                  fellas go kaput because of the wrong mindset. I've also seen Winnie the
                  Poohs who came out stronger, fitter, smarter, and more mature than ever
                  before because they had the right kind of mindset.</p>
              <p>In the previous thread, you told everyone that you were thinking
                  of keng-ing, you were gloating about going to OCS and you were declaring that army had
                  made us all more mature but not smarter. Had you stuck to that kind of mentality, you would have already lost 75% of the battle before even
                  stepping foot into the army.</p>
              <p>All I can say about winning this
                  75% battle is this: have an open mind, and think positive. There is
                  seriously no point in thinking about things like whether you are going
                  to Guards Recon Platoon or so on when you haven't even received your
                  formal enlistment date and location.</p>
              <p>Instead, just take it as
                  it comes. Army life is what you choose to make of it. If you choose to
                  think positive and strive to get something out of it, you will find
                  that army is a worthwhile experience.</p>
              <p>Have an open mind, and remember this phrase: <strong><em>we are all in this together</em></strong>. Do not only think about yourself. Your platoon and section mates are all in there
                  with you, and they are the only ones you can really depend on. You are
                  also in this with all of us, for we are among the people who have walked the
                  path thatyou are about to embark on.</p>
