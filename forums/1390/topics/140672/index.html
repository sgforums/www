            <div class='col-md body'>Nope, but chances are that you're going to train longer hours, and you're definitely going to book out less than the Tekong boys.<br><br>In my day, lights out was typically 0100-0130, and reville was 0445.  Don't know if that's changed.  Every day starts with a run between 3 and 5 km long, and that's if you're not being turned out at Changi Beach.<br><br>Basically, the syllabus is standard - it's just that's you'll be trained harder than at Tekong.  Not that it matters - if you make sure you don't get injured in training, it's perfectly survivable, and it's been getting easier over the years.</div>
