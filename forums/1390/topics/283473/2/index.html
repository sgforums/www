He was told to clear out the recreation room which was filled with furniture and other odds and bits.<br><br>He approached me lamenting his back injury.I agreed with him that he could not do the back breaking work, I spoke to our CSM in his office and he gave him 5 boxes of filing &amp; paper work to do instead over the weekend.<br><br>Personally i feel that the YSL brash actions to be popular will be fruitful,but as an effective leader, he have failed..<br><br>Personal turn out is important and it speaks volumes of the person's pride and discipline in ensuring his bearing is correct of a soldier.And I'm too quite particular about personal turn out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

In fact I dun respect this kinda 2LT for "trying to help" sia.<br><br>As a commissioned officer, he should support and enforce discipline.

Although your CSM by-right may give him face to call the young kid "sir", but he can also whack this 2LT for discipline matters. Although very rare and usually refer to OC to talk to PCs, but he CAN do that if he want to. Your 2LT is no big deal. CSM cannot punish him, but he can refer him to senior officers who will whack this kid to wake up his idea.<br><br>But for Commissioned officers, 2LT and above, can directly GIVE YOU EXTRA, without anybody's prior approval, though he will refer you to CSM to write in the informal punishment book.<br><br>nothing wrong one...3SG also can recommend u extra...just not auto-approve only...must OC/CSM approve.</div></blockquote>Some regulars just think they are some big shots (in the army). of course, to the rest of us who 'suffered' under their injustice, we just brushed them off as somebody who cannot make it in the society and therefore sign on as specialists.<br><br>Wonder y specialOps is so furious about this matter?

The CSM may sound wrong but be reminded that this is coming from one side so it tends to distort some facts. Discipline should have been upheld and such behaviour of trying to belittle the instructions of appointment holders do not reflect well on the discipline of the 2LT.</div>
