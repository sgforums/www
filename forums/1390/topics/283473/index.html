I guess we have no quarrels on this.<br><br>now for the extra for the kiwi. first you say the 2lt has no business circumventing that guideline and yet below you note that deserve respect entails finding balance between rule-bound and casual with not riding the men hard. Assumingthe 2lt finds that an extra for that( and maybe even the requirement to kiwi) is riding the men too hard and being too much rule bound; thus he is trying to correct it? He has business trying to prevent problems from pple who think of obligations wrongly.<br><br>Besides, i think the whole issue here is as you put it. part of the job.I doubt it can be really considered a job in the first place.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When I read the negative posts in this thread, it reminds me how low my fellow men can get.<br><br>A was wrong in not polishing his boots to a standard acceptable by his CSM; and the CSM rightfully handed punishment - but the punishment that was handed out was disproportionate to the offence.<br><br>The 2LT was right in helping A although I agree he should not have undermined the authority of the CSM; that is the only reason that I can think of for which the 2LT might be blameworthy.<br><br>Some of you raise the argument the 2LT is not enforcing discipline. That is utter bullshit; he is disciplining the CSM. I further like the fact that the 2LT understands the feelings of the NSF - to serve and leave. A leader who understands not the feelings of his men, commands no respect - if he were to act on his own personal agenda, he would be a mere dictator.<br><br>My point is duly made by A's reaction - we can count on his support for his commander. Had the 2LT openly agreed with the CSM's decision, A would probably have has little respect for him as the CSM.<br><br>In any case, alot of you jokers don't seem to draw the line between WO and CO - the WO is a grunt, and the CO is a gentleman; together they lead our army (think good-cop, bad-cop).

Besides, end of the day the lower ranks can only rely on the "laws" to protect themselves short of some widespread and serious injeustice that incites drastic actions from many</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mhcampboy:</div><div class="quote_body">sometimes, junior officers tend to be a bit big headed...</div></blockquote>Hmm..that comment was simply unwarranted and does not contribute to any part of this discussion.<br><br>Big headed?? I feel it's protecting his men. of course there's a fine line between over-defending which would be deemed abuse of authority and the pure concern of the welfare of his guy.<br><br>Everyone knows that not improper bearing is an offence and that we know equally better that the rules can NOT be followed like a bible. Thins must always be seen in context so there is this flexibility to go "around" the rulebook at times. So as an officer, it's his duty to take care of the welfare of his guys. The fact that he is given the power to employ that flexibility would warrant him to look at things and decide on what is right and wrong. So clearly he felt that the punishment was inappropriate and that TS should NOT be asked to carry heavy loads. So how can one say that he is childish or whatsoever.<br><br>But to look at this situation from other angles would perhaps show that the officer had no respect for the csm. But how knows what this situation is. Maybe he didn't command at all any respect in the first place. That's hypothetical... So my point is...rules and written by humans..bending the rules does not imply defiance or whatsoever. Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by rmyfrm:</div><div class="quote_body">Some of you raise the argument the 2LT is not enforcing discipline. That is utter bullshit; he is disciplining the CSM. I further like the fact that the 2LT understands the feelings of the NSF - to serve and leave. A leader who understands not the feelings of his men, commands no respect - if he were to act on his own personal agenda, he would be a mere dictator. </div></blockquote>Surely you jest.<br><br>This is an army, not Singapore Idol.  Leaders who go out to be popular are ineffective - this 2LT has traded competence (i.e. enforcing and supporting the discipline that any army requires, which is his job as an officer) for being buddy-buddy with his men.  Respect and popularity may coexist, but they are decidedly not interchangeable.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TS must have a sad life in the army. or maybe hasnt encountered nsf officers who are big time arseholes.<br><br>from my POV, that nsf 2lt is jus trying to show off his power. or maybe all along, he had some displeasure against this WO and can't do anything abt it. using this issue as a way to deal with him. whatever it is, i feel that many young officers nowadays are only substandard, not the ones everyone used to see and respect. heck, i've even seen pes c officers cuz of some small prob. 1 even admit he keng to downgrade, so that he can slack during reservist.<br><br>WOs are the ppl working on the ground with the nsfs and have a wealth of experience with them, no matter whether it's their jobscope or dealing with ppl. i feel that they shld be given the due respect.</div>
