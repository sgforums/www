              <p>Step 2: Pray(understudy pray,not U).</p>

              <p>I didn't want my phone to ring 24/7 after i left so i did my best :p I was the only 1 who was well verse with the entire system procedure and besides my own people, i have to help people in other companies in the camp and even people outside SAF with some of their work so if i didn't teach well, my phone will ring with people more than just my understudy calling.</p>
              <p>There is a limit to how much i can teach since system though has alot of standard working procedures, the adhoc and occasional system errors are things i am unable to really teach my understudies well since system errors don't always have the same signs and symptoms.</p>

              <p>Your RQ (or anyone else, for that matter) does not have the power to extend your ORD.</p>
              <p>Unless if you do something really naughty and get yourself thrown into DB.... which I doubt is the case, yes?</p>
              <p>The only thing I can say is to hammer it into your understudy's skull that he has to learn now, because after you ORD, he's on his own. And warn him that you will not bother picking up the phone to help him how to do his work after you ORD.</p>
              <p>And seriously, don't bother any more about him after you ORD.</p>
              <p>You might also want to confide in your RQ about this fella. Your RQ might want to drag this fella into his office to give him a Sir Alex Ferguson 'hair-dryer' session to wake up his ideas.</p>
