'Its military structure and doctrine is geared towards an offensive and the Republic's defence strategy is based on forward defence,' he added.<br><br>He said that while the Malaysian Army had the answer to the form and posture of Singapore's military, Malaysians must be prepared to bear the high cost and sacrifices needed to make it a success.</strong><br><br>His column in Mingguan was wide-ranging in its discussion of issues - from his views on the Al-Ma'unah incident to general army tactics and America's war on terrorism.<br><br></div>

Here are some SAF weakness mentioned by Huxley:<br>1. Are our generals bureaucrats or military strategists? (Many of them are holding appts in govt stat boards or GLCs. Makes me wonder if they are career soldiers or just another reservist like me)<br>2. How long &amp; how well can NSmen fight against a professional, albeit less well-equipped and less well-educated, adversary in a hostile land?<br>3. Falling birth-rates.<br>4. Many military assets stationed overseas.<br><br>I believe Mindef never underestimate our neighbours as we continue to pursue the 3G SAF. on our part, we should take our training seriously.[/u]</div>
