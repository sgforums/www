However, the German lines were over-extended and the Soviet defenders counterattacked the 1st Panzer Army's spearhead from the north, forcing them to pull out of the city and behind the Mius river; the first proper German withdrawal of the war.<br><br>Just as Operation Typhoon got going, the Russian weather struck. For the second half of October it rained solidly, turning what few roads there were into endless mud that trapped German vehicles, horses and men alike. With 100 miles still to go to Moscow, there was worse to come when the temperature plunged and snow started following. The vehicles could move again, but the men could not, freezing with no winter clothing. The German leadership, expecting the campaign to be over in a few months, had not equipped their armies for winter fighting.<br><br>One last lunge on 15 November saw the Germans attempting to throw a ring around Moscow. On 27 November 4th Panzer Army got within 19 miles of the Kremlin when it reached the last tramstop of the Moscow line at Khimki, while 2nd Panzer Army, try as it might, could not take Tula, the last Russian city that stood in its way of the capital. Furious rows marked the difference in opinion between Hitler, who insisted that the drive towards Moscow could not be halted, and his generals, whose troops were completely exhausted in the murderous cold. As the Fuhrer started sacking those commanders who opposed him, it was at this point that the Soviets struck back for the first time."<br><br>The power of Russian Winter .

Just gimme my SAR 21 and I'll blast a few 5.56mm holes in our enemies.</div></blockquote>The SAF was designed to counter a single primary threat: the country immediately to the north of us. The secondary threat was the country to the south of us. It is a very nation-specific military doctrine that the SAF has. Exactly like Israel.<br><br>But to the orginal question: Can Singapore defend itself? You bet your last dollar we can! I'd be willing to stake my life that for every fucker who says he's gonna run during a conflict, there are 10 who will stay behind and defend our people. We've got the largest, most sophisticated military in the region. Whether or not pessimistic assholes who dare to call themselves "Singaporean" know that or not is not as important as the fact that our potential aggressors know that. And boy are they wise not to mess with us militarily.</div>

But when push comes to shove, the fighting will not be done on Singapore soil. If Singapore is a "little red dot," then any potential aggressor will have a very bad case of chicken pox when the SAF is fully mobilised.</div>
