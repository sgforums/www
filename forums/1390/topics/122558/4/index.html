            <div class='col-md body'>Here's my question might be a little off-topic, How would the situation be like among the civilian population in Singapore once the fighting reaches our shores or even before? Your average Singaporean isn't even prepared for a minor incident let alone a full scale war. If the war is a long one we will be in deep trouble.<br><br>If there is a long term conflict, food supplies would run low once the ships stop coming, the government may have set aside a certain amount of food just in case the brown stuff hits the fan but how long can the supplies last. Soon after the supplies run out, you'll have people fighting over food and I doubt your local NTUC would still be stocking up food by then <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> and I think they would run out of stocks once war is declared. Like the rush to buy masks during the SARS period.<br><br>Why would people fight over food? Why should your child eat while mine starve.<br><br>Would there still be Law and Order on the streets even with panic among the population? Once law and order breaks down the situation may go from bad to sh1t <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> .

I think the enemy can only achieve this to a certain degree only. For example by only a few thousand troops (not more). They can use the peak hours at the Causeway , as example, to mask troops movements. But beyond this number, it is difficult. Any armed forces has a variety of intelligence gathering sources which feed info and also corroborate info. It is difficult to mask troop movements , beyond a few battalions size.  You may be able to launch a limited surprise strike but may not be able to sustain the attack. So what is the objective?  As the enemy, you only stir up some trouble but to what gain?   SAF is not so weak  or unprepared.</div>
