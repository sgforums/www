Planes will arrive in s'pore abt 4 mins frm nearby countries, n as fast as 10 mins frm as far as USA. Sm goes 2 their navy. but nt tat fast lah. As 4 ground attack, there r sum strategic areas ard CBD area 2 use 2 block e waters (cant let u guys knw where,of course), so enemy warships cant get near.  E rest of the common area's e xpress way tat goes 2 changi airport. Its use 4 landing n takin off, so food will be delivered through tat route. Still got alot. These r jus part of it. So at e end of e dae, s'pore can realli defend itself well. CHEERS</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No offence to those people who insist that "1 bomb is all it takes", "nuclear bomb, all die already, why fight?"... ad nauseum...<br><br>What would be the benefit of using nuclear weapons against Singapore? Unless you belong to a suicidal terrorist group. Nuking our island would have absolutely no strategic benefit.<br><br>This is because:<br>1) A major sea lane would be cut off from all traffic for months or years due to radiation and "nuclear winter". This means no movement of any naval traffic for any side.<br><br>2) Any nuclear bomb of even the magnitude used during WWII, would probably take off a chunk of Malaysia and perhaps even some Indonesian islands (Bintan &amp; Batam?) so that means our neighbours would never use one (even if they had nuclear capability).<br><br>3) Why bomb a place if you want to occupy or capture it for control of sea lanes?<br><br>No offence but the ONE BIG BOMB THEORY is seriously flawed...<br><br></div>

If RSAF pilots were to be like you, fly the fastest route over to singapore, i think there will be not enough fuel/planes to do aerial combat.<br><br>Take a aerial battle in singapore for example , and using the thailand AFB ,<br>To take the fastest route down to malaysia , take F-16(s) flying straight down Peninsula malaysia instead flying over the gulf of thailand , will get shot down by AAMs..Planes like F-15 may have a MACH 2.5 speed limit , but there's no way they can arrive in 10 minutes , you have to take into consideration , the pilot's ability to fight a combat after flying across the pacific .<br><br>Satellite communication with HQ is definitely necessary to discuss detailed areas and places to bomb....<br><br></div>

A trip just under halfway around the globe in just ten minutes? I don't think so.<br><br>Even satellites aren't that fast. They take about 90 minutes to orbit once around Earth.... which roughly translates to 40 minutes for the distance between SG and the US.</div>
