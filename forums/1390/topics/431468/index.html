              <p>Now you already PES E and also on long term MC leave, you still unhappy?</p>
              <p>Although I sympathise for you unable to walk at the moment, but technically speaking now, you are now serving NS at home already wearing home clothes, not in camp doing actual NS work wearing any uniform...</p>

              <p>I heard that Pes E now got chance of reservist. basically i want to get out of sg with no strings attach. espeically to NS. (i got 2 uni offer in Aus and my family got the money)(im not bragging) and i may never want to return here. </p>
              <p>I do travel around the world and seen different cultures. that's why im sure of my options of going aus.  </p>

              <p>1. 3 months ORD, on long term home MC ==&gt; just suck it up. Seriously, what more do you want?</p>
              <p>2. You're already on PES E, so your chances of reservist are already slim. And once you've served your NS liability, they will not recall you as long as you apply for a long-term exit permit.</p>
              <p>And even if for some reason they happen to recall you in spite of your PES status and your exit permit, you can still get a medical deferment if it comes down to that.</p>
              <p>So, really, what else do you want?</p>

                       from NS training refers to the postponement of NS for a period of one 
                      year or longer. NSmen may apply for disruption from NS if they are 
                      overseas for employment or studies for a period of one year or longer.<br><br>Applications
                       for disruption based on overseas reasons of 1 year or more are to be 
                      supported by a  valid EP. Applications for EPs can be done at <a class="imindefParstextimageText" href="http://www.ns.sg/">www.ns.sg</a>. Once the EP has been approved, the disruption will automatically be processed.<br><br><br></span></p>

                       from NS means that an NSman is relieved of all NS liabilities. 
                      Exemption from NS is granted only when the SAF Medical Board has 
                      certified an NSman to be medically and permanently unfit (PES F) for 
                      military service or when one renounces his citizenship.</span></p>

              <p>I dont know about you. But for me if I seriously cannot walk. I will ask the unit to send me a vehicle and escort to camp and back home. Else my parents will have to take leave and come along, and ask the unit to apply visitor pass for them. Basically it is very difficult to go around and I need help to move around. I will be happy if the CO/OC do come down for a house visit, for the "care for soldier" thingy.</p>
              <p>Anyway, leg injury would recover so it is a temporary condition.(Recover to manageable level, does not mean that you can run.) ADHD and Dyslexia are also temporay condition and they would also recover.</p>
