            <div class='col-md body'>WHEN I started business in the motor trade a couple of years ago, I was surprised that many companies are reluctant to employ Singaporeans for several reasons. One of the main ones is that most male Singaporeans have to serve two to three weeks' reservist training every year.<br>As a Singaporean, I understandably want to support my own people and give our men an opportunity. So my company went against the grain by employing one permanent resident and one Singaporean where most other companies go with PRs.<br><br>Both were equally hard working and resourceful. However, the Singaporean had in-camp training and when he failed his individual physical proficiency test (IPPT), he had to go for further training which meant that he had to leave work early. No such thing with PRs.<br><br>Although the Government reimburse the employee during reservist training, a company employs someone because of his contribution to its profitability. Does the Government take loss of business into consideration?<br><br>Small companies do not have the financial strength to bear the loss. Does this mean male Singaporeans can work only in large companies?<br><br>I wonder if the career Singapore Armed Forces officers who plan training programmes empathise with the difficulties male Singaporeans face in getting as well as retaining jobs - especially now with the greater influx of immigrants. Have they gone overboard with their planning? Do First World countries like Germany and Switzerland have similar durations in their national service and reservist training? Rather than two or three weeks' reservist training, can it be reduced to one week or less?<br><br>To Singaporean employers, the inconvenience and loss of business due to the disruption tilt the scales to favour PRs instead of Singaporeans. The survivability of the company may force us to pick PRs the next time we look for an employee.<br><br>My son will do his NS at the end of the year. When he finishes his NS, will he face this problem when he looks for a job?<br><br>Sylvester Lim Teck Hee<br><br>(Straits Times 20 Nov)<br><br></div>

The army will also let u deferred. During ICT, if ur company requires u for an emergency, the CO usually will close one eye and let u go back for the company to settle then come back. Personally, I seen cases where the CO allow his men to book out everyday during the ICT just to let them settle their job or allow them to attend their part-time courses.<br><br>Remember, the whole NS unit, all officers, WOSEs including ur NS CO are also reservist, they are more understanding and are flexible when it comes to ur job outside compare to NSF period.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, sometimes MINDEF does a little "loophole" for example they call you back on the Febuary 07 for a high key exercise and they can call you back again in November 07 for another high key exercise.<br><br>This is because their work year is from May of current year till the April of the next year.<br><br>So if you get two call back per year don't be surprised lol<br><br>But frankly which employer would enjoy having their staff to be not in office for 6 weeks per year... and do you know what type of piling of paper work and you know what when you get back from ICT.... 1 week is bad enough 3 is gonna kill ya... but MINDEF does not understand this problem but they are good enough to reduce the number of cycles to less at leasst there is some improvement there right?<br><br>This NS thing is not only hinders the prospect imagine 2 years of degree course the ladies are doing ahead of you you are label a loser when you hit the books again cause you lose touch with them and these ladies graduate 2 years ahead of you if you are lucky 30% gets married and pregnent the other 70% gets 2 year of job experience ahead of you. If they do, do well in terms of performance you have just might have a lady boss on top of you.<br><br>So of course it does affect the job prospect of the males in Singapore and for the record the extra 100-200 pay we get is not worth the two years we spend serving the country... not that I'n not loyal its just that of what its worth it seems really worthless. And ladies are complaining we are getting these extra allowance at workplace and some are crying foul.<br><br>If someone highs up see these please do something about it get the ladies involved in NS as well we need the NURSES, teachers... and serve the two years as well so the can have the same equal treatment they want so badly. But it doesn't seem fair right ladies... well life isn't. I'm no sexist its just you ladies complain we guys get more pay... better advance standing when we go to uni stuff please be a bit fair for the two years of ahead time you have over us<br><br></div>
