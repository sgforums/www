              <p>Why dont you consider police as a career rather than army? Being a Police Officer is more rewarding and exciting instead of ARMY in GREEN. Monetary rewards also better to Army and career prospect are even best. Moreover, police experience are sought after in the private sectors such as CISCO, civil service investigation works, IRs etc. You dont need to worry after getting a job in private sector after your services expired with Policy.</p>

              <p>please lor, the regulars SPECs are able to drive around not because they are given free licence and do take note that they are not senior officers who is able to get a free MID plate car. it's due to their high salary compared to their peers outside for their age,that they are able to buy a car easily.Class 3 they have to take themselves like normal people, but costs for a class 3 licence from scratch to TP pass is peanuts to them given their pay.</p>

              <p>Hi, Go for M.P as you mention you cant enter SPF.. Why do i tell you to go for M.p rather then Infantry is Simple, In M.p you will be taught law, which can be used outside... Secruity excutive or directors earn can earn up to 8k a month, Just like my friend who was an Ex.Policemen with S.O.C, after serving for 1 term, he left and Immediatly worked in the secruity line, With a starting pay of 4k, Now at the age of 30, he is a director of secruity at one of the hotels in Sentosa, Another friend also after serving a term with S.P.F, Is now a Operations "something, Something" at a local polytechnic with a very good salary package.</p>
              <p>As a M.p and S.p.f, Its almost on the same Par, One deals with Civilians and the other with Military. There is nothing you can use, Once you get out of Infantry.</p>
              <p>Btw, Both of my friends speak really good English. Which is very important if your looking to be in Secruity Managment.</p>

              accidental policy outside dont cover military personnels. So right
              now, he eat shit loh. He got a diploma cert in sport science, but
              cannot be a personal trainer, because he is no longer
              fit. With no other technical skills and cert, being a
              table cleaner is also challenging, as table cleaner have to stand
              and walk around all day. The SAF may post him around to
              do administrative. But I can tell he is in deep trouble now.
              So sign on, with risk, at your own risk. </p>

              <p>Hi, Go for M.P as you mention you cant enter SPF.. Why do i tell you to go for M.p rather then Infantry is Simple, In M.p you will be taught law, which can be used outside... Secruity excutive or directors earn can earn up to 8k a month, Just like my friend who was an Ex.Policemen with S.O.C, after serving for 1 term, he left and Immediatly worked in the secruity line, With a starting pay of 4k, Now at the age of 30, he is a director of secruity at one of the hotels in Sentosa, Another friend also after serving a term with S.P.F, Is now a Operations "something, Something" at a local polytechnic with a very good salary package.</p>
              <p>As a M.p and S.p.f, Its almost on the same Par, One deals with Civilians and the other with Military. There is nothing you can use, Once you get out of Infantry.</p>
              <p>Btw, Both of my friends speak really good English. Which is very important if your looking to be in Secruity Managment.</p>
              <p>Hope i at least pointed you in the right direction.</p>

              <p>The thing is, I'm not too sure to join MP or become an Infantry Officer. I have a diploma and I wish to get a degree cert by the end of my 10 years contract(if i sign on with the saf)... I have a few friends in MP and they encourage me to join MP. But they said, it's all out of luck. Might be posted for silent precision drill squad..</p>

              <p>sorry to tell you, but since you were only a SGT during NSF, you can only sign on as a specialist. as to whether they would recommend you for OCS would depend on your performance appraisal &amp; recommendation by your superiors.</p>
              <p>it is indeed a high risk that you may get stuck in the specialist career track for the duration of your contract though.</p>
              <p>so think carefully before signing the dotted line, unless you really dun mind being a regular specialist.</p>

              <p><br>Wasn't my luck i guess. As for prisons, yeah the recruitment officer told me to go for NS first and when i enquired about my tattoo, he told me directly that even after ord the chances of getting into Prisons are very slim.</p>
              <p>I am not hesistating. I'm just unsure of what vocation to choose. Since chances of getting into OCS are very slim too, then I guess I'll just settle for the Warrant Officer scheme. I am totally fine with that. Only thing is, I wish to further my studies (degree) during the ten years. Is that possible?</p>
              <p>Btw, don't look down on those ITE mono guys man.. they are tough both mentally and physically. Maybe it's not their fault for not excelling well academically. You have to understand some come from not well-off family and have to settle for ITE instead. I'm sure most of them who sign on will try to improve themselves academically. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
