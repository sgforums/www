              <p>but navy higher chance for u.. in any case try to make your clearance as high as possible.</p>
              <p>what's your diploma in btw? personally if your cert is in a suitable area, can consider MDES [which allows spec jump to officer], esp if u are very keen on obtaining a degree.</p>

              <p>Sorry, none of my friends who are in ITE mono, wants to sign on. Even if it is the best logical option . </p>
              <p>I think it is not that possible, it depends on your vocation, if you are in those that requires you to stay in, it is hard. You are a stay-in fellow you should know better, right?</p>
              <p>Beside, there are exercise now and then. SAF's exercise is more important than your exam. So, no OFF for that month. Then you will just failed the subjects straight. As if you boss will care if you need to study for the upcoming exam. Most likely you will be in combat unit. I dont think you can enjoy 8 to 5 clerk work. </p>

              <p>maybe to have a more balanced view, you should also try to learn more about jobs outside of the armed forces.. weigh the pros and cons carefully before deciding on anything, even more so if you eventually decide to put ur signature on the army contract.</p>
