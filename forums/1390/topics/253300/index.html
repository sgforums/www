            <div class='col-md body'>My 1st ICT stint after 2 yrs... 1st thing that blew me is that the nitwitted RSM got nothing better to do... going after the haircuts of NSmen going for ICT... This is one damn thing I can never grasp... How the heck can a haircut portray the impression of sloppiness and ill-discipline, of NSmen? We need to maintain a similar neat &amp; tidy outlook to face our customers/bosses too, and I don't see them complaining...<br><br>The same attention can be spent on more constructive and productive work... and that's what they're paid for. It's no wonder why many regulars are frowned upon... Bunch of wayang people who spoil the reputation...<br><br>So the same taxpayers are spending $$ to be fugged by their bosses for going ICT, jeopardising their promotions and getting fugged again by the slaves whom they are indirectly paying?!? Damned screwed...<br><br>Yah... some of you might just say, get a life and move on... Call it pride or something, but how many of you NSmen can take it lying down after been fugged over such a nitty gritty issue? It's not like we're NSFs... It's tough enough to drag yourself back every year, and I don't see the need for anymore such nonsense...<br><br>AND, I just got my hair cut a week ago... damn.... My rebellious side and "rights" as a citizen (do we have any in ICT?) is telling me not to conform. Any avenues to "shoot" those ball lickers and wayang nitwits?!! Will we kenna "punishments" for not "obeying" orders during ICT??</div>

Finally last year, he left cos he kena condemned for the last few years. Reservist always come @ the wrong timing for him.
