              <p>I'm 16 and doing my NS in 2 years. I have a mild/moderate excersise induced asthma - with some reactions to certain particles. What would my PES be? The lowest? Would I be able to join a combat unit for is that a bar. Can I get a waiver? And does asthma prevent me from doing OCS, SISPEC or Commandos/Guards? Just need a little advice as I live in Australia and I'm not flying up for 2 years to do a desk job as a clerk (btw, is that vocation very likely since I have asthma???)</p>

My brother (who was in the same situation) finished his NS last year in the Air Force and said it was the biggest waste of time and that he doesnt owe Singapore SHIT as he's never lived there or been connected in any other way other than holding its passport.His schooling mates in Australia were all doing GAP years and going off to Uni and are all miles ahead of him now and he has to start from square 1 when many of his friends are already half way through their uni studies. All his friends in Singapore (NS) saw my situation and advised me if there is ANY way, to avoid NS as you will be wasting 2 yrs of your prime and to join the Australian army instead if I wanted to do military service.Help?

              <p>Oh yes you can. Anyone can renounce their citizenship at any Singapore embassy overseas (by walking in and filling up a form. it takes mere minutes). I've asked around and it doesn't matter if they have REGISTERED for NS (it's another form to fill up). Registration happens at 16 to 16 1/2 years. Still, it's a grey and secretive area, I might be wrong, so move quickly and renounce your citizenship.</p>
              <p>Singapore does not recognise dual citizenship (though it does not and cannot stop you from holding it), so you cannot hold on to your Singapore citizenship while avoiding NS.</p>
              <p>A citizen who does not serve NS is a defaulter, you don't want to be one.</p>
              <p>Waivers- don't exist. You're probably in for PES B or C. In my experience these are combat vocations, in practical terms virtually the same as every fighting soldier. You'll be required to carry an inhaler at all times. By freak of chance you may be vocated as a clerk. Or you may be vocated a combat soldier, who is used at the unit's discretion as a clerk if and when it has surplus of fighting soldiers.</p>

I just really don't want to be like a clerk or office worker. Whats the chance a mild asthmatic like me would get put in a combat unit?

              <p>That's very true.</p>
              <p>But I see nothing wrong with being an LSV driver. You'll be heliborne or seaborne like all guardsmen, and it beats being a foot infantry soldier. Though I would choose to be a Spike gunner (which belongs to the support company).</p>

              <p>how are u going to live in spore when doing national service?most of them nowadays dont require u to stay in camp as there might not be sleeping facilitis provided.and the pay isnt enough for renting a place in spore even when u need to go back on weekends and daily after NS as theres no sleeping bunks in some camps.</p>
              <p>if theres no way being a sporean citizen is going to benefit u then just dump the citizenship.</p>
              <p>being a sporean will offer you no rewards.if u think u would make it in spore and be driving a ferrari or live in a penthouse...then think again!!those are meant for people who are really filthy rich like bill gates or if u are connected in some way to top people in the spore politicians where a pay of $1mil/year is the usual fare.</p>
              <p>but if u arent connected in any way to these sorts...then high chance u would end up working from morning to midnight almost everyday for the rest of yer life  even with an aussie degree in spore and earn what some butcher or cleaner would get in oz.and pay would be even lesser if the aussie degree is not recognised by spore itself.</p>
              <p>in which case ,u probably need to have working friends /job interviewers to recognise you instead of your aussie degree.and the pay max would only be S$2k/mth or slightly more...anything more will be considered a freak of nature because its the norm in spore.and pay increment in most companies generally would be subjective and so low u might as well be insane to accept it even if they gave u flying colours for performance and reward u with a high yearly increment after NS in pvt companies.u might even think they are trying to short change u with many companies offering u low pay and stingy increments despite earning millions for company and providing high value added services to them.</p>
              <p>if everyone from yer relatives to friends dont feel anything n distance themselves from spore....then perhaps they are right after all!unless you are one of the few political ministers or come from rich land or hotel owners in spore...its a pure waste of yer time next to joining a foreign legion.</p>

              <p>its your call and decision.tough decisions for a 16 year old  by spore i should say....even worse when u are in spore...best u get yer parents to help u.</p>

              <p>Malingerer!  I'm the only non-Singaporean EU citizen who has served in the local army and it disgusts me to see actual Singaporeans foresaking their own duty.  Such is the lack of honour these days, god help our men when it comes to the crunch.  Also with other actual Singaporean citizens encouraging such malingering. Disgusting.</p>
              <p>But on a less grunt-like note, yes friend it is important to choose for yourself.   My advice is for you to give up Singapore citizenship and keep the Australian one.  But then again the Aussie economy is not exactly a get-rich-quick-setting depending on your career choices and the threat of racism if you are "azn" looking.  Then to work in Singapore, you'd just become a PR or get a work permit like-everyone else.  However, before getting PR make sure you are out of the NS-range so they cant call you up.  What else, oh yes to get PR, go to a prestigious school and you'll be offered PR by the Singapore govt. </p>
