              <p>Logically, CCA is tougher because you're still in a schoolboy/civilian mindset and they put you through a huge culture shock.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In comparison, BMT is literally tougher, but the stress wears off after awhile once you get used to being a soldier.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And some people underestimate CCA standards. In some schools,</p>
              <p>the following are commonplace. </p>
              <p> ----------------------------------------</p>
              <p>"CCA can't ask you to knock it down just because the Sergeant likes it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Uni CCA doesn't ask you to carry a farking heavy fieldpack and ask you to walk a farking long route.</p>

              <p>------------------------------------------</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But of course theres no SBO and crazy vulgarities. Although putting a 19/20 year old through that might be less cruel than putting a 14/15 year old through SOME CCA camps.</p>

              <p>And some people overestimate the strength of a uniform group.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BMT is nothing, unit life is shit. No matter how hostile your UGCCA mates are, they can never be compared to the people you meet in a unit. Those "big fark wannabes", the DXOs, the arrows and the wayangs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, some schools do enforce those "trainings" onto their cadets, and let me tell you they're breaking almost every protocol and rules of the Corps. We're comparing the generic or the general Sec Sch Uniformed Group, not those schools. Until the majority of Singapore School's enforces their UG to break their protocols and rules just to train their unit, we can safely say that BMT is definitely harder then the UG in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CCA will not be tougher then BMT when you volunteered yourself willingly to their service, you know their trainings will be tough, and you willingly accept it. This strengthens your mind, and also you will view their trainings in a more positive way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hand, BMT is mainly filled with conscripts that serve the Army because our Statutes and Act says so, time crawls when you do things unwillingly, and things seem to be so much harder.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And I think this IS logically right.</p>

              <p>Very true...as the above poster says...to quote a line from LTC Doolittle of WW2's Doolittle Raid "Nothing Beats The Heart Of A Volunteer".</p>
              <p>Being in a UG you willingly VOLUNTEER yourself to it.You had a choice, but you chose to be in a UG fully knowing that you will be shouted at, given "harsh"physical training and all other stuff. And you signed up, because you wanted to be part of them.Be it for the flashy badges, the ranks, the glamour of giving command in the parade square during your school's anniversary or whatsoever...the motivation is all intrinsic. You will even push yourself further to the edge of the envelope, push your buddies/platoon mates and through that foster greater bonds.Its same as those regular SF people,they are all volunteers whom are highly motivated and self-driven though some say they are "mercernary" and eyeing the money (cummon...there's an easier way to make more money den having to rappel down 60ft. of rope onto a ship in the high seas froma chopper and taking incoming rounds at the same time,but this is society...and its at least an honest way compared to stealing or robbing)</p>
              <p>However,I think/believe NS is different. From my prior NCC background, I would say its a world of difference. Though I'm OPENLY interested in the military,having been served the enlistment letter, I'm excited yet nervous.Its the "looking forward,yet dreading it" feeling.Its not that I'm not willing to serve, but its that its a totally different culture. In the UG...you can call for a timeout when you're sick or you don't feel able to take the training,at most your peers will encourage or snigger at you saying that you try to chao keng which encourages you to return to the group. However, in NS, I'm sure those of you that have met ex-NCC cadets get turned off by them as they are deemed to be overly "garang" and thus spoil market for everyone as some are just simply interested to literally "SAF" and not fighting for command school or for awards etc.</p>
              <p>End of the day...it all boils down to the individual's mindset.</p>
