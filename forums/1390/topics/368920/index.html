              <p>Read so many people writting that when Singapore is in a war they will not fight for Singapore but will buy a air ticket and quickly leave Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hmm. When there is a war, you think the government will still let you buy air ticket to get out of Singapore meh? I think the government will ban all flights out of Singapore and will probably ban all ships and trains from leaving Singapore too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But neverthless when there is a war I won't go and fight with the enemies for 2 reasons.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. The PAP brings in foreigners to steal my jobs. So why should I go and fight in the war while these PAP politicians will most probably take a flight out of Singapore and wait until the war is over to come back?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. I think most people actually chao keng throughout their 2 years ns and I am also 1 of such people. I chao keng and become a PES C storeman and I everyday slack and sleep throughout the 2 years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only time I do work is probably to do stupid things such as move stores and man the waterpoint and serve the officers with food. I have forgotten how to use the M16 already.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So when there is a war, I won't be so stupid as to go and fight with the enemies when I don't even remember how to use the M16 already <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>The Government probably expected this, that's why the SAF has never been beefed up to a level supposedly "enough to win a war".</p>

              <p>true true... summary; just accept your fate that you have no other place to run except stay in Singapore and defend it.</p>
              <p>we Chinese have an old belief. it's better to die in your homeland than a foreign land. if you are born in Singapore, Singapore it's your homeland...</p>
              <p>but let's say, you migrated to Australia and have an Auzzie passport; Singapore is still your homeland. come back here and die k?</p>

              <p>Few weeks before the war start, most of the rich people alr bought tickets &amp; escape with their families. When they do this, panick gonna sets in the others, &amp; they will find ways to escape/hide their families. PRs/ foreign wrkers gonna be fleeing too, their families/relatives/friends is still out at other countries, so they do not need to fear no where to go etc. Do you think they stay back &amp; fight? Ha. Ha.</p>
              <p>After this, most operation in Singapore gonna slow down since everyone is leaving. No one is working etc.</p>
              <p>No one imo, is gonna throw their families in Spore &amp; wait for the war to come. Anxious mothers gonna send their children out 1st etc. You think mothers will wanna see her own son die in a war or let gamen declare u AWOL? If every of your love ones are out of here, you think they care whether a war starts or not?</p>

              My business have some dealings with a Israel firm &amp; I happen to know a couple of Israeli guys.  Met up a couple ot times in Singapore.  We chat abt each other NS life &amp; I ask them does anyone think of running away?  Does everyone really think of going to war suddenly?
              
              They replied that they also think of running away.  But how about their familes, friends, loved one? Surely cannot bring everyone along right, so they stay on &amp; fight.  Actually, they dun believe in fighting for their country but they are fighting hard to protect their buddy beside them.

              <p>These people who say they want to fight to proetct their loved ones I think they will go take their rifle and than run back home and hide in their house and wait for the enemy to come than they fight. If enemy don't come than they will just hide in their home</p>

              <p>Which country would be willing to grant asylum to shirkers and deserters?</p>

              <p>Provided we go to war, which we will probably lose due to being small, we know politicians will not stay and fight for their family so why should we?</p>
              <p>Why should i fight when i can bring my whole family over to seek refuge in Malaysia or Indonesia? Do you all seriously think by staying and defending our families, they will live? They will eventually suffer or die.</p>
              <p>Its not that im not patriotic. But patriotism means dying for your country of birth. Thats so flawed. I will die for my country and for the people around me even if they are strangers if my country takes good care of me. If strangers i meet on the streets showed graciouness.</p>
              <p>Why should i stay and fight for my country when i toiled for my country (be it in NS, Reservist or at work) but the people who benefits most are politicians, foreigners and the already-rich?</p>
              <p>Why should i stay and fight for strangers when the strangers i see everyday are mostly ungracious, inconsiderate and  impolite?</p>
              <p>I will gladly die fighting but for something that is really worth dying for and not because some politicians say i should when they will not.</p>
