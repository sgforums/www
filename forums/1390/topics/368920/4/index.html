              <p>They are not going to activate all their might on us.. They have got super lot of islands to protect themself. Not forgetting that they got the south china sea to protect because that location is rich in natural gas reserve and many countries are eyeing on that.</p>

              <p>If u look at their defense budget.. $4.74 Billion (2008) yearly for their military size and our defense budget of $11.447 billion (FY09) yearly for our size of military force.<br><br>Which side of the force is better developed and equip?<br>When we talk abt the capability of a force.

              <p>I suppose their trouble would be getting those men on our shores first! No doubt of the political and social will of the Indonesian people.. when compared to ours. No doubt of the garangness of their troops either, when uh compared to me.</p>

              <p>You are a joke.</p>
              <p>Reserves of a country <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are generated by the government</span> through taxation on both foreign and local entities - both personal and business - that conduct business, living or pleasure in said country. The government is the custodian, which allots and uses the reserves as is seen fit by them. Any government with any brains like China, UAE, Kuwait, Brunei, Qatar, Norway invests their reserves by setting up SWFs.</p>
              <p>Going by your fantasies that 'the people' OWN the reserves, how do you distribute the reserves to 'the people'? In equal portion? By citizenship? Divided by 4 million people, each shareholder get a few hundred dollars like a listed company giving out dividends? (i'm so sure you have no idea what i'm talking about cos you're poorly educated + a fool).</p>
              <p>If you fantasize that it be dispersed in that manner, then it means you believe Singapore is a communistic country, because the contributors of the pool are not equal. How much did you contribute towards it, and how much Ng Teng Fong, the richest man in Singapore contributed towards it? Please la what a fucking fool. People who work for the government pay taxes too. So this means a minister, who pays far higher taxes than you and your entire lineage of 10 generations of ancestors added together, (because you're a typical fool, I doubt you came from good stock), has far greater ownership to the reserves than you. I'm quite sure you don't pay a single cent of income tax because I see you no-up, i highly doubt you make even a measly $1800 a month, or is it $1600 now for minimum income for personal taxation LOL?</p>
              <p>You must be one of the fools who think that anyone who works in public service is 'hired' by you when you don't pay beyond $100 in income tax LOL, while my friends in public service pays $10k a year in income tax before they turn 30. Everytime i read the work of uneducated peasant fools like you talk big in forums about how civil servants owe you a living when you literally, have nothing and contributed nothing to both the success and the reserves of Singapore gives me a bad stomachache from laughing.</p>
              <p>If a civil servant, no matter whether is a minister who pays high income tax or a clerk who pays not much, is 'hired' by the pool of income tax paying citizens, does it mean they are their own bosses and hire themselves? Since they also pay income tax?!</p>
              <p>There isn't a single SWF that didn't lose money during this financial
                                                                              crisis. Four Gulf region SWFs lost US$450 billion (S$700 billion). Even Warrent Buffett lost money. Who
                                                                              are you dumb fucks to talk? Esp about money that is NOT yours? Loser. It's traditionally oil-rich nations, China and first world countries that have large SWFs. For a developing country like Singapore with no natural resources and land and many stupid self-righteous 'citizens' to have one SWF, you should consider it a miracle already and grab the balls of your smart leaders and suck them in gratitude.</p>
              <p>You're definitely one of those fools who talk cock all day long about Temasek and GIC, when you can't even speak proper English and never bought a single lot of stock in your life and think that the 'losses' are yours, let alone understand the ABC of investing that some JC kids know. Yet you losers want to take on GIC and Temasek. Dream on. Fools.</p>

              <p>Me thinks SAF can fight Malaysia easily but not Indonesia. And SAF knows this too. SAF built up its forces and pitches its skills against defeating Malaysia and deterring Indonesia. It knows it can beat Malaysia. As for Indonesia, it engages it knowing that its powerful.</p>

              <p>That is not probable. First, the military attache is rarely someone high ranking. No government sends a BG to be a military attache.</p>
              <p>Second, different military attaches carry different weights. The importance of the military attaches are in direct correlation to the importance of the countries that the government engages. Let me give you an example. The attaches SAF sends to places like the US, Israel and Indonesia would be higher ranked or have higher CEP than those they send to countries they deem not as important for military diplomacy.</p>
              <p>An army can easily come into an occupied territory to extract certain targets without engaging in combat with the occupying force. Watch Tears of the Sun.</p>

              <p>What partner? Actually I'm interested to know what Singaporeans think Singapore is to the US.</p>
              <p>if
                                                      Sg were to sink tomorrow, it has no effect on a single thing in the US. Lindsay Lohan's pantyline won't fade a shade and the palms in Malibu won't even wave a bit for it.The box office receipts from SG is so small because of what a tiny country it is that it won't dent even 1% of Steven Spielberg's salary.</p>
              <p>Singapore can't survive without trade with the US. But if SG were to sink
                                                      into oblivion because its people like TS run into the Malaysian
                                                      jungles to suck balls, there isn't an effect on the US at all. I doubt
                                                      there's much of an effect on other smaller countries with a smaller economy than the US.</p>
              <p>Singapore is not an 'important partner'
                                                      to the US in any sense of the word, in Asia or otherwise.</p>
              <p>Within Asia,
                                                      China is the one country that the US is most keen to engage. North
                                                      Korea is in its blacklist. Japan is its ally. It has its eye on
                                                      Indonesia because of its large Muslim population and its link to AQ (sensitive, will not spell it out).</p>
              <p>Singapore is not important a partner to anyone.</p>
              <p>SAF is the only force that has the capabilities, obligation and responsibility to defend the tiny red dot. But I think it can only hold off for about 3 days. Don't count on a mighty powerful savior who owes you nothing to come and rescue you. The only and last time that happened was 2000 years ago. For Christians.</p>

                                              don't know what 'deter' mean. If invaders are attacking, it means
                                              deterrence has failed. Successful deterrence means that there's no
                                              attack. Which is why this 'gem' from you "if the invaders keep attacking

It's so funny that people like you who came up with 'gems' above are the same ones making self-righteous shameless comments about SG and SAF. Seriously with this level of personal ability, even if you want to sign on as ADF man also fail miserably. SAF dude will scream "GET OUT!"</p>

              <p>And you think that battles can be won without infantry and just air strikes? The last time I met someone as dumb as to say that, it was a woman, who obviously never served NS. There's been no battle in history that's won without Infantry (inf= infantry/guards/commando) going in to claim the turf and plant the flag. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>You can bomb the shit out of a place all you want, the air strikes are done to destroy key installations like airport and camps, which would probably be evacuated before the air strikes because of intel.</p>
              <p>In other words, air strikes are combat support only, like signallers, arty. This is something that all Singaporean male should know if they are not retarded, since they would have to do NS.</p>
              <p>In Iraq and Afghan, the air force can blow up the installations and bomb the place all they want but they still had to send in their ground troops to secure the mission.</p>
              <p>The only time any battle had been won and secured without ground troops was when two atomic bombs invented by the scientists from the Manhattan Project (led by Berkeley University and assisted by Chicago University and University of Illionois) were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Everything was flattened, no person left, no structure left, so no infantry troops were needed to secure the mission.</p>
              <p>How can you be so naive about air strikes and war what a fucking retard to have gone through 2 years of NS, and not know SAF war plan or come up with something so fucking stupid above, and worst feel damn smug about it?</p>
              <p>SAF missions are conducted in the jungles here and in Brunei and Taiwan, because SAF expects to fight in Malaysian jungles. The fighting won't take place here at all. I can't say Indonesia but SAF can and will win Malaysia if the day comes. Deterrence is only first part of the doctrine. If you haven't enlisted like some forummers here, it could be excuse but having served 2 years and not know? Oh because you were a storeman. In that case, maybe you should STFU and not make a fool of yourself and confuse pre enlistees like army boizzz who may be fooled by the rubbish that lives in your mouth since you were born <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>hahahahaha i guess u are 16. if sg went to war, britain or america will what? boohoo? maybe frown? cry? hahhaha..or.. maybe wank and then go to bed..<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>seriously..sg economy is so small, if it disappeared into the Black Hole tomorrow, the only country that will care is Indonesia because their earthquake-hit area is receiving first aid from us. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>little boy, the world's biggest economy is the US. 2nd is Japan and 3rd is China. Singapore's demise will not even affect Malaysia's economy. They'll just start treating their own water hahahhah <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Singapore's GDP is behind 3rd world nations like Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Mexico, ex communist states Poland,  Czech Republic, drug smuggling HQ Colombia (which stupid local NUS educated farmer ST reporters always write as Columbia- the Ivy League university <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">), drug land, source of the world's conmen African country, Nigeria <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>The only thing that will save Singapre in a defensive war situation is its geographical location - the shortest route with refuelling and servicing stops between the East and the West.</p>
              <p>Whomever controls Singapore, controls the trade routes of the world, and trade is the lifeblood of all nations. Even Hitler knew that and had wanted to dominate Singapore according to official war documents.</p>
              <p>Should some nuthead ruler from Indonesia decides to gooble up Singapore, our country's valiant men will have to stand up and defend it with our lives.</p>
              <p>We may eventually lose due to the enemy's sheer size, but we are not going to give up,  to roll over and play dead, but to defend with our lives to maintain our soveriegnity and freedom for our families, friends and relatives, as long as possible.</p>
              <p>The potential enemy had shown racist and diabolic idealogical tendercies, treated others with absolute cruelty and harshness, as proven for centuries, thus we can expect no mercy from them should our loved ones be in their hands.</p>
              <p>We are not Somalia, tucked in some forsaken position with absolutely nothing geo-politically worthwhile to protect. The West - US and Europe, together with India and China will not willingly allow Indonesia, an Islamic centric state to control Singapore. Even the Islamic states will not allow it, for Islam is not an united theology as many presumed.</p>
              <p>The UN council will definately meet to stop any enemy's control of our country, and will have to send troops out. Singapore so far had been a friend and ally to many countries, keeping neutral mostly, but supports UN or at least international military coalitions majorities initiative.</p>
              <p>Such actions, however, will take time. In the meanwhile, it will be up to us men to hold out as long as possible, to ensure our families, relatives and friends are either kept safe or evacuated to safety.</p>
              <p>Each and every soldier is precious, and are not expendable, simply because it would take another 18 years to replace one. Thus the necessary and tough trainning to ensure every soldier will be able to live as long as possible, as well as selection of the best and brightest to lead our men. We want no rambos or unnecessary loss of lives, unless there are no other options, and a final option only avaliable.</p>
              <p>Remember always, you were trained to fight for your family, your relatives, your friends and your loved ones, which makes up our society and ultimately our country.</p>
              <p>The previous generations had keep our country safe and served with honour. It will be the present and future generations to do the same, and improve on it. They are our hope and future survival, a life and death situation, a responsibility true Singaporean citizens must not shirk from, no matter the ideolgical differences that may arise from time to time.</p>
