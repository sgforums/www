              <p>perharps let me offer this perspective for "ALL" individual who served in SAF and for those have yet to serve......and all those Crap talk about "Not fighting for Singapore" .......... consider the followings.......</p>
              <p>Any country who intend to invade Singapore already knows SAF made of civilian soldiers, that is to say if you are male citizen of Singapore and if Singapore fall you will be treated as POW.....If you defect you better leave Singapore for good.  Your HDB neighbor will know that you are a Traitor and if Singapore recoved you will be charged with Treason.</p>
              <p>Post WWII German/Japan occupied terroritory Traitors are beaten up and killed.</p>
              <p>In any case even if you don't fight occupied force will still be suspicious of residents Royality...........if occupier choose to play the Race card/religion for royality. They will content with Race Riot. As such occupier will find it effective to control all male serving population.</p>
              <p>So either way either you fight as SAF or Die as civilian it is possible that you are still  being treated as enemy combatent......hmmm........would u still fight?</p>

              idiot running the country stupid enough to raze us to the grounds
              at such a high cost? every soldier's death will cause a backlash
              from the public (maybe except North Korea). look at USA, people
              shouts, "bring our men home"... yes they are putting more men into
              Afganisten but people are not happy... China's people are very
              vocal too, the "Tian An Men" incident showed that if they are not
              happy, they will go to the streets... so with all these
              consideration, which idiot will risk hitting Singapore and

              <p>When i say we are arrogant, people flame me, but here we are claiming that we that if 4 million of us die, 8 million of the enemy will die as well. Isnt that arrogance? Or blinded faith? So that is our philosophy? That's a bit flawed.</p>
              <p>And when they is a war, why are we so sure the enemy will face wraths from other countries? And if they do, you think another country will fight the war with us?</p>
              <p>And for what should i die trying? I rather bring my whole family over to seek refuge from another country and we can survive to a ripe old age even if our life will be poorer than now. At least i have another chance at life. Why should i die fighting knowing that my family will probably die as well?</p>
              <p>That's it, i am done with discussing about this issue.This will be my last post about this topic. Let me live my life with my opinions unless the Government can show me that this country is worth dying for, which till now they can't.For those, who will fight to their deaths, i only hope they are man of their words.</p>

              <p>1) if those guys in China and India want to come to SG and work longer hours for less pay, that's their business. We cannot compare because SG is a developed nation while those 2 countries are developing nations. If you want to compare, then wait till 20 yrs later when those 2 become fully developed nations, then u compare their salary rates with us SGreans. and btw, due to those 2 giants rising rapidly, their average worker income has also risen with the times. 10 - 20 yrs down the road, don't be surprised if average salary in China is higher than us for the same job position.</p>
              <p>2) it doesn't matter if one tuang or not in NS, because at the end of 2 yrs, everybody serve and fark off and forget everything. Like me.......i slog and tidy and care for my GE store and armskote and other rooms like hell and did free duties for some idiots, while others tuang for 2 years. Now, everyone ORD liao, who will remember?! i regret i didn't tuang more back then. I was a fool.</p>
              <p>3) A lot of anti-aircraft missles in SG? oh yeah, u believe we have the resources to shoot down all the air strikes and air threats coming at us while we also at the same time defend invaders on land and sea? our forces will be fully streteched out thin.</p>
              <p>4) we bring the fight to malaysia? are u kidding?! what makes u so sure our forces can even land in malaysia? and even if we can, our forces will be depleted and streteched out thin as mention above. Meaning if another part of malaysian army attack our stretched-out SAF, we are gone.</p>
              <p>and btw, even if we can bring down JB, we still have one HELL of a fight to go and no way SAF will have resources or stamina to bring down other key installations in malaysia, because our armed forces are not meant to fight in other countries, only to "deter threats".</p>
              <p>what this "deter threats" means is that we build up our SAF so that potential invaders will think twice about invading us, and not over-running another country in times of war.</p>
              <p>because malaysia is so much larger than us, even if we bring down
              one of their city due to miracle, they have such huge land mass to
              carry on the fight.</p>
              <p>how about us? just a single air strike hit singapore (even if it's 1 successful air strike out of 100), we're goners.</p>
              <p>above is just an example against malaysia. if you replace that with Indonesia, we're still goners. If you're talking about China, say 50 yrs down the road when it's become a full grown dragon intent to devouring SE-Asia, then adios, Singapore.</p>
              <p>5) are u currently serving in NS now? i know some guys get very siao-on and enthu during NS and even want to sign-on etc. I hope u're not one of them, and i hope you're not believing all these 3G crap and hype.</p>

              <p>Frank speaking.. I am so shameful of those who choose to run away rather than to defend.. Even thought we might have a slight chance to win the opponent.</p>
              <p>In the first place, Singapore doesn't own you anything from the first day you are born.</p>
              <p><br>Instead, from the first day we are born. We own Singapore a lot of thing. The security u enjoy, the education provided (without that u think we are still world class, without that can we still compete ourself even with those developing nation), the life (thought stressful, but what do we gain? A stable income to enjoy family bonding, able to go overseas relax for at least minimum once a lifetime.)<br><br>Do Singapore own us or we Own Singapore? Pls think through..<br>When we fight, we are protecting this piece of land (Red Dot) that we call Home. thought not as big as our neighbour but its still the place we grown up.<br><br>U can choose to flee when war come.. But you will be treated as a third class citizen, a refugee in that country. What good does it get? Are they going to look after u as their first priority? How far can u run when the war break out. At most only 6hrs of grace time. After that, the airport may be crippled. The sea line may be closed. As a individual you can run very far, because of no worry. As a family, how far do you think you can travel..?</p>
              <p>U can keng or tuang in NS. Who care! Who doesn't keng or tuang before. In my unit, everyone will find opportunity to do that. But when it time to do our job in defend n in exercises. Everyone will give their very best.. No one will want to let the buddy beside them down when the button is press.</p>

              <p>commandos, guards, wadever their names. they are just airborne trained, and probably more garang than the average army rifleman. outside of that, they are still infantry foot soldiers, mortals with only 4 limbs like the rest, with the same limited ability. they are not superman.</p>
              <p>look around you, look for the people who are in commando. do they look as if they can repel bullets? in a gun fight, they are subjected to the same level of risk as the others, and we cannot depend on them as invincible soldiers who will win wars for us.</p>
              <p>and you make infiltration seems so easy, that anyone can sneak in and fly off in one of their planes. the enemy may be lacking in equipment but not manpower. do you think they will simply allow anyone to sneak into their bases unnoticed and fly off with their precious airplanes?</p>
              <p>and with regards to singapore's size, any potential enemy does not even need an airstrike to attack us. we are within immediate range of short range and intermediate range missiles, which are cheap and plentiful in the armies of SEA. and we all know that there's nothing we can do to stop these short range missiles. any missile hitting any hdb flat will results in unspeakable casualties.</p>
              <p>and the navy is probably the most useless toy in any armed forces, with the exception of aircraft carrier groups (for the projection of power, since they are often fighting far away from home). for a small country like singapore, it is pointless to have surface naval ships such as the frigates. do we still expect naval battles in this day and age? when was the last significant naval battle in coastal waters? for naval ships to participate in land warfare, they will be exposed to land-based aircrafts, which can easily sink them with a missile hit. furthermore, a ship cannot outrun a guided air-surface missile, which is also much much cheaper than a ship.</p>
              <p>to talk about food and supplies, our neighbours are all agricultural giants, able to produce their own food. they also have the natural resources and facilities to replenish supplies such as ammo.</p>
              <p>singapore, however, have no means of sustainable agriculture, and lack resources like copper mines etc, necessary to replenish supplies. while we have to go in and sabotage their supplies, they simply have to sit down and wait for us to run out of supplies, placing us at a severe disadvantage.</p>
              <p>in addition, even if it boils down to urban warfare in singapore, we do not have enough guns and ammo to last the war. we do not reserve 1 gun for every nsmen. multiple people share the guns. we also do not stockpile large amount of ammo during peacetime. so in the event of sudden war, we do not have the resource to equip every soldier in the land.</p>
              <p>thus, we can say that the SAF is just a paper tiger.</p>

              <p>We can have all the good gear and weapons. But if the soldiers are not committed for the cause, then we will lose the war. When the day comes we have to face waves of enemy infantry , its the will to fight that will prevail not just superior technology. Hearing the NS kids these days complain about NS., makes me think about this.</p>
              <p>Or we have loads of nukes, then that will make my a/m statement pointless.</p>
