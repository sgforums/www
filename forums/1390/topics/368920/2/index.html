              When Kuwait ws invaded by Iraq, the soldiers knww they were severely outnumbered by 1:10.  The iraqi were 10 times more &amp; have 8 years of war experience with Iran.
              
              However, the kuwaits fight bravely with whatever they have.  Even their Skyhawks took off from roads as their runways were decapaited by the iraqis.  Most if not all Kuwaits choose to fight till death.  Those surviving forces are ordered to flee to Saudi Arabia to re-group.
              
              Most Kuwaits soldiers fought to death and those survivors were toturted to reveal the wherebouts of westerners in Kuwait.

              <p>Well, I'm sure when war starts, we'll be fighting way before we even we have to fight on home soil.</p>
              <p>And if you fire in anger, it's because you want to stay alive and for the people around you.</p>
              <p>When you take all the SOPs and doctrines and boil them down, this is the basic tenet of why people fight and defend their homes and way of life. A natural instinct for self-preservation. If we ever have to fight in our streets, I'm sure that it will be a last-ditch effort to retain some form of self-respect.</p>
              <p>But, that said, everyone's free to choose to survive as they please. Some will go down fighting, others will do otherwise. It's hard to say in peacetime what one will do in war.</p>
              <p>In fact, I'll bet some peaceniks will fight to the death when the bullets start falling around them, and some "warriors" will try and avoid combat as much as possible. But it is only human to want to kill the mofos that tried to harm you and your way of life..</p>

              <p>Personally, I have absolutely no interest in fighting a war. </p>
              <p>However, i've given it enough thought to realise that should Singapore go to war, the option of 'running away', which most of us take for granted, barely exists.</p>
              <p>let's hypothesize.</p>
              <p>option 1: FLYING OUT</p>
              <p>For the ignorant, airports are key strategic installations that are usually very very high up on the target list for obvious reasons (go figure). Should a war break out, its very likely that changi airport will be one of the first places to be obliterated by enemy airstrikes or shellfire. Even if the airport is miraculously spared complete destruction, foreign airlines would be the first to fly the hell away, evacuating their own citizens, NOT desperate Singaporeans. Local airlines would clearly be grounded because SIA = government, and the government is never going to let AWOL SAF personnel fly off on its krisflyer+inflight entertainment+singapore girl aircraft. Those planes which are not grounded will be flying politicians, diplomats and the ultra rich out of the area. So unless you're a cabinet minister, or you have $100million to throw at the pilot, you wont be going anywhere. Even if, by some amazing stroke of luck, you manage to build an airplane out of cardboard and take off from the top of your HDB block, I'm quite sure your plane will be shot down because there's no way out of Singapore without crossing Malaysian or Indonesian airspace. And everyone knows that should Singapore go to war, it would probably be with those two countries.</p>
              <p>That said, , I dont think anyone will be flying out of the country except the occasional hero who plans on infiltrating paya lebar or tengah airbase, hijacking a fighter jet, and learning to fly it instantly.</p>
              <p>option 2: SAILING OUT</p>
              <p>In wartime, the seas will probably be blockaded  by the navy to prevent any amphibious invasion of the island. Civillian vessels will probably be used by the navy for logistical purposes eg. transport or hospital ships. Ship owners and crews would be the first to sail away if they hear of a war. And I really doubt the ability of an average person to swim to australia, india or thailand. Perhaps some might be innovative, and decide to row a bathtub. But I dont think the bathtub will be getting very far in the indian ocean or south china sea.</p>
              <p>option 3: DRIVING/WALKING OUT</p>
              <p>Most feasible option. Just walk/drive straight into the heart of enemy territory. Self explanatory.</p>

              <p>Let me just say, our doctrine is never about fighting a war in Singapore. You should read up on our strategic concerns and how we manage them. Search, and you can find them in the public domain.</p>

              lol we are all theorising here in the end and war is not to anyone's benefit :) bad for business!
              
              lazerlordz made an interesting pt - if war breaks out, so-called peaceniks might fight and so-called rambos might flee. agree with HyperionDCZ - not so easy to get out of the country once shit hits the fan. but walking or swimming over not easy as can get shot as infiltrator!

              <p>dude, I'm not here to discuss the grand details on how to fight on foreign soil.  I also did not say it would be an easy feat to do so.  And certainly I wasn't talking about our foot soldiers setting up shops on foreign soil and having pinics. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is true that no amount of money or modern technology will change the fact that we are a small island.  However, all that I was alluding to was the possibility of enlarging our fightinig zone beyond the physical limitations of our tiny island.  And superior technology, firepower, equipment and money will allow us to do so!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the HISTORY bits, I was referring to our WORLD HISTORY.  Dude, I know we have not fought a WAR....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope  I am correct about the firepower and technology part.  After all, we spent quite alot of our taxpayers' money on defence.  The point is not about arrogance; it's about combat readiness and patroitism.  No point having all the best toys but the heart is not there.  This is just my personal view.</p>

              <p>that's expected lah, bro....which is why since we cannot escape when war comes, at least we can be traitors if really needed. although some may argue it's country before family and family before self, for me, it is family before self and self before country.</p>
              <p>it's really not worth it to die for PAP or anything.</p>
              <p>those who think it's heroic to die for country must have watched too much wartime hollywood shows liao, where those war guys get honored and treated like gods.</p>
              <p>nowadays, who cares about Lim Bo Seng? in the minds of many singaporeans nowadays, the kind of guys in their mind are Michael Jackson, FireIce (for some SGF guys here), Jay Chou, Fei Lun Hai etc.</p>
              <p>SAF doesn't know what it's doing.</p>
              <p>according to it, it's purpose is to "deter threats from singapore".</p>

              <p>one thing Mr. Lee Kill You never understood, and will never ever understand, is that in life, people cannot be forced to do things against their will.</p>

China's people are very vocal too, the "Tian An Men" incident showed that if they are not happy, they will go to the streets... so with all these consideration, which idiot will risk hitting Singapore and accepting punches back? we'll see...</p>

              <p>Talk about the enemy using 8 million people to kill our 4 million people. And our 4 million people probably one quarter of it are foreigners who will all run back to their country when there is a war. Minus the old and the majority of the spoilt women in singapore who do not know how to fight only know how to everyday in the office bitch and gossip and backstab others, you are probably left with only about 2 million people to defend singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You overestimated the SAF and underestimated the enemy. The enemy probably need only 18 000 men to kill our 2 million people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Talking about modern technology, I am sure other countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia also have it. They maybe poor but every country knows that no matter how poor they are they will still need to spend lots of money on defence. Even korea is also not a rich country but that did not stop them from building and firing missiles</p>

              <p>i for one believe that if singapore has to rely on its infantry to defend we're already doomed because that would mean that the enemies is already on our soil only applicable to defense.</p>
              <p>is our ihawks that backdated especially comparing our saf equipments with our nearest threats? i dont think so. in any case, air artillery is a last resort, the first line of air defence is our fighter jets and second the navy destroyers.</p>
