Once I talk about my child, I just cannot accept it."<br><br>She said her son's biggest wish was to study Chemistry and he'd been admitted to NUS next year.<br><br>Mrs Hu said his death was an enormous blow to his brothers, as they shared a close relationship.<br><br>She said: "Emotions are heavy. They still cannot accept his death. He is such a good big brother, good in studies and good in sports, good in many areas. They respected their brother."<br><br>A neighbour said MINDEF officers paid several visits to the family after Enhuai's death.<br><br>Having seen Enhuai since he was a toddler, the neighbour of 19 years is still shocked and saddened by his death.<br><br>Enhuai studied at Hwa Chong Junior College and was a member of the college basketball team.<br><br>While his juniors may not really know him, those whom Channel NewsAsia spoke to expressed regret at Enhuai's passing at such a young age.<br><br>"I was a bit upset because I didn't know people die so easily from NS. I wonder what kind of treatment they are getting from there," said a Hwa Chong JC student.<br><br>"They should really investigate thoroughly about this issue and give the people a proper report......Otherwise, for those NS people who are doing their bit for the country, all this sort of accident is unfair," said another student.<br><br>"In order to prevent the same thing from happening again, safety precautions should be put in place," said a third student.<br><br>"I'm a bit worried for my peers who are going army next year," added a fourth.<br><br>Even for the college, it has not been easy to learn of Enhuai's death.<br><br>The college declined to speak to Channel NewsAsia as it didn't want to upset the family further.<br><br>But Enhuai is fondly remembered, especially by his Civics and General Paper tutor who recalled his drive to excel in his GP and his zest on the baseketball court.<br><br>Others who know Enhuai remember him as a lively person who was always polite to his teachers and who was very determined in his pursuit of excellence.<br><br>Many say Enhuai was a good student and a good man. - CNA<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/52914/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/52914/1/.html</a></div>
