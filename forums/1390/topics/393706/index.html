              <p>yes....its a info gathering job.,...something like what lionnoisy has been doing a long time ago.</p>
              <p>normally they will allocate each guy  to a country or so from sweden to malaysia and ask them find info from secret weapons ,R&amp;D,weapons testing,paranormal sightings,crashed ufo technology etc........and then place it in a neat and orderly manner with aid of diagrams from various countries in their languages.</p>
              <p>the main theme is that the product must be economically viable and practical.</p>
              <p>something like a reporter who doesnt do presentations to the public.</p>
              <p>mulder and scully has a job something like that!</p>

              <p>Isn't it the same as with all other jobs? Like numerous specialised jobs don't doctors and soldiers and nurses and engineers do the same specialised job and stay within the same field for life? All the dumb talk made by mostly stupid peasants (ahem) with low IQ about scholarships and commitments, don't almost 100% of people worldwide, not just in Singapore, decide on their careers at 19 yrs old as well, when they apply to undergraduate school in law and medicine and dentistry and stuff? And don't we see these people staying in the same job for life or until they're god damn old? Where do you think these old doctors with grey hair and paunches we see come from? Anyone who could continue to be fooled by the internet rhetoric and not have this occur to him, clearly has never been to school.</p>
              <p>As for TS, job "specialty" aside, don't bother with being DXO unless you are looking for a transition job to tide some time before you embark on your real career.</p>
              <p>All male DXOs, especially the farmer graduate (NUS) one and farmer graduates who seek some crummy lame 1-yr overseas master's to cover their farmer degrees, are the bottom-feeders in Gombak, the lowest of the lowest in the pecking order and considered 4th or 5th class citizens. Behind the SAFOS who are packed into Mindef HQ for their staff tours, then behind the DMS scholars (a civilian scholarship by Mindef) and then behind the female DXOs. In other words, the rock bottom of the bottom.</p>
              <p>DXOs exist to carry the balls of and facilitate the careers of uniformed officers. They are created specially as interim plugs for a larger picture that does not belong to them. This is a universal fact like the earth is round and not flat. Nothing to argue about even though it doesn't sound politically correct. But all truths do not.</p>
              <p>If however you are looking at this as a temporary thing to earn you money while you do your degree, or whatever, i'd say it's a good bet. Why? The hours are fixed more or less at your level, you get to leave office early as a junior clerical staff so you can focus on your studies, you get good networking opportunities with people you will never get to meet in the private sector, and the pay is more than decent for whatever that you are able to offer at this point.</p>
