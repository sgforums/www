              <p>Those who are liable to serve national service but refuse are
              charged under the Enlistment Act. If convicted, they face three
              years' imprisonment and a fine of S$10,000.</p>
              <p>Controversy arose when the penalties were increased in January
              2006 after <a title="Melvyn Tan" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvyn_Tan">Melvyn
              Tan</a>, who was born in Singapore, received a fine for defaulting
              on his National Service obligations. Tan left for <a title="London" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London">London</a> to study music during his enlistment age and
              later acquired British nationality. In <a title="Parliament of Singapore" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore">parliament</a>, Defence Minister <a title="Teo Chee Hean" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teo_Chee_Hean">Teo Chee Hean</a> provided some illustration of the
              punishments defaulters would face:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the default period exceeds two years but the defaulter is
              young enough to serve his full-time and operationally ready NS
              duties in full, MINDEF will press for a short jail sentence.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot serve his
              full-time NS in a combat vocation or fulfil his operationally ready
              NS obligations in full, a longer jail sentence to reflect the
              period of NS he has evaded may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot be called
              up for NS at all, a jail sentence up to the maximum of three years
              may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Each year, a small number of people are convicted for their
              failure to enlist or refusal to be conscripted. Most of them were
              <a title="Jehovah's Witnesses" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, who are usually
              court-martialled and sentenced to three years' imprisonment, but
              they are usually held in a low-security detention facility and
              separated from other conscription offenders. The government does
              not consider <a title="Conscientious objector" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector">conscientious objection</a> to be a legal
              reason for refusal to serve NS.</p>

              <p>3 months is as good as desertion. DB awaits him.</p>
              <p>If you're in touch with him, ask him to give himself up. As others have pointed out, he might get a more lenient sentence as a result.</p>
              <p>If he refuses, calling the police and ratting him out may be the only way to go. Before you say that I'm a sabo king or something, let me just point out that the longer he goes missing without getting caught, the worse his punishment will be when he <strong>does</strong> get caught.</p>

              More than 3 months, considered dessertion. Jail maybe but he can be able to get out if he keng enough to be considered unfit for army. Then the judicial court might give him a lil DB time but discharge him from ns right after.
              
              Eitherway, I've seen desserters in the unit that I am currently wasting my time in. 2 years on the 'desserters' row in the daily attendance but no one does anything, no one goes out to catch them. At most they visit the desserter's house 1 or 2 times at the start of the AWOL period but after that they tell me that "Just wait for them to turn themselves in lor."
              
              I was like "Wtf, seriously? You're not going to do anything?" and ever since then we've already forgotten it. My appointment IS to help manage these kind of cases but truthfully, I find people who return after such lonv times of AWOL retarded. If they never come back, then we wouldn't have gone out to find them. Then no need to do so much paperwork, then the tard no need to go db. 
              
              Geez ..awolers ah, seriously paranoid
