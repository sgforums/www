            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, although one source may play it up and say that a medic accused the poor deceased of theft, the whole thing reeks of mischief. It could be just a couple of fellas just fooling around with each other. Don't tell me during army days, you never play around with each other and mock chase and mock fight each other. It could really be a result of an accident or misadventure.<br><br>At the end of the day, I still think the fault lies with the poorly deceased himself. He didn't have to run, he didn't have to jump.</div>
