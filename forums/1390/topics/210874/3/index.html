Supposingly he stole the handphone, the medic should not have taken the law in his own hands.  There are channels &amp; avenues that he can escalate the issue.  Chasing the guy resulting in this tragedy is unwanted.<br><br>I doubt Mindef or SAF will release the truth of the issue but I suppose if the medic is guilty, he will be court marshalled ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The info on how the PTE died by 1 of the fellow forumates cant be totally true, well i for 1 dun really believe cos dun tell me he just made an account here just to tell how the PTE died? Not that i dun trust new members on infos, but just look at how many clones alrdy.........<br><br>anyway even if the case is true, if pte nvr steal, y run? scared kena wack? its in a camp, kena wack can report OC or S1 or even the RSM. BTW in CDO camp, the officers will really condemn u if u are suspected of theft case even if u did not commit the crime.<br><br>But if lets say the pte really did take the HP but keep denying, then he is not a man i would say. Not a man to accept the punishment. TMD theft case for a REGULAR leh. kena caught at most fine + lose contract nia. its not like going to be put in DB or watever. the detainees in DB consist of 99% NSF and only 1% regular lor. u can see how lenient SAF is to their regulars.<br><br>In both situation, pte did a very wrong and stupid thing which no1 can actually do anything about it. he knows he will die by jumping yet he still chooses to do so. kinda silly i would say. Sorry for not being respectful to the dead, but this kind of death doesnt deserves to be respected in any point of views.</div>
