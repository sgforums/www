              Hmm... seems like you're in 41 SAR? Glory coy?
              
              Don't worry bah. Stay back sat then stay back sat loh. RT, the most they can ask u to stay is only til around lunch. You'd rather kanna SOL (which means you get to stay back for the whole weekend instead of just Saturday morning) or touch wood... extend your ORD date because of DB?
              
              P.S. If you really in Glory coy, then really really good luck... My bro told me some of them kanna 9 x weekend confinement for having sweets in their bunks... lol...

              <p>Hm. After reading your situation and skipping what others have said(apologies if I mentioned repeated advices), I suggest if you are going for any treatment for your injuries like physio or whatsoever, report for a service injury first. Let SAF pay. The fact that arrangements were made for you to go for range was a wrong step...Find your PC and ask him about this service injury thing. He should know what to do.</p>
              <p>Basically service injury is for cases like accidents that happen to servicemen and due to him being in service. So I think it's only right that SAF is responsible. Talk to your PC, think he should know what it is.</p>
