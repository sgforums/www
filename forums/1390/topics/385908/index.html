              <p>Recently kerna posted to a combat unit and on tuesday, I found out from briefing that we will have range.</p>
              <p>The thing is, my left elbow was fractured a few years back and ever since, it hurts when I carry heavy weight and I injured my hip during training at BMT. I mentioned my condition to my PC during BMT  and was sent for medical review but I was always asked to postpone the specialist appointments and physio by my BMT PC due to major events,meanwhile on status given by the MO. I was excused firearms, live grenade, and did not take part in SoC at all. Currently waiting for specialist appt again,which is next year.</p>
              <p>One fine day in BMT, I was asked to prepared for re - range with other company as I was excused for the first time. My firearm status 2 weeks was over and so bobian, got to go for it..tried to talk to the officer but my sergeant say he not in camp.</p>
              <p>At the range site,I told 1 officer about my problem and my concerns about me misfiring, crossfire when I have trouble keeping the gun steady, but he just told me not to worry because his company no punishment for those offences.</p>
              <p>when going to the prone position, my left arm buay tahan, it just gave way when I shoot, the gun jumped out of my hand, the rifle scope of the SAR21 hit my forehead and I bled lo,till now still got scar.</p>
              <p>From then on,Im afraid of shooting liverounds.Damn fuckup right,get injured for this, I think this is a safety breach?</p>
              <p>Anyway who must I talk to in my unit about this? The unit live range, I heard from my tekong sergeants that its serious business,misfire, crossfire  will get charge! I don't wana kerna charge for something I cannot do but I'm forced to do.</p>

              <p><br>Dude, approachable or not isn't an issue leh. This is serious business, you are not there to have a friendly chat. Treat it professionally and pluck up courage to talk to him. Just go to his office, greet him and say "Sergeant Major, may I have a few minutes to talk to you about an issue". I am sure he will oblige. If something happens to you, its your superiors' neck and career at risk.</p>
              <p>Don't wait for an interview to highlight this problem, that will take ages. Just go to the office and open the damn door!</p>

              <p>1. Report sick, explain the whole thing to the MO, see what he says.</p>
              <p>2. Just approach your CSM.</p>
              <p>Let me put this bluntly: which is the worse of two evils - approaching an unfriendly CSM, or accidentally shooting your buddy at the rifle range because you were too scared to tell your CSM about your medical problem?</p>

              <p>the officer in charge at range must be nuts.</p>
              <p>by right any officer after tellin u that would have been court marshalled.its not your fault.....u should be in civil defence first of all as your arm was injured.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>any sgt would have argued witrh officer at range due to safety implications.u should just be helping out at most with the ammo boxes and no shooting and holding a gun as u are already injured in past.</p>
              <p>best tell any sgt ,corporal and pc......in yer platoon before range.if yer elbow was fractured before,,,,then if it hurts till today that means your nerves are already damaged.no x-ray can detect this but its well known in medical fields after a fractured arm with destroyed nerves that somehow didnt heal till this day.</p>
              <p>as long as you have hospital records on your past medical condition and u tell everyone yer arm hurts etc when liftin heavy stuff then u are safe.just get mo to sign fer yer condition...less explaination fer sgt ,pc etc.but if u cant make mo sign mc for reasons unknown then just tell pc yer problem and he will excuse u on spot.</p>

              <p>If you do not see the MO and get a new status to excuse yourself, speaking to most people will not help as only the MO can give you the proper excuse.</p>
              <p>If out of fear you do not report your condition and get forced to attend range, you cannot blame anyone but yourself if anything happens since you are at fault for hiding and not reporting your condition.</p>
              <p>If the MO gives you any status, few CSMs or officers will dare overwrite that but without any status from the MO, there is not much reason for any CSM or officers to believe in your story.</p>

              <p>hai,</p>
              <p>i very stress after posting to this unit.,sometimes i can't take it, tell myself to take 5mins and cry in the toilet. I was damn moody when RSM annouce that those who got gold for ippt will have lots of bookouts..IPPT I can't do at all, after running my hips will hurt like machiam kerna grinding and chinup can't break zero. SoC never attempt b4 in BMT but i'll have to do it in this unit.</p>
              <p>I wanted to report sick and tell MO everything on Tuesday,but after one guy vomitted after the 2.4km run,our SM ask him want to report sick anot? if want, saturday come back spent with COS. I overheard it den decide to forget it.</p>

              <p><br>SMLJ is your SM doing? I can start to imagine if a guy suddenly collaspe mid-way in a run, then the SM may just go over, kick the body a few times then ask 'eh, want me to call ambulance or not? damn troublesome leh you'.</p>
              <p>And I hate really hate hate the fact that sometimes, MO treat ppl like they are chao-kenging like that. Ya true, there are a lot of real chao-kengsters out there sabotaging, but at least the MO should make attempts to varify right?</p>
