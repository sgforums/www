              <p>Yes CPC is the board but if the unit said that you are a clerk now and they are a shortage of clerk, so unless CPC give them a new clerk or else they cannot release you. The only way CPC can over write the unit is unless u get revocated.</p>

              <p>Oh okay. Yes I am a clerk now, so I'll just see how things go ah. Thanks. But just to clarify, if I am going to re-vocate, does that mean that CPC have more authority over the manpower branch?</p>

              <p>Your request for posting out is not confirmed like what the chief clerk said and it is very likely that CPC will ask him/her if there is any more clerk requirement within the camp.If there is a position open,they will most likely deploy you in that position within the same camp unless you provided them with a VERY COMPELLING and valid reason to have you posted out.</p>

              <p>My friend downgraded to PES E from an infantry company but he ended up as a clerk at the HQ even though there isn't anymore clerk positions and they were already over estab.Yes,he did request to be posted out....to CMPB infact<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>Think of it this way.There are probably too many people in other camps who have downgraded to clerk.Other units have downgraded clerks,your unit has downgraded clerks too.Why go through all the paper work just to shift clerks when there is already enough?</p>

              <p>Sorry, I meant that I am doing a clerk's job now. I'm just waiting to get posted out, so I am helping my unit as a clerk in the meantime. Oh okay after hearing the story about your friend, I'm not so sure myself. I don't really know what's going to happen to me so I think the best thing is just to wait for an answer. Guess it's alright anyway, I'm quite relaxed during working hours too. But I just feel it's better if I know at least where I am going to get posted to, so that I will not keep thinking about it. Later get posted out to a camp even further from my house.</p>
