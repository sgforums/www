              <p>One thing memorable about my time at Lancer was I spent barely $10(only 2 canteen breaks) during my 3 weeks there. What a way to save $$$!</p>
              <p>I was a HQ spec at that time and was quite free...but the weather was so damm hot, the food at the canteen was so "heaty"(roti prata,briyani and other fried stuff) I didnt wanna fall sick there, so didnt go canteen that often.</p>

              <p>When I was at Wallaby, the cookhouse conditions looked quite jialat and unhygenic.</p>
              <p>But the food was surprisingly good. Even a normal meal of rice, veggies and meat tasted much better than the equivalent back at the camp cookhouse.</p>

              <p>When I was at Jalan Aman Camp in BSB (Lancer) during my active days (around middle of '03), they used an active cook at the cookhouse, and the food was terrible. It seemed like everything was deep fried in recycled oil. Once the CO bought stingray for the unit, expecting it to be BBQ'd and served with sambal, but that too was deep fried (there is nothing worse than deep fried, squishy stingray). Another time the cook had forgotten about some mutton in the oven and it caused a lot of smoke around the cookhouse. We went vegetarian that day :o). Needless to say, most of everyone preferred the canteen and ate at the tiny shopping mall outside the camp or at the night market every chance we get to book out.</p>
              <p>Honestly speaking, SFI cookhouses are much much better than if they had still used active cooks like in the old days. I've had the privilege of eating at Tekong, Maju Camp, Nee Soon Camp and Seletar Camp, and I still think the best cookhouse was the Foodfare at Tekong.</p>

              <p>When I was at Wallaby, the cookhouse conditions looked quite

              <p>But the food was surprisingly good. Even a normal meal of rice,
              veggies and meat tasted much better than the equivalent back at the

              <p>Yes agree to that! And there's also like unlimited servings...one of my friend collected wedges for 3 times...</p>
              <p>But also heard on one of the days they threw away 1 thrash bag of rice. so wasteful.</p>
