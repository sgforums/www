            <div class='col-md body'>Does anyone have any comments on the below mentioned? Is it beneficial?<br>________________<br>25 April 2003<br>REVISED NATIONAL SERVICE TRAINING SYSTEM (WITH EFFECT FROM APR 03)<br><br>Revised Training Cycle<br><br>With effect from April 2003, a revised National Service (NS) training system has been introduced for Operationally Ready National Servicemen (NSmen).<br><br>Under the previous NS training system, NSmen had to perform 13 years of NS training, of which, at least nine must be high-key in-camp training (ICT).  With the revised NS training system, the majority of NSmen will only need to serve at least seven high-key ICTs.  A two-day Basic Individual Training (BIT) programme that focuses on physical fitness, marksmanship and refresher training has also been introduced in the last three years of their 13 years of NS training.  This ensures that NSmen maintain their currency in basic soldiering skills.  Mobilisation exercises will also be conducted during the BIT phase to maintain operational readiness.<br><br>To minimise inconvenience to NSmen pursuing full-time local university studies, specific periods during the university vacation have been set aside for NS training.  No academic programmes are conducted during these periods.  This arrangement enables NSmen to better manage their academic studies and NS duties.<br>Training Improvements<br><br>Performance-oriented training has been introduced as part of the revised NS training system.  Through a modular approach, training is customised to focus on the specific training needs of each NS unit instead of adhering to a standard training syllabus.  This achieves more effective and purposeful utilisation of training time.<br><br>The revised NS training system also incorporates an incentive-based component to motivate NSmen to put in their best.  Those who achieve good results at the individual or unit level need not undergo additional training.  For example, NS units that perform well in major evaluation exercises could have a subsequent high-key training replaced by low-key training.<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>Over the years, NS training has progressively become more effective and efficient with improvements in technology and administrative efficiency.  The revised NS training system capitalises on these improvements to effect a reduction in the number of high-key ICTs and the introduction of BIT, without compromising the operational readiness of the Singapore Armed Forces.<br><br>Our citizen soldiers have to shoulder the multiple demands of family, work and duty to country.  We recognise that this requires significant commitment and sacrifice. The Ministry of Defence continually reviews the NS training system to optimise training time and ensure a meaningful NS experience.  The revised NS training system is the latest of a series of improvements to NS management and administration, following the increase in NS allowance in July 2002 and the revised Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) system in April 2003.<br><br>Back to news release<br><br>[/quote]</div>
