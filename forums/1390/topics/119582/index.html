My friends who served in combat units before told me all about stand-bys. Everything in their haversack must be in peak condition and tightly compacted into ziplocs. In actual war time, it would be very impractical. And it seems they are expecting KL troops to invade from Gelang Patah. But I'm sure those people with designs on PSA know better.</div>
