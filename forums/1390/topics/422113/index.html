              <p>Uhm, hi everyone~</p>
              <p>Well... I think I posted in one other thread but it seems rather inconsistent in reply-regularity. All I want to do is ask about the vocation C9L3. I did some scouting around and searching, but I either get other forum's replies dating back to 2004, or irrelevant PES statuses like C9L9 or E1.</p>
              <p>So... yeah. I am going in REEEEAAAL soon, and I am a little confused about what I will be kinda, seeing. Reading up on the internet didn't help mainly because their website, ns.sg, seems to be... 'general'. Talking about grenades and all, which I don't really think my vocation will end up doing.</p>
              <p>Speaking with people I know in real life is... not working out, because my uncles are from the eras where you are forced to eat chalk or something... </p>
              <p>So... if anyone would be kind enough, could they help me with these few questions I have? I'd really appreciate it x3</p>
              <p>1. If you're PES C9L3, maybe tell me a little about your life there?</p>
              <p>2. What kind of people end up in PES C9L3? I mean... from what I understand, people there seem to have some sort of medical condition...</p>
              <p>3. Do people in PES C9L3 do Routemarches or camping out? I read the web description before, but it was vague. Something about 'stationed at Base'.</p>
              <p>4. General; is it... alright to bring books to read? Well, specifically is there even time/energy for it?</p>
              <p>5. Are we issued Rifles? I hope so, I'd love to use one. x3</p>
              <p>--</p>
              <p>So yeah... thank you all so much in advance! Sorry for my misuse of language if any, it is rather late out. &gt;&lt;</p>

              <p>PES C9L3 - mostly got non-combat vocations like service medic, signalier, storeman and clerk.</p>
              <p>If be a storeman, that will go outfield to set up tentage, bring food rations for others, help out around officers, do arms duty, in charge of all the firearms in the store, then yearly go for rifle range to shoot to pass, no ippt, no soc.</p>
              <p>If be a signalier, that will go outfield to set up tentage, set up radio equipment onto rovers, help out around officers, yearly go for rifle range to shoot to pass, no ippt, no soc.</p>
              <p>If be a service medic, that will in medical centre care people, wait for them to come to you if they see doctor, help out minor injuries, yearly go for rifle range to shoot to pass, no ippt, no soc.</p>
              <p>Got camping out, can bring books to read when you have free time in your bunk but not when during field excercises or when officers expect you to be on alert for something, yes, you sure will be issued with a rifle.</p>
              <p>Basically just know your way around officers and specs when you finish your BMT and pass out from whatever courses they give you, as you will be more or less a helper in the command area, depends on where you go, mostly sure hang around main offices.</p>
              <p>Polish up on your EQ and stay out of trouble as officers can be strange creatures sometimes, not happy, they will make you sign extras (guard duties or other duties during weekends), but basically if you can work with them then no problem, just do what they say.</p>

              <p>You will be going through modified and relaxed form of BMT so do not worry.</p>
              <p>Yes, the people there have many excuses like excuse PT,upper limbs and lower limbs etc.</p>
              <p>You do 10 KM route march. The PES A and B has 24 KM route march.</p>
              <p>L9 can go back base to sleep not so sure can L3 people go back.</p>
              <p>Yes, you can bring books. Normally you stay in bunk at 8 pm. My bunk people read religious books like Koran and bible.</p>
              <p>Unless excused firearms, normally you have to handle them.</p>

              <p>Thank you, Askingyouto, Cute Dolphin.</p>
              <p>This information is definitely helpful, although it does seem rather scary. 10KM route march, huh?</p>
              <p>And also... what happened to the title? I know about the FAQs above and I read it before, but it was not focused on any PES level and did not go into details that Cute Dolphin has given. I am asking for details, not a general inquiry...</p>
              <p>Anyway... the only way to truly find out is to get in there, huh? x3</p>

              <p>One good tip is go extract wisdom tooth when you are in unit after your BMT.</p>
              <p>Get MC and Mindef pay. Please do not miss this chance.</p>

              <p>As for your BMT, It's modified, please do not worry.</p>
              <p>It's not stressful. I am an PES C enlistee, I gone through it myself.</p>
              <p>One of the most memorable thing is that I seen many recruits with excuses.</p>
              <p>Excuse uniform,firearms,upper limbs, loud noise,grenade,field camp,grass ... ...</p>

              <p>Swimming is simple, 50 M breastroke. Non-swimmer also nevermind. They will teach.</p>
              <p>Not compulsory to pass though.</p>
              <p>Yes some people when their skin touches grass, It will start an allergic reaction.</p>
              <p>I think many of my relatives also extract wisdom tooth during NS.</p>

              <p>There's swimming in PES C? Is it compulsory?</p>
              <p>I have problem with my reflexes. I always breath in water whenever in the pool. I had compulsory swimming class when I was sec 1 but didn't complete it because I always breath in the water sub-consciously. When everyone jump into the pool, I was the only person who breath in the water. During breathing exercise, I always breath in the water no matter how much I tried to stop breathing. I have phobia of being underwater because of the past. Can I be excused from swimming lessons?</p>

              <p><br>Okay.</p>
              <p>Not really fear of water, fear of swimming/being under water. After declare it to specialist, will he/she find ways to make me overcome my fears or let it be? I only fear if the specialist give me courses for me to overcome my fears of being underwater. The fear does not disrupt my normal life so it's okay if I don't overcome it. Same goes for fear of height and insects. I heard others said need to declare our fears too so I'm thinking about it.</p>

              <p><br>CMPB checkup must declare everything <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">truthfully</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>Yes fear of heights,insects and swimming must be declared.</p>
              <p>Normally for specific phobias like water,heights and insects, psychiatrist won't ask you to overcome.</p>
              <p>Unless It's social phobia or like fear of opposite sex that will impact your life.</p>
              <p>For example, my friend have stage fight. He shivers on stage that kind.</p>
              <p>Some people fear doing things in front of people, If you do not declare before enlistment, if when handling firearms infront of people, you have fear, It's troublesome.</p>
              <p>Psychiatrist will help you to slowly overcome those issues that affect your lives.</p>
              <p>If necessary they will write a memo to CMPB/Army psychiatrist.</p>
              <p>Some people are excused from NS like shizioprenic/autism and severe psyhosis.</p>
              <p>Their specialist will write a letter to CMPB MO.</p>
              <p>For example maybe if you have social phobia, you still can serve NS but with excused firearms and stay-in in camps.</p>
