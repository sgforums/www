              <p>in my time, i was posted to 42 SAR at selarang barrack, changi. This was the place used by the japanese to house the Local, English and Australian POW dugring WWII. So there are plenty of ghost stories in the camp. Anyway I haven't met one but here's a pretty famous one there.</p>
              <p>There was an ammo dump in the centre of the camp that was surrounded by fence. During the earlier batch, 2 soldier were detailed to guard the ammo dump at night. One was to stay guarding the main gate and the other was to patrol the perimeter of the fence. After his hour patrol was up, they were to change place. The story goes that while one was patrolling, the sentry guard saw an army captain walking towards the ammo dumb. The sentry shouted the guard procedure halt that army captain. Then he requested the captain to show proof for entering the dumb. The "captain" took his head off and handed it to the sentry. When the sentry saw that, he fainted immediately. When the patrol guard came back, he saw his mate on the ground. He immediately informed his guard commander thru the tele-jay</p>
              <p>he story spread around the camp. During my time, there were 2 patrollers and no more sentry</p>
