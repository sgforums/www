              <p>Not sure what " G" was my time... But I ROD'd in 1985. Wore Temasek Green for my first 18 months of NS ---  even had the old no. 3 uniform, the one with badges and pins! Went abroad to study and came back to do ICT in the 2.5G army ( I'm guessing !).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Weapons.... seen the 60 mm mortar at the time it was phasing out. 84mm recoiless, 106mm RR, M-16 / AR-15 with bipod .... we had to strap this to our SBO and this caused a lot of cuts because some of its edges were sharp. Useful item though... because it means that when you prone during a laager, you had your weapon ready and also kept it off the muddy ground.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tekanning... pretty standard thru' my "decades" of service. Except that when I joined BMT in 1982, some of the tekanning was bordering on torture and bullying. Escape and evasion training had no limits and the instructors could pretty much dream of stuff to do to you. This was toned down towards 1984 and after , when a number of high profile scholars became Colonels and they started to review the training programme. Emphasis was on training realism and not on discipline.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The other difference I saw as an "old" soldier was that some parts of Singapore were still not developed. For example the area around Orchid Country Club was a great area for training. Many abandoned villages and belukar areas, meant great map reading and section patrolling areas. You get a good feel of what would be like across the border ( if you know what I mean !). The area around Pasir Laba was also like this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When I did my ICT in the 1990s, a lot of these areas were developed/ developing. Golf courses, HDB estates etc etc. I had the sense that our training grounds were getting smaller. Some areas, there were no point to use NVGs, because there will be flare in the goggles caused by the stray lighting from the housing estates. You were blinded. The other thing I noticed that went missing in the 1990s were the " Civvy Quartermaster ". These were roadside hawkers who drove a small van to sell sweets and cold drinks in the training areas. They performed a great service and  I suspect they "stole" the training programmes from the camps to see which group was training where and at what time... because they always seem to turn -up at the right time and place !</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I wonder how it is now in Singapore.....   my last in-camp was 1995 but I demobbed in the 2000s, as I am now working overseas. I am sure the training areas are mostly gone. Don't get much realistic environment in Singapore now.</p>

              <p>in my time, i was posted to 42 SAR at selarang barrack, changi. This was the place used by the japanese to house the Local, English and Australian POW dugring WWII. So there are plenty of ghost stories in the camp. Anyway I haven't met one but here's a pretty famous one there.</p>
              <p>There was an ammo dump in the centre of the camp that was surrounded by fence. During the earlier batch, 2 soldier were detailed to guard the ammo dump at night. One was to stay guarding the main gate and the other was to patrol the perimeter of the fence. After his hour patrol was up, they were to change place. The story goes that while one was patrolling, the sentry guard saw an army captain walking towards the ammo dumb. The sentry shouted the guard procedure halt that army captain. Then he requested the captain to show proof for entering the dumb. The "captain" took his head off and handed it to the sentry. When the sentry saw that, he fainted immediately. When the patrol guard came back, he saw his mate on the ground. He immediately informed his guard commander thru the tele-jay</p>
              <p>he story spread around the camp. During my time, there were 2 patrollers and no more sentry</p>
