              <p>Full-time National Service (NS) is an essential part of our 
              nationhood and a rite of passage for every Singaporean and Permanent 
              Resident (PR) male. While some may find it demanding, it is absolutely 
              critical for maintaining our sovereignty. To understand why, it may be 
              worth spending some time to read through the following information and 
              acquaint yourself with the history and facts of NS.</p>
              <h1><strong>What NS is</strong></h1>
              <p>NS is a mandatory conscription and duty that every male citizen and 
              PR must undertake upon attaining the age of 18. NS can be served in the <a href="https://www.cmpb.gov.sg/life-in-ns/saf/">Singapore Armed Forces (SAF)</a>, <a href="https://www.cmpb.gov.sg/life-in-ns/scdf/">Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF)</a> or <a href="https://www.cmpb.gov.sg/life-in-ns/spf/">Singapore Police Force</a>.</p>
              <p>NS has been the cornerstone of Singapore’s defence and security since
               independence. Our national servicemen form the backbone of these three 
              uniformed Services that keep Singapore safe and secure.</p>
              <p>To date, more than 900,000 male Singaporeans have served NS and 
              journeyed through this rite of passage. For many, this defining 
              experience bonds servicemen from different backgrounds and across 
              generations.</p>
              <h1><strong>NS duration</strong></h1>
              <p>You will be in the active service as a full-time National Serviceman (NSF) for two years.</p>
              <p>After your full-time NS, you will become an Operationally Ready 
              National Serviceman (NSman). Your NSman obligation will end at the age 
              of 50 if you are an Officer or have special skills. Otherwise, you will 
              serve until the age of 40.</p>
              <h1><strong>Why you need to serve NS</strong></h1>
              <p>The need for NS became clear when Singapore gained independence in 
              1965. It would not have been possible to raise a regular force of a 
              sufficient size to protect this island state given our small population.
               For over 50 years, NS has evolved into a national institution that is 
              well accepted and a part of our way of life.</p>
              <p>Our servicemen’s roles have also expanded. Beyond protecting 
              Singapore from armed conflicts, our servicemen are now involved in 
              countering terrorism, dealing with the aftermath of natural disasters 
              and tackling health epidemics. In 1975, the first intake of Police 
              full-time National Servicemen was enlisted and deployed for peacetime 
              and emergency functions. The SCDF enlisted its first intake of NSFs in 
              1981 to provide emergency services to the nation during peacetime and 
              crises. Today, the changing roles of our servicemen reflect the need for
               NS to evolve and keep pace with the changes in our society as well as 
              our threat environment.</p>
              <p>NS, as the bedrock of our fighting force and national security, 
              remains critical for Singapore’s continued survival and success. A 
              strong defence underpins the peace and prosperity we enjoy by 
              safeguarding Singapore’s independence and sovereignty.</p>
