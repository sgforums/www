At the stations, the recruits will take turns to be the leader and his job is to organise his men to complete the task at hand. The recruits are assessed and interviewed by a reservist lieutenant and marks are given.<br><br>I think its important to show not only that you can be a good leader but also that you can be a good follower as well. Anyway the above info is based on my personal experience 3+yrs ago, not sure if things have changed leh..</div>

It is a test that asseses your ability to lead and/or carry out tasks under stress or difficult situations. U will be joint up with other platoon mates to carry out 6 missions a day.<br><br>Each detail is around 12 pple from 4 platoons. You will be assigned a role in your detail. Roles include: Medic, LAW (Light Anti-tank Weapon a.k.a 2nd wife), Claymore (remote detonating explosive), Mine, Demolition, Navigator and Signals. Throughout the SIT test, one of your coy's instructors will follow your detail to motivate u'all, ensure order, safety and act as a second accessor.<br><br>On the first day of SIT test, u will learn rope skills (Very impt!! needed in all missions!), and your assigned specialisation e.g. for LAW u will be trained to handle the weapon. The second day, u will set off with yr detail for your missions. After the 1st day ends, there is an interview with the accessor, who is a reservist 1st Lt officer from ABSD. On the end of second day there is a peer evaluation that lets u grade your detail mates.<br><br></div>
