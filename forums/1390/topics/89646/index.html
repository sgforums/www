For one, they are using one of the biggest damn needles around, and in school of military medcine, they would have done only 10, and probably missed about half of those. They just dont get the practice, unlike the MO, who would have done a few hundred (dare i say a thousand?... probably) before he set that plug on you.</div>

My sispec buddy(nurse trained) happened to be at the medical centre....imagine 3 or 4 ppl brought in full of blood and one arm gone and open wound everywhere....how many medic can handle the sight of that??......all the medic there was shock and blur like sotong..ended up my buddy was one of the few still thinking with their brain and were handle to help out....and mind u... my buddy was considered a chao keng and reporting sick after SOC there ok.....<br><br>i know we cant blame too much on them as we are not a war zone and they dun have much real experience... but SAF should consider and try to post NSF to unit that is relevant to their course previously studied.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

In the same manner, I don't think anyone can vouch for individual battlefield courage until the sh^t hits the fan.<br><br>I've personally witnessed both extremes of such crisis management during my NSF days at 21SA. The 1st was a M113 explosion in the middle of the night; my battery medic completely froze &amp; it was left to my BC who improvisedly went into the vehicle to save the wounded. The 2nd occurred when my fellow DI took sharpnel in the stomach (off a wayward genade throw by a mono-intake recruit), but the assigned range medic was cool as heck that day.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I must say my experience of combat medics have been mixed. My camp had one who fainted and was himself casualtied as he hit his head on the floor,  when a recruit accidentally shot 2 instructors with one M-16 round (this story the next time). The instructors were not dead but were shot in the leg and hand respectively. Minor injuries to a trained nurse in a hospital A&amp;E ward.<br><br>The funny thing  tho' is that those whose civilian life or education background involved something to do with their hands (e.g. car mechanic, cook) are actually very good medics in the field. Somehow they can think straight and work fast and accurate with their hands !   And can work under stress.<br><br>One of my friends, who was a infantry section cmdr, got converted for reservist, to become a medic sergeant/ senior specialist, and was transfered to  a medical battalion (not exactly combat medic in the platoon). He told me that they are definitely nervous ... human nature. They spend some time as part of medic training in the A&amp;E ward of hospitals to get exposure to injuries and death. But still they are nervous when treating a real casualty. THis is normal. There are "kabra-kings" everywhere, even in the combat vocations. Who can say that they will not be frightened under fire???</div>
