            <div class='col-md body'>There seem to be some people who think it's good to be abused? LOL.<br>Their logic seem to be you should be treat and abused to the worst shit mentally and physically. To me, i don't agree with that. Personally i find anyone advocating that kind of approach to training are showing a lack of self esteem and self worth . Do you think people who go through the nazi conceration camp are "stronger" now? Not really, more like scarred for life.<br><br>Instead as long as the soldier is fit, and know the technical side of his job, and has basic discipline and teamwork, it is enough.<br><br>For vulgar words, it's just reflect on yourself when you cannot communicate without using one. Would a Singapore commission officer dare to use foul word if a minister was inspecting or when the parents are around? Then it's kind of pretentious behavior.<br><br>And issit necessary? Will the soldiers stop obeying order the day you stop using vulgar words? I think the trend is singapore is getting more and more educated, people are hearing and seeing less and less of crude and vugular words being used.<br><br>I feel the trend is moving towards reduced manpower, with better use of technology, and run more like a school instead of a army. I think there is nothing wrong with that. Would you like your own kids and grandkids to be go through ns the old way or the new way? Think about that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1 more point to add, some my friends who once before enlistment is well mannered and seldom speak vulgarities, but after going through bmt n army, they became so much more crude mannered.</div>

When u go out as a civilian do u use vulgarities to make ppl listen? If u are a manger of a company would u use vulgarities to yr employees?<br><br>N btw just to tell u, my platoon has a very good spec n PC, they very seldom spew vulgarities. They talk reasonably and behave wad a leader should be. When its time for tough training, yes they will force us. When discipline is slack, they do scold but they seldom use vulgarities. N most important they are very reasonable n explain why they are doing this n that. Unlike some who just spew vulgarities when they see something they dont like.<br>As a result our platoon respect the spec n PC, we do wad we were told to do n i dont see our discipline declining. At the end of POP, our platoon shook hands with the Spec and PC and those encourgaing words tha they said leave a impression on me. This is a fine example of wad a leader should be..<br><br></div>
