            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh. Why does this always happen? Why do people always like to make it like some people are more important than others in the SAF. And why the CAPS and the vulgarities. Really shows a lack of intelligence in some people here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder if there is such a thing as civilised army. Well in the American civil war, it was fought 'gentlemanly' and officers could not be shot at. It changed to how we fight wars now and since when did anybody say that being a soldier was easy? Of course people asking for NS to be more slack or more efficient is just quite selfish.<br><br>What if one day, SG really goes into war and with our sissyfied training how are we supposed to win? If we dont win, ALL will die. Your parents, your loved ones, your friends. Even you yourself. I'd rather live my life knowing that I've got the best training I can have, am prepared, confident of myself so that i can keep myself alive and perhaps protect my friends and family who cant defend themselves.<br><br>If we are all softies, how are you going to fight to survive?<br><br>Why rely on other people to protect you when all men should be capable of protecting himself and others. Expect regulars to do all the fighting for you? Please, how many are there. Don't just think about giving yourself the easy way all the time, can we all rise up to the challenge to protect our families when the need arises?<br><br>btw about the vulgarities thing, yes it may be deemed barbaric or whatever you call it. No doubt sometimes it is uncalled for, but I feel that sometimes you really need to wake them up and scolding does work. It sets an example for the rest. And that is quite powerful.<br><br>But i also understand that constant unnecessary use of it will reduce the effectiveness when compared to a rare occasion of a verbal abuse. Perhaps this is what several members are driving at.  All in all, different people different working style some scold more some scold less. In the Army, your PS/PC during BMT is your boss, hurls vulgarities at you wtf can you do? Since there is no way out. Suck it up like a man and get on with it. Calling your mom to complain is what primary school kids do. Not adults. Not Men.</div>
