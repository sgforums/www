              <p>Is it worth it though?</p>
              <p>Left when I was a kid (needed exit permit, had NIRC already). Recent circumstances (mostly family) made me realize that I'll still like the freedom to be able to travel to Singapore if necessary</p>
              <p>For the record I'm 27 and have spent half my life abroad. I'm fairly Westernized but am still able to converse in my mother tongue (Mandarin). I have a University education and while I don't exactly run marathons for breakfast, I'm not entirely unfit either. I have citizenship status with the country I'm currently living in.</p>
              <p>That said, what do you guys think? Too old? I've read about that Melvyn Tan business and am somewhat discouraged by it. In all honesty, I'm perfectly willing to set aside 2 years of my life in good faith so as to be able to travel freely. To add to that I'm also keen to get rid of that lingering thought on the back of my head that I'm a criminal in the country of my birth.</p>
              <p>I know I'm not the first and I doubt I'll be the last. Plenty of folks like me out there who just want to sort out this messy business once and for all.</p>

              <p>First up,it would be best for you to liase with Mindef or the SG embassy in your country of residence on this matter.Only they can give you a clear stand on the options left open to you regarding this.</p>
              <p>From a personal point of view,if you are asking whether it is worth it in the first place then there is no point in even considering it.If the reasons you gave do not provide you with a strong enough motivation to surrender yourself without thinking twice,then nothing else will.</p>
              <p>Why would you be discouraged by Melvyn Tan's case?He defaulted his NS so he had to face the consequences.Do you expect a much more lenient sentence for NS defaulters or even to the extent for them to be entirely pardoned?Since you read up on his case,you should be aware that there was an outrage from Singaporeans over his seemingly lenient punishment.A $3K fine is a paltry sum for the opportunities he had by not serving.</p>
              <p>If you really want a so called "secure" way to enter back Singapore without facing too heavy a penalty,then wait till you are 40 then return back.I doubt they will do anything much when you are that age.</p>
              <p>You are not the first and won't be the last but this begs the question,why do it in the first place then show remorse thereafter?I'm not trying to flame you but I'm irritated time and again by such defaulters whose parents knew very well what the consequences would be for their son should they choose this path but yet continously seek out a loophole in which they won't have to face any penalties when they decide to return.</p>
              <p>"If you choose to do the crime,then do the time"</p>
              <p>I applaud you for giving this matter some thought though but I suggest you discuss this matter in depth with your own family first.As a warning though,even if you should choose to return to face trial,they might hand out the jail term as the penalty and you still have the serve the 2 years thereafter.There might be other charges that Mindef can bring such as failing to apply for exit permit or defering for further studies too.</p>

              <p>Controversy arose when the penalties were increased in January

              music during his enlistment age and later acquired British

              Defence Minister <a title="Teo Chee Hean" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teo_Chee_Hean">Teo Chee Hean</a> provided some illustration of the punishments defaulters would
              face:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the default period exceeds two years but the defaulter is
              young enough to serve his full-time and operationally ready NS
              duties in full, MINDEF will press for a short jail sentence.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot serve his
              full-time NS in a combat vocation or fulfil his operationally ready
              NS obligations in full, a longer jail sentence to reflect the
              period of NS he has evaded may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot be called
              up for NS at all, a jail sentence up to the maximum of three years
              may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Each year, a small number of people are convicted for their
              failure to enlist or refusal to be conscripted. Most of them were

              three years' imprisonment, but they are usually held in a
              low-security detention facility and separated from other
              conscription offenders. The government does not consider <a title="Conscientious objector" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector">conscientious

              <p>Interesting comments. Thanks to all who responded.</p>
              <p>About the Melvyn Tan case. I raised that issue because I'm not exactly keen on the 'mandatory' jail term clamored by most Singaporeans after his case was made public. I think a hefty fine at that age should suffice. I do concur that $3000 is a bit too low.</p>
              <p>Now don't get me wrong. I'm not looking to find a loophole to get out of it. I just want to serve for 2 years, no questions asked.</p>
              <p>As for why I did it? It wasn't a case of me, it was a case of us. My family left the country, I had no choice. That said, I refuse to blame my parents for my current predicament. I've blamed them in the past regarding this issue, but I've since realized that it's counterproductive. If anything I should be blamed for going along with it so easily. In the end, it's still up to me to sort it out.</p>
              <p>I've discussed this with my parents and they're taking a hands off approach this time around. They've conceded that I'm old enough to gauge the pros and cons of the situation and eventually make an informed decision.</p>
              <p>I might contact Mindef in a couple of days and see what good will come of it. I'm obviously not in the position to dicate terms but I still need a compromise of some sort that won't entirely ruin my life. A fine and 2 years of service is reasonable. A jail  term (a few years? seriously?) followed by the service is ludicrous.</p>
              <p>Now I've read about the recent controversy regarding Singaporeans emigrating and foreign permanent residents 'taking over'. Can anyone say brain drain? Drastic demographic change? Obviously I'm in no position to criticize but I personally believe making it high nigh impossible for Singaporean born defaulters (we number in the tens of thousands, perhaps more) to return serves nobody any good. Some of us just might be of some use to the country if we can return. Like I said, I'm willing to return to serve out the full term in good faith as long as the additional penalties aren't excessively harsh.</p>

              <p>Since Singapore does not allow duo-citizenship, I can only infer that you have given up your Singapore citizenship quite some time ago. If you are no longer a Singapore citizen, you will not be required to serve NS. And assuming you don't have PR status, you can't even volunteer to serve NS. </p>

              <p>IIRC,the penalty is jail term of up to 3 years,a fine up to 5k or both.From what I heard over the years,it seems that most cases usually end up in a fine.You might actually stand a good chance of avoiding a jail term but I cannot personally guarantee anything.</p>
              <p>I would have to politely disagree about the part regarding making it high nigh impossible for defaulters to return.The law was enacted to deter people from defaulting in the first place not as a "carrot" to entice them to come back and serve.</p>
              <p>If the penalty was reduced to only a fine,I think alot of people will abuse the system then.Many will end up skipping their enlistment to further their own studies or goals first since the only thing they need to fear should they choose to return is merely a fine.Jacking up the fine to a sum of let's say,a $1 million,would be ridiculous too and might actually promote the idea of "money can buy you a way out".</p>
              <p>I agree that some of the defaulters can be of use to the country when they return but many including myself will question as to just HOW useful they are to justify them returning with only a "slap to wrist".In the past,some of the other defaulters flaunted their prestigious degrees as proof of how they can contribute to the country but it only served to fuel anger from the local males who are usually older than these defaulters but have yet to complete their degrees.I came across a defaulter who was let off with a fine but during his NS,he constantly complained as to why they had not sent him to OCS since he had a degree as compared to the majority of the other conscripts.That irritated me and my buddies to no end.</p>
              <p>To say they are green with envy is not wrong.After all,they abided by the law and sacrificed much in the process.Many including myself didn't particularly enjoy our NS stint but that is not a good reason to not impose stiff penalties on those who choose to flaunt the law.In your case,it was not your choice but that of your parents'.I agree that it is pointless to blame them but the consequences of their actions cannot be avoided.</p>
              <p>Defaulting NS is just like AWOling,both carry the possibility of a jail term because it is a serious offence to your own country.If the penalties cannot reflect the seriousness of such a duty,many will argue that NS should not be made compulsory and I doubt the politicians would want such a situation anytime soon.</p>
              <p>I hope you will get a favourable reply from Mindef.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>Nah I don't think it works that way (regarding citizenship). If I could give up my Singaporean citizenship and still be able to return without any problems (NS included), I would. The key is that all male Singaporeans are required to finish their NS term before they can relinquish their Singaporean citizenship. Of course the dual nationality business makes it a bit complicated. As far as the authorities care, I'm still Singaporean and Singaporean only in their eyes. As for the authorities of my adopted country, they couldn't care less that I serve in a foreign military and hold another nationality as long as I'm not forced to give up theirs'.</p>
              <p>Thanks for the heads up baikachuku. You've given me a slight understanding as to what local Singaporean males think of us hehe. I understand the whole 'green with envy' bit. In all honesty I personally want to finish my term as quietly as I can, with minimal fuss, and move on with my life. I couldn't care less about OCS, flaunting what little education I have (basic BA) and what not. I'll be perfectly content with whatever rank/status the powers at be slap me with no matter how lowly. After all the reason why I'm going through all this trouble to head back is to fix a personal mistake and to fulfill a personal promise to a now deceased grandparent who I dearly loved.</p>

              <p>SG does not permit dual citizenship. But whether you have NS liability or not, depends on when you relinquish the SG citizenship. if its a few years before 18, you're definitely liable for NS. But if you are very westernised and have not been in SG for over 10 years it will be very hard for you to adapt to NS life, especially since you don't intend to go to OCS. If you think by not going to OCS, you will have a nicer life, I think not. You may be beaten the crap by the men. At least in OCS there're higher odds that you may find some like-minded people. Its really up to you. Your parents are also overseas right?</p>
              <p>If i were you, i'd rather not come back. I only came back because my family, including my extended family is based here, including our business and moreover I only left 18, so I was not as foreign to Singapore as you are. I intend to live here and make money until my early to mid 50s and take up US citizenship and retire there. Which country did your parents and you take up roots in? I was in the states for four years after A levels and had a hard time dragging myself back.</p>
              <p>US is truly the most beautiful country in the world, with the world's smartest men and most beautiful girls, the most dynamic cities, universities, and companies, the best tech gadgets, the smartest, nicest, warmest people and the most gorgeous sceneries.</p>

              <p>Yeah, I understand Singapore does not permit dual citizenship and I am more than willing to give up my SG citizenship, but they will not let me do so without fulfilling NS.  In any case, I have been a US citizen for 11 years now and have not returned to Singapore since I was 12 years old (which is 17 years ago!).  In fact, I even married an American earlier this year.  And yet, I'm stuck in the dumb Singapore Catch-22 law of not allowing me to renounce my citizenship.</p>

              <p>The only reason I want to return is that my mom's side of the family are all in Singapore and I would like to visit them after not seeing them for over 17 years.  That's all.  Absolutely no intentions of living nor working in Singapore at all.  Just vacationing and spending money in Singapore.</p>

As it is, I doubt I will be heading back due to the prospects of a hefty jail term. The NS I don't mind, I'm even willing to put up with the possibility of 'special treatment'. It's the jail time that I find excessive and unjust. What other country besides Singapore (and possibly North Korea) would impose such harsh penalties on its own people with regards to forced conscription? At the end of the day, many of us (defaulters) left young due to our families leaving. Many of us had no choice.</p>

              <p>I'm pretty much in the same situation as you with regards to citizenship status. I've been a citizen of my country of residence ever since I was 13.

I wouldn't head there for anything more than a short stay either. Like you I can't renounce due to the NS catch 22. Like you there's nothing for me there besides family, vacationing and a strong desire to visit the country of my birth.</p>
              <p>I think the whole situation is unfortunate. I sincerely hope that Singapore's laws will change in the future, although I can't say I'm confident they will.</p>

              <p>Actually, no the law isn't dumb. In fact it's smart, because it was deliberately meant to punish defaulters in an almost sadistic manner from the way I see it, (make it hard for you to even step foot here, tear you away from possible relatives), so as to discourage defaulting in general to the whole population. If they allowed any male SG citizen who is able to get citizenship in other countries to simply give up the SG citizenship as the only condition to skip NS, it would be way too easy.</p>
              <p>It is not difficult to get citizenship. I know quite a lot of foreigners who after 4 years there studying and landing a job right after, became naturalized Americans eventually plus the US is extremely immigrant-friendly.</p>
              <p>There are over 200 countries in the world. Can't get citizenship from one country, try the next. At this rate, more than half of the sg male population due to serve NS will take this way out and half the country's population will be emptied out. Well, at least those with the means.</p>
              <p>I know what you mean by difficulty in understand the spoken English of some Singaporeans. I didn't come across so many people who spoke distorted and mangled English with terrible dictions until I did NS. The most horrifying thing is, most of those with the horrendous dictions are actually graduates or would-be graduates, going to one of the three unfortunate universities here. In my experience, the graduates or would be graduates from Australia speak better.</p>

              <p>That's because of the poor standards of the low-class universities here. Seriously, when I was in JC, everyone who wanted to be anyone begged their middle class parents to send them overseas. Those from well to do families knew they were going overseas after A levels right before they started JC. If you think you have a hard time understanding what they mean when you read what you say, it's ten times worse when you hear them speak. Their diction is totally inscrutable, most of the foreign students in the US I met from HK, China, who did not study and were not exposed to English as intensively in grade school as these Singaporeans speak way better than them. It is the reason why anyone who has any brains in Singapore high schools all went to overseas universities.</p>
              <p>Which state are you living in? Are you in the east or west coast? Did you marry an American WASP? Hehe. A very small number of Singaporean friends who went to the US with me dated American girls, mostly the Chinese or the whites. I know such relationships will only bring pain in the long run since I had to come back, but its all good, cos I eventually hooked up and am marrying a Singaporean who was also US-educated. I really miss the big boxes and IHOP and even little things like TIVO.  This (SG) is really a god-damned place, not because of its physical limitations or its leaders, but the majority of the people here sicken me. If it wasn't because of our business here, which really is everything our family is built on, we wouldn't be here at all.</p>

              <p>Singaporeans can go overseas for their university education first after A levels or O levels. Not only is it allowed, its very very common! Their parents simply have to file the papers necessary with Mindef, and put down a security deposit.That's what the parents of dozens of my classmates and my parents did. Parents get the security deposit back when the person returns to serve. I'd say about 1/2 of my friends who went to US, UK, Australia and Japan, went overseas first after doing the declarations then came back to serve like me. The other 1/2 did their NS first cos they wanted to get it over and done with. This excludes the scholar-group. The PSC scholars (SAFOS and OMS) naturally get to disrupt at 19 and fly off - its part of their contract. The stat board and corporate ones do not. If they wish to on their own accord, they have to file their own papers and put down the security deposit.</p>
              <p>What these people are talking about and the fix they're in is caused by going overseas on other permits  without doing the necessary declaration for NS liability and they now want to do NS just to be able to renounce their SG citizenship officially and be able to travel to SG freely. (i believe they followed their parents, who had gone overseas on job postings when they were very very young, and their parents and they subsequently obtained US citizenship)</p>

              <p>its not just the informal internet typing. just listen to how these local 'grads' speak and their horrendous diction with their cheenapok accent..omg. most of them even those who do humanities at 'university' level can't plagiarize a formal paper without making simple primary school grammatical errors (!!), so no one harbours any hope in them possessing any intellectual currency or critical thinking. besides low intellectual ability there is also the frog-in-the-well quotient. ALL the local grads i've spoken to don't know the difference between partisan and non-partisan, the different between a politician and a civil servant, and the different between a lecturer and a professor. They're truly a disgrace when made to interact with foreign students and foreigners - every single one of my foreigner friend and Singaporean US/UK-educated friends made these remarks about them.</p>
