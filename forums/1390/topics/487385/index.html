            <div class='col-md body'><p>Alright guys i need some help about NS Deferment. My nitec course end at December and i already got my results online. I also received my BMT letter which is on Feb 3rd. The thing is, to apply a course for Higher Nitec i have to wait 15 Jan and wait another 2 or more weeks for the result for application. I read that to defer NS i have to show them proof that i am studying. Anyone know how to get out of this mess? I have only deferred once. I really want to study till Higher Nitec. If i were to wait for my result for application for my course, it will be time for me to go for my BMT. So how do i defer now?</p></div>
