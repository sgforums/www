He certainly did not make me walk any faster. He also did not rate highly among my platoon mates.

For me at least, i know that i can't have kept up pretences for so long. He could. There was no test of planning ability. Neither was there any test of industriousness.

Fitness superiority or well liked by instructors? I forgot to add that those who were very "gam" or "arr ka chiu ji" (friendly) with instructors ended up in OCS too. Maybe those kind of people have the PR / EQ skills to bring them to a level above the norm.<br><br>I am not despising them or whatsoever... sometimes I wish I had that x-factor or charisma myself too.

Some of you may think I am a sourgrape. But let me just set the record straight. I was offered twice at SISPEC to go to OCS. When interviewed, I said, "Sir, no thank you.

Though getting a 2LT or LTA rank is no big deal as they wouldn't really have a "armchair command" role (unless in BMT), I feel that getting bonded to the men would be more suitable for me (as a spec) as they (the men) are the main fighting force that the Bn will depend on in a war.<br><br>But I am upset as those who eventually crossover to OCS from my SISPEC coy were the wayang kings, and not those whom most of my peers felt were more deserving.<br><br>True to a certain extent, you get a bit more pride and monthly allowance when you served as an officer.
