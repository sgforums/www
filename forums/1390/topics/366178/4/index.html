              <p>If you have problems, feel free to pm to talk or post on forums etc and most ppl will try to help and advice.</p>
              <p>You still have a long way more to go so don't worry about such things at the moment. Focus on your studies and wait till you are closer to enlistment before you start worrying about such stuff. Don't let the future affect the present.</p>
              <p>Now just focus on your studies, do well for your own future.</p>

              <p>Marrying young has its advantages i would say, have kids early and you have people to support you earlier :p I got boys who already have children when they are only 16-17 now...</p>

              <p>Just don't let yourself get into depression again since its not exactly a problem thats easily solve especially if you get to the more severe stage like the previous guy. Talking to him was a torture...</p>

              <p>Furthermore, its easy to just look at your monitored posts to know your interest :)</p>
              <p>Just go email SMRT and ask them what is the qualifications for being a TO. Noone can answer that question better than them since they are the 1s hiring.</p>
