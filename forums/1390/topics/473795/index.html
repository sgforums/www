              <p>If you are travelling overseas for <strong>6 months or more</strong> you are 
              required to apply for Exit Permit. If you have a valid EP when you 
              travel overseas, you need not make further notification to MINDEF 
              Notification Centre (MNC).<br> <br> Applications of EP can be made through the NS Portal at <a href="https://www.ns.sg/nsp/web/esvcs/common/eep/apply">www.ns.sg</a> and you must declare the followings:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Reason and duration of your overseas trip; and <br> </li>
              <li>You are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT </span></strong>scheduled for NS training within 6 months from the date of your application.<br> </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Once your application is confirmed, you will be issued with an e-EP. 
              You must provide documentary proof, e.g. letter from your employer to 
              substantiate your declaration when required. Otherwise, you may deemed 
              as providing false declaration and be liable for prosecution.<br> <br> If your NS training schedule clash with your overseas trip, you will need to apply for deferment of your training in <strong><a href="https://www.ns.sg/nsp/web/esvcs/mindef/mydefer/main">MyDeferment</a></strong> at NS Portal (<a href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a>)
               before applying for EP. You will be disrupted from ORNS if the duration
               of your overseas trip is 1 year or longer. If you wish to extend your 
              overseas stay and your EP expires, you are required to apply for an 
              extension.<br> <br> Upon your permanent return to Singapore, you are not required to 
              surrender your EPs if you have been issued with EPs previously. MINDEF 
              will use the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) Exit Entry 
              Control Upgrade System (EECUS) to track your return and schedule you 
              accordingly for ORNS activities.<br> <br> <strong>When will I be exempted from EP requirements?</strong><br> You will be exempted from the EP requirements if you belong to the following categories:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Personnel who are exempted from National Service liabilities and have been issued with a Notice of Exemption [NOE (NS)];</li>
              <li>Personnel who are exempted from applying Exit Permit (EP) and are issued with a Notice of Exemption from Exit Permit [NOE (EP)].<br> </li>
              </ol>
              <p><strong>What happens if my EP expires?</strong><br> It is an offence to remain overseas without a valid EP under the Enlistment Act.<br> <br> If you are a first time offender, you may be served with composition 
              fines. However, if you are a recalcitrant offender, you will be charged 
              in court and on conviction, you are liable to a fine of up to $10,000 or
               imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both.<br> <br> For more enquiries on our exit control measures, please contact our 24 hours NS Call Centre at: 1800-367 6767.</p>

              <p><strong>What is Disruption from National Service?</strong><br> Disruption from National Service training refers to the postponement of 
              NS for a period of one year or longer. If you are going overseas for 
              employment or studies for period of one year or longer, you will need to
               apply for disruption from NS.<br> <br> If you are going overseas of 1 year or more, your application for 
              disruption must be accompanied by a valid EP, which can be applied in <a href="https://www.ns.sg/nsp/web/esvcs/common/eep/apply">NS Portal</a> (<a href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a>). Upon approval of your EP, the disruption will be automatically processed.<br> <br> If you need to apply for a local disruption due to a circumstantial 
              need, you will need to provide proper documentary proof directly to:<br> <br> <strong>Human Resource Services Centre (HRSC)</strong><br> 3 Depot Road #03-03<br> Singapore 109681<br> Tel: 6373 1048/ 6373 3076<br> Fax: 6373 1299<br> <br> Note that if you are pursuing a full-time tertiary education, you are 
              not disrupted from NS. You can still be called up for NS activities such
               as ICT, IPPT and mobilisation manning.<br> <br> In fact, to facilitate your tertiary education, MINDEF has an existing 
              arrangement with the 3 local universities, i.e. NUS, NTU and SMU) for 
              undergraduates, who are also NSmen, in the first 3 years of your 
              studies. If you are a NSman and are studying in any of these 
              universities, you may be called up for ICT only during specific parts of
               the university vacations. You can be assured that there will be no 
              academic programmes scheduled by the universities during your ICT period
               as well.</p>

              <p>The Enhanced NS IPPT system was implemented on 1 Apr 2011. It 
                      incorporates principles of fitness training science to enable NSmen to 
                      train more effectively, while offering flexibility in planning their 
                      fitness training to stay fit. Individual Physical Proficiency Test 
                      (IPPT) is a standard physical fitness test to gauge the basic physical 
                      fitness of an individual. The IPPT is a standard physical fitness test 
                      designed to test the basic components of physical fitness and motor 
                      skills of an individual soldier. In this service package, NSmen can find
                       out about policies governing IPPT and book their IPPT dates.</p>
              <p><strong><em>In the IPPT Gazette under the Enlistment Act dated 26 May 06, if 
                      an NSman fails to pass, or fails to take, the IPPT within any IPPT year,
                       he will have to attend and complete a remedial training programme at 
                      any SAF FCC. </em><br> </strong>Â Â  Â <br> IPPT can be divided into the followings:</p>
              <ol> </ol>
              <p><strong>ICT IPPT</strong><br> This is a requirement for all NSmen participation as part of the ICT programme, unless exempted due to medical reasons.<br> <br><strong>Non-ICT IPPT</strong><br> This is conducted at various IPPT test centres and the NSman can make as many attempts at the <strong>Fitness Conditioning Centres</strong> (FCCs). Note that only the first 3 IPPT attempts will be considered 
                      towards the NSmanâs NS liability and be paid service and make-up pay, if
                       applicable.</p>
              <p>The annual IPPT is applicable to all PES A, B/B1, B2/C1 NSmen and DXO 
                  with NS liability, till age 45 and 40 years old for Officers and WOSPEC 
                  respectively. The NSman's IPPT annual requirement commences on his 
                  birthday immediately after his NSF Operational Ready Date (ORD) and ends
                   when he is posted to MINDEF Reserves (MR), or medically downgraded to 
                  PES C2 and below.</p>
              <p><strong>What is the IPPT Window?</strong><br> <br> The NSman's IPPT window is based on his birthday. The IPPT window 
              commences on his birthday and ends on the day before his next birthday, 
              both days inclusive. NSman who has just ORDed can take his IPPT 
              immediately. The results will be counted towards his IPPT requirements 
              for the first NS year. The IPPT window is divided into two parts as 
              follows:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The first 9 months</span>.</p>
              <p>Commences on the NSman's birthday and ends on the day before the 10th 
              month of his birthday window. NSman must attempt at least 1 IPPT within 
              this period.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The last 3 months</span>. Commences on the first day of the 10th 
              month of NSman birthday window and ends on the day before his next 
              birthday. RT must be completed within this period, and will be applied 
              for the following cases:</p>
              <p>20 sessions of RT for IPPT failures and defaulters, and IPT defaulters who did not complete the 10-session IPT program.</p>
              <p>8 sessions of RT for those who completed the 10-session IPT/E1 PEP program but did not meet the PPT.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p><strong>Test Frequency</strong><br> NSmen must attempt at least ONE IPPT within their first 9 months of the 
              IPPT window. They can make as many attempts as they want within their 
              first 9 months of the IPPT window. Regardless of the number of attempts 
              made at the FCC, only the first 3 attempts by the NSman will be 
              considered towards his NS liability and will be paid service and make-up
               pay, if applicable. Notwithstanding this, the SAF will continue to bear
               the responsibility for service injuries sustained by the NSmen whilst 
              attempting the IPPT beyond the third attempt. NSmen will not be allowed 
              to make any more attempts within their annual IPPT window at the FCC 
              after attaining the GOLD standard, regardless of the number of attempts.</p>
              <p><strong>IPPT Requirement<br> </strong>All eligible NSmen must attempt their IPPT once within the first 9 
              months of their IPPT window. They may attempt IPPT during their ICT or 
              at any FCC and may make as many attempts as they want to improve their 
              IPPT results, except for NSmen who have attained the IPPT Gold standards
               for the IPPT year. The best result achieved will be taken as the record
               for that IPPT year.</p>
