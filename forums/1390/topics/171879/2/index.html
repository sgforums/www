So we should urge NSmen to maintain their fitness and eat healthily so that they'll have no need to worry about IPPT. Lowering the passing standard is not really logical. Anyway, I don't think the current standards are unreasonable.</div>

C tried before and he also say very hot....</div></blockquote>It's a good deal better than the old SBO. Spreads the weight better, can hold alot more, and is considerably more comfortable. For commanders, who have to carry signal sets, maps, compasses, writing materials, and pen flares in addition to the normal load of ammo and stuff, the new webbing is a god-send.<br><br>For M203 gunners, there are now pouches for their 40mm grenades. Of course, most of the time there aren't enough dummy m203 rounds to force every gunner to carry 8. In fact, there usually aren't enough dummy rounds for every m203 gunner to carry ANY.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  So in peace-time, those pouches remain unused, and the m203 gunners just dont appreciate them.<br><br>For SAW and LAW/Matador gunners, they all use the normal magazine pouches. Our SAW gunners still have to lug 18 magazines for ATEC and as an OPS load.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Naturally, there isn't enough space on the webbing to fit all 18 magazines, so that's still 1 problem there. But personally, I dont think its a fault of the webbing but of the weapon issued. No problems for LAW gunners; they appreciate the wider straps of the webbing, as it helps prevent the LAW strap from sawing into their shoulder all the time.<br><br>The best feature about the new webbing is the fact that it's modular. The MOLLE/PALS webbing allows you to tailor your webbing to suit your load and appointment. By right you're also supposed to tailor the webbing to suit your mission, but most units have a standardised load for each appointment, and the men cant stray (very much) from it, no matter the mission.<br><br>Yes, the webbing it hot(ter). And yes, you will have difficulty leopard-crawling and worm-crawling in it. But with regards to heat, I first wore the LBV with a bullet-proof vest and went straight for a mission without much prior acclimatisation or training, and found it tough but manageable. Some training will allow the soldier to operate in the LBV very efficiently. Train for it. If your sole grouse is that the LBV is hot... then you need to toughen up.</div>
