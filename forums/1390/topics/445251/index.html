              Now I getting worry Because I got the same problem in IPPT.
              
              At first after the 2.4 or sometime even in shuttlerun, I will feel my pulse too fast even for me to regulate my breathing and can even feel my pulse on my head temple area. Bad things happen if it con't more than about 10-20 sec, and the first symptoms is out of sudden I can't feel my heartbeat.
              
              Stage 1/Unable to feel heartbeat, chilling at nose and mouth, lips pale
              Stage 2/Vision colour change (from colour to purple screen then to white and see objects as shadows, hearing confusion (funny 'e' sound become louder and surrounding sound travels in the head), cold sweat at head and palm [This stage last last about few minutes/ Confusion state]
              Stage 3/Jaw and stomach pain, vision and hearing regen back to normal, heartbeat somehow can be hear again but weak [This stage means recovery]
              
              Its lucky for me to talk to you all here because I believe one day I may be like this CPL as my this problem become more frequent.
              I found this problem i age 16 and now I'm age 22 LCP(NS). Last time it happen on me is Oct 11 when I take IPPT (after shuttlerun).
              If you all will to ask me why not see doctor, my answer is MO and polyclinic doctor take that as physical exhaustion and say its okay.
              
              If anyone like me got this condition which I believe this CPL(NS) is suffering, please give me advise. Thanks in advance.

              Thanks for the reply.
              
              I actually think I should just brisk walk or maybe jog a bit in 2.4. My last timing 2.4 is 17+min which I happy to finish it. As for my shuttlerun, I also just fail it and not trying 2nd attempt since I exp shortage of breath before after 2nd attempt. What I worry about is ICT outfield which really needs to run alot. If on camo, my buddy hard to tell my lips pale anot and inform my commanders.
              
              Btw, can someone also explain to me about G6PD screening result: Presents. I need to know because it may be connected to my shortage of breath.

               Thanks for the reply. But I hope can help me answer those questions too:
              1/Faint during training without falling out can be charge? (My NSF OC told us)
              2/Found out hiding some condition (but no memo), even see MO before but no outcome, can be charge also?
              3/Develope condition during NS can be charge? (Pre-enlist I have no G6PD, ORD FFI then found G6PD presents)
              Hope someone can reply. Thanks in advance.

              My NSF OC say before malingering is worsen the condition by fainting without preventing it. He also say unhygienic (eg. getting foot rot, soil diease) can be charge. Well I must say this OC is a very famous CPT in SAF especially in BMT. Guess who is he? (Clue: Don't drag your boots! Whole lot knock it down!)
              Btw, I did see MO about shortage of breath and chest pain during run. But he say is just physical exhaustion and muscle ache. Polyclinic doctor say the same thing but give me a inhaler I request from him. Army doctor cannot be trusted. Polyclinic doctor hard to request specialist. zzzzz

              <p>1. Uh.... no. Maligering means faking an illness when you don't have one. </p>
              <p>Your OC is talking rubbish.</p>
              <p>As a medic, I've seen plenty of fainting cases before, and none were ever charged for malingering..... because it is totally not malingering.</p>
              <p>2. Foot rot is technically a chargeable offence, but I have never heard of anyone actually getting charged for that.</p>
              <p>After all, wasting cookhouse food is also a chargeable offence, but no one has ever been charged for that.</p>
              <p>3. '<em>Don't drag your boots! Whole lot knock it down!'</em></p>
              <p>Sorry, but that sounds like every 3SG and above at Tekong.</p>
              <p>4. If the MO says that it's just physical exhaustion, then it most probably is.</p>
              <p>Every mother's son who is not physically fit will have chest aches and shortness of breath the first few times they go for physical training.</p>
              <p>If you have never even experienced this during your PE sessions in school, then I must question whether your PE teacher was doing his job.</p>
