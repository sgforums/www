            <div class='col-md body'>SQ117 - yep that was a long time ago ...<br><br>Ok here to put the fact straight ....<br><br>1)Were the hijackers armed with anything dangerous?<br>- they first they have onboard dinner knife as weapon, if use enough strength at right place can still kill someone<br>- next they took out some stuff which they claim to be explosive. That cannot be verifed by look as it may be dyname or other home make explosive, on a pack plane with fuel, you just cannot take chance and take it as explosive. Only when over then send to lab - it turn out to be fire crackers stuff.<br><br>2)Who dragged the steward away when he was pushed out of the plane<br>The SOF or commandos would be the people that took the stewards to safety.  Depending timing, the commando which is securing the immediate parameter may be in the better position to react at that time, as remember it was a long night, SOF only move in place when the folks feel there is a need to storm the plane.<br><br>3)What weapons did SOF used during that time.<br>The weapons use is MP-5 ! at that time MP-5 is already in our inventories.<br>A lot of people are mis-lead by what they see, the inner parameter defense are the commandos they use M16, they may be wearing black also, outer is guard unit which is also M16. SOF - you don't get to see them, till action time as we need them as fresh as possible - they are only put in position when there is a possible need to board the plane. Thus what most people would see is the commando with m-16.<br><br></div>

Okay, let me put this in a way a primary school kid can understand.<br><br>If you don't know exactly what you're dealing with in there, is it going to make a difference in how you storm the aircraft?  Don't strain your little noggin too hard thinking about the answer - I'll tell you:<br><br>NO, IT'S NOT.<br><br>Enough of the Rainbow Six fantasies - a dead bad guy is a dead bad guy, and apart from the armchair generals, nobody's actually keeping score apart from the simple number of hostages walking out of the place instead of being carried out.<br><br>If you're looking for a scoring system based on difficulty or complexity, I would recommend diving, gymnastics or perhaps synchronised swimming - CQB's obviously too simple for your liking.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By the way, you also seem to have missed the main point of SQ117 while you were busy scoring style points.  The main thing to take away from the incident was the message that the Singaporean government sent out by sending the lads in:<br><br>We don't negotiate with terrorists, and if you want to play funny buggers, you've got about 55 seconds to regret it once that door opens.  And we really don't give a rat's if you've got an AK or a pair of chopsticks.<br><br>It's as simple as that.</div>
