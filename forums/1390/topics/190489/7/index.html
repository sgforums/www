            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, going back to your original assertion in this thread:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Icemoon:</div><div class="quote_body">the only argument we can put across is this - SQ 117 is not a good indicator of their ability, or inability.</div></blockquote>The Garuda and EgyptAir incidents are proof that things can and do go wrong.  In contrast, SOF did not shoot any friendlies, nor did they set the aircraft alight or let tangos slip out.  As I've asserted before, they did everything they had to do correctly, and that is a good indicator of their ability from a technical point of view.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some more summarised information on Sq117 (based on Sumiko TanÂ’s Book) Â–<br><br>Shahid Hussain Soomro was in the cockpit continuing with the countdown when an Urdu speaking police negotiator spoke to him. This caused a distraction in which Fida Mohammad Khan Jaboon joined him. The hijackers thought that they have made contact with Pakistan.<br><br>Signal given Â– raid beginsÂ…Â….<br><br>Khan is eliminated first, followed by Shahid. (In the book, there is lots of over dramatised information) I assume Khan was standing at the door of the cockpit while Shalid was in the cockpit itself.<br><br>Third hijacker (I will quote the book)  Â– Â“Hijacker Javed Akhtar Kayani was near the front of the plane, walking towards the cockpit. When he saw the commandos running in, he grabbed a woman passenger to shield himself from the masked men. But he was blown away within seconds, and the woman was freed.Â”<br>Sumiko TanÂ’s book made no mentioned of another passenger pulling her away.<br><br>Also from the book -<br>Â“Mohammad Yosaf Mughal was slightly further back in the aircraft. At the sight of the commandos. He fearfully threw his canister onto the floor. A commando scooped it up and, point-blank, finished off the hijacker.Â”<br>Canister in this case refers to the sticks of firecrackers (post-investigation), which the air steward reported earlier as appearing to be sticks of dynamite.<br></div>

While I was at 1 CDO, I had the chance to watch these guys train, and I can tell you that they don't muck about.  Rest assured that we're up there with the best of them.

I might be wrong then. If the CT took the shot with the hostage in front, then I cannot but say his skill is really good. After all, even snipers need to carefully aim before they take such a shot.<br><br>Fearfully threw his canister? Not light it up meh? Why did the commando scoop up the canister?</div>

Last time the papers featured this red beret topping the SF course also. These people featured will thank their wife or gf for giving them support blah blah .. haha<br><br>Well, I am pretty sure our SOF are way better than D81 or the Egyptian one.
