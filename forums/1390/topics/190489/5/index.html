Do we wish that things were a lot more complicated so that we can prove that we can handle things going badly wrong?

They had a blue-on-blue and shot hostages, botching the entry so one team was still outside when the other two were already shooting, and then shooting through the walls of the aircraft.  As far as CT ops are concerned, all those are big no-nos, especially plinking friendlies.<br><br>Is D81 a bad unit?  I can't say for sure.  Was that a bad mission?  Definitely.  Does such a mission add to the unit's reputation?  Decidedly not - at least not in a good way because you don't brag about f*cking up.  Do we want to have a mission like that?  Definitely not.<br><br>The ingenuity's in the training and mission planning, not the execution, and if the job's done right, there's nothing much to be said about it because it'll be pure vanilla.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wondering if the CT Teams have any distinct identification to determine friend from foe? AS during the storming of any aircrafts,ships,buildings, one would be hyperventilating, taking incoming rounds, firing off rounds and the environment is basically chaotic. The Israelis I have read, actually taped a yellow strip of tape to the slides of their handguns and also on the handguards of their SMGs/ARs to aid recognition.<br><br>Was playing Rainbow 6 3 and realised that another way for IFF during night ops is for the troopers to don uniforms with a reflective patch which shows up very distinctly on NVGs and not without.As this clearly helps create a shoot/no-shoot environmnet.</div>

I pity the middle guys the most.<br><br>I feel that the problem with that particular hijack was that the team was not thoroughly prepared.  If they were well prepared, they would be on tippy toes to check their targets before they shot (after all, they knew they had friends coming from the front, end and middle ) , as well as ensuring that stray rounds do not cause collateral damage.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>They would have better luck tear gassing the rear and middle, and have 1 team sweep through the plane.</div>
