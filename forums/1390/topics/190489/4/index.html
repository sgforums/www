Because only SG knows what they are talkib about.. and the hijackers are the only ones probably standing anyway....<br><br>using this tactic.. I'm surprise there were no collateral damage, as the Americans call it now. I heard it from the reliable source many many years ago...<br><br>Later, every tom, dick and joe was search and identity verified regardless.</div></blockquote>It be totally wrong to say that they start shooting anything standing.<br><br>Yes the standard drill is to go in and shout for the hostage to get down, this is to give them a clear view, but with the loud bangs some hostages will still be up and lost, these they will quick push down and yell to stay down. The SOF is trainned in to do quick identification of who is armed or not, they only shoot at anyone they feel is armed or a thread.  . Even is all tango is taken down, all remain hostages will still be escort out and question and search again to confirm that there is no more tango hiding within the hostages.</div>

That is to get in kill all tango on sight, without giving them any chance to activate the explosive.

It would be up to the air-force to decide if they want to blow the plane out of the sky.  Same options available as in 9-11.<br><br>Honestly, I don't believe that the terrorists actually BELiEVED they would getaway once they were on the ground? Almost every scenario played out in history has shown that once the plane was on the ground, hijackers lose. It was just a matter of time. Tire them out, make them grumpy....... yet they still have to be alert n watch out for attacks.<br><br>On the other hand, the CT units can choose WHEN to strike.<br><br>Too many disadvantages for the hijackers.  </div></blockquote>this is pre-9/11, where hijacks were more ideological in nature, conducted by non-religious motivated terrorists to achieve certain aims, these people do not have a hard-on for suicide attacks.</div>
