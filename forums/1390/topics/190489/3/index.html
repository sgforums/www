            <div class='col-md body'>Aiy. The SOF guys signed on to a high risk job, and thats what they did when they stormed the plane.  Honestly speaking, if those terrorist meant business and were more "professional" so to speak, SQ117 would be a smoldering ruin on the runway. They would have planted one of themselves on the aircraft as passenger and not reveal himself.  And he would probably be the one holding the detonator if there was a bomb.<br><br>The outcome could have gone either way since no one really knew if they were serious or were they amateurs.  The point is Sg did storm the plane and it sent a clear message to any other pigs who wanna try another stunt on Singapore.<br><br>Fortunately, we have the dead hijackers and a plane load of live passengers. Not to mention a now "feared" CT unit.</div>
