            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>At around 6.50 a.m., hooded SAF Commandos were given the command to storm the plane. They had already been waiting under the rear section of the plane for some time. With blackened faces and hands, the Commandos propped their ladders against the sides of the plane and opened the doors from the outside. The 20 commandos stormed in, some through the front entrance and others through the rear. Two loud thuds followed as the Commandos detonated some stun grenades to immobilise their enemy. <span style="color: blue;">The leading Commando shouted out to the passengers: Â“Get down! We are Singaporeans! We are here to rescue you!Â”</span><br><br>Automatic gunfire followed. <span style="color: blue;">The commandos, said the eyewitnesses, quickly killed three terrorists with their precision shooting. The fourth grabbed a woman to shield himself. Another passenger instinctively grabbed her away. A commando opened fire at close range, instantly killing the fourth terrorist.</span> Even after the four terrorists were killed, the Commandos took no chances. All passengers and crew were evacuated and told to put their hands on their heads until their identities could be confirmed. For the passengers, the rescue mission happened so quickly that they barely had time to react. The storming had taken a total of four minutes. By 6.54 a.m., passengers began sliding down emergency evacuation chutes from the plane. The hijack was over.</blockquote>Who was the leading Commando? The most famous SOF of Singapore?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>We are glad the fourth terrorist was dumb.

Don't you know that that is the worst case nightmare for any police or CT team ! Come on you don't even understand those basic fact and you dare to talk cock here ! .

By they have knifes , you want to let us poke you with a knife see if you die or not ? Knifes are weapon also and can kill.  They also have pour alcohol all over the plane, thus a little fire can light up everything.

You assume too much, you assume that the terrorist need fire to light the explosive, what happen if it is a button push type that igite with batterys ?<br><br>4) Your ops knowledge and even common knowledge is too shallow. You see too many movies ! In a hijack, the passengers usually in their seats, with heads lowered, that is what you assume, but their is still movement of people who need water, toliet, also terrorist may occasionally shift people. Terrorist are people also, hostage situation is a long waiting game, they also sit down to rest. Also in the terrorists may have backup team hiding within the hostages, they may be armed also and may have explosive also. In a plane of 100+ people, how dumb can you get to assume that there is no dumb people or don't have people who will do stupid things  like standing up , try to run to the door , or their love ones, they are too shock and frighted that they loss their sense of reasoning and just responsing.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Doubt they shouted that long.I belief that the 1st thing they did aft storming the plane was to yell "Get Down!" pure and simple instruction. Nothing fancy, try doing this, run 1 round around your block, and then up a flight of steps to your home, burst in and shout something long. Most probably nobody can make out whatever you are saying.This shows that their main aim was to get in asap, clear the tangos and get out.<br><br>Also, most aircraft hijacks end with the CT teams coming in dynamically, flashbangs or breeching charges to take the doors down before they flood in. Not saying that there is anything wrong with doing it dynamically, but that its done that way so as to shock the hell outta the tangos.<br><br>On the incident bout the Indons,I believe they could have made a tactical decision by boarding the plane via the mid-section on each side, once entry has been made to split into four columns and move down the aisles, 2 towards the cockpit, two towars the tail section and leaving tail-end charlies behind to provide security to the frontal team and also to secure the area. This will greatly decrease chances of Friendly Fire incidents. In a split second, one must make the decision to squeeze the trigger or not, and they are trained to shoot at armed personnel. But having a reflective strip or a small velcro flag on the vest allows for quick identification. The way the Indons boarded the aircraft, it can be said that its a Cluster F**k waiting to happen, pity those going in the middle section.</div>

Are you saying you are the expert? I'm engaging you on a logical level. Maybe you should enlighten me with some case studies to booster your argument?<br><br>1. Once again, prove it. Show me an ops a group of unprofessional and dumb terrorists were able to overwhelm the CT force. I don't think it is right to equate unprofessional and dumb people to be unpredictable. On the contrary, I can argue, the pros know the tactics used by the CT. This is already 1/2 the battle worn, figuratively speaking.<br><br>2. I can argue, during 9-11, some passengers wrestle with the terrorists. If what they have is a knife, you still have a chance. In fact, if the terrorists have no explosives, it is easier to overpower them. Is it any strange most terrorists claim to have explosives, even if those are fakes?<br><br>3. I never said if you're stunned still can shoot. I said if you are stunned, you are stunned, period. When you recovered, you can shoot. Isn't this what happened in Marseilles? The poor GIGN tiok the AK.<br><br>4. I don't think terrorists will allow large movement of people, much less an exodus to the toilet.<br><br>I think you are the one who came out with more fictitious scenarios. I'm not saying you can't have terrorists having backup teams hiding among the people, and sitting down to rest.<br><br>But maybe you can quote me such real-life accounts to booster your argument?<br><br>Thank you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think you're going a little too micro here, Icemoon.  Okay, let's be logical about this.<br><br>What's the terrorist's motivation for hijacking?  I think the pattern is there so that we can assume that they want something in exchange, be it the release of prisoners, or to achieve some other ends as in 9/11.<br><br>If it becomes clear that they can't achieve these goals, such as when the aircraft is full of CT troops, would their objective change to trying to get out of the situation, or would it be to take down as many hostages as possible?<br><br>In the latter case, the terrosist would be stabbing the hostage, and a dead hostage is no use to a tango.<br><br>In the former case, the terrorist would be working on a plan to escape, either by taking a human shield (and keeping said shield alive and useful), or by masquerading as a hostage like Resaq did.<br><br>Assuming that the terrorists are not entirely devoid of any sense of self-preservation (9/11 was a suicide mission, so it doesn't apply, but we're talking about cases like 117 and 648 here), the logical option to go for would be the try and escape.  Therefore, it simply wouldn't make any sense whatsoever for the terrorist to stab a hostage at that point, because that would simply be throwing a bargaining chip away.<br><br>As for what happened with 648, I disagree with you.  The op is on until such time that all possible hostages are safe and all tangos are either dead, in custody or long gone.<br><br>As for the definition of being armed, let me put it this way.  I've got you as a hostage, and while I've got the guns pointed at me, I've got a knife to your throat.  Would you consider me unarmed at that point?
