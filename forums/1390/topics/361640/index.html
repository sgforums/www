              <p>My question is should i tell them i have RT during the second interview if they express interest in employing me or should i tell them after i sign the letter of appointment.</p>

              <p>very simple.....your priority is to get that Job. Do what it takes to get that job. If your gut feel says that telling the RT will not help you get the job than scrap it</p>

              <p>You should get the job first... only after getting then inform them... but assure them only 2 months... or if you would rather be frank then tell them when you have the interview...</p>
              <p>the RT is at 6pm right? So you probably would have to left at 5pm latest... so suck thumb, just have to let them know. Unless you wanna wait until august then look for job, which i think its still a long time to go.</p>
              <p>If you dont go for RT, its alright.. just wait for being charged. no need go DB but then have to fine.. after which second offence would then result in you getting hauled into the detention barracks.</p>

              <p>Just bloody pass the IPPT and you wouldnt have problems. If not go throught the RT program or take the easy way out and downgrade.</p>
              <p>Anyway i see those going for RT not so bad, do some fitness training and most of the time they get to go back earlier than scheduled. Just take it as something unavoidable as a citizen of Singapore, not much you can do about it unless you intend to migrate.</p>
              <p>Anyway do anybody knows how they maintain the fitness of Israeli reservists? Maybe SAF can take a few pointers.</p>

              <p>thanks for all your feedback, but its kinda of getting out of topic, all i am asking is whether should i inform my employer i have RT during my second interview well any way i told them bot during my interview, they said having RT once every year is ok if it does not clashes with their schedule, which mean they hint that they do not like people taking time off for RT.</p>
              <p>Anyway this is my first RT session , to be frank i been getting silver ($200) for my previous 4 ippt test, i flunk due to my standing broad jump as i i sprain my hip after a fall and it clashes with my ippt dates and also i was hospitalised for dengue fever during the perid which means i kinda lose my touch.</p>

              <p>RT once every year, what is you employers thinking?</p>
              <p>RT is a zai-jie-zai-li thing, where got once a year one?</p>
              <p>You are right in saying that your employers don't want you to go for RT, so I suggest you better by hook or by crook find someway to clear it, otherwise you may have to part with this job.</p>

              <p>eh??u told yer prospective employer about yer rt???man.......and what did they tell u on second interview????normally second interview is when they ask u sign or wait to sign for the employment letter!!!</p>
              <p>???eh???why u tell them???rt once every year is ok???the interviewer must certainly be malaysians from sound of it. They must have mistaken rt for reservist training n not remedial training....its ok.. as long as u get job to pay bills!or u can go stare at forbidden sinner angrily after a few weeks later when u dun hear from yer prospective company.</p>
