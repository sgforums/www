              <p>hi, all, very glad to see a forum like this and topic about RSAF.</p>
              <p>i'm
               chinese, came to singapore in 2005, and study in NTU for a bachelor 
              degree in EEE and graduated in 2009. then i stayed in NTU as a research 
              staff until now. i obtained PR in 2010. i'm 25 (born in 1986).</p>
              <p>i'm quite interested in aviation and military. The RSAF also come
               to the university at career fair every year for recruitment. mostly the
               positions like airforce engineers and something like that.  Although 
              i'm also quite interested in career as a pilot, especially helicopters, 
              but i understand the chance is rather rare. but still i'll be very happy
               if got opportunity to learn these flight skills.</p>
              <p>anyway, i also wanna consider this military career in rsaf. now that 
              i'm a pr, but probably will convert to citizen in future. however i'm 
              not quite familiar with the military career in singapore.since i was 
              also exempted from the NS. so what will the life be like in the military? is it really wise to join RSAF~~</p>

              <p>LOL. stop daydreaming.</p>
              <p>you stand a higher chance of serving in PLA than in saf.</p>
              <p>Reason being:</p>
              <p>1) you are still a foreigner, not yet a citizen. therefore, you will never be choosen for sensitive position such as pilots etc. There are no Regulars who are PRs.</p>
              <p>2) Even if you are a citizen, since you did not serve NS, hasn't gone through BMT, you are not even qualified to sign on as a uniformed personnel. Well, unless you are willing to go through BMT at your age.</p>
              <p>The best you can do is to be a dxo in the ministry, BUT, due to your background, your clearance might be limited.</p>
              <p>3) For RSAF, you are too old to join. they take in young recruits between 18-21, and send them for years of flight training. There is a age cap for pilots to stop flying when they reach a certain age, and it makes more economic sense to train someone who is younger with more years to spare for flying.</p>

              <p>Question is, are you willing to die for Singapore. I don't exactly appreciate you viewing the RSAF as a career and perhaps as the reason for conversion to citizen. The fact that you did not even consider the physical requirements shows you do not understand the demands of a fighting soldier, flying or otherwise.</p>
              <p>Deathmaster has listed out the reasons well. You might have better luck with the commercial aviation industry.</p>
