            <div class='col-md body'>Well, two points,<br><br>1) Pray hard that yr brother got high fever or swelling or bleeding due yr removal of wisdom tooth. CSM will be blamed and yr brother - safe. Why, got MC but CSM overwirte MC, no one in camp, buddy not around, cannot find help.<br>MO is usually a Captain or Major. CB CSM only SSergent, dun give MO face, hee hee CSM die till dun how he die.<br>2) Report to yr OC. Sure kana weck upside down. But yr brother in deep shit.<br>Always kana gaurd Duty on weekends, kana arrow for nothing.<br><br>Please stick to 1 because much safer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly speaking,if your bro want to di siao siao with the CSM,it likely also,he can ask his parents indirectly or just ask your parents to write to straits time, MP,etc,regarding "how come my son got MC cannot stay at home?Is the health issue more impt or serving the NS?" as he really have a hospital MC given,not by GP.BUT he will definely get into trouble,it a lose lose situation to the CSM as well as Himself,cause maybe he may get to go home rest for MC,but from the way his CSM handle things,he will definely get a longer period of confinement after finishing his MC loh and since u mention that the CSM is going to ord dun really bother abt his career in SAF,i think it hard also to complain</div>
