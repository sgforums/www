            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, you need to provide more background details -- eg. your old NS vocation, whether you're staying within the same formation for reservist, etc. If convenient, confirm whether you're now with, say, a PDF outfit too.<br><br>Lots of folks convert after NS, the bulk cuz there's no reservist equivalent for PTIs, MPs, RPs, ammo technicians, etc.. This lot tend to end up as riflemen again, serving with an infantry brigade but under PDF command &amp; thus considered as second-line troops. So you may be lucky in that sense, since it's usually a cultural shock for those guys to do stuff like trench-digging again, although their combat training isn't as demanding as for the ex-SIR soldiers.<br><br>There may also be certain operational roles for reservist that didn't exist during active time, in which case they'll be filled in by newcomers. For example, my old Arty outfit has a outfield RSM group &amp; we had to convert the above-mentioned ex-vocationers (plus even a driver or two) for it, even during mid-cycle.<br><br>With both examples, the conversion is done mostly by induction -- or learning on the job -- rather than through attending a proper course. But yours shall require formal training, cuz you'll need a licence to drive military vehicles.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes, i haven start my ICT yet.<br><br>why i dont want ah ? reason being is that  i never driver for 6 years after i  passed my class 3 licence test. Then Ask me to  go behind wheel for a 3 tonner, Its tough....<br><br>for those with driving experience, driving 3 tonner need  a little adjustment. But for me its a lot. And they only give me 2 week to get it learnt to drive. In fact only 10 days( including 1 day for test).<br><br>Many people said that i am  stupid that  i want to revoc out of driver, but its  stressful when  you  doesnt remember a lot about driving, not to mention a totally different vehicle.<br><br>For a totally  new recruit who  got to be driver, their life is good. so much free time. For reservist totally different thing. Short training period,long duration each day for training, Hardly got tiem to  rest or get some eye shut in between break. Its just like waiting for something to happen with the 3 tonner.<br><br>I been to the training before, every night nightmare about driving. hai.........</div>

Tio induction course, lessons already started, presumably no unit yet, hence can be posted anywhere, &amp; with a whole reservist cycle ahead of you!<br><br>Firstly, I'm not surprised to hear about your instuctors' casualness. It usually happens with these induction trainings; I myself went through a 2-week one to become a DI (mono-intake BMT) in my time. If you're disillusioned by this, well, don't be unless the same attitude prevails during the actual test. The latter should be stricter -- we're talking about a formal licence to drive, after all -- &amp; maybe you can fail that if you really want a way out. (What can they do, re-course you?)<br><br>But obtaining that driving permit is the equivalent of finishing BMT. It'll be difficult to justify reversing deployments thereafter.<br><br>On the other hand, driving 3-tonners isn't not the end of the world either. Yes, the risk of getting charged is there if you get involved in accidents. But the SOP for such vehicles is to travel properly by convoy, &amp; you shall always have a vehicle commander riding shotgun too (&amp; share the blame with ~lol~). Very few chances to anyhow speed like cowboys, lah. Instead, the main difficulty will be negotiating off-road terrain, cuz even rations truck must negotiate dirt tracks during their deliveries. No idea how thorough your current training is in this area.<br><br>You can try talking your future MTO into giving you an easier unit appointment too. Most likely, he or the MT Sarge will take the initiative if they're the helpful type. Another upside is that combat reservists often "take care" of their drivers, eg. ensuring they get enough rest/sleep, excusing them from OP duties, giving them plenty autonomy at the field MT parks, etc.<br></div>

A 5 tonner without load is about 13 tons already while a 7 tonner is about 15 or 18 i forgot.</div>
