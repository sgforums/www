I'm saying is yes...train us. Be realistic but keep a look out between realism and tekan/torture.But as always...instructors like to compare..."During my time...blah blah!" so yeah...mebbe his instructors can go and tell his parents the same line.</p></div>

              <p>Full—time NSman who died was granted 3—day medical leave</p>
              <p class="first">SINGAPORE:
                  20—year—old Private Joe Foo Wei Rong who died at Lim Chu Kang Camp on
                  Tuesday morning had been given three days of medical leave on Sunday
                  for a hamstring strain.</p>
              <p>Relatives
                  and friends learnt of this as they paid their last respects to the
                  full—time National Serviceman at the Ubi Teochew Parlour on Wednesday
                  afternoon.</p>
              <p>Private Foo collapsed while doing chin—ups at Lim Chu
                  Kang camp. The Ministry of Defence said he was brought to hospital
                  where he died shortly after.</p>
              <p>It’s learnt that Mindef is investigating why Private Foo was training while on medical leave.</p>
              <p>Private Foo will be cremated at Mandai Crematorium on Thursday morning.</p>
              <p>Many remember him as an athletic young man who liked to play basketball.</p>
              <p>Clifton
                  Seah, the cousin of Private Foo, said: "I’m very shocked. He was a fine
                  young man. My brother was on the phone with him barely 12 hours before
                  he died. It’s a great loss." — CNA/vm</p>

              <h1>National service, national responsibilities</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <p>Thursday, 19 June 2008, 9:45 am | 637 views</p>
              </div>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignleft" style="float: left; margin: 13px; border: black 3px solid;" alt="" width="160" height="160"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">There is a saying in my office: the job of the Military Medicine Institute is to prove that you don’t have what you say you have. It began as a joke, based on observations that we have made during our time in Basic Military Training. Unfortunately, it seems that the statement is truer by the day.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I told my colleagues the story of a recruit in my company in Pulau Tekong. He suffered from severe flat feet. The arches of his feet would collapse after running for too long, making him highly unsuitable as a frontline soldier.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">He demonstrated that he had flat foot during his medical check-up. He even went to a private specialist to confirm his condition. But he was sent for PES A/B training. It took over a month before he was officially downgraded and posted out - in the interim, he was pulled out of training and spent his days sitting in the company office and running simple errands.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Fiction? I wish. It is merely just another case of irresponsibility.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><strong>The price we pay</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Every time a recruit is declared ‘Out of Training/Course’ in BMT because of a pre-existing medical condition that could have been detected but was not, he would have to be sent for the next BMT recourse that caters to his actual PES status. All the money heretofore spent on him, from food to utility bills to ammunition, would effectively be wasted - and that money comes from taxpayers’ wallets.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Pre-enlistees, too, have to bear the cost of a medical misdiagnosis. My former company mate scrambled to have a private specialist to diagnose him with flat foot, after realizing that the doctors at the Central Manpower Base would send him for PES A/B BMT. Armed with this documentation, he proved to his superiors that he should be medically downgraded, and was declared OOT from the third day. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Had he not consulted his specialist, there is a very high chance that he would have suffered feet injuries before the MMI realized its mistake. But it is absurd that he had to pay a private specialist to perform a service that a military doctor could, and ought to, have done just as competently, and for free. Private specialists charge steep prices; should a pre-enlistee with a medical condition be unable to afford a specialist, and be wrongly classified during his preliminary medical check-up, he would be in for a spell of bad luck and trouble. And the SAF would then have to pay for his treatment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Worse still is the effect on the recruits’ health. One of my colleagues has scoliosis, curvature of the spine, and was sent for PES C BMT. The simple act of carrying his military and civilian clothing and equipment to his bunk injured his spine, and he had to be excused from carrying heavy loads. It should have been a given, considering his back problem, but nothing in the SAF seems to exist unless it is officially documented in triplicate. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">A few months later, he was ordered to wear a fully loaded Load Bearing Vest to the live-firing range for nearly the whole day, further aggravating his injury. He now has to perform personal physiotherapy every other hour, courtesy of several slipped discs, and can only sleep on a waterbed because regular ones would aggravate his condition. Here, the SAF has to spend time to process his injury report - his case stretches back to December 2007, and has yet to be resolved - and determine if he was eligible for compensation. A medical board is being convened to determine if he should be downgraded to PES E9L9, the lowest grading a serviceman may get before being discharged on medical grounds. The result: even more time and money spent to rectify something that could have been prevented.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Perhaps the most debilitating of all is the effect on the morale of affected servicemen. My colleague now bears a grudge against his former commanders, refusing to refer to them without using unprintable vulgarities. Every serviceman who had had to turn to a private specialist because the military doctors have failed in their job would lose his faith in the MMI, because of that failure, and would have judged it rightly. Left unchecked, the negative attitude that emerges from each lapse would extend to embrace the SAF in its death grip. Indeed, to the disaffected, ‘SAF’ is an acronym for four words. The first two is ‘serve and’, and the last is ‘off’. I will leave you to speculate what ‘F’ means. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Should his ennui be entrenched by future incidents, the serviceman would lose any incentive to do his best while serving his National Service liability. The efficiency of his unit would then be compromised in the area he is currently responsible for, be it logistics or clerical work. From a macro perspective, compounding the negative effects of each disappointed soldier, the overall effectiveness of the SAF would be further compromised - and therefore, its ability to defend </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The price of every misdiagnosis and every act of negligence is in the currency of money, time, operational readiness, and blood. We, the people of </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, are the only people who can pay for it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Duties and expectations</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><strong></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The military sees National Service through the paradigm of duty. The average citizen, however, sees it through the paradigm of compulsion. The SAF wants to instil a sense of loyalty in every serviceman, to have him understand that National Service is a duty imposed upon all male Singaporeans to provide for the common defence, because there are too few people to sustain an army of regular soldiers. But many Singaporeans simply see National Service as a mechanism that tears their sons, brothers, fathers, husbands and lovers away from them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Neither side is wrong. But their perspectives are irreconcilable. The death of every serviceman attributed to a military lapse would heighten the tension between them, and eats away at the military’s core. The military, in turn, would want to play down the extent of any lapses, because it - and its political masters - have no desire to lose the public’s support, which was never significantly high to begin with. I would not be surprised if stories of cover-ups were to surface; after all, nobody, least of all a regular soldier, would want to lose face. Yet this is only a temporary solution at best. It does not at all resolve the situation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">What should be done is the recognition of responsibilities on both sides. The military must recognize that it is a public organization that is mostly staffed by people against their free will. This restriction of such a basic human right must be recompensed through a pledge of honour and professionalism, to develop each enlistee’s potential to the fullest. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the event of a lapse, especially one so severe that it leads to death or injury, the SAF must spare no effort in investigating its cause and punishing the guilty, and it must be done as transparently as possible. The military must aim to minimise the cost of maintaining the SAF, especially the cost imposed by negligence and misdiagnoses. Nothing less will do, because the survival of the nation and the honour of the military rest on the SAF’s shoulders. It is the public’s duty to urge the government and the SAF to do so, to prevent bureaucratic inertia from suffocating the investigation, as it is the public that must bear the cost of military irresponsibility.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Recognising responsibilities</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Civilians, in turn, ought to recognise that they must provide for and support the common defence. Pre-enlistees should realise that only they can defend their loved ones, because there are not and never will be enough regulars to do so for them. They should play their part by meeting the rigours of National Service - servicemen by doing their best, civilians by supporting them. The legal system assures us that anybody who chooses to renege on his national duty would be punished if caught. But it is education, public messages, and the attitude of the military towards servicemen that would influence what people truly think of National Service.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The ultimate objective of this exercise is to reduce the cost borne by the public caused by negligence and misdiagnoses. When the military recognises its responsibility and acts professionally, doctors would examine pre-enlistees more carefully, commanders would care more for their men, clerks would pay more attention to their work, and so on. The citizenry would support the military in its task, and take it to task when needed. This means less public money spent on recourses and resources, less time wasted for new postings, less blood spilt and hearts lost by trainees, and a lower chance that the SAF, should it be needed, would be found wanting. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In times of peace, sons bury their fathers. In times of war, fathers bury their sons. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Let us hope that it becomes so.</span></p>

              <div class="posttext">A few medical officers, including my superior, have asked me why I am serving the military given the nature of my medical condition. I have been told by my colleagues to get a downgrade to a PES F status, but I have no clue how to approach this. The SAF medical board has no record of anyone with my medical condition in the military and I'm the first person in the military (with my condition) to have a neurostimulator medical device needed for my daily activity. <br><br>1) Problem walking, or bending<br>2) I could only walk short distances<br>3) I'm in baseline pain (pain scale: 4-5/10) every day and every second. <br><br>Please advise.</div>

This medical device serves as an alternative to my life activities. And I'm suffering in pain everyday. Without this device, id be in immense crippling pain, confined to a wheelchair or I may be bedridden. Furthermore, this pain im suffering from is chronic (aka. lifelong). Its something that affects my central nervous system. I just want to get back to my education which i had missed out on because of this disability. I can't bend because the leads in my spianl cord may snap or dislodge from the battery in my abdomen. Im undergoing excruciating physiotherapy to get the motor nerves on my leg working again. BTW, I dont want to inflict self-pity. I just want to do something I'm able to do in my own life, and recuperate whatever education i missed out on as a result of this disease.</div>

NS Man accused of malingering, denied of proper<br>medical treatment and finally dies.<br><br>These are not isolated incidents. In addition to direct physical and<br>psychological abuse, denial of proper medical treatment is also a constant<br>recurring feature of the Singapore Army.<br><br>Many SAF doctors merely "go through the motion" of dignosing and treating<br>patients, and often the results are catastrophic. These paper shuffling<br>bureucrats have long forgotten their professional oath as medical doctors and<br>replaced it with a bureucratic creed which favours career advancement in the<br>civil service.<br><br>Straits Times<br>25 Oct 2003<br>Family sues NUH, 6 doctors<br>By K.C. Vijayan<br><br>THE family of a dead full-time national serviceman is suing six<br>doctors and the National University Hospital (NUH), alleging that<br>their negligence led to his dying two days after he was admitted for<br>a pain in the right leg.<br><br>The six include a consultant surgeon and an orthopaedic specialist<br>who attended to 23-year-old Chua Ya Ta in June, 2001.<br><br>The dead man's parents, carpenter Chua Seow Cheong and housewife Tan<br>Hong Eng, both in their early 50s, and his sole surviving brother, Ya<br>Lin, 21, are behind the suit, which was filed in the Subordinate<br>Courts late last month.<br><br>A spokesman for the family's lawyers, Oei and Charles, said that the<br>firm is in the process of serving the suit.<br><br>Corporal Chua, who was a tank driver in the army, saw the doctor at<br>his camp on June 15, 2001, when his leg started hurting, and was<br>advised to go to hospital.<br><br>At NUH, he received treatment and was sent home.<br><br>But less than three hours later, he returned to the hospital<br>complaining of pain and a fever that came and went, and was admitted.<br><br>In the next two days, despite suffering from the pain, he was accused<br>by two of the doctors of malingering 'to avoid his army training'.<br><br>In fact, the morning after he was admitted, his girlfriend, IT<br>administrator Gladys Seow, also 23 then, was told by a nurse that the<br>hospital wanted to discharge Cpl Chua and was handed a bill for the<br>medical charges.<br><br>He was not discharged as by then, he had difficulties standing<br>without assistance.<br><br>At about noon, he fainted in the hospital toilet while showering.<br><br>There was also blood in his stool.<br><br>His condition worsened and at about 3pm the day after, he was given<br>oxygen because he had difficulty breathing.<br><br>By this time, his fingers, toes and face had also turned slightly<br>blue.<br><br>Distressed, his uncle, businessman Chua Kok Poon, who was visiting<br>his nephew then, asked that he be transferred to another hospital.<br><br>At about 5pm, he received a note from a doctor assuring him that Cpl<br>Chua was in stable condition and not in 'clinical danger'.<br><br>He was later transferred to the intensive care unit, where he died at<br>11.10pm of an acute bacterial infection.<br><br>The suit alleges that NUH doctors failed to take sufficient steps to<br>diagnose the infection and prescribe early treatment.<br><br>Contacted on Thursday, an NUH spokesman said that the hospital had<br>referred the case to the coroner in 2001 and had cooperated fully in<br>the investigation.<br><br>She added that the hospital has always kept the lines of<br>communication with the family open.<br><br>'We also offered them grief counselling, as well as our fullest<br>assistance whenever appropriate,' she said.<br></p>
