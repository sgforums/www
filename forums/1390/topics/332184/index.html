              <p><span> Private (PTE) Foo Wei Rong Joe, a Full-time National Serviceman from
              4th Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment, collapsed in Lim Chu Kang
              Camp at 6.05 am this morning while doing chin-ups. The chin-ups, as
              well as some push-ups which he had completed earlier, were part of the
              unit's daily basic exercise routine. He was given immediate medical
              attention and evacuated to Tengah Medical Centre by 6.40am, where the
              doctors tried to resuscitate him. PTE Foo was sent to National
              University Hospital at 7.15 am. The SAF doctor and medic continued
              their attempts to resuscitate him en route to the hospital, and he
              arrived at 7.45am. PTE Foo was pronounced dead at 8.28am</span></p>
              <p><span>MINDEF and the SAF extend their deepest
              condolences to the family of the late PTE Foo, and will assist the
              family in their time of grief. MINDEF is investigating the incident.</span></p>

              SINGAPORE: A full-time National Serviceman collapsed while doing chin-ups at Lim Chu Kang camp on Tuesday morning.
              
              The Ministry of Defence said he was brought to hospital where he died several hours later.
              
              It's the first time a fatal incident has occurred during a daily non-strenuous exercise routine and it's the third military training death this year.
              
              The Defence Ministry said that at about 6.05am, Private Joe Foo Wei Rong, from the 4th Singapore Infantry Regiment, was in the midst of his seventh chin-up, being assisted by a buddy, when he collapsed.
              
              He had already completed six chin-ups without assistance and several other morning warm-exercises, including push-ups.
              
              The servicemen would usually go for breakfast after their morning warm-up exercises.
              
              The Defence Ministry said medical help was immediately given using cardiopulmonary resuscitation and an emergency defibrillator.
              
              At 6.40am, he was evacuated to Tengah Medical Centre in an ambulance about 10 minutes away where doctors continued medical attention.
              
              Private Foo was then taken to the National University Hospital and arrived at 7.45am.
              
              He was pronounced dead at 8.28am.
              
              The former Singapore Polytechnic student was enlisted in July 9, 2008 as PES A - the highest fitness grading.
              
              It's understood he had displayed no signs of difficulty or health problems and there were no strenuous exercises the night before.
              
              Private Foo had not complained of any medical condition prior to the exercise. Investigations are currently underway to find the true cause of the incident.
              
              A report is expected in about eight weeks.
              
              Mindef will convene a committee of inquiry.
              
              Two other servicemen died during training in June this year, recruit Andrew Cheah fainted during a 2-kilometre walk and Officer Cadet Clifton Lam collapsed during training in Brunei. - CNA/vm

              <p>Well u cannot blame the MO in the medical centre. All these heart problem should be check in CMPB when the person go for check up. Btw some of these heart problem are quite hard to detect without the right equipment. In this case, the personal had passed the BMT phase so it's assume that he's medically fit. To all those in BMT and going to BMT,  please do take care of yourselves......report sick when necessary.</p>

              <p>Btw if u see the amount of recruits reporting sick, especially the 1st of enlistment, sometimes I really feel sorry for MOs, and some of these recruits really nothing wrong with them, they report sick because the medical centre can smoke lah....</p>

              <p>dr bala from 4 sir is a good doctor.he goes to work earlier than other doctors.while others arrrive at 8am,he is always at the med ctr by 7am.the blame should not be his or any other doctor as 5bxs are conducted at 6,a time when all doctors are absent.5bxs are also considered a low risk activity that does not even warrant the presence of a medic.something must have whilst he was being transported.the board of enquiry will convene and investigate.as to his cardiac arrest,i think their 5bx must be more shiong than normal otherwise nothing would have caused it.my condolences to the boy's family.the only thing i can promise is that this incident will cause us,the members of the medical corp,to be even more vigilant,to prevent such accidents from happening again.</p>
