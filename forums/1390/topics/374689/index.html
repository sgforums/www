              <p>i guess i'll be more disipline once i've completed my studies. furthermore, i'm not that keen on starting my tertiary studies yet. i look at ns as a long term break hahas. i'm also looking at the possibility of taking up the poly scholarship too.</p>
              <p> yes, i do know that some of you ppl may find ns as a waste of time and that i should just go on with poly first then serve to yrs of ns and f off. however, there are a few that says that ns is a good experience. i guess it depends alot on the type of ppl you are, am i right?</p>
              <p>i know alot of people will shun me off or criticise me for this:<br>I am planning to sign on with the army as a combat specialist mainly for the passion and the nature of which the career has.</p>
              <p>some basic info of myself:<br>i'm physically and mentally fit. attained silver for napha. love adenture and outdoors. able to listen to instuctions.positive attitude.cooperative.able to lead. wouldn't mind being in the dirt getting dirty.</p>
              <p>hope you guys would enlighten and share your experiences</p>

              <p><strong>wait till u really enlist into national slavery 1st before you even consider</strong> signing on the dotted line contract... u now just see some exhibitions/ advertisements only... wait till u see and really physically experience what are behind the scenes... by then, u will think of other career options liao...</p>
              <p>n with regards to the joint-poly "scholarship", it is definitely only a <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sponsorship</span></em> only... yah, u bite the dangling carrots 1st, meaning... sure u will get some money as monthly allowance while studying... but then, once u enlist and <strong>bonded for 5 years</strong>, its a different story all together... and when u realise all the advertisements r just showing the surface dirt, the pit has yet to be seen n scrub to be seen at all, then u will surely regret ur choice for signing that slavery contract...</p>

              <p>For the scholarship, aren't you supposed to apply for it while you are studying in poly and join NS after poly education?</p>
              <p>I am not sure whether you can sign on with only an O's cert nor the actual details about that scholarship but the usual advice is only sign after you have experience BMT and not before you even enlisted.</p>

              <p>thanks for your valued views rednano and dkcx.</p>
              <p>to be frank the salary does not bothers me much as i have other means of income ( no not from my parents hahas).</p>
              <p>yes i can only apply for the scholarship after i had gained admission into a poly institute and serve only after i had completed my studies provided i passed all my modules.</p>
              <p>yeah rednano i heard of all the shit things that may happened in the army from my cousin who signed on, my brother who is serving ns and a late friend of my family who signed on also. all of them advised me to not sign on, if im doubtfull or feel insecure. however they encouraged me to sign on if im up for the challenge. rednano, you seem to be against the idea of signing on, want to share the reason why? its okay if you don't want to.</p>
              <p>still considering my options though(: anybody who wishes to share their experiece in the army be it good or bad, please do share.</p>

              <p>I believe most of us would advice you against that decision since we have heard many cases of regrets be it from fellow forumers over the years or from regulars during our term of service.</p>
              <p>Do also note that these days its also army that chooses you not you choose the army so if you are not up to their expectations, they will still not want you.</p>
