While the government may be becoming more open, society in general still refuses to accept non-standard behavior. If found out, you will be the butt of jokes at camp. You will lose respect among your men. Your men will be less likely to follow your orders and more likely to question them.

You will face discrimination of the very worst kind and at the end of the day, this will affect your productivity and the productivity of your men.<br><br>As I mentioned, society in general does not accept you and the military is by far one of our society's most conservative institutions. Thus, on another note, if found out, the SAF might not punish you openly, but they might make an effort to side line you.
