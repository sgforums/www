I know a LTA who paid 26k to tear his contract, but not many can afford to pay such a lump sum. So reconsider carefully before signing on.<br><br>Even if you got into you dream vocation, i.e guards, commandos etc, can you be sure that you will never suffer any injuries due to training? You might have to serve out the remaining years of the contract sitting in front of an office desk.<br><br>The stupidest reason i ever heard, was from a regular, a friend of mine.<br>He signed on so that he have the money to buy a car. 5 years after serving finish his MTE (minimum term of engagement) he left the SAF with 0 job experience, $0.<br><br>No one will stop you from signing on, for the ladies my advice is DON'T. For the guys, finish your BMT and experience a few months of unit life first then consider signing on.

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly, I can't comprehend the combat applicants' mindset too. Technical or logistics, yes. (Same goes for the other service branches &amp; the paramilitary organizations.)<br><br>But with combat, I guess it has more to do with the immortality sentiments among the youthful, although today's generation also conceivably (pun) consists of some ex-"army brats". Perhaps they have prior romantic notions of the SAF as like the US Marine Corps or French Foreign Legion too. (If so, the more astute should aim to sign on with local elite forces -- any branch -- cuz the ethos they seek does exist with those small &amp; professional units.)<br><br>As long as we're in peacetime -- &amp; prospering -- the military remains an attractive career choice, particularly for officers or those well-qualified, with guaranteed job security, material benefits &amp; the chance to recycle on later with GIC companies if they stick it out.<br><br>Yes, the first 6 years tend to be backbreaking with the operational demands at the BN level. But, thereafter, life does become more of an office-hours routine as you get promoted, posted on to the BDE or DIV or Formation HQ level, &amp; can delegate down. That's the usual hierarchy structure of any military organization, what.<br><br>The other complaint mentioned in your post -- which IMO is the main alienating factor -- is the bureaucracy nature of the SAF, which isn't surprising since we aren't on a war footing. As such, it also partly operates as an mammoth administration bureau like any government agency, with the same propensity for organizational structures, red tape &amp; office politics. Except it can be more regimented, being military. The combat-inclined regulars must live with the system, or quit altogether.</div>

The pay is getting better, and regardless of the pay, it is sufficient, and if no savings are made that is a fault of the individual and not the organisation.<br><br>Also, I would think that the military is NOT an attractive career for everybody when the economy is booming, as shown by the recent pay increases that were announced.<br><br>Yes, the airforce and the navy are different from the army--in that they are more glamorous.
