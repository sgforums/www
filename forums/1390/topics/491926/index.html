              <p>During your online pre-enlistment documentation, you will be prompted to
               book a medical screening appointment. The screening will determine your
               medical fitness, which impacts the type of basic training and vocations
               you can be assigned to. A psychometric test will also be conducted on 
              the same day. You can only <a href="http://www.ns.sg/nsp/web/esvcs/mindef/nsreg/medical-app">book, amend or cancel your first medical screening</a> during the National Service registration online exercise. Note that you
               can only change your appointment date once during this period. If you 
              are unable to change your appointment, please <a href="https://www.cmpb.gov.sg/about-us/contact-us/">contact us</a>.</p>

              <p>You will be required to sit for a computer-based psychometric test on
               the same day you attend your medical screening. This test is conducted 
              at the Vocational Assessment Centre (VAC) in CMPB and usually takes 
              about 1.5 hours to complete.</p>
              <p>The psychometric test scores are used
               to place servicemen in vocations or appointments where their abilities 
              can be best used to maximise our limited manpower. Your test scores will
               be used as one of the factors in decisions subsequently, including 
              assignment to a vocation and selection for leadership courses. You 
              should put in as much effort as possible to do the tests well and 
              accurately.</p>
              <h1><strong>What the tests are like</strong></h1>
              <p>The 
              psychometric test is designed to measure aptitude in a range of domains 
              such as reasoning, technical and mental-spatial abilities. It is 
              delivered on a computerised adaptive testing system, which means that 
              the test adapts to your ability level. The computer software selects 
              questions that are suitable for you based on your responses to earlier 
              questions. You will not be able to review or change your answers once 
              you have submitted an answer to a question.</p>
              <p>You can download the file if you want to attempt some of our sample test questions.</p>

              <p>There are six stations in the medical screening process and they will
               take about 2.5 hours to complete. Should there be any abnormalities 
              detected as you go through the respective stations, you may be asked to 
              go for a further medical review.</p>
              <p>You will be medically graded in 
              accordance with the Singapore Armed Forces Medical Classification 
              Guidelines and assigned a Physical Employment Status (PES). Your PES is 
              one of the considerations to determine your deployment during your 
              full-time National Service. You will be able to check your definitive 
              PES on the <a href="http://www.ns.sg/nsp/web/esvcs/mindef/medical/referral-system">NS Portal</a> if you are not required to attend any further medical review in a month’s time.</p>

              BMT</span></strong><br> This 9-week programme trains combat-fit recruits in the basic
              military skills to prepare them for advanced vocational training.
              The programme includes weapon training with the SAR 21 rifle which
              will teach recruits technical handling and marksmanship skills; a
              Battle Inoculation Course that simulates a real battlefield; a
              Field Camp which develops basic survival skills; progressive
              training to complete a 24-km route march which builds combat
              fitness and endurance; and hand grenade training.<br> <em><span style="font: inherit;">For those who fail to achieve the

              BMT</span></strong><br> As evidence has shown that obese recruits are able to achieve
              optimum fitness levels and weight loss in about 19 weeks, the new
              BMT programme for recruits with Body Mass Index (BMI) scores
              exceeding 27.0 will be 19 weeks. This BMT programme is designed to
              help obese recruits improve their physical fitness progressively
              while equipping them with basic soldiering skills and
              knowledge.</p>

              programme. The new 9-week PES B2 BMT programme will be conducted
              for recruits who are medically fit for deployment in selected
              combat and combat support vocations, such as signal operators,
              combat medics and naval system operators. These recruits will be
              given a new medical classification of PES B2, in place of the
              existing PES C1 classification. This is to ensure that the medical
              classification of our soldiers is consistent with their deployment.
              The new 9-week programme will include customised physical training,
              as well as basic combat training to prepare them for their combat
              and combat support roles.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES C

              training to prepare them for combat service support vocations, such
              as service medic, and those related to logistics and
              administration.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES E
              BMT</span></strong><br> The 4-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES E recruits. This

              Education, SAF core values, regimentation and discipline to prepare
              recruits for combat service support vocations.</p>
