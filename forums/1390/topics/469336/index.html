              <p>Hi.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm currently a 16 year Old, American/Singapore Dual Citizen</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I left Singapore when I was 6 months and moved to the UK and returned in late 2011 at the age of 14. I  have only ever studied under the UK system and still study under the system and thus have never had a local education.</p>
              <p>I only ever planned on living in Singapore until I finished my A Levels, so before I go off to University and also planned on revoking my Singapore Citizenship.</p>
              <p>To add to this I am also a homosexual, and thus not eligible I presume for standard NS.</p>
              <p>As I have read I believe it is far too late for me to revoke without having to do NS and I feel that it  has caused a certain disruption to my plans to leave to studay in America for University.</p>
              <p>I would like to know where I stand in terms of having to do NS, What I would be doing in NS and What purpose I would have doing it since it has really upset me that I most likely won't be able to start my education in Uni on time.</p>
              <p>Since my situation is rather strange I haven't been able to get any sort of information elsewhere about a case like mine so any assistance would be wonderful.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank You</p>

              <p>While recognizing the existence of <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1753.html">dual nationality</a>,
               the U.S. Government does not encourage it as a matter of policy because
               of the problems it may cause. Dual nationality may hamper efforts by 
              the U.S. Government to provide diplomatic and consular protection to 
              individuals overseas.  When a U.S. citizen is in the other country of 
              their dual nationality, that country has a predominant claim on the 
              person.  A foreign country might claim you as a citizen of that country 
              if (a) you were born there; (b) your parent or parents (and sometimes 
              grandparents) are or were citizens of that country or (c) you are a 
              naturalized U.S. citizen but are still considered a citizen under that 
              country’s laws.  (The oath you take when you are naturalized as a U.S. 
              citizen (<a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/get-cfr.cgi?TITLE=8&amp;PART=337&amp;SECTION=1&amp;TYPE=TEXT">8 CFR 337.1</a>)
               doesn’t mean the foreign country does not still regard you as a citizen
               of that country.)  Public inquiries about the citizenship laws of other
               countries should be directed to the embassy or consulate of that 
              country in the United States.  <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-4140.html">8 U.S.C. 1185(b)</a> (Section 215(b) INA) and <a href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=3c1bc943f003a0dfdce7af7585dcba6a;rgn=div5;view=text;node=22%3A1.0.1.6.35;idno=22;cc=ecfr">22 CFR 53.1</a> require that U.S. citizens exit and enter the United States on a U.S. passport, with certain limited exceptions (<a href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=3c1bc943f003a0dfdce7af7585dcba6a;rgn=div5;view=text;node=22%3A1.0.1.6.35;idno=22;cc=ecfr">22 CFR 53.2</a>).</p>
              <p>Under Singaporean law, an individual who automatically acquires 
              Singaporean citizenship at birth retains that status even after 
              acquiring U.S. citizenship. Singapore does not recognize dual 
              nationality beyond the age of 21. </p>
              <p>If you wish to renounce your U.S. citizenship, please send an
               email with your full name, date, place of birth, U.S. passport number

              <p>A
               U.S. citizen who is a resident or citizen of a foreign country may be 
              subject to compulsory military service in that country.
                                      Although the United States recognizes the 
              problems that may be caused by such foreign military service, there is 
              little that
                                      we can do to prevent it since each sovereign 
              country has the right to enact its own laws on military service and 
              apply them
                                      as it sees fit to its citizens and residents.</p>
              <p>Military
               service by U.S. citizens may cause problems in the conduct of our 
              foreign relations since such service may involve
                                      U.S. citizens in hostilities against countries 
              with which we are at peace. For this reason, U.S. citizens facing the 
              possibility
                                      of foreign military service should do what is 
              legally possible to avoid such service.</p>
              <p>Federal statutes long in force prohibit certain aspects of foreign military service originating within the United States.
                                      The current laws are set forth in Section 958-960 of Title 18 of the United States Code. In <strong><em>Wiborg v. U.S.</em></strong> , 163 U.S. 632 (1896), the Supreme Court endorsed a lower court ruling 
              that it was not a crime under U.S. law for an individual
                                      to go abroad for the purpose of enlisting in a 
              foreign army; however, when someone has been recruited or hired in he 
              United
                                      States, a violation may have occurred. The 
              prosecution of persons who have violated 18 U.S.C. 958-960 is the 
              responsibility
                                      of the Department of Justice.</p>
              <p>Although a person's enlistment in the armed forces of a foreign country may not constitute a violation of U.S. law, it could
                                      subject him or her to Section 349(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001481----000-.html">8 U.S.C. 1481(a)(3)</a>]
               which provides for loss of U.S. nationality if an American voluntarily 
              and with the intention of relinquishing U.S. citizenship
                                      enters or serves in foreign armed forces engaged
               in hostilities against the United States or serves in the armed forces 
              of
                                      any foreign country as a commissioned or 
              non-commissioned officer.</p>
              <p>Military
               service in foreign countries, however, usually does not cause loss of 
              citizenship since an intention to relinquish
                                      citizenship normally is lacking.  In 
              adjudicating loss of nationality cases, the Department has established 
              an administrative
                                      presumption that a person serving in the armed 
              forces of a foreign state <strong>not</strong> engaged in hostilities against the United States does <strong>not</strong> have the intention to  relinquish citizenship.  On the other hand, 
              voluntary service in the armed forces of a state engaged
                                      in hostilities against the United States could 
              be viewed as indicative of an intention to relinquish U.S. citizenship.</p>
              <p>Pursuant
               to Section 351(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, a person who 
              served in foreign armed forces while under
                                      the age of eighteen is not considered subject to
               the provisions of Section 349(a)(3) if, within six months of attaining 
              the
                                      age of eighteen, he or she asserts a claim to 
              United States citizenship in the manner prescribed by the Secretary of 
              State.</p>

              <p><span class="bodytext">
              </span></p><p>SINGAPORE - Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, the Minister for Information,
               Communication and the Arts, has refuted online speculation that his son
               will not serve National Service (NS).</p>
              <p>Dr Yaacob's 16-year-old son carries dual citizenship in Singapore and
               the United States. He was issued US citizenship as his mother is an 
              American citizen by birth.</p>
              <p>The issue of his son's citizenship was made public when a leaked US 
              diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks identified the minister's two 
              children as US citizens.</p>
              <p>It then made its way into online forums where some netizens 
              speculated that Dr Yaacob's son will not serve NS. Other netizens called
               for Dr Yaacob to clarify the matter.</p>
              <p>Dr Yaacob's press secretary confirmed yesterday that the minister's son will serve NS just as his father did.</p>
              <p><strong>What the cable said:</strong></p>
              <p>"Yaacob Ibrahim has been Minister of Environment and Water Resources 
              since 2004, following two years as Minister of Community Development and
               Sports. In 2002, he was appointed Minister-in-Charge of Muslim Affairs.</p>
              <p>"He was first elected to parliament in 1997 and was quickly promoted 
              to the sub-cabinet position of Parliamentary Secretary at the Ministry 
              of Communications in 1998.</p>
              <p>"In December 2004, he was selected Vice Chairman of the People's Action Party's policy-making Central Executive Committee.</p>
              <p>"Since his college days, Yaacob has been very involved in Singapore's
               Muslim organizations. He was a youth member of the Muslim Missionary 
              Society (Jamiyah) and is a long-time volunteer at MENDAKI (the leading 
              Malay/Muslim education self-help group linked to the government).</p>
              <p>"He was also actively involved with the Islamic Religious Council of 
              Singapore (MUIS), serving on its council from 1992-1996. As 
              Minister-in-Charge of Muslim Affairs, he has encouraged community 
              organizations to specialize and avoid duplication of services. He has 
              also been given a role in Singapore's outreach effort to the Middle 
              East.</p>
              <p>"In 2004, he led two business delegations to the United Arab 
              Emirates, Qatar, and Egypt. While in Egypt, he met with Singaporeans 
              studying at Al-Azhar University, as part of the government's efforts to 
              ensure that its citizens studying in the Middle East keep Islamic 
              teachings in a Singapore context.</p>
              <p>"Several contacts have asserted that, since his hajj in February 
              2004, Yaacob has become less of an integrationist. These contacts said 
              he has come to believe that there were two distinct spheres in 
              Singaporean society: public and private.</p>
              <p>"While he envisioned that Singaporeans of all races would continue to
               interact in the public sphere in areas of common interest, they could 
              choose to limit their private interactions to people of the same race 
              and religion.</p>
              <p>"Dr. Yaacob was born in Singapore on October 3, 1955, the fourth of nine children of a minor civil servant.</p>
              <p>"All of his siblings have excelled as professionals. His eldest 
              brother was the first Malay chosen as a Presidential scholar and a 
              younger sister is political editor for the Straits Times.</p>
              <p>"He graduated from the University of Singapore with a Civil 
              Engineering degree in 1980. He obtained a scholarship to do his Ph.D. at
               Stanford University.</p>
              <p>"He graduated in 1989 and worked subsequently as a Post-Doctoral 
              Fellow at Cornell University. His wife is an American citizen who grew 
              up in Puerto Rico.</p>
              <p>"Yaacob told emboff that he has a more open-minded interpretation of 
              the Koran and said his wife converted to Islam to satisfy the 
              conservative standards of Singapore. They have two children, both 
              American citizens, and they travel to the U.S. frequently to visit his 
              wife's family."</p>

              <p><a class="mw-redirect" title="Dual citizenship" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_citizenship">Dual citizenship</a> is generally not recognised in Singapore, but is possible up to the age of 22.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_nationality_law#cite_note-7"></a></sup> Such dual citizens may have acquired citizenship by birth in a foreign 
              country, from a foreign citizen parent, or by naturalisation. 
              Singaporean citizens who acquire citizenship of a foreign country after 
              the age of 18 may lose Singaporean citizenship.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_nationality_law#cite_note-8"></a></sup> Foreigners who naturalise as Singaporean citizens are required to renounce all foreign citizenships.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_nationality_law#cite_note-9"></a></sup> Minors who are dual or multiple citizens by birth on foreign soil, by 
              descent from foreign parents or by naturalisation are required to 
              renounce all foreign citizenships by the age of 22 or may lose their 
              Singaporean citizenship.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_nationality_law#cite_note-10"></a></sup></p>
              <p>The prohibition of dual citizenship is a contentious issue in 
              Singapore. As the economy becomes more globalized and Singaporeans more 
              mobile, many Singaporeans have acquired foreign citizenships and 
              reluctantly renounced their Singaporean citizenship even though they may
               feel a strong emotional attachment to Singapore. Immigrants who have 
              been resident in Singapore for long periods and qualify for Singaporean 
              citizenship may be reluctant to become naturalized citizens as it would 
              mean giving up the citizenship of their native countries. Those who are 
              dual citizens at birth may find it unjust that they are denied their 
              birthright to citizenship of other countries where they were born or 
              that of their parents. Male dual citizens are also not allowed to 
              renounce Singaporean citizenship after the age of 11 and before 
              attaining majority at the age of 21, such that they have to serve 
              National Service at the age of 18 for a country to whom <a title="Allegiance" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegiance">allegiance</a> they may almost immediately abjure.</p>
              <p>The government's rationale for not allowing dual citizenship is that 
              Singapore is a young and vulnerable nation which cannot afford to allow 
              its citizens multiple allegiances which may be compromised in times of 
              national crisis. Citizens without a second citizenship may feel 
              aggrieved if dual citizens enjoy the benefits of citizenship during 
              periods of wealth but leave the country in trying times.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_nationality_law#cite_note-11"></a></sup> Nevertheless, the government is open to the possibility of allowing 
              dual citizenship if local and global circumstances demand so.</p>
              <p>Male Singaporeans cannot renounce citizenship until completing national service.</p>

              <p>Each year, a small number of people are convicted for their
              failure to enlist or refusal to be conscripted. Most of them were

              court-martialled and sentenced to three years' imprisonment, but
              they are usually held in a low-security detention facility and
              separated from other conscription offenders. The government does
              not consider <a title="Conscientious objector" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector">conscientious objection</a> to be a legal

               controls are necessary to ensure that NS-liable males who have gone

              responsibilities.<br><br><strong>Will young males aged 13 to 16.5 who fail to apply for an exit permit be sentenced to imprisonment?</strong><br><br>The
               penalty for exit permit offences of young males aged 13 to 16.5 will be
               a fine of up to $2,000, with no custodial sentences. They will however 
              be subjected to harsher penalties should they continue to breach of the 
              Enlistment Act after age 16.5.<br><br>Males above 16.5 years who travel 
              and remain overseas without applying for an exit permit would have 
              committed an offence under the Enlistment Act. They will be liable upon 
              conviction to a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not 
              exceeding 3 years or both.<br></span></p>
