              <p>to made4forum,</p>
              <p>ya wont be running anymore in singapore.u will  be released or become a clerk.for more information see your medical officer n ask him.your case is very serious with operation n broken bones.most broken bones end up as a clerk.remember to see your medical officer for paperwork which is important in army.</p>
              <p>when u book into camp....see yer medical officer before the saturday runs out.....the army medical officer will always give u a continuation or extension of the MC on the spot until u meet up witth the civilian bone specialist.but with the bone  operation it would take u like many months before u can even walk properly again.</p>
              <p>next u take your precious mc and show it to your platoon commander and he will want a photocopy of it for admin purpose.your PC will then decide to ask his CO whats the next posting for you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>high chances u wont even be allowed to walk or run anymore in any army camp.medical officer will get in trouble if he dpnt give u MC extension.medical officer will send u to a specialist and the bone specialist will say your ns future will be as good as a holiday camp.</p>

              <p>dun werry,</p>
              <p>most cases,,,,the mo will arrange for u to meet up with civilian bone specialist with appointment letter issued by him.</p>
              <p>then there would be an evaluation ....x-rays.....etc etc,,,,,,if your mo is friendly he will tell u whats your future in ns......</p>
              <p>most cases they wont want to "babysit" anyone....how u goto  toilet in wheelchair???the encik carrying u and stuff with u being in wheelchair???most logically they would send u back home so yer mom could look after u or something.</p>
              <p>its up to chief trainer,CO and medical officer from rsults obtained from civilian bone specialist...........but so far i have never seen anyone in wheelchair being in any army camp.</p>
              <p>remeber if u are in a wheelchair.....put sunshades and drink lemonade from a glass with a lil tiny umbrella.everyone at camp would make noise...</p>
              <p>and then volunteer to go up botak hill still ina wheelchair but insist someone carry u up hill instead.....they would throw u out of tekong and ask u stay at home.staying in camp in yer condition is rather odd.u should be recovering in some army hospital for months after the operation.....but if u think army food is da best and free,,,then by all means eat and recover....if they have free  internet then.........</p>

              <p>If you can't move about much, you will just rot in the bunk, unless your commanders are the really nasty ones. Of course, if they are the really, really nice ones, like Terminator said, you could possibly end up back home.</p>
              <p>No one can tell exactly what will your vocation be, but clerk is quite a safe bet.</p>
              <p>As for recoursing, it will depend on what PES you get downgraded to.</p>
              <p>Your last question will be better answered by someone with more medical knowledge.</p>
