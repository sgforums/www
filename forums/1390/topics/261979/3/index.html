If i report to mo, what will the mo do? put u on oot ooc? or simply give u painkillers and carry on the training? Previously didn't went for any specialist cause the cost like **** expensive being seeing those clinic gps who keep saying eat pain killers. 1 told me my problem cannot be cure unless i do physiotherapy but since he is a gp i doubt the mo will take concern of his words.

            <div class='col-md body'>but what am i suppose to do lan lan do the training till i suffer a serious injury to my back then need to go A&amp;E or what? Its really not worth it to permanent injured yourself when serving NS. Although they say serve 2 years then f*** off but serve 2 years then rest of your life kena this kind of pain..... i can't sleep when i consider the consequences man. Imagine no more playing sports no more running no more physical activities. confirm got a lot of ppl genging 1 but to be considered as genging then refuse to downgrade or excuse me seems a bit too tough for me.<br><br>BTW i am serious in doubt about how they post ppl. I got tons of frens who very garang then want chiong sua but never kena command school but stuff like life guard MP which are more relax vocations then they complain to me that i kena guards not them. Then i got frens who fail ippt but go guards to endure the tough physical training which i think they can barely make through. A bit wierd heh not considering how u fare during BMT but based on the computer test u did during cmpb which will determine your vocation after pop</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by equlus84:<br><strong>Ok this one is for Guards, moderators, delete the parts you feel might have breached OPSEC.<br><br>[b]Q: What is GCC?</strong><br><br>A: GCC, also known as Guards conversion course, is a rite to get the Khaki beret. Basically, there are GCC for men, specs, officers. These GCC differs from each other as they caters for the needs and operation demands of men, specs, officers. Thus topics emphasis may differ for the 3 grps.<br><br><strong>Q: How long is GCC?</strong><br><br>A: GCC's length is dependent on commitment of the battalion eg. in NDP or any other events. If there is NDP, it is usually 1+ month, if not then around 2.5 to 3 months. If there is NDP, things can get a little cramp up, if not is at an acceptable pace.<br><br><strong>Q: From what I read eg.commercials, urban legends, Guards/GCC very siong leh, machiam like confirm will die...... is it true?</strong><br><br>A: The probability of one dying during GCC is definitely lesser than the probability you get hit by a vehicle. The author was once also frighten, petrified, confused when he received his posting orders many yrs old. But after some time he got used to life inside...... and yes, he is alive and kicking. Just remember that most of the GCC components needs more of team work rather than physical stuff. Of course, you need to be fit, but rest assure, training is safe and progressive. Just like  harry potter movie. Remember to be like Harry, sincere, hardworking and modest. Dun be like Hermione(act smart), Ron(hopelessly blur), Draco melfor(Guai lan).<br><br><strong>Q: Oh, I almost forgot, what are Guards anyway?</strong><br><br>A: Well, this question the author have been also pondering it for very long. In theory, Guards are supposed to be heli-borne infantry, that are inserted into enemy terrain to capture a vantage point crucial for gaining a tactical advantage. Being more strike oriented but Guards do not fight in small clandestine units. Be expected to do a little more walking as you may not see the tonners so frequently, as tonners can only move in unless an axis is secured. We are structured very much like the infantry and the author himself at times do not see any difference between GDS and INF.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Hopelessly blur one is Neville lah. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I doubt the basic core topics taught in GCC will defer that much from batches to batches. So I think " 72km march" is nothing more than a hearsay thing.<br>GDS are divided into heli-ops and sea-ops battalions. Eg. 3GDS during my time is a heli-borne battalion.

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a trooper from Guards too. During ur Guards conversion (actually it's called AIT - advanced infantry training- for men), book outs usually on sat afternoons 'cos like BMT, got fixed training programme so sometimes not enuff time, so take up saturdays. After AIT, it'll be back to friday bookouts.<br><br>Since you're from BMTC, try ur best to get into support coy if ur commanders ask u. 'cos what happened to me was that ppl from BMTC will go into the rifle coy (ABC) for AIT, then post out to Support if they're chosen.  Support life is much better 'cos got much less outfield than rifle coy. Rifle coy must go for platoon then coy training then battalion training.  Support coy mostly go for battalion trainings only.  In support coy, there's Scout, ATGM, Pioneer, mortar, signals.  You get to go for the weapons/vocation courses (except signals), and some of these courses can be quite slack. Some platoons are vehicle bound too.<br><br>Dun worry abt mixing with the monos, they're quite ok if u dun guai lan and respect them as lao jiaos.  Chiong sua with them and they'll respect you.  Dun chao keng too much.  And dun worry abt physical toughness, i was from obese bmt coy but still get guards tab and khaki in the end, so it's all in the mind.
