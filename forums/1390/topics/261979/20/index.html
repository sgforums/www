              <p>Hello eveyone!</p>
              <p>I went for my VA on the 28th of july this year and I just
              received my posting online. Turns out i'm being assigned to Special
              Operation Tactics Centre. And my enlistment date is on the
              05-Feb-2010.</p>
              <p>I'm guessing this is Commando camp? Yes? No?</p>
              <p>I have a question though. I live in the north in Sembawang. The
              last time I travelled down it took me almost 2hrs. Does anyone have
              a shorter route in mind? I'm travelling by bus and mrt.</p>
              <p>P.s I'm okay with the distance, just that I dont mind a shorter
              route if anybody has any opinions.</p>
              <p>Thank you! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>By when? Hmm i'm not too sure about that.</p>
              <p>The big picture now is that there are 2 groups of people.</p>
              <p>The first group being friends who received their posting online, along with the letter, to enter SOTAC. Yes they are from the enhanced batch.</p>
              <p>The second group being friends who have YET to receive any news, ie no letter, no online reference given from:</p>

              <p>Haha to quote the seniors, "fitness can be trained".</p>
              <p>I'm not sure what are the exact figures from ptp batch and enhanced batch. One thing's for sure, when I went for my VA, my detail IC told me his intake was about 270 plus I believe. While it is 250 is usually the case, CMPB will choose more for the initial enlistment because the ooc rate is really high.</p>
              <p>Enlistees are chosen based on recommendation given by the Commando who interviewed you. After which CMPB<strong> will decide</strong> who are the final 250+ to be enlisted into SOTAC.</p>
              <p>What I was told was that it is<strong> </strong>the people of CMPB who make the <strong>final decision</strong>. Therefore even if you have performed well during the VA ie Interview, physical + psycho motor excercises and the IQ test, you <strong>might</strong> not make the cut.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless I believe if you're PES A, with a clean family background, plus you did well for the IQ test taken during the first medical checkup, you're likely to be selected for the final enlistment.</p>
              <p>Hope this helps!</p>

              <p>Haha I wouldn't say that "I love to go into commandos". I feel really privileged to be selected instead.</p>
              <p>I mean, you hear and read about stories of the people who have been through it all, and you just can't help but to really respect them. These were young men, just like you and me, who had families. Sure, they could have easily given up halfway and decide to take the easy way out, but instead chose to risk it all to gain the distinction of being a full fledged commando.</p>
              <p>Now that I'm given a chance to go through the same journey, I feel a sense of responsible to learn more about them, to try my best to meet expectations and to try my best to honour the tradition and the red beret.</p>
              <p>So ya, not love, but really, privileged. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Hmm cdos.boyz, I think you might have misunderstood me.</p>
              <p>As mentioned in my earlier post, the mindset that I bear is really to do justice and to honour the beret, <strong>not</strong> because I want recognition or people to know that I'm a commando.</p>
              <p>I
              believe that if I i'm entering the course just for the sake of getting
              the beret or to gain the respect of my peers, I probably <strong>will not</strong> make it through the first 3 months.</p>
              <p>I
              believe what matters most is to really understand the history and
              tradition behind the beret, to know that so many people have selflessly
              given themselves to the beret.</p>
              <p>You know, I'll be lying if I
              said i'm not afraid of sustaining a long term injury. I have a bad knee
              and an injured back. I may even be the first recruit to be OOC to be
              honest.</p>
              <p>But injuries are really inevitable if you think about it, big or small, you can't really run from it.</p>
              <p>That
              being said, I think it's really more important to go through the course
              not for the sake of getting the beret, but really to understand and
              respect what the seniors have been through, to appreciate the rigour,
              and to hopefully have the aptitude to earn the mark of a commando.</p>
              <p>I
              believe there's really so much more to it than acquiring the beret for
              respect. I say that because when I listen to stories shared by ex
              commandos (local or foreign), they don't really care about how nice the
              berets look on their heads nor the amount respect they get from people
              simply because they are commandos. But really, what has stuck with them
              most, was the blood, sweat and tears that they have shed in their time,
              and how ordinary men, like you and me, would unconditionally sacrifice
              themselves in times of war and terror, just so their love ones would be
              able sleep peacefully in the night.</p>
              <p>I mean, what do you say to that really? Personally I cannot be more thankful enough for such men who risk their lives for the safety of ours.</p>

              <p>haha oh no spaghetti you misunderstood me too.. i don't mean it that way.. i am just asking how u feel about that thought that is in my mind. haha well yeap really its a honour to be in the commandos. if i am really given a chance to be one, i will too be like you and go through all the tough obstacles to push myself to my best of my ability.</p>
              <p>Well as of now i don't think i have that honour to be one as i have yet to receive my posting. Do i still have chance to be in the commandos ?</p>
              <p>Seriously i would rather be in the commandos than to be in the naval diving unit.</p>
