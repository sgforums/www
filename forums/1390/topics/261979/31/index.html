              <p>Yes, you are right. I do chamber dive in the past only, I dont wet dive.</p>
              <p>And you have not read carefully on what I post again. Did I say you can immediately teach diving after you past out from NDU, no, you have to "apply for" .. read again. Besides, your cost does not include the medical checkout, boat rental, gear purchase/rental, plus alot of stuff, so it is not as simple as you think. That sunnto watch is already not cheap, and so is that diving camera. </p>

              <p>Back pay is a 1 time lump sum of, I would say, appreciated money
              payable to CDOs for what they had gone thru after they had passed
              out as CDO fighter. During my time, it was ~$2K. Does current CDOs
              still get it? Need to ask the current CDOs then.</p>
              <p>Cant understand wht u meant by "Only cdo from the leader section
              be selected from OCS?" I can only say...only those outstanding

              my 7Aug, 3.10pm and 8Aug, 3.37pm mails. Pls go thru
              them slowly again. In short, other CDOs who do not go to CSLC will
              go to Vocation Training (VT) phase for their individual expertise

              <p>My estimated costing for the open water certification covers the theory classes, pool sessions, course materials, equipment rental, the 5 open water dives in malaysia (its cheaper if you choose to do your open water dives off pulau hantu), and the c-card. You don't pay anything additional up to that point.</p>
              <p>and as far as I know, you don't get a free dive computer or underwater camera for completing ndu training either. And a dive computer is one of those nice to have but not essential items.  ditto for the camera.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>The divemaster or dive control specialist course will cost a lot more than that, and being a navy diver does not allow you to skip this stage. Typically people take anywhere from 3 to 6 months to complete this course. You can then go get yourself certified as an instructor.</p>
              <p>Now, if the NDU guy decides that recreational diving is not for him, he can also get himself trained as a commercial diver and get paid doing underwater maintainence, salvage and emergency response. The training path for this is completely different as well.</p>
              <p>Surviving NDU training definitely gives you a huge advantage over others but it doesn't allow you to actually skip any steps.</p>
              <p>oh, and don't try blowing any more smoke up my ass, I am commenting on the recreational diving portion of your bullshit only because I am a recreational diver and trained together with some ex-NDU guys for my dive control specialist certification<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Hi Ssk,</p>
              <p>I presume you were talking abt what chances of CDO recruits being at least a CDO 3SG? That will be around 30-50 out of 250.</p>
              <p>If you are a CDO recruit, you will breed and raise there till you become a CDO fighter. Not possible to go out of Hendon and take SCS be a 3SG. SCS trains infantry operation, not CDO operation. Morever, we have our own CSLC, remember?</p>
              <p>All CDOs must go thru VT. That was why I mentioned earlier, CDO BMT--&gt;BCT--&gt;VT--BAC--&gt;Fighter.</p>
              <p>And I doubt VT training equate to entering SISPEC and attaining the rank of 3rd sgt. So far, never heard of  that.</p>

              <p>Back pay is a 1 time lump sum of, I would say, appreciated money
                  payable to CDOs for what they had gone thru after they had passed
                  out as CDO fighter. During my time, it was ~$2K. Does current CDOs
                  still get it? Need to ask the current CDOs then.</p>

              <p>Just to expand on this, the back pay comprises of vocational pay for each month leading up to the day that you receive your red beret.  In my time (and I believe H&amp;G's as well), this was $150 per month Commando vocational pay, over and above what another NSF of equal rank would earn.  You would only qualify for this vocational pay once you have actually been fully assigned to the vocation, i.e. you have earned you beret and can therefore be counted as a Commando.</p>
              <p>In my company, there were two hard-luck cases.  Both guys had fractured their vertebrae during BCT, and by the time they had been diagnosed as such by the MO, they had gutted out the remaining six months of their training and earned the beret.  Unfortunately, both guys received their diagnoses and were downgraded on the same day (less than a week after we got our berets), so not only did they lose the red beret, they didn't receive their back pay either.</p>

              <p>As a Commando, you will have one of the following vocations:</p>
              <p>- leader (officer or 3SG)<br>- weapons man (in my company the weapons men on the GPMGs or SAWs were section leaders)<br>- demolitions man<br>- signaller<br>- medic<br>- sniper</p>
              <p>Back in my day you could also be sent for training to be part of the 84mm mortar platoon, although my understanding is that these days it's been replaced by the Milan platoon.</p>
              <p>In terms of rank, the leaders will all be 3SGs while some of these leaders will go to OCS.  The remaining men will be corporals.</p>

              <p>Things such as paramedic, abseiling, driving, motor riding .. and more, it is necessary for re-certification and on-job training. Although, it post some advantages but one still to go for some recourses. </p>
