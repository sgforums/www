              <p>Hi everyone, I'm seriously new and I have some questions pertaining to the commandos. Before that, a great thank you to the veterans such as Gedanken, jus-tea, H&amp;G, Bryann816a and many others.

              <p>I'm currently in J2 and attended the VA for commando in July; I expect that the enlistment letter will come in the coming few weeks. But I'm currently assuming that I will be enlisted, considering how during the interview at Hendon the interviewer assured me of "high chances" of getting in, and I tried to show a positive attitude during the assessment. Ok, to keep things terse:</p>
              <p>1) From the little knowledge I have of the Commando Section Leaders' Course (CSLC), it tends to use physical benchmarks to evaluate the suitability of a potential section leader. The Physical Readiness Test, the Commando Tasks test, and some obstacle course after a 10km run are part of this course, am I right? I vaguely remember some comment in this thread along the lines of: "Section leaders not selected for physical fitness but more of leadership qualities". However this conflicts with what I know. Could someone who has undergone this course or have some RELIABLE knowledge on it share with me their specific experiences and possibly what the trainers look out for in a potential leader? Is it really about physical ability or about the attitude, or both? </p>
              <p>2) While this may sound ambitious, I personally hope to become a commando officer. From what I've heard, only the best of the best that pass the CSLC have a chance to be chosen. Sorry if this query may overlap with the one above, but is there any big difference between a commando officer and a normal graduand of the CSLC? I mean what is the extra effort/quality that is required to be exerted to rise up to that rank? From the interview at Hendon, the interviewer reassured me that getting into OCS was "very easy", and all that was required for a good chance was "a gold in your IPPT". While I would not want to question the credibility of the information of regulars, is that a white lie to tell me that I can get into OCS as long as I have to will to get in? I mean my intuition tells me that the road to a Commando Officer is not easy at all. I have to be pragmatic.</p>
              <p>3) This may sound ignorant. This question is about the physical rigour of Commando BMT (for a start). I would like to start training up for the BMT but I'm slightly lost as to which direction to head towards. Is it more about endurance or strength? When I go the gym I like to do heavy weights with low reps, but according to my friend, that is practically useless. It seems that I'm better off doing pushups and stuff that have high reps and lower intensity. And lots of running. But from what I know the weight of the equipment is also no joke either. So how should I train? 3 days of weights and 3 days of cardio a week, is that enough?</p>
              <p>Thanks for reading through the above and I hope you all can answer my questions.Thank you!</p>

              <p>Hi Starke,</p>
              <p>1) Need to understand what does a Leader do? Esp a CDO leader. I was no leader trained (although I had the chance to go then :) ) but I can assure you CDO Leader needs to have both leadership qualities and highest physical fitness. If you want to go CSLC, you will have to prove your worth during your BMT and BCT phase.</p>
              <p>2) Good to have the ambition to become a CDO officer. From my time, only top 15% from CSLC will be selected for OCS course. After which, will also need to pass thru CDO Officer Conversion Course (COCC). Of course, Officers will go thru more stuffs than Leaders. As for OCS, i think so long you possesses leadership quality, can do attitude, fit and plus you attained mininum educational qualification status, u should be able to get in.</p>
              <p>3) Before I join CDO, I went to the Career exhibition to ask for more info on CDO BMT. 1 regular just told me, do more chin ups, push ups and try to run at least 5km within 25mins. During my time, CPLs are required to run 5km SOC within 30-35mins and Leaders to run 10km SOC within 1hr but I guess they had changed to 3km and 5km respectively now. But still, do run more.</p>

              Hi guys,
              
              I've went for the commando VA on the 27th July this year. Earlier on I logged onto NS portal and checked on the enlistment date and it says it's not confirmed yet it's between December 2011 to May 2012. I don't know if I'm in the commandos or not but I really hope I can get into the formation. I would like to ask from those who went for the VA does the NS portal says the same thing? Or I'm just not posted to commando? Do help me out by clarifying this with me. Thanks and have a good day ahead.

              <p>Don't worry bro, I also went for the commando VA, but mine was on the 25th July... And yeah, i'm pondering about my enlistment too as I've not received a letter yet. Likewise the NS portal indicates that my enlistment date hasn't been confirmed yet.</p>
              <p>So yeah, we're both in the same boat. Either both not selected, or still awaiting confirmation i guess. Hope we both get in though =) would be great.</p>
              <p>where're you from by the way? JC? or Poly batch?</p>

              Oh okay I see, thanks, I'm from the JC batch by the way. I guess we'll have to wait till next week or maybe later for the results then.

              <p>Hi Starke,</p>
              <p>1) Need to understand what does a Leader do? Esp a CDO leader. I was no leader trained (although I had the chance to go then :) ) but I can assure you CDO Leader needs to have both leadership qualities and highest physical fitness. If you want to go CSLC, you will have to prove your worth during your BMT and BCT phase.</p>
              <p>2) Good to have the ambition to become a CDO officer. From my time, only top 15% from CSLC will be selected for OCS course. After which, will also need to pass thru CDO Officer Conversion Course (COCC). Of course, Officers will go thru more stuffs than Leaders. As for OCS, i think so long you possesses leadership quality, can do attitude, fit and plus you attained mininum educational qualification status, u should be able to get in.</p>
              <p>3) Before I join CDO, I went to the Career exhibition to ask for more info on CDO BMT. 1 regular just told me, do more chin ups, push ups and try to run at least 5km within 25mins. During my time, CPLs are required to run 5km SOC within 30-35mins and Leaders to run 10km SOC within 1hr but I guess they had changed to 3km and 5km respectively now. But still, do run more.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hi H&amp;G,</p>
              <p>Thanks for your advice! Now I have something more concrete to work towards. Am running 3 days a week now, though I alternate between long distance and HIIT. I think it's difficult to gauge how to build up leadership qualities for now, so I guess I'll focus more on keeping fit. With a national exam around the corner, there's also a little struggle in priorities as well. </p>
              <p>Sorry, but just to clarify, doesn't SOC refer to the standard obstacle course? Or is it an abbreviation for something else?</p>
              <p>Anyway hi Pathfinder07, Reavengeance and singaporeFTW, I also attended the VA on the 27th July. If we all get selected, then I look forward to meeting you guys too. I have been worrying slightly about receiving the letter these few days and my NS Portal account also shows nothing, so let's just be patient. I believe, like singaporeFTW mentioned, there're still weeks until the letter may come. </p>
              <p>Argh back to A levels. </p>
              <p>Cheers,</p>

                  Congrats for getting into commandos, I guess there's no news for myself yet, its the same thing enlistment between december 2011 and may 2012. Hopefully things will be different tomorrow morning. Oh ya did the NS portal say the same thing as what the letter of enlistment stated? Please clarify this with me cause what I've heard from some is that they received the letter but NS portal states that their enlistment is between december 2011 to May 2012.

              <p>For those who will get to CDOs soon, do not get too happy or excited as there will be many challenges waiting for u to clear 1 by 1. Do get prepared mentally and physically. Do more runnings, push ups, chin ups and steps climbing else you will find yourself constantly under tremendous stress when u lag behind. Once you lag, you will suffer with even more trainings where others can sit back and relax. Remembered 1 incident, 1 of my mate failed SOC, the trainers forced him to clear SOC with a car tyre placed on his neck.</p>
              <p>For those who will not get to CDOs, fret not. Your contributions to all other units are equally valuable. All units are unique and important.</p>
