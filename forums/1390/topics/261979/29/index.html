              <p>this is utter bullshit. When do you remember this from? It's was
              NEVER like that. Never during my father's time 30 over years ago

              <p>roughly 50 over go to CSLC and out of which about 20 over go to
              OCS. CDO is mono intake NOT because it's a non leadership intake.
              The CDO intake is mono because we choose our own people, ALL CDO
              nsf are mono intake. officers and specs are all chosen from
              the 250 odd. There are no exceptions (unless you're a regular
              convert). Lokey please stop feeding them wrong info</p>

              <p>And I remember this line from a current air steward who is a pes B posted to a commando storemen 3 years ago. That why I say "if I remember correctly".</p>
              <p>Perhaps if you misunderstood my posting also.  Unlike Navy, if you can pass IPPT, 
              you will get OFF tomolo already. It is different world out there.</p>
              <p>And I do remember that the CDO wants to achieve 100% gold, certainly they will not let you off easy if you failed or just pass.</p>
              <p>And unlike Tekong, more than 50% of the platoon go SISPEC, including my cousin who go in BSLC 2 weeks ago and he is just an average performer. He is really good at dancing though.</p>

              <p>I know that the commando trained their own spec and officer. I am saying that it is not a non-leadership batch. You dont get what I meant.I still say it is a non-leadership batch because it is a mono-intake. There are non-leadership batch in Tekong also, do you know that? And it is not a mono-intake.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, you still have not answered the poster, about is it a requirement to get gold for ippt to get to CSLC? </p>
              <p>And also explain how did the 1CDO get their Best Unit from the SAF Best Unit Competition?</p>

              <p>I know what you are saying. You are speaking as in CDO guy's shoes. But if you are a poly student who are picking to go to volunteer for VA for CDO, and has the intention of becoming a SGT. You may want to evaluate if you are fit enough to get gold for IPPT(CDO standard) in a CDO unit, vs being in Tekong aiming for SGT. The ultimate goal is just being a SGT only.Of course, being a SGT in CDO is the best outcome, so that what is the probability of getting in. What is his chances of meeting the standard of getting gold to get in.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">just some questions for those who recently went for the CDO VA:</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">1)Does the Physical Test component include a run?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">2)Did the medical test section require blood sampling again (even
              after they did it at CMPB)?</p>

              <p> Mhmm I would think that its somewhat tougher as you really have to stand out among everyone else. CDO already is an elite force and so you essentially have to be the 'elite of the elite' (simply put). The road might be tough and draining but I'm sure the reward's worth it (and no I dont necessarily mean monetary- its also about satisfaction etc)</p>

               is attained through promotion in the specialist rank?<br> - Enlistee from commando unit can be neither specialist nor officer 
              right? That is, they can only attain their ranks of private up to

              <p>-What are the chances of being officer in

               chances too? (:</p>
              <p>-what are the mono-intake units in SAF other than commando? by mentioning non-leadership, it means they can only go up the rank in the enlistee ranks? not specialist etc?</p>
              <p>- What's a regular convert? can we apply to be regulars before or during our NSF period?

              </p><p>idk. during my times in my unit, those who got ippt silver can get a 
              day off; those who failed dont have. To ME, isnt those who failed is 
              being punished for not doing well and on top of that they have "extra" 
              training? (My friend did mentioned that he had to stay back to get the 
              "gold" for the off in CDO.)</p>
              <p>On another setting during my NS days, my boss did recommend day 
              off for the CDO boys that had joined in our exercise.  The CDO 
              commander said "it is their duty." And ok, I was thinking, I was not in concern, it was their unit
               affairs anyway...  </p>
              <p>As I say, it is their unit affair anyway. Please noted that I am only addressing to people who are still "civilian". I dont think there is anything wrong with it, it is an open forum here. Those people who are serious in confining their CDO affairs, they should go to NS.sg. There is a unit forum there.   </p>
