              <p>Hi all, </p>
              <p>A newbie here.</p>
              <p>First would like to thank the proper CDOs with experience for the input here. Especially debuking the Lokey and Termin-whatever fella's outlandish claims. I have, yes read the 48 pages. Anyway, onto the main reason for my being here.</p>
              <p>I've got a CDO VA on the 28th (this thursday), but frankly, I'm lost on the fastest way to get there (I live near the Bukit Panjang Interchange), any tips on the fastest way to get there would be much appreciated. </p>
              <p>From the many pages, I understand that:</p>
              <p>1) Glasses are no barrier to CDO</p>
              <p>2) Only son matters not</p>
              <p>3) Attitude is the important ideal</p>
              <p>4) Fitness will be trained (regardless of CDO/NDU/BMTC training)</p>
              <p>5) PES A/B is a must</p>
              <p>6) Academic capability is not a major influence on outcome</p>
              <p>Please feel free to correct me or add on. I'm sure I missed something.</p>
              <p>I also want to ask, I'm generally a very reserved person and not very confident, but I do want to turn this around by joining the CDOs (and one up my father - Tri-services officer, or something along those lines). The question here is, is the lack of confidence in me going to ruin my chances? Considering I do want to turn this around. Not to mention I am terrified of failure (Failing this would reduce my self-esteem further) and that this is something like a boyhood dream of sorts. Anything apart from "Stay focused" and "try your best" sort of advice would be much appreciated :) I'm not asking for a definitive "YES doing this will get you in" answer, just one that would heighten my chances of entering. Please advise!</p>

              <p>After you get into CDO, ORD from CDO. Then you can look back and see if my "outlandish claims" is true or false.People here are sharing their experiences with newbies, we dont earn any money, we dont get anything from doing this.</p>
              <p>Getting into any military training would build up your confidence and self-esteem. So how does joining CDO make it better or worse? It does not.</p>
              <p>If you are really good, you should go to Tekong BMT, get into OCS, pass out from OCS and get posted to mindef HQ or CMPB. </p>

              <p>Can't believe you read all of that, but that's about right.  
              Ultimately, if you do get the job, adapting to change is a big part of 
              the job (and these changes can take place quite rapidly), so just stay 
              sharp and maintain awareness of what's going on so that you can respond 
              appropriately.  I understand it's not what you want to hear, but that's 
              the way it is. </p>
              <p>After all this time, selection's still a bit of a black art in my 
              book, but in broad terms, the instructors will be looking for guys who:</p>
              <p>1) can work as part of a team<br> 2) can keep their heads when the proverbial hits the fan</p>
              <p>Conversely, big turn-offs are:</p>
              <p>1) hero types - these arseholes will wreck missions and get their team killed for personal glory<br> 2) the panicky sort - the last thing they want is someone setting off a charge or firing a GPMG at the wrong time</p>

              <p>Hmm.  No beret of any colour is going to help you with that, I'm

              <p>Being reserved in itself is not an issue - some of the most

              confidence.  Confidence is an odd thing - it tends to be retrospective 
              in nature in that the more things you try doing (and succeed at), the 
              more confidence you gain, but then again, the more confident you are, 
              the more things you'll try.</p>
              <p>As for fear of failure, well, if at first you don't succeed, Airborne's not for you. <img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> Seriously, though, to borrow a phrase from one of our cousins, Who 
              Dares Wins - you'll be helped along by the military environment's 
              directive nature, so for most part following and executing instructions 
              will get the lion's share of the job done.  The only action you can 
              really perform wrong is no action at all.</p>

              <p>Go to the VA, choose 1st choice for CDO. When interviewed with CDO officers, just be sincere. I remembered I told that CDO officer I want to parachute from plane for free. The rest is up to them. In the end, that officer became my 1st OC.</p>
              <p>If indeed you are selected, pls start to do more running and swimming. U will find them very very useful, trust me.</p>

              <p>You are an expired outdated NSF commando who went to hide overseas to escape your IPPT and ICT as a commando. Why dont you come back to Singapore? It must be either your degree is worthless and unrecognised in Singapore or you find Singapore unworthy to return to. </p>
              <p>Since you are no longer staying in Singapore for so many years, why are you so bothered about the affairs of Singapore? You dont have your home and property in Singapore now. Your loyalty to Singapore is even questionable, so dont even talk about NS in Singapore. Go to your Aus forum and chat there. That is where you belong now.</p>
              <p>Since you are so rich, educated and married, as you have claimed in the past. Why dont you give birth to children? It can only be you are a gay or impotent. Dont give that crap that you enjoyed freedom.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do know that this FAQ is about the elite units. So!? The fact that you have put up over the years that in this forum show that you are neither here or there. And it is clearly show what commando training has done you. You have become "siao". People can dig up all the past posts that you have posted and much of these are nonsense and unconstructive since jul' 03. Go and find your identity of who you really are. Cure your brain before you find fault in others. </p>

              <p>But if you are so interested to be a CDO, be persistent, make a visit or call to CMPB to make a formal appeal. Anything can happens from now till your BMT in Nov. According to Suay Templar, there is a CDO VA on 28th, this thurs, go visit and make appeal there, why not?</p>
              <p>CDO prefers positive attitude enlistees.</p>

              overseas to escape your IPPT and ICT as a commando. Why dont you
              come back to Singapore? It must be either your degree is worthless
              and unrecognised in Singapore or you find Singapore unworthy to
              return to. </p>
              <p>Since you are no longer staying in Singapore for so many years,
              why are you so bothered about the affairs of Singapore? You dont
              have your home and property in Singapore now. Your loyalty to
              Singapore is even questionable, so dont even talk about NS in
              Singapore. Go to your Aus forum and chat there. That is where you
              belong now.</p>
              <p>Since you are so rich, educated and married, as you have claimed
              in the past. Why dont you give birth to children? It can only be
              you are a gay or impotent. Dont give that crap that you enjoyed
              freedom.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do know that this FAQ is about the elite units. So!? The fact
              that you have put up over the years that in this forum show that
              you are neither here or there. And it is clearly show what commando
              training has done you. You have become "siao". People can dig up
              all the past posts that you have posted and much of these are
              nonsense and unconstructive since jul' 03. Go and find your
              identity of who you really are. Cure your brain before you find
              fault in others. </p>

              <p>Which one is bullshitting?  Why you, of course - even the kids can see that now. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>You didn't seem to get it the first time, so I'll say it again.  The title of this thread is:</p>
              <h1>Guards / Commandos / Rangers / NDU FAQ</h1>
              <p>You're not  Guardsman.<br> You're not a Commando.<br> You're not a Ranger.<br> You're not a Diver.</p>
              <p>You come in here, trying to impress the unaware with bullshit references to things that you have absolutely no firsthand experience of, and then you try to throw smoke to cover your horrible trail of fetid bullshit with even more fetid irrelevancies.  Which brings me to another previously-mentioned fact that so evident in this thread that it's an inescapable conclusion to kids:</p>
              <h1>You're a liar and a hypocrite.</h1>
              <p>Despite all of your bullshit about not being Singaporean (which I still am, by the way), this December, as with every other, I'll be shooting the breeze at the CDO officers' mess with my fellow <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>real</strong></span> Commandos, while you couldn't get past the front gate without the guard commander demanding to know who the fuck you are.  You know why?</p>
              <p>Because I'm a Commando and you're a pathetic wannabe.  It's that simple.</p>
              <p>By the way, of course I don't give birth to children.  Unlike you, i don't pretend to be a lady. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Alright. Finally logged in.</p>
              <p>Anyway, my CDO VA was moved to Tuesday 26/7/2011. Went for it. Come out a bit... "dejected" to say the least. Mainly because the Interviewer said I was "very average" in the tone that sounded as if I won't make it. But no matter, always a hope :)</p>
              <p>Anyway, my observations of the day were:</p>
              <p>1) Keep an open mind and be adaptable to whatever your IC says.</p>
              <p>2) Do best to sound confident at interview (not Garang/Seow On)</p>
              <p>3) When in any doubt, ASK. All personnel on-site were very friendly and helpful </p>
              <p>4) For physical, psychomotor tests and psychology tests. Do your best, don't skip or stop halfway. Psychomotor tests really require focus, don't lose it.</p>
              <p>5) Keep open minded.</p>
              <p>I'm no expert, but this was what I tried to do and pulled through (or sort of). Admittedly, I wish I could have taken more time at the interview as I did not say everything I wanted to. But no matter, whats done is done, I'll see in a few months whether or not I've got the red or green letter. </p>
              <p>I think its also important to at least try to communicate with the other selected people there, I did and I think it could have paid off (new friends and the like). But as should be noted, I have only experienced the CDO VA, not actually anything yet, so these are just some experiences I've had at Hendon today :)</p>
              <p>P.S Your Detail IC will likely psycho you to get in to CDO :)</p>
              <p>Edit: P.P.S Before I forget, @ H&amp;G, the CDO VA on the 28th was moved to 29th. I rearranged for mine to be on the 26th :) Yeah, Tried my best to be sincere about it. I mentioned that I enjoy my voluntary work experiences (with others) in Cambodia and that the outgoing part of the CDO really appealed to me (didn't have time to mention much else sadly). The Captain who interviewed me was honestly, very friendly, asked me a lot of things I never expected to answer in 5mins. I almost didn't want to leave the place!</p>

              <p>according to Suay, the VA had changed to 29th instead of 28th. Pls go appeal if you want it. Remember, if u want the red beret, u need to earn it, no short cut.</p>

              <p>Nope. After you express interest to sign on (assuming you will), your PC wil assess you base on your physical, mental ,leadership skills etc. Basically its the same stuff. If you express interest halfway through your trainee phrase, aka any part of your training, they will treat you like a 'regular' meaning you will be aimed more often, summoned for extra PT after the normal PT and take up more leadership roles like being the IC more frequently. Oh ya, you will given 'special' treatment during hellweek too so ya goodluck!</p>
