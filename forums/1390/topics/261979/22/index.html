              <p>You have to meet the vocation requirement before you can choose to sign on with them. Signing on does not allow you to bypass the basic requirements for any vocation.</p>

              <p>Hi everyone</p>
              <p>Could anyone give me some pointers to make it through the commando course without sustaining any major injuries, ie to have a broken limb?</p>
              <p>For example I was told by the commandos during my VA that majority of the accidents happen during BAC. As a result I was adviced to wear knee and ankle guards before the jumps to minimize the risk of any long term injury to my legs.</p>
              <p>May I know what are the other activities that would incur heavy injuries as well?</p>
              <p>Also, may I know out of the average 40% who OOC-ed, how many cases are genuine? This is to hopefully give me a better understanding of the rigour of the course.</p>
              <p>Thank you!</p>
              <p>P.s. Is the current batch required to do the SOC in FBO?</p>

              <p>the only way to get into CDO is if you are not in it is by signing on. No two ways about it.</p>
              <p>To sign on, you must first pass the Special Operations Force Selection which will be announced every quarters, you must check with your unit or for your case, your manpower side whether if there is any selection going. They are planning to ramp it up to 4 selections per year.</p>
              <p>The selection is 3 weeks long, and the last week will be a mini rite of passage, or formerly known as "hell week". Why I call it mini because if you are able to clear the selection and enter as their training company, your last week of your training phase rite of passage is way way beyond your imagination.</p>
              <p>For starters, once you cleared the SOF selection, you will now be put into either SOTF/CDO or SOTF/NDU. If you choose to be a commando regular, I think nowadays they won't want but you can still try. Another way is if you can ask to be a battalion regular, ie, less pay than Commando Regular Force or SOF, more sai kang but you still wear the red beret and still fight ATEC with 1st Cdo Bn.</p>
              <p>If your highest qualifications is Olevels, you can still try, but how successful depends on your results, whether if your results can still go for further education, if they deem okay, then sure by all means try for the Selection.</p>
              <p>In Army, everything must try, if never try, you'll never know whether if you ever stand a chance.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>It's Special Force qualification course now=) Don't think there's SOF selection anymore. U get selected into SOTF or CRF (for army) during this course. The SFQC is a 9mth course.</p>

              <p>i felt a tinge of excitement when i arrived for the cdo va ytd morning. looking at all the faces, i finally appreciated why "fitness can be trained". Almost more than half of the unit detail i was in could barely do the standard req for pushups situps and pullups. However, i noticed that all of them have the physique to deal with intense exercises.</p>
              <p>This thus means that even though if you are pes A and have a good physique, you may not even get selected for CDO. it's pretty sad to see that some people in the detail overlooked CDO as their preferred choice of combat vocation, i mean there are alot more people wanting to enlist as commando yet they do not get the chance. but i still tried my best to convince them to make use of the opportunity</p>

              <p>They can be posted to anywhere. The SAF manpower system works in mysterious and mythical ways. Or maybe that they will anyhow send the guys anywhere.</p>
              <p>It also depends as to whether these soldiers are still combat fit, earmarked for recourse. There are many factors to considers. Most important of all is where there is vacancy.</p>
              <p>So no use speculating. Just wait for the posting. And since they are very low ranking, its not like they can fight the posting. </p>

              <p>I would say towards the ending part of BMT will your fate be sealed. Usually recommendations from your commanders do influence where you go. Just do your best and let the rest worry for itself. (Not sure, need the rest to comment. I wasn't trained in Tekong)</p>
              <p>If you do not start your BMT at Pasir Ris Camp, there is NO WAY you can end up as a commando during your NSF term. Signing on might get you in..</p>
