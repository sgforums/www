              <p>For my company it was an intake of 200.  Prior to enlistment, one guy broke his leg and the other got chicken pox (at least that's the way I heard it), so we started with 198.  We lost most of our guys during BMT and BCT, but quite a few guys got downgraded later from early injuries - the only reason why they stuck arround so long was because the specialists took too long to diagnose them.</p>

              <p>I just hope that Singapore doesn't get on the bad side of any country holding nuclear weapons, man. Imagine one day, they don't like us, they press one button, and that's it. Kudos to Singapore for employing soft power while keeping a robust deterrence force ^^</p>

              yea i'm in the middle of exams myself, i rekon a break is well deserved. i wish i could get at least 2 months off before i get enlisted. you know just so i can catch up with friends, chill and into the right mindset before i get in.

              <p>I expect that the two Commando fighter classes still apply,
                  although I'm happy for those who have more recently served to
                  correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
              <p>Upon earning the red beret, you become a Class II Commando
                  fighter, which means that you have the very basic skills to get the
                  job done.  Over the remainder of your service, you undergo
                  further training (e.g. LRRP and unarmed combat), and having
                  completed this additonal training, you will be propmoted to Class I
                  - this does not involve getting a higher rank, but the pay will
                  increase slightly.</p>
              <p>The OOC rate in my company by the time we got the beret was
                  about 50% or slightly more.  If memory serves me correctly, we
                  started with 198 recruits, had 12 men join us from SAFINCOS during
                  the BCT phase, and somewhere around 95 men got the beret, two of
                  whom lost it within a week because of cracked vertebrae.</p>

              true but still i wouldnt say we're up there in the asia pacific region. that honour goes to south korea whom many underestimate. they've got soldiers who fight with great conviction-'freedom' is their goal. that is reason enough to respect them. well that and the youtube videos of their endless skillset. haha i have an friend who's a regular in the australian army. a combat veteran, served in iraq and afganistan and he wasnt too impressed when i said i was going to enlist next year. apparently there isnt much 'honour' per say in joining our 'small army'. i quote ,' well maybe in south asia you're the big guns but on a global scale nobodies heard of singapore winning any battles, your record's clean as. because you're not a combat proven, mate do your self some justice and join the australian forces, they're known for being tough as nails, or if you're really into making a difference, try the SASR they're the best regiment in australia; highly respected its an army within itself. and maybe even greatly romanticised compared to our counterparts the british SAS'. 
              
              well that sorta confused and angered me at first, but theres some truth to it even within the arrogance. we are truely an island nation, 24km by 24 km and within this space we have close to 5 million residents and 300000 reserve soldiers. it really struck me how small we are compared to our neighbouring countries. lol i drive 18 km to go to my gym. when i make a round trip it struck me that i have crossed the width of singapore. its great that people know we exist on the map. but will our armed forces ever be recognised on a global scale as competent fighting force whom have comparable combat skills to that of their allies. and perhaps the equipment to match? haha in todays modern world i'd give our army 8/10 for attitude. i've seen how my friends have become more patriotic just because they experience and understand what our ancestors fought for. its truely a great sight, but in todays world i think we just dont have the resources to be a global powerhouse. i really hope we can change that image, of being a country thats vunerable just due to the lack of space and resources, to a more modern and secure country whom if needed will provide assistance towards just causes like freedom. haha i truely salute the soldier sacrifices through whom we've gotten our own freedom, i still think its fucked up that we dont see the world as it is today, civil/border wars in india, china, africa. we really do take our freedom for granted

              <p>Well, I'd really question if your mate from the ADF was a combat soldier or a REMF.  I've known a number of Australian SAS and US Special Forces troops, plus SEALs, Rangers and Recon Marines, and they've all been professional enough to know that if they've done the job right, they wouldn't have to fire a shot.  The "my dick's bigger because I've gone to war" mentality very much belongs to the wannabes.</p>
              <p>The guys I've mentioned above are old-school combat proven soldiers who've seen action in places like Vietnam, Panama and the Gulf, and they've got absolutely no problem with our standards (caveat here being that their views pertain specifically to 1CDO).  There's no doubt that the ADF's carried itself well in a wide range of battlefields, but you can tell your mate that I said he's a fucking infant.  After all, is he going to drive his car into a brick wall so he can romantasise about the airbags? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Nah, no offence taken.  The point I'm making here is that the pros know that superficial heroics are neither meaningful nor welcome.  As you've rightly concluded, the only thing your mate has managed to demonstrate is his ignorance.  I'll add inadequacy to his litany of sins; after all, if you've got it, you don't have to get into histrionics.</p>
              <p>very kindly provided us with a working example of this inadequacy.  All this talk about 1000 push-ups and 20 bullets is starkly in inverse proportion to the talker's feeble inability to pass a simple IPPT.</p>

               lol and all this is coming from the same person who once claimed to be a diver commando, and on top of all an army accountant, knowing prices for army equipment and such.
              
              i learnt online in interweb summer school that one should never fight a 'troll'. a lifeless creature that stalks the interweb looking for forums to camp in and seek attention. its almost like trying to fight cancer by shouting at a cancerous tumor, in a cartoon there would now be a cut scene where the tumor now laughs and grows indefinitely till it explodes, killing the person along with it  . or moreso its like giving crack to a cocaine addict. they feed on the attention to survive. i believe all trolls have a phd's in bullshititis. its the art of spouting half truths, baseless facts and having bad grammar and rebuttal skills which usually compliments the amazing yet weak analogies "just make sure u can shhot straight in yer toilet bowl!".seriously? :S
              
              but i digress, having learnt from past experience that shitman will post and add to his post, almost as if to reinforce his arguement with 7 inches worth of bullshit, due to his significant sense of insecurity. oh and what better way to end than to compliment this with ged's quote "my dick's bigger because I've gone to war" mentality very much belongs to the *wannabes*. as such i will leave the rambling man to muster whatsoevers left of his diginity and shall leave him alone to continue spamming to a non responsive forum.
              
              btw its been great being constantly enlighted on matters of the heart :D its nice to have a clear head sometimes ged. oh and 50$ says he'll use my own rebuttals against me in an attempt to phase me. also out of his lack of creativity that is.

              <p>u need to know stuff...thats what differntiates a wannabe soldier like bryan.....an average soldier n me as one of the finest combat soldier spore has ever met or made.</p>
              <p>if u refuse to believe....try requesting RAAF archive films or SAF films.only  real soldierst know what im talkin about. but for u pud suckers,wannabes and bank robbers u can go talk bout it without ever being the best or selected . u might as well go play computer games. pretend to be the best without werking yer tickets.</p>
              <p>bryan....as a true red blooded soldier...u have no respect from me......because u dun deserve it.until u go to afhghanistan or have proven yerself...go SUCK YER OWN TITS!</p>

              <p>But of course - that's the brain-stem-driven behaviour of hopelessly inept no-accounts.  The prognosis for them is particularly poor given that they're incapable of behaviour modulation or learning, so the only thing we can do (if we deem fit to do anything in the first place) is to either pity them or laugh at them.</p>
