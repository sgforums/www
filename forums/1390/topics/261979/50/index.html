              <p>CDO stands for commando. Wonder if the training is still the same in SOCT, but usually the basic was 9 months, 6 day jumps and 4 night jumps, and you get the red beret at passing out parade...may get posted to other units/cross train, otherwise in 1CDO.  10CDO for reservists. Physically have to be very fit... eg. 2.4km run in 8 minutes.....10km FBO in 50min. Eyesight best with perfect vision. May have to go for IQ test....If really want to learn something in NS, dont opt for officer course (OCT)....you will spend too much time in office.....that's why they are called officers. For the 2.5 years, u will probably learn: unarmed combat, weapons training, IFC, intel, op, com, equipment repair, infiltraion, analysis, strategic planning/design, topo, survival, vehicles and boats, demolition,....etc.....teamwork very important. Boys usually go for cdo, navy seal, sas etc are just for prestige (ie: want others' respect) basically, and that's not the right attitude. Amry training is to improve your chances of survival during adverse conditions, nothing to do with patriotism.  For poly student intake, got to check with others, not sure about this.</p>
              <p>Good luck in NS!</p>

              <p>Hi Pathfinder,</p>
              <p>Well from what i know, JC batch has 2 intakes depending on your napfa. If you get silver and above, should be feb. If fail or bronze, then its is in dec. Since letter should be sent out about two months before enlistment for commando, im sure you can do the maths. If no letter by then then you can either check NS portal or phone up CMPB to check if commando wants you. Goodluck!:)  </p>

              <p><strong>Q: Most important question....What is in
              GCC?</strong><br> <br> A: GCC varies from batches to batches and it is usually up to the
              individual RSM/ CO of the unit to define what the components are in
              the GCC.<br> <br> 1) runs: 5,6,7,8,9,10 KM run with the test runs of 7,9,10 KM. The
              requirement of 10KM run is 60mins for men and 50mins for
              commanders. If I did not remember wrongly there is also a 10KM FBO
              run if I am not wrong.</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt; If I recall correctly during my time it was 10km in 45mins.</p>
              <p><br> <br> 4) Weapons: Like all infantry men, Guardsmen must also learn all
              the weapons used in SAF. SAR-21, M-16, LAW, M203, these section
              weapons will be taught and there will be some live firing.</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt; other than this, we were taught how to use 84 etc</p>
              <p>we were also request to test new weapons at that time</p>
              <p>what other weapons, not for discussion  :)</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><strong>Q: Oh, I almost forgot, what are Guards anyway?</strong><br><br>A: Well, this question the author have been also pondering it for very long. In theory, Guards are supposed to be heli-borne infantry, that are inserted into enemy terrain to capture a vantage point crucial for gaining a tactical advantage. Being more strike oriented but Guards do not fight in small clandestine units. Be expected to do a little more walking as you may not see the tonners so frequently, as tonners can only move in unless an axis is secured. We are structured very much like the infantry and the author himself at times do not see any difference between GDS and INF.</span></p>
              <p>&gt;&gt; I know the answer where the CDO, GDS, INF location and working procedure. However regret to inform you I can't reveal how the whole formation work as this is classified information. Look at it this way, the whole SAF must work as a team. Each of this group in the team have a role to play. Even with the rivalry between the GDS and CDO at the end of the day all must work as a team when the time come. </p>

              <p>My 1st post here, would like to know some stuff regarding NDU. Hope you guys/laojiaos can enlighten me!  :D</p>
              <p>Earlier this year I responded to NDU's VA and did reasonably okay. I passed all the visual/auditory/breathing tests. Physicals were kinda a breeze, 22 pull-ups and 248cm for broadjump. IQ tests were all pretty simple as well. Currently, I'm a PES A.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However I just went for a heart scan a few days back and docs discovered I have mild MVP <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">(Mitral Valve Prolapse), but --- thankfully it is asymptomatic. Only a slight heart clicking sound, but the heart valve could leak</span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: medium;">. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: medium;">Doc said I might be down-PES from A to B, and advised me to not pursue combat units. But then again he added I'm fit for vigorous excercises and recommended OCS instead.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've been pretty fit. NAPFA's always a gold. 2.4km's averaging under 10mins etc, broadjumps above 245cm. On top of that, I'm a regular 10K, 12K and 21K runner. I've had overseas diving experiences and furthermore I'm an active sportsman in my JC.</p>
              <p>IOn top of that, I've not had any experiences with chest pains, palpitations, breathlessness / whatever symptoms those diagnosed with MVP usually have.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm pretty much interested in NDU. But can some kind soul tell me would it still be possible to enter NDU given my status? </p>

              <p>Hi everyone, I'm seriously new and I have some questions pertaining to the commandos. Before that, a great thank you to the veterans such as Gedanken, jus-tea, H&amp;G, Bryann816a and many others. I'm particularly impressed with the unity among the few of you about the experiences shared and the underscoring of the meaning of NS which I, though far from experienced, cognitively agree with. </p>
              <p>I'm currently in J2 and attended the VA for commando in July; I expect that the enlistment letter will come in the coming few weeks. But I'm currently assuming that I will be enlisted, considering how during the interview at Hendon the interviewer assured me of "high chances" of getting in, and I tried to show a positive attitude during the assessment. Ok, to keep things terse:</p>
              <p>1) From the little knowledge I have of the Commando Section Leaders' Course (CSLC), it tends to use physical benchmarks to evaluate the suitability of a potential section leader. The Physical Readiness Test, the Commando Tasks test, and some obstacle course after a 10km run are part of this course, am I right? I vaguely remember some comment in this thread along the lines of: "Section leaders not selected for physical fitness but more of leadership qualities". However this conflicts with what I know. Could someone who has undergone this course or have some RELIABLE knowledge on it share with me their specific experiences and possibly what the trainers look out for in a potential leader? Is it really about physical ability or about the attitude, or both? </p>
              <p>2) While this may sound ambitious, I personally hope to become a commando officer. From what I've heard, only the best of the best that pass the CSLC have a chance to be chosen. Sorry if this query may overlap with the one above, but is there any big difference between a commando officer and a normal graduand of the CSLC? I mean what is the extra effort/quality that is required to be exerted to rise up to that rank? From the interview at Hendon, the interviewer reassured me that getting into OCS was "very easy", and all that was required for a good chance was "a gold in your IPPT". While I would not want to question the credibility of the information of regulars, is that a white lie to tell me that I can get into OCS as long as I have to will to get in? I mean my intuition tells me that the road to a Commando Officer is not easy at all. I have to be pragmatic.</p>
              <p>3) This may sound ignorant. This question is about the physical rigour of Commando BMT (for a start). I would like to start training up for the BMT but I'm slightly lost as to which direction to head towards. Is it more about endurance or strength? When I go the gym I like to do heavy weights with low reps, but according to my friend, that is practically useless. It seems that I'm better off doing pushups and stuff that have high reps and lower intensity. And lots of running. But from what I know the weight of the equipment is also no joke either. So how should I train? 3 days of weights and 3 days of cardio a week, is that enough?</p>
              <p>Thanks for reading through the above and I hope you all can answer my questions.Thank you!</p>
              <p>Cheers,</p>
