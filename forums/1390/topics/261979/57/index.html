              <p>Hi eac,</p>
              <p>Meaning to say that if one fail to get into CSLC in the first round, one can never get into CSLC again or get converted into OCS?</p>
              <p>By the way, is it possible for commandos to cross over to air force pilot trainee after bmt?</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, you are right. </p>
              <p>As each commando fighter trainee goes into his own specialised vocation skills set unique for each platoon section, it takes time to train his skills. So if you do not meet the cut for command school, you will still be trained to be a specialised commando who will also wear the red beret once you pass the commando vocational training. </p>
              <p>For crossover if you sign on, it is on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, please call the 24/7 NS hotline at 1800-3676767 to speak to a customer service officer.</p>

              <p>Hey eac,</p>
              <p>Thanks a lot! But is it possible to join the CSLC again after VT? lol. Like join the next batch...?</p>
              <p>So the crossover is only possible if one signs on... I see.</p>

              <p>It is most highly very <em>unlikely</em> because by then, you will be a trained specialised commando corporal in your platoon section. </p>
              <p>Also, there will not be enough time since by then too, the intake batch will also going to turn operational, preparing for ATEC and then ORD as per schedule.</p>

              Hi, trying to find out if anyone who went for the commando VA has received the letter yet. I went for my commando VA on 22 Jan 2013. I'm in the ptp batch as well but i haven't received any letter yet.
              Just anxious for the result. Cheers.

              <p>The Guards are infantry soldiers who are proficient in
              helicopter operations. All Guardsmen are taught and trained to be
              comfortable working with helicopters. They are proficient in
              Terminal Air Guidance, in the setting up of landing sites as well
              as communicating with the pilots.<br> <br> To ensure that Guardsmen are able to land in any conditions, they
              are taught the normal emplaning and deplaning drills, all Guardsmen
              are able to execute hover-jump, heli-rapelling, and fast-rope down,
              in full battle order.<br> <br> The specialised skills that Guardsmen possess are vital to the SAF
              as they add a new dimension to the modern battlefield. To achieve
              such high standards is not without blood, sweat and tears. The men
              are put through some of the most rigorous training. To be worthy of
              adorning the muchh sought-after 'Guards' shoulder tab and the Khaki
              beret, trainees have to go through the gruelling 'Guards Officers
              Conversion Course' for officers and 'Guards Specialist Conversion
              Course' for specialists.<br> <br> The men go through the 'Guards Advanced Continuation Training'
              (GACT) to earn their mark as Guardsmen. These conversion courses
              push every soldier physically and mentally to the limit and only
              those who qualify will be given the right to be called a
              'Guardsmen'.<br> <br> <strong>Rappelling and Roping</strong><br> In battle, Guardsmen are noted for their rapid deployment of
              troops. Their rapid deployment is by helicopter. Thus, an important
              part of their training has to do with helicopters. This entails not
              only rapid disembarkation techniques but also rappelling, coming
              down from the chopper via long ropes. A nice landing area may not
              always be available, and Guards units may have to rappel straight
              into battle zones, or onto rooftops.<br> <br> The Guards have to master many kinds of rappelling from cliffs and
              buildings. In one method, they come down a cliff head-downwards.
              All this business of jumping off cliffs may sound scary but the
              Guards are used to it such that it is second nature to them.</p>

              <p>To achieve such high standards, trainees are put through some of
              the most rigorous training within the Singapore Armed Forces. To be
              worthy of donning the coveted "Guards" shoulder tab and the Khaki
              <a title="Beret" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beret">beret</a>, trainees have to go through the gruelling
              <em>Guards Officers Conversion Course</em> for officers and
              <em>Guards Specialist Conversion Course</em> for Specialists. The
              enlisted men go through the <em>Guards Advanced Infantry
              Training</em> (GAIT) to earn their mark as Guardsmen.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Guards#cite_note-Guards-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> These conversion courses signify the conversion from regular
              infantry to the elite Guardsmen and push every soldier physically
              and mentally to the limit. Only those who qualify will be given the
              right to be called a "Guardsman", wearing the coveted khaki beret.
              In Dec 2011, the <a title="Ministry of Defence (Singapore)" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_%28Singapore%29">Ministry of Defence
              (Singapore)</a> released a 7-part web series on the Guards
              Conversion Course, titled <a title="Making The Cut: Guards Conversion Course" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_The_Cut:_Guards_Conversion_Course">Making The Cut:
              Guards Conversion Course</a>.</p>
              <p>Part of the conversion requires the soldier to undergo a timed
              12 km fast march, a 2 km coastal swim and an advanced
              obstacle course known as the Guards Assault Course (GAC). The GAC
              is a team course that requires the group of soldiers to swim 50
              meters, to climb a high tower, rappel down a tower and complete a
              5 km run with a standard SAF obstacle course and carry an
              "injured" teammate on a stretcher for the last 1.5 kilometers. The
              entire course is done in full battle order (FBO) with packs packed
              with sandbags to reach the required weight requirement. Guardsmen
              are also required to maintain a strict physical fitness regime
              throughout their careers.</p>
              <p>The Guards are trained to be inserted and extracted from the
              combat zone by <a title="Helicopter" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter">helicopter</a>, hence the term "heliborne". They can
              do this either by rapid disembarkation while the helicopter is
              landing, or by "rappelling" (descending by rope while the
              helicopter hovers) and fast roping straight into battle zones, or
              onto rooftops.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Guards#cite_note-Guards-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> As a nice landing area may not always be available, the Guards have
              to master many kinds of rappelling from cliffs and
              buildings.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Guards#cite_note-Rappelling-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> In one method, they come down a cliff head-downwards. In case they
              are wounded in a leg and cannot use their legs to brace themselves
              against the cliff face, they also learn to come down with their
              backs facing the cliff, and also in a stretcher.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Guards#cite_note-Rappelling-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Another dangerous method, but at times necessary for a fast and
              decisive strike, would be "running" down a cliff. This method is
              known as the "Australian rappel".<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Guards#cite_note-Guards_History-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Guards are also specialised in seaborne assault such as coastal
              hook, which is an offensive manoeuvre initiated by army forces and
              executed by forces embarked in surface water craft using the
              coastal sea or river as an axis of movement, to outflank the enemy
              in order to accomplish the assigned tactical mission.</p>

              <p>These conversion courses signify the conversion from regular
              infantry to the elite Guardsmen and push every soldier physically
              and mentally to the limit.</p>
              <p>Only those who qualify will be given the right to be called a
              "Guardsman", wearing the coveted khaki beret.</p>
              <p>In Dec 2011, the Ministry of Defence (Singapore) released
              <strong>a 7-part web series on the Guards Conversion Course, titled

              <p><em><strong>Making The Cut: Guards Conversion
              Course</strong></em> is a <a title="Singapore" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singaporean</a> <a title="Documentary" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary">documentary</a> released
              in 2011. Filmed at the Bedok Camp. 122 soldiers from all walks of
              life attempt to survive the toughest challenge in 3 weeks to get
              the Guardsman tab. 7 episodes will be released. The first episode
              airs on 28 December 2011 on <a title="Youtube" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youtube">Youtube</a>,
              subsequent episodes were released on Every Thursday, each clip
              lasted for 6 to 8 minutes.</p>
              <p>The series was filmed by Lance Corporal (LCP) Jake Nam, a
              Full-Time National Serviceman from DMC. Mano Mahendran serves as
              narrator of the show.</p>
              <p>To earn the Guardsman tab, all personals must endure this 3
              weeks compulsory training, all 122 personals from all walks of
              life, from a active regular to a NSF's 3SG, although not all will
              survive the training, but the toughest one will then be given the
              final honour and can be a highly-trained specialised troopers who
              are always "Ready to Strike".</p>
              <p>Taking 15,000 quick steps in full battle order that weighs
              almost 30kg is anything but easy. This is just one of the key tasks
              every trainee must pass to go to the next level of training in this
              intensive and tough 3-week Guards Conversion Course. Making the Cut
              looks at 122 full-time national servicemen and regulars from
              various SAF units, coming together for a single purpose, to attain
              the coveted khaki beret and to be part of the Guards family.</p>
              <p>In this first episode, watch how the Guardsmen trainees adapt to
              the high standards of discipline and training required of every
              Guardsman and their introduction to the dreaded 12km fast march.
              And watch how some try and overcome their fear of heights when
              they're introduced to cliff rappelling, every Guardsmen's staple of
              operations.</p>
              <p>They take blisters, abrasions and pain in their strides as they
              race against time to complete the 12km fast march in under 108
              minutes.</p>
              <p>This is their final test. There is no second chance and no room
              for failure.</p>
              <p>Watch how these trainees push themselves hard to pass this test
              of endurance which is one of the key tasks they must complete to
              obtain the coveted Guards tab.</p>
              <p>Also in this episode, the trainees are introduced to tower
              rappelling, a feat not for the faint hearted.</p>
              <p>While some breeze through it, others try hard to overcome their
              fear of heights.</p>
              <p>The strong downwash from the helicopter rotors adds to the
              adrenaline rush.</p>
              <p>There is no margin for error as the Guardsmen trainees conduct
              one last safety check before they rope down from the Super Puma
              helicopter hovering about eight storeys high.</p>
              <p>Check out how the soldiers execute their first helicopter live
              descent.</p>
              <p>As the sun sets, the soldiers look forward to a well-deserved
              night out of Bedok Camp, especially after the rigorous and
              strenuous training.</p>
              <p>Will they get to book out or is there something else in
              store?</p>
              <p>The soldiers emerge from a thick plume of smoke with a cacophony
              of gunfire as they aggressively attempt to take out "enemies" holed
              up in a series of buildings.</p>
              <p>Amid heavy gunfire, smoke grenades and the relentless rain,
              things don't really go according to plan and the soldiers
              desperately try to find their footing to synergise their
              attacks.</p>
              <p>One thing's for sure - they're determined not to repeat the same
              mistakes twice.</p>
              <p>Their bodies tell them to stop but their minds are in overdrive
              as the Guardsmen trainees are given task after task, all to be
              completed within a given time limit. The Rite of Passage pushes the
              limits of every Guardsman trainee’s mental and physical
              endurance.</p>
              <p>Will the soldiers' spirit of camaraderie and their will to
              overcome bring them closer to donning the coveted khaki beret?</p>
              <p>Lasers from the SAR21 assault rifles pierce through the darkness
              like a scene from an ominous science fiction movie. The air is
              filled with the smell of gunpowder and smoke from grenades.</p>
              <p>And amid these, the sweet smell of success, as the Guardsmen
              trainees take out the well-concealed "enemies", one by one, in a
              dilapidated building.</p>
              <p>As the firefight comes to a close, it seems to signal the end of
              their mission. Or is there something more in store?</p>
              <p>There seems to be no end in sight. For these soldiers, it's one
              mission, after another and they haven't slept for over 60 hours.
              And to add to the chaos and confusion, their tasks seem
              insurmountable and almost impossible to achieve.</p>
              <p>With just hours away from the Guards Graduation Ceremony, the
              soldiers put mind over matter and push themselves to their limits
              to make the cut and earn the right to be called Guardsmen.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi guys, I know this has been a repititious question all the time but what are the criterias to enter Commando BMT? I see alot of my non spectacled JC friends entering it instead of my average poly or ITE friends. I understand that they have to go through this Vocational Assessment to see whether they are eligible for it. So I would like to know, what are the criterias, and what should I do to be eligible for it? Any tips or advices? Thanks! </p></div>

              <p>Hey eTan, i dont know about Cdo, but Ndu never set foot in Tekong at all throughout their BMT and CDC phase. Nope their BMT will not be conducted in Tekong, don't worry, the accomodations are great.<br>Enlistees will have a more memorable PoP haha, trust me on that... you won't be getting the normal PoP because you only have your true POP after your CDC phase.. you get a memorable one after BMT too, but trust me.. the CDC one is worth the wait.</p>

              <p><br>our camp r located at sembawang. why we cant conduct at Tekong its very simple.</p>
              <p>during our time, when u enlisted to NDU, most of the batch will not have their BMT first! all men will be posted to NDU and let their instructor whack a few weeks later then they attached to SNT- BMT instructor (some of them are from guards unit). they will take care of those 'Tadpoles' for around 6 weeks and return all of them to our unit again. BMT phase usually is 14-15 weeks, therefore our very owner instructor will handle them for the first 4-5 weeks and last 4-5 weeks (only in between 6 weeks are belong to 'army style' of training).</p>
              <p>i can also share this... during army instructor, its usually MORE RELAX! you can check with any diver during late 80s and 90s..... as, those army instructor usually will treat us much better then our very own instructor. they will tell us.... YOU GUYZ BETTER TAKE CARE!</p>
