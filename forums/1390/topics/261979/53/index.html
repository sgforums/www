              hi james, let me help you breakdown on what to expect. instead of relying on non-cdo/ndu with a loose cannon that canâ€™t seem to keep quiet when neccessary.
              
              yes, va at pasir ris or hendon camp is tentamont to an assessment on whether the formation wants you. contarary to what people like lokey says, no one, has any way of getting anybody, through any means into commandos. now, the assessment is rather simple, you do a series of physical tests ie pull ups, sits up to determine your physical condition. this is followed by many questions assessing your personality/IQ/etc.
              
              The process
              
              cdo bmt is rather similar to the normal one, with of course higher requirements as you are constantly reminded that you are elite soldiers. i believe the soc course has been revised; the currently looks easier that the old one, but commando requirements expect you to do it carrying a gpmg and 2 p-90s. this is the most basic course, as you progress your load increases to full battle order, so will your distance to run. ippt required is cdo silver, and you have to do fine in your individual field craft(outfield). basically you have to pass all. also there will be many activities like iron man challege, ultimate detachment challenge and exercise thunderstorm to turn you from a boy to a soldier. all this in 9 weeks. Sounds like a lot, but it is actually very passable.
              
              after bmt, the batch will split to a few vocations:
              
              Commando section leader course(officers and sergeants)
              
              weaponman(specialised weapons like igla/spike, and snipers)
              
              signallers
              
              medics
              
              demo/boat man(explosive and zodiac boat drivers capable)
              
              these are the basic vocations with a few other special one i will mention later. during this period is called the vocation training. the entire batch will split up to do all these courses, some in different camps around singapore. during this 4 month period, airborne course is also conducted. you will earn your wings here with 5 jumps, 2 with full combat load. with airborne course conducted, vocation training finishes and all men will have a rank of corporal(men) and 3rd sergeant(specialist). top graduates of the leaders course will be presented with their red berets early and sent to OCS to be trained as commando officers.
              
              the next phase, commando basic training(BCT) begins. here you willl be initiated into 1st commando battalion in 2 comapnies to further train with more skills. To complete the course, the 72km march and the red beret presentation awaits you.
              
              I hope this helps.
              
              P.S Lokey, I would advise you not to give out any information that you are not sure of. I am aware that this is an open forum, however, this thread is where potential trainees enquire information pertaining to what they may experience. eg, you have never undertake airborne, so refrain from describing/quoting/advising on the topic. unless you have the relevant experience, first-hand, i hope you do not give out any false hoods. I am still in touch with some of my superiors in hendon and prc, so if your sources are sprouting nonsense, please let me know so i can bring it up to special operations task force command. i am sure they are very interested in your information.
              
              P.P.S i cannot believe any nsmen do not know what does the S branches mean. even my storemen knows this very well. and though this question was put through long ago, a maj/ltc at 36years old is still there in his post because he was badly injured during training, in this case major george, by my time dy commander SOTC.
              
              P.P.P.S Gedanken, my very old senior, did not run off to â€˜escapeâ€™ ICT as you claim. if you noticed, he said he â€˜ROD-edâ€™ which means he completed his reservist of 6-8icts depends on strike/lrrp. any nsmen will know this.
              
              For honour and glory

              <p>Dear rvd89,</p>
              <p>I do not give any information that I am unsure of. If I remember correctly, that guy is interested to sign on as a regular CDO. For applying a job, and internal transfer between mindef departments, you do need referees and recommendations like all other jobs applications in this world. It is not the case of a simple NSF getting in CDO through VA. Please get your story clear first.</p>
              <p>Yes, I do agree that you have relevant experiences in your field. And of course, I will not cross borders. But beware, any informations and claims that you have made on the forum, you become a spokemen of the CDO. Under the mindef directives, you are not supposed to talk about these informations at all. (unless they are already found on the mindef handbook or CDO website.) </p>
              <p>Gedanken cross my line as early as 2009. He immediately go to overseas and stay overseas (till now) after his ORD. So how can this doctor ROD-ed, sia?</p>
              <p>It is precisely, that some1 is not a CDO/NDU can talk about the other units' affairs. Don't you get it! When you are in the unit, you represent the unit, and anything you say become official informations. And you are not supposed to say such things out, as you are told not to do so (on the first day of your BMT).Whereas, people who are not in the unit, can talk anything about it, as anything that he say is unofficial.</p>
              <p>So I suggest you delete your earlier post as it contains too much informations. </p>
              <p> Ps: If you wan to show off your CDO expertise, there is a CLOSED NS portal forum in which you can discuss your official deployment in your CDO thread.</p>

              Dear lokey, to refer back to your reply, let me get things clear.
              
              1)to sign on, you need I go army recruitment centre. And then to joint special force qualification course and selection. No referral is needed. Anyone can sign up to try.
              
              2)any info I have given can be found on Wikipedia. I merely elaborate somewhat. Do not worry for me, I know what is classified and what isn't. I am no spokesman, merely being helpful to new trainees.
              
              3)do you know him very well, to know how many icts he has been through? Been following him?
              
              4)again you do not understand me. Being a commando doesn't make me official spokesperson. Though everything said here is unofficial, any information given should be honest and accurate. I have not revealed any nature of the training, the methods, nor numbers of special forces troops. Some classified info has been leaked in this thread, but not by me.
              
              Let me reiterate: let people who knows what's going on give accurate information. Do not assume nor invent nor lie. Thanks.

              Lokey. As you look back to your comments, do you not understand why you have been scolded and cursed so much, by many different individuals? To say here that I am young and immature, in what way have I shown that? In my way of providing precise information, or my contradiction of your speculations?
              
              I merely state that your 'way' of getting a commando his job is unrealistic. We are based on a meritocratic society, if you have the conditioning to make it as a special force warrior, you can just sign your name and make it through the course. There is absolutely no other way to do it.
              
              I have the right to put off your info if it's is incorrect as it certainly is. I have no intention of making an enemy out of you or anybody. Like I say, I just hope you don't feed people any information you are not absolutely sure of. I am certain questions here are directed to current/nsmen of cdo/ndu. You once claimed gendaken as being obsolete, but he did receive commando training before, yet you hypocritically asked him to not make false claims. I'm sure this raised a few eyebrows.
              
              Try not to make everyone pissed at you yea. It wouldn't hurt to just keep quiet sometimes. Happy new year everyone.

              <p>There is always two types of NSF: Chao Keng and Siao On. From my past posting, you should have realised I belong to the CK group. So dont even talk about recommending some1 for whatever. So use your brain and think before attacking people.</p>
              <p>Obsolete means no longer produced or used; out of date. He WAS a commando, but he IS obsolete. In fact, even I am obsoleted. Therefore, I have not been posting here a long time ago. It is "you" who dig me out.</p>
              <p>Well, you have already pissed me off. If it is incorrect, you can just point it out. Dont falsely accused people, saying that you are wrong, but you never say what is wrong.

              I am now utterly confused. Weren't you the one who said you have the means, above or under the table, to 'push' someone to be a cdo regular? How come it is now I who is recommending people? I definitely do not have the means as I have just said no one does. I honestly do not care what kind of NSF you are, to each his own.
              
              You do know that in times of need, mindef have the authority to pull you back into service even if you have ord-ed or rod-ed? Dont label your kind self as obsolete, your usefulness to the country may not have ended according to the nation. :)
              
              If you are pissed, so be it. I have pointed out that you are incorrect, but you chose to obstinately deny that you were wrong, even to the point of calling me 'young and immature, foolish'. this is not the stance of someone who believes he might be wrong. Lastly I have never accused you; you are definitely wrong. I ord-ed 2 years back. But I have some ns mates who signed on with the force, so I am quite aware with going on.

              <p>Mind you, even though I didn't get called back for ICT, I still pop in to Hendon Camp whenever I'm in town. I keep my finger on the pulse with the 2 Coy boys, quite a few of whom are still in the battalion, so we catch up for beers at Club 33 ever so often.</p>

              Hi gedanken, thanks for clearing up. I understand what you're saying. You belong to the group of 'too expensive to pay for upkeep reservists', like my dad. As long as your pay hits a certain $xx,xxx you'll never get called back.
              
              You might be interested to know that nsmen are no longer required to do refresher jumps as the injury rate is apparently high. My batch is also the last to do lrrp. Henceforth, lrrp missions will be conducted by a certain classified unit.

              I’ll accept Lokey’s claim that his continuous humiliation began in

              need to know about Lokey:<br> <br> 1)    He’s a pathological wannabe, and there’s no
              stopping him from turning up and spouting nonsense in the vain hope
              of impressing school kids with his “knowledge” of what happens at
              Hendon.<br> 2)    When he gets caught out lying once again, he
              will throw all kinds of smoke and try to divert the conversation
              away from the lies that have been highlighted.  He gets
              particularly high-pitched when his attempts at distraction don’t

              this cloak-and-dagger-I’d-tell-you-but-then-I’d-have-to-kill-you

              <p>Gendanken did not get recalled back because of compensation. He went overseas, and hence not recallable for ICT. CDO ICT cycles begin after they ORD. When he came back after 8 years, his gang would have finished all their ICT cycles and ROD. Besides 29 year-old guy is unlikely to be called back for combat vocation, especially elite units. Hence he is left alone. Most other people would have finish their ICT cycles by then (FYI). </p>

              <p>It’s probably different with your two-year term these days, but back when we were serving two-and-a-half years, we RODd/ORDd having to finish an additional two quarterly jumps to get our jump pay for our final year.  We used the old AI2 parachutes which worked great, but I heard they got superceded by a model that wasn’t as good, and that caused a few accidents.</p>

              <p>Oh, do we want a replay of Lokey’s Greatest Hits, then?  Okay.<br><br>How about your obsession about that Ah Beng and your fantasies about – what was that laughable crap? – “biological psychology”: <a href="/forums/12/topics/348606?page=3">http://sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/348606?page=3</a><br><br>Or how about when you “prescribed” coke, chocolate and prayer for depression: <a href="/forums/12/topics/345520">http://sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/345520</a><br><br>That took all of 2 minutes of flipping through your old posts, and bucks to your aunt’s cherry there’s plenty more where that came from, tiger.  You’re full of shit and this forum bears damning evidence of it.</p>

              Wrong again. Studies deferment is a valid reason, even if your batch boys rod-ed, you will join another junior company if liable. 29 years old is not old for cdo reservists, there are 35 year olds walking around in pasir ris camp. I have ord 2+ years back, but my batch has not been called back, so I'll finish my 8 cycles at earliest 32 years old. Most likely his basic salary exceed what mindef pay range for reservist, that is why he is not called back. My father only complete 3 cycles out of his 13 for the same reason.
              
              Kindly elaborate on the compensation. Compensation because of injury or what?

              <p>Gendanken did not get recalled back because of compensation. He
                      went overseas, and hence not recallable for ICT. CDO ICT cycles
                      begin after they ORD. When he came back after 8 years, his gang
                      would have finished all their ICT cycles and ROD. Besides 29
                      year-old guy is unlikely to be called back for combat vocation,
                      especially elite units. Hence he is left alone. Most other people
                      would have finish their ICT cycles by then (FYI). </p>

              No problem James. Glad to be of any help. Dont worry too much, give yourself a chance. Because you have never push yourself hard, thus you do not know how far your body can go. If you really are interested, state it in the interview, you may be given a chance. After all, fitness can indeed be trained, and no mistakes, you will be trained hard.
              
              Lokey, to answer your question, my user was only created 30th dec, so how to answer before that? Lol. And yes, dentists and lawyers, may not earn as much as what people thinks. Even a non-specialised medical doctor is hard pressed to earn a 5-digit salary here. We are not talking about the professions top earners, but the average. My dad was a man in the army (during his time officers and specs are largely regulars). So to mindef and to me, it's a bit idiotic to pay a rifleman $xx,xxx to chiong a 2-3 week ict. Unless you are an officer holding a high post eg CO of a ns battalion.

              <p>I’ll put it into accurate perspective.  Someone popped up with a question, you saw that nobody was around to keep you honest, and you got up to your old bullshit tricks again to see what you could get away with.  Don’t try to spin it into a public-service martyrdom story because that’s just plain sickening.</p>

              <p>Read all the hell you want, but for God’s sake don’t pretend that you can do anything with it like trying to "save" some Ah Beng who was unfortunate to catch your eye.  The fact is that every health practitioner registration system exists to ensure that properly trained PROFESSIONALS use research information responsibly, specifically to prevent untold damage being done by QUACKS like you running off half-cocked. </p>
              <p>It’s ludicrously ironic that you spout all this crap about being civic-minded when you haven’t the foggiest idea how your spewing bullshit is in fact a disservice, if not an outright danger, to the people you’re trying to puff yourself up to.</p>
