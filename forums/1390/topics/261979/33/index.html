              <p>S.s.k. I have replied to you in reference to your previous
              posting. You are talking about if you are pre-selected for NDU
              prior to CDO. My answer is NO, it is random, at THIS stage (after
              the medical screening and other clearances) And that is why we can
              end up with turban wearer and mild myopia case in NDU (at my
              time).</p>
              <p>If you are talking about Regulars, then "Yes". If you can shoot
              they will "recommend" you to CDO, else dive. BUT depends of
              vacancies, they will might "recommend" you to either elite
              departments as a spec.</p>

              <p><br>Think it's smth to do with getting the mask and equipment on? not too sure. tougher PT. longer field camp(dependant on OC), tougher field camp. U book out on SAT. but more pride. Makes it worthwhile if, like me, u love the formation.  You do Basic airborne selection during BMT too.</p>

              <p>For divers, they need to dive with diving googles. So if you dont have perfect eyesight, you are blind with googles on. Although, there are a period of time, when they do trial with lasik for regulars, and also embedded lens, but it does not seems to work out either.</p>
              <p>Actually, if you wear spec for CDO it is also quite troublesome, although they do take in people with mild myopia.</p>
              <p>BMT CDO training.... humm they do SOC with sand can,faster run timing, lots of leopard crawl in the bunk, and many funny stuffs (I will leave the CDO and Ex-CDO) to feed you with details.  In tekong, SOC is optional (I failed SOC but I still POP), IPPT just need to pass (combat 2.4 km run  timing is lower than CDO, guards timing). Basically CDO BMT is more siao and xiong than Tekong.</p>
              <p>The OOC rate of CDO is high.You already have one downgraded personnel here. Another of mine friend also is ex Pes A, ex-runner, but cannt run now due to injury at the knee during one of the para-jump. So take care of yourself.</p>

              <p>That's a bit difficult to answer.  To state the obvious, if you wanted a purely objective view, you'd have to ask someone who's attended or conducted BMT at both Tekong and Hendon (or Pasir Ris as the case may be these days).  As far as I know, nobody on the forum fits this bill.</p>
              <p>Speaking broadly, I'd agree with jus-tea (Against All Odds, bro! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png">).  In Commando BMT, you still learn the basic skills, but you'll be pushed just that little bit further than your peers at Tekong.  All you need to do is keep a level head, make sure you follow instructions, look out for your team more than for yourself and most of all, don't look for the finish line - you're done when your instructor says you're done.</p>

              <p><br>Hi Ssk,</p>
              <p>From start of CDO BMT, you will be constantly reminded that you are a CDO recruit, that is why you are trained to walk faster, run faster and perform better.</p>
              <p>For CDO BMT, wow.. to me..it was like lots of physical trainings + IFC + field camp + rifle PT and of course..the notorious 'Tekan'. Wonder do they still have the famous culture which we called 'Turn out' after BMT?</p>
              <p>Not to scare you, you will be surprised to see thousands of ways that trainers tekan the recruits. So long as you are not singled out or blacklisted, just endure thru together with the rest. You will be fine. Just get mentally and physically prepare before you join CDO.</p>
              <p>And of course when BCT, it has more runs, more marchs, more trainings but less tekan, I felt.</p>

              <p>so the whole logic is:why on earth are you tekaning yer commandoes for??the purpose of tekaning is meant to indoctrine the act of attacking the enemy be it in joe or no joe territory  when enemy approaches or suffer greatly.</p>
              <p>????it kinda defeats tekan principle really when all they end up is being victms of robbery or attacks made not by warriors from another country but by mere farmers n street hoodlums.</p>

              <p>excuse me but arent commandoes suposed to be a rambo or almost that stage??ya not supposed to be regular infantry. u are supposed to be hunters born n retrained again as one..perhaps i should email the commando unit trainer to construct an approximate 90kg steel weight to be dropped on  every commandoes head with a helmet to innoculate even better commandoes.seems like the commandoes need a review of training methods..tekan doesnt build up a man.the sources could be true,,,but most wished it as falsified info.it was true most countries like indonesia and malaysia would have positioned their troops n taunted spores defence might.we aint living with good neighbours. it could be false.</p>
              <p>but if they tekan their men so badly that they will not be able to think n function properly as fighting machines then why bother even having a commando unit??might as well rename them as another guards or SIR unit.</p>
              <p>they try to train you into a rambo but u ended up....................</p>
              <p>whenever a foreign army sees one of the tougher military units of another country.....the foreign general would be shocked just by the mere sight of the special helmet of that special military unit.pretty much like a blowtorch amongst the files n hammer in a workshop.that military unit would be the blowtorch that is able to melt down and wipe out all traces of the other military tools.....remember....u are the military commando..not another standard infantry unit.if yer orders are to wipe out an entire kampong with every man woman child dog n cat....those are yer orders!</p>
              <p>but due to the effects of tekan .......ya cant exactly protect yerselves from a thai rice farmer even.so situation now is what are u goin to do with that thai rice farmer ???let bygones be bygones??baygon is the answer???i expect ex-commandoes to go back to thailand and at least do something.</p>
              <p>thats where u folks cant compete with the us army or other better armies with better warriors.u dont need to hiss n curse like a mad dog all the time  n ekan n call names....thats a sign of....bitchiness and not macho in reality.:)</p>
              <p>in the us army even the us  regular forces in oz actually beat the crap out of aussie airmen who barged into the u.s. peoples taxi and share it.that aussie airman ended up in a coma.so if an aussie potato  farmer barged into the us people taxi n tried sharing it .....think its worse for theaussie potato farmer.thats what commandos should be like....not let some farmer run away and even talk n poke jibes at some unfortunate commando unit.</p>
              <p>really the commandoes need to change in their indoctrination process in getting rambos....if they didnt want rambos they would have been quietly contented with another SIR unit.</p>

Oh sure, so a company sized SF soldiers are to manually kill a farmer? Did your "warrior" instincts tell u of the political unrest that might arise from your "warrior" act? Thai papers would read, "singaporean Commandos kill innocent local farmer" The people would rebel, political ties with SG will be strained. Asean would be strained.</p>
              <p>HAHAHA yes cdo are trained to be rambos. 1 man vs 100 men with 2 GPMGs in hand and we'll never get shot, cookoff or run out of ammo. Yup u're right. hahahahahahhahaha.</p>
              <p>So if the recruits don't listen, move sluggishly or do not perform, do we ask them... nicely? hahaha.</p>
              <p>So are you telling me that GUARDS aren't able to "think n function properly as fighting machines "?</p>
              <p>In a broad sense Hardship, "tekan" and operational training are essential to an elite unit. I don't know where your studies, info etc comes from. A simple example of how the  above produces elites, Rangers. And  if you don't already know, Rangers lead the way.</p>

              <p>treat them like pulau tekong.and yes.....commandos are supposed to fight in the middle of nowhere surrounded by an army against all odds.thats why they trained u so hard.</p>
              <p>guards,SIR all combat units are standard soldiers and do their role equally well as designated.</p>
              <p>it is u the commandos who should outshine.rangers are nort supposed to take down thai rice farmers.</p>
              <p>stop fooling yerself.u know what kinda soldier u got when they cant get hold of a thai farmer who shot,injured yer folks n ran away.so which soldier in spore army will hold up 2 gpmg and fire away???the combat engineers??the guardsman??the airforce pilot???the medic???the recruits at bmt???no,its u the commandos!</p>
              <p>would rather have thai newspapers that says spore commando kills thai farmer than the newspaper that says farmer kills spore commando.</p>
              <p>mindef n isd ??i dunno if they are up to it.they have other more important jobs like feeding  and arming commandos who cant fight n protect themselves.</p>
