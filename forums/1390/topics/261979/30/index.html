              <p>idk. during my times in my unit, those who got ippt silver can get a day off; those who failed dont have. To ME, isnt those who failed is being punished for not doing well and on top of that they have "extra" training? (My friend did mentioned that he had to stay back to get the "gold" for the off in CDO.)</p>
              <p>On another setting during my NS days, my boss did recommend day off for the CDO boys that had joined in our exercise.  The CDO commander said "it is their duty." And ok, I was thinking, I was not in concern, it was their unit affairs anyway...  </p>
              <p>As I say, it is their unit affair anyway. Please noted that I am only addressing to people who are still "civilian". I dont think there is anything wrong with it, it is an open forum here. Those people who are serious in confining their CDO affairs, they should go to NS.sg. There is a unit forum there.   </p>
              <p>Wow... my friend's IC starts with S92 ... . I think ROD personnel should stay retired. lol </p>

              <p>Everything you said was based on your friend this and that..</p>
              <p>As I put to you politely in my previous msg, Ah Boy.....let UNCLE enlighten you ....since you are neither a CDO nor NDU what makes u think that u can make remarks/comments on CDO or NDU? Only those guys who had gone thru it can give appropriate comments to those who really need them.</p>
              <p>As for you, everything u said was all based on assumptions and whatever ur friends said. Go on and ask your CDO friends to read all your comments on this forums and see if they think you are correct. There are many ex CDO/current CDOs here and I am sure that they will not agree with whatever u said here.</p>
              <p>I may be Ex but my experiences in CDO still counts. Ah boy, older CDOs are not as soft as you think. So what if your friend's IC starts from S92? Big deal. Your CDO friend will even respect more for older ex CDO.</p>

              <p>Leave S.S.K. to us. Why do u think we need to put u down? Have you been thinking? Do u really think you worth the trouble for us? It is just plain simple, we do not want others to be misled by your incorrect comments.</p>

              <p>Looked equally weird and funny to me when you said we are trying to put down ppl like YOU who are addressing their questions. I guess all the Ex/CDOs here will have to thank for your help then!!</p>
              <p>Anyway, like wht I said earlier, time will tell.....see how long more will others believe in your so called 'CDO/NDU' story.</p>

That is, they can only attain their ranks of private up to coporal etc?</p>
              <p>-What are the chances of being officer in tekong BMT and commando BMT like? likewise, for specialist, what are its chances too? (:&lt;!-- google_ad_section_end --&gt;</p>

              <p>Hi Ssk,</p>
              <p>I will try to reply you your questions as much as possible as I had already out for quite some time.</p>
              <p>For CDO BMT, it was 2.5mths during my time in Hendon. Duration should not be too far from here.</p>
              <p>To put simply, CDO BMT (Recruit to Pte)--&gt; CDO BCT (Pte to CPL)--&gt; VT--&gt; BAC--&gt; CDO Fighter.</p>
              <p>VT -&gt; Vocation training like Signal, Demolition/Boatman, Sniper, Weaponman, Medic and Section Leader Specialist (SLSC) course. From SLSC, you will passed out as 3SG. Among here, 15-20 will be chosen for OCS.</p>
              <p>Other CDO vocations will remain as CPLs. During my time, we got our CPL after CDO BCT training. Remembered CPL rank was handed to us after a 35km road march ended in Changi beach soaked in sea in middle of night.</p>
              <p>Warrant officer can be obtained if you are a specialist regular. Unlike NCC, no NSF can be Warrant officer for their 2.5yrs stay.</p>
              <p>Not sure abt chances of getting to OCS from Tekong BMT but you can calculate out of 250 recruited in CDO per batch, only 15-20 will get selected for OCS. Volunteer more during your BMT/BCT may help if you want to increase chance of getting into OCS. Ultimately, it is your attitude counts.</p>
              <p>You will need at least a A level cert or Diploma to get into OCS.</p>
              <p>To apply for CDO regular, you can apply before or during your NSF period. I remembered 1 of my mate signed on before entering NSF. No special benefit for him. We went thru same shit. In fact, the instructors whacked him more than us to make sure he has the cut of it. Like wht I said earlier, if you had signed on before or during NSF, plus you have the attitude and relevant cert, you can be selected for OCS. Pls bear in mind, OCS is mainly for Infantry officer. Once passed out from OCS, officers still need to go thru a CDO officer conversion course (COCC) before become a CDO officer.</p>
              <p>Hopefully I had answered most of your enquires.</p>

              <p>Hi Ssk,</p>
              <p>Wouldn't say that is 'Salary'.</p>
              <p>Pay is paid monthly for CDO (or else we really have to eat grass...:))</p>
              <p>Once after you got ur red beret, you will get a lump sum of backpay.</p>
              <p>You will need to get trained in SISPEC or OCS so as to lead your men. And therefore SAF will give you higher rank and pay, sounded logical?</p>

              <p>Yes Rajan...1 tough guy...cant really remember but he was actually marched either 24km or 35km on bare foot.</p>
              <p>Maj Looi was another tough guy..he showed us how he still able to finish his SOC within 8.30mins despite he is much older than most of us. Our jaws all dropped!  I remembered when he had his tour of duty in Brunei, when he saw us there...1st thing he said, "Ar...long time din see CDOs, come..5 mins later, PT kit, warrior PT." See, he missed CDOs so much in Brunei.</p>
              <p>Yes I agreed, I actually like old camp more. Can even see P.Ubin from old 1st coy hill top. Trainers oftenly missed old camp too much that they enjoyed bringing us there to train + tekan. Of course nobody will know what happened there.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/cry.png" alt="cry.png"> Heard that old 1st coy guys will sweat a lot before and after every meal due to the long distance from their bunks to cookhouse in Hendon.</p>

              <p>For other CDO vocations, they will be posted to other camps for other specialised trainings for example, CDO signallers go to Signal camp, CDO medics go to Medical school etc. But after everybody completes their specialise trainings and RTU, we cross trained each other stuffs and that makes CDOs rather unique esp in times of war when casualty occurs as we usually do not have the luxury or time to get replacement unlike in the infantry.

              <p><br> Hi Lokey,</p>
              <p>Leave S.S.K. to us. Why do u think we need to put u down?
              Have you been thinking? Do u really think you worth the trouble for
              us? It is just plain simple, we do not want others to be
              misled by your incorrect comments.</p>
              <p>Weird? I think you are the only weird one here.</p>
              <p>Looked equally weird and funny to me when you said we are
              trying to put down ppl like YOU who
              are addressing their questions. I guess all the
              Ex/CDOs here will have to thank for your help then!!</p>
              <p>Anyway, like wht I said earlier, time will tell.....see
              how long more will others believe in your so called 'CDO/NDU'
              story.</p>

              <p>Back pay is a 1 time lump sum of, I would say, appreciated money payable to CDOs for what they had gone thru after they had passed out as CDO fighter. During my time, it was ~$2K. Does current CDOs still get it? Need to ask the current CDOs then.</p>
              <p>Cant understand wht u meant by "Only cdo from the leader section be selected from OCS?" I can only say...only those outstanding perfomers in CSLC can be selected for OCS.</p>
              <p>Cant understand wht u meant by "What are the chances of cdo being at least a specialist( going to scs)?" Kindly rephase your question and what is SCS?</p>
              <p>For your last question, In fact, I think I had wrote the phases down from CDO BMT till CDO fighter on my 7Aug, 3.10pm and 8Aug, 3.37pm mails. Pls go thru them slowly again. In short, other CDOs who do not go to CSLC will go to Vocation Training (VT) phase for their individual expertise trainings.</p>
