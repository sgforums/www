              <p>$$$ dont come out from yer ass.....its thru hardwerk and high technology that u are unable to comprehend in yer fuck n screw  enviroment.u know it doesnt take much to figure out costing IF U ARE AVERAGELY SMART....BUT U ARE BELOW AVERAGE SMART....u have only enough intteligence to yell n rob folks...thats about all u have from data gathered here..u cant calculate..u cant figure out stuff..u cant even think straight !so what can u do???depend on other peoples hardwerk like a worm for sustenance???SHAME ON U U WORLDS BIGGEST LOSER!</p>
              <p>.which stupid country or person wanna pay $$$$$ for his little 2 year  freeloading on mindef escapade adventures of which he cant pay back to spore in any way .he probably wont even be in spore after ord even!he must think spore is his free playground supplying him with the latest military toys.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>so if he a total foreigner  doesnt get posted to commando unit that he demands and badly wants and ends up as an ordinary grunt....he should shut the fuck up like any smart person...but thing is he never was smart..and never had much balls or initiatives.its simply even a waste of $$$$ posting him to any military unit in spore.not that he is brave or has initiatives from the way he handles a simple thai farmer..</p>
              <p>best he get posted to police force.his muscles would  handle the uneducated and unshaven criminals in spore.im sure he should do great in that job as it takes one potential criminal to know how the other same species of his think like.</p>

              <p>Basic US military training is anywhere from 3-6 months, which translates to ~$4,000 minimum just to pay a single trainee. Add in food, lodging, and equipment at government-contracted rates and that cost easily doubles. That doesn't include any of the support staff necessary to train, equip, or manage the logistics of a group of recruits. No good source for it, but its generally said that each front-line soldier requires eight additional folks to support them... not quite applicable to basic training so call it a really conservative 2:1 ratio of trainee to support staff, tack on the fact that support staff is probably averages at least four years of service, and three months of training a single soldier jumps easily jumps to US$10,000. Once a soldier completes minimum training they're good for... pretty much nothing except wearing the uniform and being able to complete further training. more cost will be expected if selected to train for advanced combat training.<br></p>

              <p>Uh, hi, sorry for interrupting. Wanted to ask a question.</p>
              <p>I went for the commando VA last month. During the eyesight test I forgot to declare that I haven't changed my specs for nearly 2 years, and ended up with a 6/15 and 6/18 for my left and right eye respectively (damn bad). Does that mean my chances of being selected into commando BMT will be greatly diminished? Because I was rather enthusiastic about it...</p>

              <p>Uh, hi, sorry for interrupting. Wanted to ask a question.</p>
              <p>I went for the commando VA last month. During the eyesight test
              I forgot to declare that I haven't changed my specs for nearly 2
              years, and ended up with a 6/15 and 6/18 for my left and right eye
              respectively (damn bad). Does that mean my chances of being
              selected into commando BMT will be greatly diminished? Because I
              was rather enthusiastic about it...</p>
              <p>Thanks!</p>

              <p>Hey just a question.</p>
              <p>As you guys know, there will be many dates for the cdo VA but does students with more 'qualification' be selected for earlier dates? As in the earlier the dates selected for the VA, it shows the level of qualification you have to be a cdo?</p>

              <p>Hi.</p>
              <p>Finished my prep-enlistment medical checkup,and went for my specialist review at cmpb in May 2010. The Specialist was a professor from a hospital outside which i kind of forgotten where,graded me to PES C9L2. But before he ask me to leave,he asked me whether i am interested and keen on being a commando, i didn't think much to it so i just gave a reply "If i can,sure why not". He gave me a smile and i left after that.</p>
              <p>My posting is to Tekong and i was posted to Supply Assistant.So i was wondering if i would to answer that i am keen in trying out ,would i get a chance to go CDO?</p>

              <p>NO. this "thing" is, it is not about you, it is about the MO/specialist. Do you think he would risk his career over your interest? What happen if something happen to you? Then who wants to take the responsibility? Besides, there are many Pes A people around, what make you think you get the chances even if you want to?</p>
