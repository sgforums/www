              be required to go through Vocational Assessment at the Vocational
              Assessment Centre (VAC). This is done using a battery of tests
              called the Manpower Aptitude Assessment System (MAPAS) to assess
              your mental abilities. This is so that we can maximize our limited
              manpower by putting people where their abilities can be best
              used.<br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Your Vocational Assessment scores
              will affect important decisions, which include assignment to a
              vocation and selection to be a commander (Officer,
              Specialist).</em></span><br> <br> Therefore, you should put in as much effort as possible to do the
              tests well and accurately, as this will not only help the nation
              maximize it's limited manpower, but also help us place you into
              vocations that will make good use of your abilities.<br> <br> Click <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ns.sg/cs/content/eServices/mindef/Register%20for%20NS%20%28nsreg%29/General%20Information/vocational_assessment.html"> here</a></strong></em></span> for more information on the MAPAS

              <h1>NS has been the cornerstone of our nation’s defence and security 
              since independence. Our national servicemen form the backbone of the 
              Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), Singapore Police Force (SPF) and Singapore
               Civil Defence Force (SCDF) that keep Singapore safe and secure.</h1>
              <p>To date, more than 900,000 male Singaporeans have served NS and 
              journeyed through this rite of passage. For many, this defining 
              experience bonds servicemen from different backgrounds and across 
              generations.</p>
              <p>The need for NS became clear when Singapore gained independence in 
              1965. It would not have been possible to raise a regular force of a 
              sufficient size to protect this island state given our small population.
               On 21 February 1967, then Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew announced the 
              introduction of full-time NS. Conscription began with 900 of 9,000 
              eligible conscripts enlisting for full-time NS, while the rest served 
              part-time in the People’s Defence Force, the Vigilante Corps and the 
              Special Constabulary. Full-time NS was extended to the SPF and SCDF in 
              1975 and 1981 respectively.</p>
              <p>For over 47 years, NS has evolved into a national institution that is well accepted and a part of our way of life.</p>
              <p>When NS was introduced, officers served three years and other ranks 
              served two years, followed by ten years of reserve service. In 1971, the
               length of service was changed to two-and-a-half years for servicemen 
              holding the rank of corporal and above. In 1983, the reservist training 
              cycle was extended from 10 to 13 years, to meet operational needs.</p>
              <p>In 2005, arising from improvements in training and technology, the 
              duration of full-time NS was reduced from two-and-a-half years to two 
              years. The Operationally Ready National Service (ORNS) duration was 
              shortened to ten years in 2006. (ORNS replaced the term “reservist” in 
              1994 to better signify the operational roles and readiness of our main 
              fighting force.)</p>
              <p>The roles of national servicemen have changed over time. Our first 
              few batches of enlistees were trained in infantry battalions. Enlistees 
              also started joining the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) and Republic 
              of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) in 1969 and 1970 respectively. In 1975, 
              the first intake of full-time Police National Servicemen was enlisted 
              and deployed for peacetime and emergency functions, such as crime 
              prevention patrols and protection of key installations, and preparation 
              and training for national emergencies and disasters. The SCDF enlisted 
              its first intake of NSFs in 1981 to provide emergency services to the 
              nation during peacetime and crises.</p>
              <p>Since then, our servicemen’s roles have expanded. They are now 
              trained for a wide spectrum of operations. In the SAF, our servicemen 
              are trained to fight within units that have to operate in a 
              decentralised manner and in urban terrain. They are also technologically
               savvy, and able to operate sophisticated equipment. This will enable 
              the SAF to achieve mission success decisively and efficiently.</p>
              <p>Beyond protecting Singapore from armed conflicts, our servicemen are 
              now involved in countering terrorism, dealing with the aftermath of 
              natural disasters and tackling health epidemics. For instance, our NSFs 
              and NSmen from the SAF and the Home Team aided relief efforts in 
              Indonesia and Thailand in the wake of the Boxing Day tsunami of 2004, 
              working shoulder to shoulder with our regular forces. Our SCDF NSmen 
              have participated in a total of nine relief missions in the Asia-Pacific
               region, as part of Operation Lionheart. Back home, our SAF NSFs 
              contributed to detection, contact tracing and quarantine management 
              efforts during the SARS crisis in 2003. SAF medics were also deployed at
               Changi Airport to augment efforts to screen air travellers.</p>
              <p>The changing roles of our servicemen reflect the need for NS to 
              evolve and keep pace with the changes in our society as well as our 
              threat environment. This is necessary if NS is to remain relevant.</p>
              <p>NS, as the bedrock of our fighting force and national security, 
              remains critical for Singapore’s continued survival and success. A 
              strong defence underpins the peace and prosperity we enjoy, by 
              safeguarding Singapore’s independence and sovereignty, as well as 
              providing us with the political space and freedom to act in 
              Singaporeans’ best interests.</p>
              <p>The turbulence and instability in our regional security environment 
              in recent years underscore the continued importance of defence for this 
              generation. Countries have become increasingly assertive over the 
              maritime and territorial disputes in the East and South China Seas. 
              Tensions in Northeast Asia in particular have risen, as overlapping 
              claims intersect with historical animosities, domestic nationalism and 
              changing power dynamics. We also have to contend with non-traditional 
              threats such as terrorism, piracy, natural disasters and health 
              epidemics. These unpredictable threats are complex, with no easy 
              solutions.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, seriously:<br><br>Q: How siong is CDO training?<br>A: It's tough, but anybody who keeps his head can reasonably be expected to make it through.  The training's a good application of the principle that the mind is the first thing to give way.  We've had fit men crack under pressure, and at the same time we've had men who were unfit at enlistment who made it all the way through to the beret.<br><br>Q: What are the things I need to look out for?<br>A: 1) Don't bother trying to wayang - if you're doing a good job the instructors will notice it and not say anything, if you're trying to make a show of things you're more likely to get marked.  2) CDOs operate as a team - make sure you help your section and platton mates as much as you can if you have the time and resources available.  3) Along the lines of point 1, don't waste time gobbing off - your effort's better spent getting the job done.<br><br>Q: Can I become an officer if I go to CDO for NS?<br>A: Yes, you can, although only a small number get sent to OCS, and that's after they get selected for and pass the CDO section leader course first.<br><br>Q: Do I get CDO pay from enlistment?<br>A: Yes, you do.  Note, however, that it's kept in reserve until you get the beret, then it's paid as back apy in a lump sum.  No beret, no back pay.<br><br>As for the phases and how long they take, it's obviously changed since I left, so I'll leave it to the newer guys to fill in the blanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok this one is for Guards, moderators, delete the parts you feel might have breached OPSEC.<br><br><strong>Q: What is GCC?</strong><br><br>A: GCC, also known as Guards conversion course, is a rite to get the Khaki beret. Basically, there are GCC for men, specs, officers. These GCC differs from each other as they caters for the needs and operation demands of men, specs, officers. Thus topics emphasis may differ for the 3 grps.<br><br><strong>Q: How long is GCC?</strong><br><br>A: GCC's length is dependent on commitment of the battalion eg. in NDP or any other events. If there is NDP, it is usually 1+ month, if not then around 2.5 to 3 months. If there is NDP, things can get a little cramp up, if not is at an acceptable pace.<br><br><strong>Q: From what I read eg.commercials, urban legends, Guards/GCC very siong leh, machiam like confirm will die...... is it true?</strong><br><br>A: The probability of one dying during GCC is definitely lesser than the probability you get hit by a vehicle. The author was once also frighten, petrified, confused when he received his posting orders many yrs old. But after some time he got used to life inside...... and yes, he is alive and kicking. Just remember that most of the GCC components needs more of team work rather than physical stuff. Of course, you need to be fit, but rest assure, training is safe and progressive. Just like  harry potter movie. Remember to be like Harry, sincere, hardworking and modest. Dun be like Hermione(act smart), Ron(hopelessly blur), Draco melfor(Guai lan).<br><br><strong>Q: Oh, I almost forgot, what are Guards anyway?</strong><br><br>A: Well, this question the author have been also pondering it for very long. In theory, Guards are supposed to be heli-borne infantry, that are inserted into enemy terrain to capture a vantage point crucial for gaining a tactical advantage. Being more strike oriented but Guards do not fight in small clandestine units. Be expected to do a little more walking as you may not see the tonners so frequently, as tonners can only move in unless an axis is secured. We are structured very much like the infantry and the author himself at times do not see any difference between GDS and INF.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Q: Most important question....What is in GCC?</strong><br><br>A: GCC varies from batches to batches and it is usually up to the individual RSM/ CO of the unit to define what the components are in the GCC.<br><br>1) runs: 5,6,7,8,9,10 KM run with the test runs of 7,9,10 KM. The requirement of 10KM run is 60mins for men and 50mins for commanders. If I did not remember wrongly there is also a 10KM FBO run if I am not wrong.<br><br>2)Rappeling: Normal, Austrian, inverted,walk down. There are live heli-rappeling training sessions. We also do cliff rappeling at this cliff at Changi, forget what the of the cliff is. But it is around 5/6 storey like that. The clif rappeling also do all the above I have mentioned.<br><br>3) Height obstacles: Some batches did the AOC and HCC. But for us, we did the HCC. HCC are series of height obstacles at Hendon camp. The author himself is very scared of height, to this day he is still so. But a word of advice, be brave to take up the first step and things should go smoothly.<br><br>4) Weapons: Like all infantry men, Guardsmen must also learn all the weapons used in SAF. SAR-21, M-16, LAW, M203, these section weapons will be taught and there will be some live firing.<br><br>5) Demolitions: You will be taught how to construct simple man portable explosive devices, that can be used in varies situations, but due to the fact it might breach OPSEC, I don't think I will discuss in detail.<br><br>6) Outfield: there is a 1wk field camp to teach you all those platoon, section drills and movements.<br><br>7) Summex: it is the highlight to the entire GCC, whereby trainees will be put to the test on those things they have learnt for all these whiles. It is a 7D6N and yes, I'm not kidding, non-stop exercise. This exercise is platoon based and section based, redland vs blueland, Umpire based force vs force. Most importantly, IT IS UNRESTRAINED, A.K.A FREE FOR ALL. There are no such things as dig in or harboring. The coy is divided into 2 each led by a platoon commander. Each side is given a set of tasks in which they must complete with a time frame. How the PC plans is up to him eg. fighting patrol, recce, ambush........ At any one time the forces can carry out some operations not as planned if they deem it necessary. eg. The section doing ambush encounters the another section that may happen to be in the vicinity, they can attack them. The only rest time available is the time when troops top up for ammo, water, rations.<br><br>All ammos, food, rations are carried by each trooper on a 3 days basis, and your PS most prob will advise you to bring along spare 1.5litre bottles for water. As a bonus for the exercise. a tonner will carry some commercial, non ration food along a path, thus the PC will organise ambushes of these tonners, if successful, the troops will be rewarded with red-bull, chocolates that are loaded on the tonners!!!<br><br>Another mission I remember, is that they used a PUB station as an imaginary signal tower, one for each sides. Before the exercise, both side will have prepared wooden blocks representing block charges and thick nylon ropes as detonation cords. Both sides are required to attack each others signal towers. BUT OF COURSE, THEY ARE GUARDED BY OOPOSING TROOPS. All these are done in thick foilage, so even have CAT1, they won't call it off.<br><br>8 ) GAC: Guards assault course<br><br>9) Coastal swim: 2Km swim to Tekong with life-jackets. The author himself is a poor swimmer, but some how, he managed to coastal struggle back to the shores.<br><br>10) Amphibious Operations: Trainees will how to do a variety of coastal operations eg. coastal hook, coastal assault. Trainees will learn the concepts, drills and tactics in such ops. They also familiarise on operating from FCEP, FCU, RPL.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Q: What is Guards Assault Course (GAC)?<br>A: GAC is a one day course that spans from early afternoon all the way into the late evening. This course will consist of a variety of stations which test the trainees on the skills, drills and techniques taught for the past few weeks. It is a physically enduring course, it is doable and the entire team must help each other in all stations. Done at section level but some stations require the individual involvement of each trainees.<br>( Note that stations may vary from batches to batches )<br><br>Station 1: Run 4 rounds around the red tracks of the stadium in SBO attire less the helmet.<br><br>Station2: Rappeling. Instructor will choose any 2 types of rappeling techniques to test the trainees.<br><br>Station3: FBO SOC. There is no run down. But the entire section must clear the SOC obstacles with full pack on. No timing is required.<br><br>Station4: Fast march around the camp. The distance should be around 2KM or more.<br><br>Station5: Do the various section drills  taught eg. flanking, 2 up, 3 up, retrograde drills. At the end. The Umpire will declare one man in the section to be a casualty. The section will FAD him as according to injury. Take out a stretcher. Place him on it and the entire section will carry him around the camp. Upon reaching to the almost the next station. Umpire will call the casualty to be removed from stretcher and the entire section will firemen lift him for abt 200m to the next station.<br><br>Station6: The entire section will push a rover that is laden with many filled jerry cans for abt 100+m and after this. Make a dash for the finishing line which is abt 400m away.<br><br>This may seem very siong, but due to the many details running and doing stations. There should be adequate time and opportunities to rest and take a breather.</div>
