              <p>Yup - he can't help but prove me right.  It's as unstoppable as a rabid dog's foaming at the mouth.</p>
              <p>The rapid and incessant edits aren't likely to be the result of OCD, though.  The OCD person would take an incredibly long time to make each post because he would check and recheck and make sure everything was right before submitting; if an error was discovered, it would most likely to be something small like a typo or a grammatical error.  The radical differences between Shitman's edits don't fit this pattern.  I'd say it's more of a case of "oh, I forgot to add this", reflecting plain and simple incompetence and stupidity.</p>
              <p>Anyway, let's let him carry on.  I do have to admit that I find his lies hilarious - the more outrageous his porkies are, the funnier it is.</p>

              <p>There's no removing him.  He keeps coming back because he needs to make his little fantasies feel real by telling other people about it, so there's no point trying to stop someone that desperate.  Better the devil you know, so let's just take him to be the clown he is and get some entertainment out of it.</p>

              <p>There's no removing him.  He keeps coming back because he
              needs to make his little fantasies feel real by telling other
              people about it, so there's no point trying to stop someone that
              desperate.  Better the devil you know, so let's just take him
              to be the clown he is and get some entertainment out of it.</p>

              <p>2) i refuswed to take n pass my ippt as i have work comiitments back in spore unlike u who dont need to learn much n program computers at work.</p>
              <p>3)i survive job interviews and got jobs in spore even though the interviewrs were foreigners....the job applicants range from a few hundred for a  single job and all needed high skills in engineering.on top of it all i got my jobs despite recesions from asian crisis to gulf war and sar crisis which affected the spore economy greatly in the past!however its not dat bad as compared to oz as oz seems to be ina recession even though it has no recession.besides that the industries here ar so UNSAFE.I THINK ITS BEST I GO SETUP MY OWN FACTORY.....I DONT INTEND TO LOSE MY ARM OR LEG.not my fault...so there u ave it.and i have my own business n has a better future than those in oz that would neither make me vastly rich or comfortable.</p>
              <p>4)i complain...if things dun go my way...unlike u....thats why spore is a bitch to live in cuz folks like u make it so unberable with an already dumb n dictator like gov.</p>
              <p>5)my cheap ass car is now $15,000 on local newspaper...so it was a good investment as i bought it dirt cheap.</p>
              <p>6)my toys????thats what GDP is all about.</p>
              <p>think u should go read up more better books or at least pick up a good magazine to read.</p>

              <p>Oh, this is the part I love.</p>
              <p>This hopeless crumb who:</p>
              <p>- can't pass IPPT<br> - can't survive job interviews<br> - can't complete a simple driving test without fucking up three
                                      times<br> - cries like a spanked bitch about being a victim in Singapore and
                                      a victim in Australia<br> - spends his time pretending his toys are the GDP's driving
                                      force<br> - spends his time pretending his cheap-ass rustbucket is a good
                                      car</p>
              <p>now wants to take it outside. </p>
              <p>We all know that in real life, if even an 8-year-old kid turned to him and said, "Care to repeat what you said?", he'd just wet himself on the spot.</p>
