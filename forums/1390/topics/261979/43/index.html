              <p>I expect that the two Commando fighter classes still apply, although I'm happy for those who have more recently served to correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
              <p>Upon earning the red beret, you become a Class II Commando fighter, which means that you have the very basic skills to get the job done.Â  Over the remainder of your service, you undergo further training (e.g. LRRP and unarmed combat), and having completed this additonal training, you will be propmoted to Class I - this does not involve getting a higher rank, but the pay will increase slightly.</p>
              <p>The OOC rate in my company by the time we got the beret was about 50% or slightly more.Â  If memory serves me correctly, we started with 198 recruits, had 12 men join us from SAFINCOS during the BCT phase, and somewhere around 95 men got the beret, two of whom lost it within a week because of cracked vertebrae.</p>

              <p>There are lots of ways to serve the army, actually. Mono-intake is just one of them. Since what's decided is already decided, I guess you could just try looking forward to Tekong life and strive for the best. (Sounds awkward..but, oh well...)</p>
              <p>P.S. I think I can understand how you feel for not getting a chance(I went for the VA but didn't get selected ._.)</p>
              <p>By the way, I didn't know commando fighters could be further split into classes 0.o</p>
              <p>I thought it was only men, specialists, and officers...</p>
              <p>And, is there anyone who got into Commando PTP?</p>

              <p>30 additional ways to kill a guy...disturbing. But to be honest,</p>
              <p>30 more ways to kill a guy &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 30 bucks</p>

              <p>I expect that the two Commando fighter classes still apply,
              although I'm happy for those who have more recently served to
              correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
              <p>Upon earning the red beret, you become a Class II Commando
              fighter, which means that you have the very basic skills to get the
              job done.Â  Over the remainder of your service, you undergo
              further training (e.g. LRRP and unarmed combat), and having
              completed this additonal training, you will be propmoted to Class I
              - this does not involve getting a higher rank, but the pay will
              increase slightly.</p>
              <p>The OOC rate in my company by the time we got the beret was
              about 50% or slightly more.Â  If memory serves me correctly, we
              started with 198 recruits, had 12 men join us from SAFINCOS during
              the BCT phase, and somewhere around 95 men got the beret, two of
              whom lost it within a week because of cracked vertebrae.</p>
