              <p>Yo broz, i just wanted to ask wheather if Ndu or Cdo enlistees
              ever get to set foot on Tekong. I do already know that they go
              through their very own BMT but i wanted to know if their BMT would
              be conducted on Tekong Resort.</p>
              <p>Also would enlistees get involved in a PoP similar to the normal
              BMT enlistee after his graduation from Tekong?</p>
              <p>Thanks in advance for replies</p>

              <p>Hey eTan, i dont know about Cdo, but Ndu never set foot in Tekong at all throughout their BMT and CDC phase. Nope their BMT will not be conducted in Tekong, don't worry, the accomodations are great.<br>Enlistees will have a more memorable PoP haha, trust me on that... you won't be getting the normal PoP because you only have your true POP after your CDC phase.. you get a memorable one after BMT too, but trust me.. the CDC one is worth the wait.</p>

              <p>Hey guys i recieved the vocational letter for ndu, i am really
              interested and determined to get in and i'm almost-fit, what can i
              do to get a higher chance of getting in? It is due to the fact that
              i actually wanted to defer ns for my studies but i understand that
              this opportunity won't wait, if i don't get ndu, there's no point
              for me to not to defer. So any advice?</p>

              <p>The Commando PTP programme doesn't differ much from Tekong PTP. It's all the usual PT, basic foot drills, introduction to military life, etc. The training is definitely progressive, especially after the recent spate of training-related deaths. Commanders everywhere are scrambling to up their safety measures so they don't add to the body count and ruin their career.</p>

              <p>there is no height requirement.. for a malay it's pretty hard to join the commandos. Every intake there would probably be only 1 or 2 malays. I don't know how they choose, It depends on how mindef measures their clearance level. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hey guys, I was kinda wondering what are the minimum requirements of being a commando? Cause i kinda am shortsighted with like 300+ degrees on both eyes, but no astigmatism/color blindness/ whatever. And in the forward bending test I am like 3 degrees positive (not really sure what that means but basically just know that its is somehow crooked). But other than these 2, i have no other medical conditions, no broken bones/medical history whatsoever. And my fitness is reasonably good. So anyone has any idea what are my odds of just getting selected for VA, ie do I even meet the minimum requirement? Oh and I also kinda failed the SYFC medical test, not sure why though...</p></div>

I called the NS hotline @ 1800-3676767 already. CSO said it will take 3 working days to get back to me. So should I just wait or keep calling everyday to pester and expedite process?</p>
