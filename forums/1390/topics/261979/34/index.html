              <p>stop fooling yerself.u know what kinda soldier u got when they cant get hold of a thai farmer who shot,injured yer folks n ran away.so which soldier in spore army will hold up 2 gpmg and fire away???the combat engineers??the guardsman??the airforce pilot???the medic???the recruits at bmt???no,its u the commandos!</p>
              <p>would rather have thai newspapers that says spore commando kills thai farmer than the newspaper that says farmer kills spore commando.</p>

              <p>wow.. I never thought that I can hold up the 2 GPMGs and fire away then. This guy really thinks CDO are rambo. And he also thinks that Rambo is real!!!!!!!! Maybe he dunno how heavy is 1 GPMG? hahahaaha.....think u watched too much such movies, be realistic.</p>
              <p>from this thai farmer shot CDO incident, the way you wrote here...this army should had dragged you into CDO. You acted so aggressive, what a pity CDO din choose you....hahaha....But being aggressive is not enough, u did not use enough of ur brain to think....do u want to strain the SG-Thai good relationship? Or are you ready to wage a war with Thailand becos of this? Do u seriously think it would look better on our CDOs that SG CDO killed Thai farmer instead the other way? This is not purely CDO-Thai farmer affairs but also SG-Thai governements affairs. </p>
              <p>Maybe you are just too young to comprehend such things. Oh..by the way, CDOs are soldiers who trained to kill, but we are not killers and certainly not Rambo as you had claimed. No trainers in our camp ever said we are like Rambo, never! Because we work as a team, not some acting gangho, selfish individuals.</p>

              <p>wow....i was deeply appreciated by the lengthy mails you had sent....must had took you sometime to think and to type.....hahahaha</p>
              <p>from your comments, i think u cannot fit to CDO.....if you are in taleban, u make a very good terrorist though....welcome, Extremist.</p>
              <p>If I were you, I wouldnt be proud if imagine you are the CDO who want to kill some innocent Thai farmers so eagerly. SG government and SAF were so lucky you were not there when incident happened. So tell me, what so good if SG and Thai are in war becos of this incident? Do you know that those SF from US who trained with us told us that we, Singaporeans are very lucky to train in peacetime? Those were the ones who went to gulf war and killed before....so what....they were not proud of themselves of doing such acts. Pls admit that you are still young and inexperience la. Act garang will not last!</p>
              <p>SG-Thai relationship already strained? Since when? Pls define. And pls do not tell me it was due to this Thai farmer shot CDO incident. My jaw will drop.</p>
              <p>Whether was I made of CDO material had nothing to do with you and certainly dun need your so call 'expertise' advice here. Well..ah boy, no matter how u put me down, I had gone thru that phase. My red beret and stiletto knife will keep me accompany for rest of my life. And pls dun doubt me, when times come, I will put a bullet on my enemy's head if I need to for this is what I was trained for.</p>
