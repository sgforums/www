              <p>Well from what I know:</p>
              <p>Guards: Some will go in through the mono-intake (<em>usually</em> non diploma or A level holders) while the majority will be posted to Guards after tekong BMT, not exactly sure what the criteria is based upon but I suppose fitness plays a part (as Guards are pretty 'xiong')</p>
              <p>Commandos: Commandos is mono intake and they have their own BMT. You'd have to get a VA letter (they look at Security Clearance, MAPAS results, PES A/B etc) to go for an interview coupled with some physical and psychological tests. After that they will select the Commando enlistees from the VA pool. Apparently the chance of going from Tekong BMT to Commandos is close to or nil.</p>

              <p>Prehaps my English was really that bad. The three lines was a joined paragraph, please read together. I was telling this guy not to be so naive, and asked him to google for more information himself, and I was not giving more information this kind of military abuse matters, people not following the directives and safety issues. But certainly, he being such as smart boy could deduce the whereabout.</p>
              <p>The more you want me to shut up, the more I would not. If you are not happy asked the moderator to ban me. Else you can setup a thread on your own (just for commnando only) and fixed it else where. And this I had already mentioned it previously.</p>

              <p>There is some criteria here and there, to me, it is illusive. As far as I know, they try to post  every1 to the "correct" vocations according to what they can do. But there is always hiccup here and there. Sometimes, we request for Pes A/B personnels to be posted in our unit, but strangely some Pes C fill up the slots. I do not blame them, as when I issue out SAF100 myself, I also do recall back Pes E personnels which is not meant to be.</p>
              <p>how do u get posted to
              safsa? Different sports are different. Some sports have selection trials (just like in school). Some coaches might spot althletes. If you are in the scene, they will know you.</p>
              <p>Is it after BMT where u will be posted to safsa?You have your own vocation. SAFSA training is on top of your regular schedule. But SGT have to let your off for training. For example, my colleagues is a clinical medic, but he will go for water polo training here (like CCA)</p>
              <p>can you go
              for the sports trial in ns by yourself or u will be selected based
              on ur accolades? Both.</p>
