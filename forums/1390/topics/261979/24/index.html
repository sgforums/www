              <p><br>Because you are one who say that you have a batch boy working as a regular in S1 now in the first place previously. So when you reflect me back, I am actually stunned by you. I am assuming that the S1 batch boy of yours is some1 you meet for outing at the weekend and hence you can probe him for the event details informally and indirectly.

              <p>Anyway, I really dont know what is S1, S2, S3. Prehaps, such a system does not exist in Navy and it is newly implemented. I dont even know the rank system now loh. A level 200 blur king.</p>

              <p>If I want to know about operational details, why the fuck would
              I ask a manpower officer?  Just because you cling on to one
              name that you know like a drowning man doesn't mean that I'm as
              fucking pathetic as you are.  If I want to talk to the S3,
              I'll fucking talk to the S3, you idiot.</p>
              <p>Then again, you're just stupid and lazy enough to go ask the
              Muslim stall fella for a plate of char siew rice, aren't you, you
              dumb fuck?</p>
              <p>When I mentioned my batch boys, it's because two of them have
              served as S1s in CDO and both of them would be <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>BEST PLACED</strong></span> to certify
              that you're full of shit.  That doesn't mean that they are the
              only officers that I know there - for fuck's sake, I know both red
              beret BGs personally on top of a number of officers who have
              commanded SOF, so just because nobody wants to know you doesn't
              mean that any one else is as fucking pitiful as you are.</p>
              <p>For fuck's sake, really.</p>
