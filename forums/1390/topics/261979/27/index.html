              <p>LOL.You are wrong again. I say I am a PA, did I say I am a

                  firefighting course. </p>
              <p>And for my senior batch they are compulsory to go for basic

                  previously is in SOF now. </p>
              <p>Boy, I also know how to lay the light sticks and do heli ops,
                  which the bloody RSAF dont listen to me at all. I am heli ops
                  trained too, but I dont jump down from helicopter. And I am still
                  remember the left and right, and the helicopter land in front of me
                  that time. </p>

              <p>OK, I was trained to strip, clean and shoot a P226 but that was only because a bunch of us were arrowed to take care of the logistics for the annual range for all the officers in our department. They figured we can just use up the unexpended ammo instead of returning it all. But even that training was unofficial and does not show up in our records. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>So it is about time, you show me your publications, dont tell me you have not published anything in your PhD years.Even your thesis should be published in the school library blah. Another friend of mine managed to get 4 publications in her short 2 years of master of applied psychology. Surely your researchs worth something in your PhD years?

                  So what's your plan?  Do you want to feel clever by getting my
                  name while you hide yours?  Are you really so fucking stupid

                  Or do you want to stalk me?  I've got enough fans and frankly,

                  So what?<br>
                  <br>
                  I don't have to explain myself - do you see any of the other
                  Commandos on this forum accusing me of faking?  No they don't,
                  and it's because I don't bullshit.  Similarly, people with
                  real psych backgrounds don't have to demand my publications list
                  because they recognise the truth of what I write.  More
                  importantly, my clients are happy to pay hundreds of thousands of
                  dollars for that same truth today and don't care what I wrote ten
                  years ago.  What makes you think you count?<br>
                  <br>
                  You, on the other hand, are the one being accused left, right and
                  center of being a bullshit artist on so many fronts it's not funny
                  anymore.  I'd be happy to run off the roster of people who
                  have already called you on your lies, but it's already obvious by
                  browsing a few threads that your credibility's all shot.  All
                  I have to do is quote all of the accusations from other members and
                  it's game over for you, booster.  Hell, I might just do that
                  in response to all of your future posts.<br>
                  <br>
                  So, I'm being accused of bullshitting by someone who's himself
                  widely acknowledged as being full of shit.  I ask again, so
                  what?<br>

              <p>Oh yes! I remember you in my same course. Of course. you do a Kage Bunshin no Jutsu. You graduated from your PhD in 2002, at the same you are in RSN, commando, doing the same course with me. I believe you have plenty of chakra. And you are able to maintain your clone for such a long distance.</p>
              <p>Use your brain when you reply, boy. How can PhD holder reply without thinking?</p>
              <p>I do agree that there is no point talking to an O-geez-san, who reply my post without thinking.</p>

              <p>I really feel sorry for you guys too, your brains are so linear
              and narrow. Can you use some common sense? It get worse when you

              <p>If your house is on fire, you will stand there and let the fire
              roast you to death? Who do you call, what do you do?</p>
              <p>Dont you think that Navy ship is very likely to be caught fire
              too. So if the ship is on fire with all this missiles and stuff, do
              you expect the fire to be put off by itself automatically in the
              middle of the ocean?</p>
              <p>And there is heli pad on every LST ship. What are they for?</p>

              <p>Well, a guy from the fire prevention came to my office last year and held a talk. He said fire fighting is like a gamble, even you got fire extinguisher in the office or home, it's not meant to fight fire with it. It's suppose to open a safety road for you to escape. That goes the same with whatever cert to it. As for gamble, he said actually there no right or wrong method as long as your life is saved. If in the end of process you were saved, you won, if not you lost. With all the certs is good, but when the real thing occurred how many out there can kept their mind clear what to do next. </p>
