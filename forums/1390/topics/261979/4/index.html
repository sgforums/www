Thats new, something I never knew or realize. Basically, I feel that INF and GDS same one lah..... seriously, so I dunno why some forummers here posted to 3rd GDS need to be so petrified. Being a conscript army, they anyhow post one, so you get a gd mix of chao keng, siao on type, so you can be sure sometimes INF are better than GDS......<br><br>But during 11th mono, our RSM 1WO Teo he is very siao on on in chiong sua one, so we did quite well for atec with high recon 2A, but in the end also never win best INF...........</div>
