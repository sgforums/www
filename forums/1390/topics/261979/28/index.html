              <p>haha glad thats settled, i'm new here and i've got a
                          question :) , i'm doing my ns next year and i really really want to
                          join the rangers.. do you get picked for the ranger course after
                          bmt or do you get selected right from the start? i'm dont
                          understand the terminology used here. enhanced bmt etc. all i know
                          is i'm doing hsc's in sydney.. and from what my dad says that
                          qualifies as an a lvl qualification. will that boost my chances or
                          will i have to do something else?</p>

              <p>Yes, hopefully that the end of pretenders coming in here and spouting baseless rubbish, but I’m not holding my breath.</p>
              <p>Your mention of “joining the Rangers” implies that a Ranger unit exists in the SAF.  Unfortunately, unlike the US Army, the SAF does not maintain Ranger units.  Instead, Ranger-type roles such as strike missions or LRRP (Long-Range Reconnaisance Patrols) are performed by the Commandos.</p>
              <p>Entry into the Ranger course is voluntary – you need to put your hand up for it rather than just being selected.  The fellows who have served more recently would be able to give you a clearer answer about who is eligible to volunteer for Rangers, but while I was serving, the Ranger course was just beginning to be made available to NSFs (it was previously only available to regulars), and only Commando NSFs were eligible to volunteer.<br><br>I interpret your question to be “do I get selected for Commandos from the start or after BMT?” – please feel free to correct me if I’m off the mark here.  The answer to this question is that you get selected right from the start, and attend a separate BMT course from recruits for other units.</p>
              <p>The selection process takes place about half a year before you enlist, and shortlisted candidates for Commando selection are asked to attend a Vocational Assessment (VA).  The VA involves a number of physical and psychological tests, following which attendees will receive a letter informing them if they have been selected.  There has been much speculation about what it takes to get selected, but to be perfectly frank, after 20 years I still haven’t figured out how they actually make their decision.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, if you’re doing your HSC in Sydney, the greatest likelihood is that you won’t be called in for the VA simply because you won’t be available.  However, if you’re going to be in Singapore six months before enlistment, it may be expedient for them to call you in.  Short of this or of signing on as a Commando, I’m not sure what you can do to get selected.</p>

              <p>Last time I checked, it was exclusive to Commando NS men but open to all regulars.  Keep in mind, however, that the last time I checked was 17 years ago, so some of the guys who have served more recently may let you know if that's changed.</p>

              <p>170 cm is fine. In fact, they prefer guys who are short in NDU, as they can fit into the diving suit better, plus many other reasons. If you are tall and thin, you cannot fit in that well. If you learn diving you will know, what I meant.</p>
              <p> If you are underweight then you will be Pes B and may not be selected for the NDU selection. People who are too thin, are afraid of cold and they lost heat very easily. It is not prefer.</p>
              <p>I think you are an ectomorph, which dont make good diver. </p>

              graduating with a diploma. i feel tat i will love the army as i
              hate admin jobs and prefer hands on ( pls dont comment on this
              which i always see everytime ppl start a threat on such
              things).</p>
              <p>just wan to clarify.</p>
              <p>is a diploma holder better for spec or officer? in terms on $
              and future (yes i intend to sign till old ignoring whether will i
              be able to recontract, just wanna get a picture first)</p>
              <p>yes, money is concern thats why i chose cdo (yes they havent
              chose me but i just i to know what if), which is better? cdo or cdo
              officer?</p>
              <p>will i promote slower in cdo? or cert doesnt really matter in
              cdo as it is a unit itself?</p>
              <p>i do have interest in SOF and NDU, but i do not have perfect
              eyesight, is there any ways?</p>

              <p>From the last chit-chat with another regular.</p>
              <p>If you want to be combat, a diploma holder, it is better to be spec. As the current Army, is having a lack of people at this level. You will be promoted fast and within 5 to 10 years ending up at mindef HQ. For officers, wait long long for promotion.</p>
              <p>Money wise the max officer vs the max senior warrant, of course the max officer is higher, but the specialist path is faster now due to the lack of specialist at this level.</p>
              <p>I am surpised that that regular is still jumping around with ropes when he is already a warrant officer. His palms and soles are full of calluses. And it just indicates that the work that he do is tough work.</p>
              <p>They need men who can think, run and write now, so recontract is not a problem. But your career will be doomed as you are so combat-trained that once you get injured (perm) you will be condemed perm. As having downgraded to Pes E is a no-no for regulars.</p>
              <p>In my personal opinion, it is better to be an OBS instructor rarer than "pushing tonner", "picking leaf from tree" and "leopard crawl in the bunk". <br></p>

              <p>You are right. Actually if you walk officer route, combat, diploma, it will take 2- 3 year to get from 1 bar to 2 bar, then another 3 to 4 years to get to cpt, then another 3 - 5 years to get to Major, then you will stuck there for 3 to 10 years or forever. </p>
              <p>Actually, the pay scale is up on the mindef website or in their recruitment brochure in black and white.  </p>
              <p>You are very diplomatic, you will do well if you work as broker, banker (financial product sales), and other stuff, which might fetch even more $$$ than you sign on.  </p>
              <p>There are alot of job that can earn more, better then digging trench at 3 am in the morning.  </p>

              <p>It is not just IPPT only but basically that is about it and more . </p>
              <p>The enlistment date for A level commando unlike the Tekong guys is not fixed, so you do have a problem going Uni. There is no pro but con for commando, apart from glory and honour. OOC rate is very high. My training spec, bunk mate, understudies are ex-commando OOC. Injuries that they are proned to are back, knee, ankle. It is super difficult to get into spec or officer in commando, especially if there are regulars around.  IT is after all a mono intake ("non- military leader"). </p>
              <p>Maybe one pro the combat pay is higher, you get to jump out from aeroplane.</p>

              <p>this is utter bullshit. When do you remember this from? It's was NEVER like that. Never during my father's time 30 over years ago and not during my time too. They are logisticians and Clerical staff for a reason.</p>
              <p>roughly 50 over go to CSLC and out of which about 20 over go to OCS. CDO is mono intake NOT because it's a non leadership intake. The CDO intake is mono because we choose our own people, ALL CDO nsf are mono intake. officers and specs are all chosen from the 250 odd. There are no exceptions (unless you're a regular convert). Lokey please stop feeding them wrong information.</p>
