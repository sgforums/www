            <div class='col-md body'><p>oh yea i'd like to see you stab a rice farmer just 5m away from you while he's armed with a shotgun.. its easier said than done. and the odds are he'd probably shot your head off even before you reached for your knife. plus since theres no use being civil around you. stop watching war movies and grow the fuk up.. 'rambo' does not exist. even in the movies he makes it clear that he does not like killing, either you're dumb or you're seriously fucked in the head. seal or sas or whatever sf they may be, odds are when they see the enemy 5 metres away looking them dead in the eye. they will not pull the trigger. you fail to realise that killing machines even if they exist at the end of the day are humans, people with consciences. soldiers are suffer the diesease that is the human condition. watch your ww2 documentarys. even the greatest of veterans let the enemy slip when they are undetected. for a soldier is not a killing machine, he is a human fighting for a cause he believes in, freedom, family rescuing comrades. these are the values they teach you in the army. the fact that they give you a gun doesnt mean you have to kill someone. its easy to neutralise a threat without violence and just so you know.. sar21 dont come equipped with bayonets.. do your research.. i believe bayonets were discontined after the sar 21.. the only forces i know of that use bayonets are the marines. even then.. its just a knife that they attach to the tip of their guns. its a last resort. marines believe that death by a bullet is more humane than hacking a person to death. therefor the freedom of not having it attached permanently to their rifles</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>just so you know pte raj and company were approximately 30 metres away from the farmer. they werent issued live rounds, only blanks. and when the farmer heard the steps of the soldiers, he shot at what he believed was an animal. there was no intention of injuring our troops, therefore charges could not be placed against the farmer. you should start reading more literature. even i who live in sydney am more informed than you are. stop discriminating our soldiers and give respect where its due. our forces arent pushovers. the australian and united states army has reached out for joint training exercises, we are their official southeast asian partners. the fact that we are deployed all over the world for humanitarian missions and not suffered casualties is amazing considering that sometimes they have to fight and provide relief outside the green zone. we are properly trained and have good relations with the various countries too, they know that what we lack for in manpower we make up with courage and determination to help our fellow man. like i said For Honour And Glory.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>mate, as much as i'd like to, i really cant stand to watch a fellow 'singaporean' disgrace our troops. my uncle works in the navy as comms guy, although he doesnt do combat stuff, it doesnt mean he works without a sense of conviction. people like the permed hitman should be extradited from singapore. all our forefathers fought bravely to defend the land we live on. its only fair that they also get recognition for the work they did. thanks for the assist though</p></div>

              <p>I hear what you're saying, Bryan, but look at it this way.  He couldn't do something as simple as pass a simple fitness test, so really, what's the worth of anything he says?</p>
              <p>The fact is that you can be proud of your relatives, and regardless of anything this loudmouthed poofter says, we Commandos know what we're on about.  In contrast, can you imagine how miserable it would be to have to wake up every morning and see Shitman's face in the mirror? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>yer dad was a guardsman...what on earth has that got to do with u????then what are u???an army clerk??i dun exactly care if yer dad was zorro unless he is fighting with that thai farmer....so now u bringin in yer dad n grannny into the picture  when u have thoughts about confronting a mere farmer...then if it was a soldier armed with a gpmg u defintely would have ran for cover along with yer ancestors.....</p>
              <p>all the singaporeans fought in the past for spore??what bout lky???he worked for the japs back in ww2 in comms too like yer uncle in da navy!</p>
              <p>face it...if u were in the jungle and had to face off with a thai farmer with a pitch fork....u would have backed out and crawled under some foxhole.</p>
              <p>bryan bryan bryan.....stop showing to the world spore has such poor quality soldiers like you ...u may run away or hide like an athelete...but when given a real problem...u make excuses like not being able to track down a mere farmer..no bullets.....perhaps farmer is also an elite special forces in the rice husk section of his barn who can appear n dissappear like a ninja....i would relish at the idea if every enemy soldier was like u.....i would not only have enjoyed fighting against such soft targets i would have brought yer head back as a souvenir too.</p>

              <p>Hitman, even if he served as an army clerk. He served, what did you serve as? or have u served? =) Men like you who are deluded by false acts of bravery are the reason why comrades and men die.</p>

              <p>ok...ya not much soldiering material from the way u think n only thing ya wanna extradite me is to fill up singapore with high quality soldiers like myself  in order to protect kids who cant protect themselves or arent tough enough.as i have said....u may dress up like a special forces called navy seals..u may have all the bullets and all the guns in their arsenal..yer uncle or grandfather owns the army.....but it all boils down to one thing....the warrior and his DNA who actually has the balls to get up,think and take down the enemy efficiently.</p>
              <p>if yer dad spit on me...i would probably  have ripped his tongue out and turned the both of u into pate.why on earth are u bringin yer old elderly dad here to fight ina war???hahaha....thats amusing.......shouldnt u be somewhere else other than the cdo thread.....yer dad was a guardsman but are u one???u must be with the st johns brigade for not fighting fer yerself.....mannn.....u tellin me sporean guys in sydney are softies who need their dad to fight for them???hahaha</p>
              <p>i already answered my countrys call when they needed special help in the past.have u???u have difficulty wondering if u should take down rice n frozen vegetable farmers even.stop bringin yer dad n grandaddy in here...u make me feel as if u are a 10 year old kid.</p>
