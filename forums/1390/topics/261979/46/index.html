              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I'm new here but I've read this entire thread (yes, all 46 pages of it.)</p>
              <p>I'm a CDO from 2 Coy and I enlisted in 1996. After 14 long years, I've finally just finished my last ICT. Quite a ride when I think back to the day of enlistment and all the things that had transpired since then. I was horrified when I first found out my enlistment was to CDO. But when all was said and done, I would do it again if I had to live my life again. It was one of the best experiences of my life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One thing I would like to share with the soon-to-be-enlisted young men: there is a misconception with regard to the OOC rates in CDO. Here are some points to share:</p>
              <p>1) There are always a huge number of people who do not want to be a CDO even though they are enlisted there.</p>
              <p>2) Some leave by signing on to other units. Some leave by disrupting for studies. Others dig up their full medical history and even try to concoct problems in a bid to get downgraded and posted out of company or out of unit. A few will speak to the OC and have serious discussions about their wishes to get posted to other units, be it due to their personal reasons or otherwise.</p>
              <p>3) Although the [final operational company strength]/[enlistment headcount] is about 50% or lower, it has to be remembered some of the people are posted to CDO HQ as Medics/Signallers or to be in the SRT. So it is not true that 50% gets OOC'd.</p>
              <p>4) And perhaps the most important point of all, the OOC rate that are caused by training injury is actually pretty low. At least that's the case in my company.</p>
              <p>5) Yes, it is true that a small handful will get injured during the airborne course. But most of them will eventually recover, get themselves upgraded and continue their journey as a CDO. One such example is a 3SG who was chosen to go to OCS. He hurt himself during airborne training and was thus not sent there. Although he took a while to recover, recover he did. And he chose to sign on for 2 years (this was possible back then, not sure about now) just so that he can fulfill his destiny of going to OCS and becoming a CDO officer. He did it.</p>
              <p>So, the overall OOC rate is actually misleading. Injury rates as well. As long as one is keen to be part of the family, listens to instructions and be vigilant about training safety, everything will be fine. ( I, for one, has never ever reported sick during my 2 years 4 months + 6 ICTs.)</p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And in order to dispel a few other myths:</p>
              <p>1) I wear glasses (although my degree is only about 150). There are guys in my company with 200-300+ degrees. As far as I know, my company is the very first that took in short-sighted people. During my ICTs, I've seen spectacles become very prevalent among the NSFs. So being short sighted is not an issue. (Although there seems to be a ceiling on the allowable degree: 500).</p>
              <p>2) I am an only son. And some are even only-child's. So this is not a problem either.</p>
              <p>3) I am PES B. I sustained a couple of fractures when I was young, hence this PES status. As far as I know, it has no bearing against becoming a CDO.</p>
              <p>So, even though I am concurrently in 3 of the "unlikely to get selected" group, I was still picked (which was why I was horrified by the enlistment letter). For those who are keen to go to Hendon, don't let any of the above deter you. For those who are going in soon, don't be afraid. The experience and the bond that you'll build is something you'll come to treasure for life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Against All Odds. For Honour And Glory!</p>

              during airborne training and was thus not sent there. Although he
              took a while to recover, recover he did. And he chose to sign on
              for 2 years (this was possible back then, not sure about now) just
              so that he can fulfill his destiny of going to OCS and becoming a
              CDO officer. He did it.</p>
              <p>So, the overall OOC rate is actually misleading. Injury rates as
              well. As long as one is keen to be part of the family, listens to
              instructions and be vigilant about training safety, everything will
              be fine. ( I, for one, has never ever reported sick during my 2
              years 4 months + 6 ICTs.)</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>And in order to dispel a few other myths:</p>
              <p>1) I wear glasses (although my degree is only about 150). There
              are guys in my company with 200-300+ degrees. As far as I know, my
              company is the very first that took in short-sighted people. During
              my ICTs, I've seen spectacles become very prevalent among the NSFs.
              So being short sighted is not an issue. (Although there seems to be
              a ceiling on the allowable degree: 500).</p>
              <p>2) I am an only son. And some are even only-child's. So this is
              not a problem either.</p>
              <p>3) I am PES B. I sustained a couple of fractures when I was
              young, hence this PES status. As far as I know, it has no bearing
              against becoming a CDO.</p>
              <p>So, even though I am concurrently in 3 of the "unlikely to get
              selected" group, I was still picked (which was why I was horrified
              by the enlistment letter). For those who are keen to go to Hendon,
              don't let any of the above deter you. For those who are going in
              soon, don't be afraid. The experience and the bond that you'll
              build is something you'll come to treasure for life.</p>

              <p>I have heard of CDO with 400~ degrees in one eye, CDO being only child, but this is certainly the first time that I heard Pes B can be CDO. Will be sure to share this info if asked.</p>

              <p>Yes.</p>
              <p>If you think about it, being the only son will make you the eldest son as well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>On a related note, I know of several instances where, if a family has more than 1 son, and if the elder son went to CDO, the younger one will go to CDO as well. i.e. I have quite a number of CDO friends whose brothers are CDO as well.</p>
              <p>I do not know whether this is due to coincidence or by design though.</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I'm new here but I've read this entire thread (yes, all 46 pages of it.)</p>
              <p>I'm a CDO from 2 Coy and I enlisted in 1996. After 14 long years, I've finally just finished my last ICT. Quite a ride when I think back to the day of enlistment and all the things that had transpired since then. I was horrified when I first found out my enlistment was to CDO. But when all was said and done, I would do it again if I had to live my life again. It was one of the best experiences of my life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One thing I would like to share with the soon-to-be-enlisted young men: there is a misconception with regard to the OOC rates in CDO. Here are some points to share:</p>
              <p>1) There are always a huge number of people who do not want to be a CDO even though they are enlisted there.</p>
              <p>2) Some leave by signing on to other units. Some leave by disrupting for studies. Others dig up their full medical history and even try to concoct problems in a bid to get downgraded and posted out of company or out of unit. A few will speak to the OC and have serious discussions about their wishes to get posted to other units, be it due to their personal reasons or otherwise.</p>
              <p>3) Although the [final operational company strength]/[enlistment headcount] is about 50% or lower, it has to be remembered some of the people are posted to CDO HQ as Medics/Signallers or to be in the SRT. So it is not true that 50% gets OOC'd.</p>
              <p>4) And perhaps the most important point of all, the OOC rate that are caused by training injury is actually pretty low. At least that's the case in my company.</p>
              <p>5) Yes, it is true that a small handful will get injured during the airborne course. But most of them will eventually recover, get themselves upgraded and continue their journey as a CDO. One such example is a 3SG who was chosen to go to OCS. He hurt himself during airborne training and was thus not sent there. Although he took a while to recover, recover he did. And he chose to sign on for 2 years (this was possible back then, not sure about now) just so that he can fulfill his destiny of going to OCS and becoming a CDO officer. He did it.</p>
              <p>So, the overall OOC rate is actually misleading. Injury rates as well. As long as one is keen to be part of the family, listens to instructions and be vigilant about training safety, everything will be fine. ( I, for one, has never ever reported sick during my 2 years 4 months + 6 ICTs.)</p>
