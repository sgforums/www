              <p>Oh me, oh my.  Yet another lie.  After all, in this
              thread you've already stated:</p>
              <p>Whoop, there it is.  So, are you busy or are you
              free?  Liar, liar, pants on fire, just jammed that rod up you
              arse even higher.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Oh, so your idea of entertainment is being having your LIES
              exposed to the public?  Jesus Christ, you're more fucked-up
              than I dared imagine. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>There's sweet fuck-all chance of what you've posted being true,
              so don't waste time on impossible scenarios. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>The doctors that you have met have simply been polite and found
              nice ways of describing your distended rectum to you.  Once
              you go away, they have a good laugh about that fucking 3-tonner
              that tore right up your arse, did a U-turn and drifted its way back
              out again.  I know - I've had enough such laughs in that
              rarefied atomsphere well above your pitiful station in what you try
              to pass off as a life.</p>
              <p>Most assuredly, nowhere close to being as stupid as you on your
              best day.  Yes, go celebrate that win now. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              is that you are making a fool of yourself. Because what I am saying is the
              Truth.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In the previous gangster incident, you had gone on uttering
              your nonsense, without know that fact that I knew the kid's parents too.
              Without complete information that I had given you, you had make the wrong
              conclusion hence ending at nowhere.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In the commando accident, what I heard in the gym (where
              regulars' handout) was that that regular had committed a stupid mistake which was
              not a good image for CDO. It was not right for me to talk about military secrets
              in the public. And hence I had suggested you to find out the details yourself.
              I admitted that I am not clear about the incidents' details; hence I was not
              making further comments on that.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In the commando inquiries, I really did not see the problem
              of "passing the name" to an SAF regular. You had interpreted it as a
              blackmailed/corruption, which I found it strange. To me, it was more likely
              that you had not done administration work before.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In the current incident, whether I was at HQ or at company
              line, how did it matter to me? Did it make any differences at all? Did it make
              me inferior or superior? For I had ORD for 8 years now. Besides I had not told
              you my vocation yet, and I only tell you that I worked in HQ. May be I was a
              cleaner back then working in HQ?<span>   </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Does being bored = free?<span>  </span>Wrong! I was bored with my report writing, but I still had tons of works
              to do. <span>  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Is it interesting to see some people going rounds in
              circles, figuring out a puzzle with missing pieces?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">About the doctors' part, you are right in some sense, as
              doctors are very good actor. I do not deny that.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">It just interesting, how can "registered psychologists"
              be so free to post into forum so often? Perhaps, the business needs
              improvements? Or "perhaps" you have pretending to be attentively
              typing the patients' complaint when in fact you are serving the internet?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Goosh! Soon you are accusing me of lying again for I have
              previously stated that I want you to post "concise statements". I can
              go on and on, for I can expand these sub-points to paragraphs then to chapters.
              <span> </span>But I decide to end here. Hope you realize
              by now that I can be extremely long-winded and details if I want to. But in
              cases where I have purposely drop out the fact, it does not mean I am lying.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">You should know that a puzzle can only solve when you have been
              given complete/enough information. At times, you may deduce a conclusion, but
              you may be heading the wrong directions. In other cases, the first piece of
              evidence may already be misinterpreted (by miscommunications, typo errors.. ), hence
              the direction may be screwed. So it is important to not to make declaration

              <p>I do wish you’d make up your mind.  First you ask for conciseness, and when you get it, you try to worm your way out by bleating about truncation, you coward.  The fact of the matter is that you chuck truckloads of meaningless trivia in your stories, presumably in the hope of throwing the reader off your trail of bullshit.</p>
              <p>By the way, academic boards and clients paying hundreds of thousands of dollars have absolutely no problem with my conciseness.  You're just the one who's too retarded to read.<br><br>You just keep claiming you’re telling the truth (with a capital T, no less – do you think you’re Christ or Mohammed now?).  I’ll just keep exposing your lies.  The game goes on.</p>

              <p>Nope, you’re just plain lying.  Just look at your latest post – once I’ve kicked you in the arse enough times to provide more information, it’s come out that your “advice” is based on what you overheard in the gym.  In fact, the additional information has not only highlighted your tendency to go to the gym to not only pick up gangsters and go home to meet their parents, but also to eavesdrop on other people’s conversations and try to pass yourself off as being in a position to give “advice”.  There’s no typo that can explain that away.</p>
              <p>So go ahead, if you feel that providing more information would help your cause, feel free to do so, but just keep in mind that I’ll use it all to hang you because when all’s said and done, you’re just full of shit.</p>

              <p>Nice try.  I'll tell you the way it is: you make up a story, I point out the holes in the story, and then you go, "Oh shit, forgot that part!", and make up the next part of the story.</p>
              <p>Now, you might say that my explanation is no more plausible than yours, and fact is, I'd agree that it's no more plausible.</p>
              <p>The only problem for you is that while you've been making up other parts of the story, you've forgotten about all of the lies that you've told to date and you've created a whole lot of inconsistencies that do in fact demonstrate that you're lying.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure if you're the one I said this to before, but I'll say it again: do make sure that you never have to go to court - you'll go in for jaywalking and get hung for murder. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>In the few previous posting, I am stunned by your statements when you mention that you are a doctor. You say it yourself; you have achieved the title of Doctor. So "Doctor" is a title, similar to “Minster”, “Sir”, and “Lord”. So when people address you, they will address you as Doctor with the name or Dr. with the name. The PhD holder themselves don’t address themselves as doctor. Just like I don’t address myself as “I am a Mister”. Is it funny when Sir Newton addresses himself as “I am a Sir”?</p>
              <p>Only a medical doctor can call himself a “doctor” referring to “doctor” refers to an occupation. But if you ask a MBBS graduate, he will reply you that he is a house officer, s.house officer, surgeon, GP and so on. It is rare that he will reply you saying that “I am a doctor”. The word “doctor” is really for laymen to call them. Not for them to address themselves.</p>
              <p>For PhD holder, usually, they will not call themselves as doctors, even though, doctor also refer to a person who has  been  awarded  a  doctor's  degree. But usually, it is written as “he is a  Doctor  of  Philosophy.” Or he will say, “I am a PhD holder, post-doc, prof, specialist and so on.”</p>
              <p>The way you express your statement is odd.</p>
              <p>FYI, I really meant "medical doctors" in my previous posting. As “PhD holder” is nothing to me. </p>
              <p>Setting that aside, I am also stunned that you mention that “your batch boy is a S1 officer in CDO camp”. I remember you say that you are from CJC and I assume that you have entered NS as a JC commando batch. Given that you claim to have obtained the title of Doctor in 2002. I assume that you have taken 3 years Bach., 4 years PhD. You should ORD when you are in 1995? Then you should be 36 years old now. So you are telling that your batch boy is now also 36 years old, degree holder, officer, and  is still stuck as a S1 officer as a Maj or LTC in a unit camp?</p>
              <p>My cousin is a SAF farmer, has already been a 1 years platoon officer in Armor before disruption for uni, 1 year company officer in Armor and recently post to CMPB for special project. The other friend of mine is a SAF scholar is now doing a company officer as CPT. And he have also recently received posting to Mindef. Why your batch boy is still sucked in CDO camp? Is it because CDO officers are considered as high profile or otherwise?</p>
              <p>Do I forget or I have purposely leave it out for my story? I do remember that you have mentioned that you have taken a specialist course which makes you distinguishable from other psychologists. I also remember that in order to be a registered psychologist in Singapore, you need to log at least 800 hours of supervised practical experiences (about 6 mons to 1 yr ) and I am wondering, how can you go private, at the same time, be a registered psychologist. Unless, you have left immediately after you have clocked your hours, which show that  you are inexperienced in counselling.</p>
              <p>There are many things that you have mentioned previously in all your postings does not make sense to me. Your behavior and expression does not match your status and claim.</p>

              <p>As usual, you only present the part of the story that your limited imagination can encompass.  All of the above behaviour would be warranted upon the presumption that both the title holder and the layperson are in at least broad agreement about the implications of the title.  However, when an obnoxious fucking lowlife cockroach presumes to dictate how doctors should behave, he needs to be shown the facts of life in a completely unambiguois manner.</p>

              <p> if I am correct. It is because usually CDO officer is promoted from within. Meaning he has to go through CDO BMT, to be a commando, then go to OCS then to be an CDO officer. But he has to sign on in order to be a regular CDO officer. But how many people managed to sign on each year in CDO. So since there is no juniors, the seniors have to stay in the CDO camp. Am I right? </p>

              <p><br> So why is it that ... his batch boy who is now 36 years plus is still an S1 officer in CDO camp?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, I am kapo. I am asking this because I dont understand. A known person of mine is an ex-CDO NSF officer who have chosen to be an diligent accountant over a tough army guy.</p>
              <p>If you look at him, I would hire him as a body guard, personal trainer, TKD coach but not as an auditor, accountant. (You get the picture?). His personality also does not fit into his job. </p>
              <p>Consider salary, prospect, personality, fitness it does not make sense for him not to take the job. So why? </p>
