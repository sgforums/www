              <p>Of course it was not possible to complete all SOC stns but the trainers put him to do some particular stns with the car tyre on his neck several times. Basically tekan! During that time, the rest of us seriously think that he will peng san soon but he pressed on. After so many years, we will still talked abt this incident whenever we gathered. Haha..those were the days.</p>
              <p>Wht I wanted to point out here was if you are not mentally and physically prepared, you will get singled out by trainers to do more while others can have their rest.</p>

              Hey Guys,
              
              I guess I've probably accepted the fact that I'm not selected for commando formation, so most likely I'll get posted to bmtc in tekong. What that won't stop me from becoming a commando. So I would like to ask the commando forumers here if I strive hard to get into OCS and then sign on, then can I be converted to a commando officer and will it be easy for me to do so given that I've passed the initial criteria for commando given that I'm selected for its Vocational assessment? And what are the odds of me not getting in. It's important for me as I've plans for a military career. Please advise me on what to do, thank you.

              Really that works? So from Guards convert to commando? Any commando can verify if this really work or not? Hopefully I can use this path get there. Hah, Royal marine commando  sounds cool but I need to finish university first and I highly doubt that our system allow us to serve in a foreign armed force. I'm just keeping my fingers cross and still waiting for that letter to come.

Besides, GDS no joke either, so if you get there, why not stay there? </p>
              <p>About the Royal Marines, you can serve as a Royal Marines reserve, meaning you train when you can, such as during UNI in the UK . And yes, I've asked the RMC recruiter if Singaporeans could join and the answer was no problem. The British system just needs notification from the SGP government to see if we are free for other service according to <em>page 3</em> of "<a href="http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/Notes_for_Commonwealth_Applicants.pdf">http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/Notes_for_Commonwealth_Applicants.pdf</a>" so who knows right?</p>

              <p>Imagine you are the kena tekan one, faced in front of your platoon mates. I bet that is the last thing you want to be there.</p>
              <p>Tyre? From where? Easy. The trainers took the tyre from the monkey swing (not sure the current SOC still has monkey swing nowsaday?). CDO SOC height were higher than normal SOC found in other camps so therefore we need to step on the car tyre to jump onto monkey swing.</p>

              Hey guys,
              
              Come to think of it, my enlistment status says that the enlistment date is between December 2011 to May 2012 so there might be a slight possibility that I might be enlisted into the poly batch of commando intake. Can anyone clarify whether this assumption of mine is true or not? Any JC students being enlisted in Bravo batch to start their BMT, then after Basic commando training? Thanks and have a good weekend.

              <p>As I've said, I'm no expert and am just regurgitating from memory from an earier post. I'm not too sure, but if the SAF thinks I'm not CDO material, not as if I have any other choice but opt for the other vocations correct? Besides, GDS no joke either, so if you get there, why not stay there? </p>
              <p>About the Royal Marines, you can serve as a Royal Marines reserve, meaning you train when you can, such as during UNI in the UK . And yes, I've asked the RMC recruiter if Singaporeans could join and the answer was no problem. The British system just needs notification from the SGP government to see if we are free for other service according to <em>page 3</em> of "<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/Notes_for_Commonwealth_Applicants.pdf">http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/Notes_for_Commonwealth_Applicants.pdf</a>" so who knows right?</p>

              <p>Haha congrats to those who're enlisting into SOTAC, my only advice is to enjoy your time there (in fact enjoy the life <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before</span> crossing over to Hendon). Once you go over to Hendon and begin pre-ops training your life is gonna be kinda miserable. But then again look forward to the day you don your Red Beret and keep forging on :)</p>

              <p>Hi guys. I will be going for my medical checkup next week, and should be enlisting next year. My question is:</p>
              <p>1) I want to volunteer to join commandos, what are my chances of going for the VA interview?</p>
              <p>2) How should i express interest? Have to email/call cmpb? Or talk to the service counter during medical checkup?</p>
