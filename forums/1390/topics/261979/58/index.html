              <p><strong>The khaki beret and Guards tab do not come easy, as 
              more than 100 soldiers find out after embarking on a journey to become 
              part of this elite group.</strong></p>
              <p>In the still of the night at 1am, they seem like dead men walking. 
              After three days of rigorous physical training with little rest, 122 
              soldiers are roused abruptly from their much-needed sleep, packed into 
              5-tonners and transported to the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Ferry 
              Terminal.</p>
              <p>As they march from the terminal, some hobble and some limp, their 
              bone-weary and heavily-blistered bodies barely holding up the weight of 
              their Full Battle Order (FBO). They are the very picture of extreme 
              fatigue.</p>
              <p><strong>Guards 101</strong></p>
              <p>Just 22 days ago, 131 Guardsmen-to-be stood fresh-faced on the parade
               square with only one goal: to graduate from the Guards Conversion 
              Course (GCC) and don the khaki beret and Guards tab.</p>
              <p>Reputed to be physically gruelling and mentally taxing, the 
              three-week GCC trains soldiers posted to the Guards formation in 
              technical skills such as setting up helicopter landing sites and 
              insertion into hostile territory by heli-rappelling.</p>
              <p>To successfully graduate from the course, trainees are required to 
              complete a 12km fast march in 108 minutes, a 2km coastal swim and a 
              rappel from a helicopter.</p>
              <p>To test their physical and mental limits, they also undergo a Rite of
               Passage (ROP) phase, a series of missions and physical tasks towards 
              the end of GCC before passing out as Guardsmen.</p>
              <p>Should the course prove too challenging at any time, trainees are 
              given the option to ring a bell to signal their intention to drop out of
               the course.</p>
              <p>Course commander 1st Warrant Officer (1WO) Saravanan, who is also the
               Regimental Sergeant Major of 3rd Guards (3 Gds) Battalion, explained 
              the purpose of the GCC: "As Guardsmen enter deep inside hostile terrain 
              in combat, they have to be very strong in their fundamental soldiering 
              skills and be able to work closely as a team. That's what we aim to 
              develop in trainees during the GCC."</p>
              <p>1st Sergeant (1SG) Alvin Thomas, a 3 Gds Platoon Sergeant and 
              Training Cohort Specialist for this GCC, elaborated: "Guardsmen are land
               warriors of air and sea; we have to be adept on land, and in the air 
              and sea.</p>
              <p>"The heli live descent and coastal swim build trainees' confidence 
              and test their competence to operate in the air and sea, while the fast 
              march trains their speed and endurance on land."</p>
              <p>He continued: "The ROP encourages team dynamics... Trainees are 
              grouped into new syndicates (teams of 12) just before the ROP, so they 
              have to immediately adapt to changes and work as a team to complete the 
              various tasks and missions."</p>
              <p><strong>Always ready </strong></p>
              <p>Staying true to the Guards creed, which ends with the line "Always 
              ready, ready to strike!", the GCC comprised many twists and turns to 
              test the readiness of the trainees.</p>
              <p>Turn-outs, where the instructors wake the trainees up for physical training (PT), happened when least expected.</p>
              <p>Trainee 3rd Sergeant (3SG) Syahrulnizam Bin Aziz recalled the 
              experience of his first turn-out in the early stages of the GCC: "The 
              instructors turned on the lights in our bunks at 3am and shouted 
              'Turn-out! Turn-out!'.</p>
              <p>"The banging and shouting woke us up, and we had to change into our FBO and run to East Coast Park (ECP) for beach PT."</p>
              <p>Flashing his usual optimistic smile, he said: "When we ran back from 
              ECP, our energy level was very high despite our tiredness. We sang and 
              cheered while running, and that was very memorable, because I felt that 
              the turn-out actually bonded us closer together."</p>
              <p>Said 1SG Thomas: "Once, during the course, we even got trainees to 
              report back to camp a few minutes after they had booked out, and we 
              asked them to check their stores and equipment in camp."</p>
              <p>He explained: "We spring such surprises on them to ensure that they 
              are always alert and prepared for anything. (So that) when they become 
              Guardsmen, they will always be ready to be deployed."</p>

              <p><strong>Rising above</strong></p>
              <p>Despite being pushed to their limits, some trainees took pride in overcoming personal challenges during the GCC.</p>
              <p>At the start of the course, 2nd Lieutenant (2LT) Ng Li Bing predicted
               that the fast march would be a major obstacle: "I'm vertically 
              challenged; with shorter legs, doing the fast march will naturally be 
              more difficult."</p>
              <p>Being the only lady in the course, she gave other stronger and taller
               men a run for their money, as she successfully passed the 12km fast 
              march within 108 minutes.</p>
              <p>With memories of the march still fresh in her mind, she said: "The 
              thing that kept me going was the thought that I never want to do this 
              again, so I had to pass it well, and not have to re-take the test."</p>
              <p>For 3SG Elamaran s/o Ambalagan, the coastal swim was something he did
               not look forward to, revealing that he was not a good swimmer.</p>
              <p>He gave an account of his experience during the swim that took about 
              three hours: "We swam against the current most of the time, which made 
              us drift further away... It felt like we were never going to finish the 
              swim, but as we sang the Liverpool song <em>You'll never walk alone</em>, it boosted our spirits and kept us swimming."</p>
              <p>Another trainee 3SG Chester Tay added: "My syndicate came up with the
               strategy to place the weak swimmers, including me, in the centre, and 
              have the stronger swimmers flank the weaker ones. After completing the 
              swim as a group, there's this sense of achievement because before this, I
               couldn't swim for more than 100m at a stretch."</p>
              <p>The heli live descent was another major obstacle for 3SG Tay, who had a fear of heights before the GCC.</p>
              <p>Remembering how his legs shook while standing at the edge of the 
              tower which he had to rappel from, he found the confidence to rappel 
              from a helicopter after progressive training.</p>
              <p>"It's a unique feeling to be in a helicopter for the first time! Up 
              in the helicopter, I kept going through what I learnt about rappelling, 
              and surprisingly, I wasn't as scared as I thought I'd be," said 3SG Tay 
              after the heli live descent.</p>

              <p><strong>Breaking point</strong></p>
              <p>While the heli live descent, coastal swim and 12km fast march proved 
              difficult for some trainees, the three tasks were merely the tip of the 
              iceberg. Nothing quite prepared them for the ROP.</p>
              <p>Out in the field for three whole days with little opportunity to 
              rest, the trainees were continuously given tasks to do, such as dragging
               tyres through the mud, carrying fellow trainees on their backs or 
              carrying 140kg logs on their shoulders. All the technical skills they 
              learnt during the GCC were put to the test as they also carried out an 
              attack mission in a built-up area.</p>
              <p>"I'd expected that our commander's ROP would be tough... I was 
              mentally prepared, but it took everything out of me physically. It's the
               toughest experience in my life," said trainee 3SG Harikrishnan 
              Veerasamy.</p>
              <p>Even trainee 3SG Alvin Lim, who was later awarded the Best in 
              Physical Training, found the ROP a challenging experience: "I've gone 
              through BMT (Basic Military Training) and SCS (Specialist Cadet School),
               but it's only during the GCC that I experienced this kind of extreme 
              physical exhaustion.</p>
              <p>"The GCC really pushes you to the point where you'll know where your limits are, what your breaking point is."</p>
              <p>1SG Thomas added: "Although the GCC tests the trainees' mental and 
              physical limits, the instructors always have their safety foremost in 
              mind, and we also train them to look out for themselves and their 
              buddies."</p>

              <p><strong>Trained Guardsmen</strong></p>
              <p>There is a saying that the GCC never ends, but it did on the morning 
              of 6 Aug at Bedok Camp. At the graduation parade, the remaining 122 
              trainees stood before proud family members, looking the worse for wear 
              after the three-week ordeal, but maintaining their high spirits 
              nonetheless.</p>
              <p>Chief Guards Officer Colonel Nelson Yau commended the graduands: "In 
              the past three weeks, you have undergone the toughest training yet in 
              your Army experience... You have displayed the confidence, fortitude and
               determination required of a Guards commander."</p>
              <p>As the khaki berets and Guards tabs were presented to the graduands, 
              the loudest cheers came not from family members, but from the 
              instructors. 1WO Saravanan expressed his approval for the graduating 
              batch: "When they first came in, what we saw were individuals trying to 
              get this GCC over and done with.</p>
              <p>"Today, you can see that they are a team, always looking out for one another...and we're very proud to see that in them."</p>
              <p>Looking back at the past three weeks, 3SG Syahrulnizam said: "This 
              course showed me the true character of my friends, that they are willing
               to help and encourage one another during times of intense stress."</p>
              <p>He also spoke about how the course changed him: "I've grown to be 
              more like a soldier. I'm now mentally and physically tougher. It has 
              taught me resilience; to keep pushing on no matter what happens."</p>
              <p>Having demonstrated an indomitable spirit and comradeship during the 
              trying course, these soldiers marched out of the parade square with the 
              symbolic Guards tabs on their sleeves and khaki berets on their heads, 
              having earned themselves the right to be called Guardsmen.</p>

              <p><strong>MINDEF: CSNS will not be reviewing specifics of the IPPT</strong></p>
              <p>The Straits Times' article "SAF Soldiers' IPPT Likely to 
              Change" (dated 23 Oct 2013) was speculative and misleading. The 
              Committee to Strengthen National Service will not be reviewing specifics
               of the IPPT, which is an SAF matter as it deals with the combat fitness
               of our soldiers. The SAF does review its training programs 
              periodically, including those for combat fitness but has not decided on 
              any changes to the IPPT format.</p>
