                  that you can do anything with it like trying to "save" some Ah Beng
                  who was unfortunate to catch your eye.  The fact is that every

                  properly trained PROFESSIONALS use research information
                  responsibly, specifically to prevent untold damage being done by
                  QUACKS like you running off half-cocked. </p>
              <p>It’s ludicrously ironic that you spout all this crap about being
                  civic-minded when you haven’t the foggiest idea how your spewing

              <p>No problem James. Glad to be of any help. Dont worry too much,
                      give yourself a chance. Because you have never push yourself hard,
                      thus you do not know how far your body can go. If you really are
                      interested, state it in the interview, you may be given a chance.
                      After all, fitness can indeed be trained, and no mistakes, you will
                      be trained hard.</p>
              <p>Lokey, to answer your question, my user was only created 30th
                      dec, so how to answer before that? Lol. And yes, dentists and
                      lawyers, may not earn as much as what people thinks. Even a
                      non-specialised medical doctor is hard pressed to earn a 5-digit
                      salary here. We are not talking about the professions top earners,
                      but the average. My dad was a man in the army (during his time
                      officers and specs are largely regulars). So to mindef and to me,
                      it’s a bit idiotic to pay a rifleman $xx,xxx to chiong a 2-3 week
                      ict. Unless you are an officer holding a high post eg CO of a ns
                      battalion.</p>

              <p>It is ok. Most people ask such questions for fun only in this thread. In fact, soldiers are trained not to ask questions and just follow orders. So they failed by asking too much questions when they actually want to sign on the first place.</p>
              <p>I WAS a MO PA/Clerk in the Navy. When I reviewed my own posting just now. I dont think I was wrong. A person with heart murmur can be Pes B1, and Pes A/B1 person can be a commando. This is right, on the medical perspective. </p>
              <p>Do you even realise that for IPPT, service and combat person needs to achieve B+21 for 5 stations for gold, whereas the same person (as a commando/diver) need to get B+23 for silver. From my shoes, I (as a service men) actually need to get a gold, if I am a commando. That person will be losing $200 every year, for just being in that vocation!</p>
              <p>That is how I do the posting in my past (cose I am the one who is doing it). May be SAF is having a lack of manpower now. What I see is in my ex-reservist unit now, several of my platoon mates own a bus company, dentists, resturants, leather company? and ... May be medic worth more than rifleman in the SAF than we think.The doctors get called back regardless of their age, earning and pes status.</p>

              They will not inform you on whether you are selected. Rather, 3 months before enlistment, they will sent you your enlistment letter, on where to report. For the mainstream, it's tekong island. Commando trainees will be pasir ris camp.
                      
              If you defer, the va will not be valid as I think it has an expiry date. I.e if you're not enlisting that year, they will not use that results for future assessment. You have to be randomly selected for va again. It's 250 selected/1500 called for va/ 20,000 NSF a year.
