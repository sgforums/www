              <p>yes. Heart murmur, and Myopia is a big deal. If you wan to get in commando, whether it is under table or above table, I can get you in. But it just does not make sense for you to sign on as a commando. Anyway they will screen you.  Dont worry too much.</p>

              <p>Murmurs vary widely in degrees of seriousness, so you're going to have to find out more detail at the next consultation.  By and large, the reality is that no medical officer is going to risk having to answer for an NS man dropping dead, so if there's any doubt, I'd bet on the MO recommending against your getting in to CDO.</p>

              <p>I'll make you a deal.  PM me your name and I'll call either
                  George or Chang and ask if they've ever heard of you.  In
                  front of everyone in this forum, I guarantee right here and now
                  that if they confirm your bona fides, I'll issue you the most
                  public apology you've ever seen.</p>
              <p>Okay, I'll fess up.  I'm convinced that you're just
                  entirely full of shit, and your playing coy about the details only
                  serves to prove my point.  You can't back up your claims for
                  one simple reason:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>AS USUAL, YOU'RE
                  LYING.</strong></span></span></p>

              <p>Not many people get selected into the "commando selection" in the first place. If one know the people inside the circle, he can get him to write a recommendation letter to introduce another to the unit. Of course, that person must meet the minimum requirement. My networking with Mindef, and other units is not bad, hence I dont see this much of a issue.</p>
              <p>My friend have been reposted to NDU, because his father has called up the NDU unit. And his original posting is Tekong on paper. So it can be done.</p>
              <p>It is not right for you accuse another for lying without sufficient evidences, moreover, you claimed to a registered professional previously. Better reflect your action.</p>

              <p>Well gee whiz, tiger, that’s a big departure from your “if you want in, I can get you in” bullshit, isn’t it?</p>
              <p>Yes, yes, your next sidestep is that of course there are minimum requirements.  Well, sonny boy, in the same post as your “I can get you in claim” you wrote “Heart murmur, and Myopia is a big deal”, so you already knew precisely what you were claiming and who you were claiming it to, and it's only now, when you've belatedly realised that you can't get away with such bullshit, that you ease back on the tall stories. Too late, sport.  The only person too stupid to see your limitations is – guess who? – YOU!</p>
              <p>So, you’ve made a big claim, and at the first sign of trouble you’ve tried to weasel your way out of the inevitable revelation of your lies, but you forgot the clear proof that you knew you were making an unlimited claim in a situation where you knew the limits.</p>
              <p>So, in accordance with your sage advice, I have reflected upon my actions, and as a “registered professional” I have this to say:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br></span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">THERE'S YOUR EVIDENCE THAT YOU'RE A LIAR</span></strong></span>.</p>
              <p>Anyway, it seems that you’ve provided a few other fun bits here.  Let’s see:</p>

              <p>Circle?  Oh my, is this like Robert deNiro’s “circle of trust” in Meet the Parents?  Or is it a Ring-of-Roses kind of thing?  A doughnut, maybe?</p>
              <p>You’ve claimed that you have a “network” in Mindef, and what I said before still stands: until you actually provide some evidence to support your claim, I say you’re making up stories, and you’re a liar by definition.</p>
              <p>If there is such a “circle”, the only thing it means is that you’ve just revealed a group that has acted to corrupt the processes of the SAF.  If money has changed hands in the process, God help you and your little friends if the SAF looks into this matter.</p>
              <p>So, you have two choices, my boy: either tuck your tail in and take your beating like a good little boy, or put your mates in the line of fire for corrupt practices.  Your choice.</p>
              <p>Look, I’ll make it easy for you.  I’m already convinced that you’re bullshitting, so why not grow up and just admit that you’ve been lying as usual, and leave it at that?  It’s not as if you’re ever going to be able to provide proof anyway, so don't go getting people in trouble for absolutely nothing.</p>
              <p>By the way, a word of advice – make sure you never end up in court.  At the rate you’re going, you would walk in to pay a littering fine and end up convicted of murder.  Yeah, you’re that stupid.</p>

              <p>You want to claim to be concise when you have already confessed to DELIBERATELY not being clear?  Do you even know what "concise' means, you dumb fuck?  Really now, how many times did your mother bounce you on your head as a baby?</p>
              <p>You really are a retard.</p>
              <p>In any case, Squaresss already talked about getting into the VA - do you know what the "V" in "VA" stands for, asshole?  Do cooks, clerks, storemen and drivers go for VA?  If not, what the fuck are you bringing up your pathetic misguided claims for?  Just to have something to say and in so doing deny being the useless piece of shit clinging on the pubic hair on on the arse of humanity that you are?</p>
              <p>It all becomes clear now.  You talk about your "PhD", your "research" and all that other bullshit, but it's just like this, isn't it?  Is it only a matter of time when you claim that when you said "PhD", your meant "permanent head damage"?  Or when you meant "research" that it's the sort of thing that Primary 5 students do for their homework?</p>
              <p>All you do is play stupid fine-print games to impress the unaware, and the moment people start asking question, your pathetic house of cards falls over and your true miserable existence is revealed.</p>
