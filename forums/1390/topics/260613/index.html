            <div class='col-md body'>Allow me a late post  ... you may find alot of similarities between what you will be doing in BEC in the mission tasking of a similar formation in the US Army ...<br><br><a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/5-170/index.html" rel="nofollow">US Army Field Manual FM 5-170: Engineer Reconnaissance</a><br><br><blockquote><br><strong>MISSIONS</strong><br><br>An engineer recon team's primary mission is collecting tactical and technical information for the supported or parent unit. The team must be able to perform this mission mounted or dismounted, during the day or at night, and in various terrain conditions.<br><br>A tactical recon is conducted in a high-threat environment and is a combined-arms effort to--<br><br>* Collect information about the enemy's location and obstacles and the terrain within the AO.<br>* Conduct limited marking of obstacles, routes, and demolition work.<br>* Conduct limited reduction of obstacles in conjunction with maneuver units.<br><br>A technical recon is conducted in a low-threat environment. It may or may not be a combined-arms effort to collect engineer-specific technical data on a point or area target or route (see Chapter 5).<br><br><strong>CHARACTERISTICS, CAPABILITIES, AND LIMITATIONS</strong><br><br>An engineer recon team normally conducts operations as part of a larger combined-arms force. This team has capabilities and limitations that must be considered when they are employed.<br>General Organizational Characteristics<br><br>Characteristics of a typical recon team include the following:<br><br>* The engineer recon team usually depends on both the parent and supported unit for combat support (CS) and combat service support (CSS).<br>* The scout platoon may perform a recon of two routes simultaneously (for trafficability only) if the engineer recon team is performing a recon with a HMMWV scout platoon.<br>* The engineer element will assist in reconning a zone 3 to 5 kilometers wide when working with a scout platoon during a zone recon mission. Mission, enemy, terrain, troops, and time available (METT-T) conditions may increase or decrease the zone's size.<br>* The engineer recon team must train and rehearse in detail with the unit it supports to ensure that all soldiers understand the recon TTP.<br><br><strong>Engineer Recon Team Capabilities</strong><br><br>An engineer recon team has the following capabilities. It--<br><br>* Increases the supporting unit's recon capability concerning complex mine and wire obstacle systems, enemy engineer activities, and details of mobility along a route.<br>* Provides detailed technical information on any encountered obstacle.<br>* Conducts an analysis of what assets will be needed to reduce any encountered obstacle.<br>* Marks bypasses of obstacles based on guidance from the supported commander. This guidance includes whether to mark bypasses and in which direction the force should maneuver when bypassing an obstacle.<br>* Assists in gathering basic enemy information.<br>* Provides detailed technical information on routes (including classification) and specific information on any bridges, tunnels, fords, and ferries along the route.<br>* Assists in acquiring enemy engineer equipment on the battlefield.<br>* Assists in guiding the breach force to the obstacle to be reduced.<br><br><strong>Engineer Recon Team Limitations</strong><br><br>An engineer recon team has the following limitations:<br><br>* Engineer battalions do not have personnel and equipment listed on the table(s) of organization and equipment (TOE) and the modified table(s) of organization and equipment (MTOE) dedicated to conduct a recon (see Figures 1-1 through 1-5).<br>* The recon team has a limited ability to destroy or repel enemy recon units and security forces.<br>* The distance the engineer recon team can operate away from the main body is restricted to the range of communications, the range of supporting indirect fires, and the ability to perform CSS operations.<br>* The recon team has a limited communications capability. Based on the radio configuration of the vehicle used during the recon and whether the engineer recon team is working under a maneuver element's control, dedicated monitoring of engineer nets may be difficult. However, with the single-channel, ground-to-air radio system (SINCGARS), the recon team should be able to scan critical engineer nets or, at the very least, easily switch to the engineer net to report obstacle intelligence (OBSTINTEL).<br>* The engineer recon team has very limited obstacle creation and reduction ability. It normally carries only a light basic load of demolitions, according to the unit's SOP. Obstacle reduction is normally limited to manually reducing obstacles not covered by enemy fires and observation.</blockquote>Just think of it as the job you used to do but with a more technical slant to it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
