              <p>If you didn't clear your bmt, then u will likely be sent back sometime after your driving course when they have slots for the bmt intake. That could be few months later or a year later depending on when your driving course starts.</p>
              <p>As for driving course, it can be fun or stressful depending on your instructor and your progress in the course. Be mentally prepared to drive large vehicles and of course drive safely. For the period of the course, you would be staying in from Sunday night till Saturday noon at Sembawang camp (5.5 days) if they didn't change it, but the training will be done elsewhere.</p>
