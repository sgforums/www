            <div class='col-md body'>As according to the thread I would just like to add this.Do not judge a soldier by the number of badges he has as he might just fail you one day.The badges only indicate the type of training a person has gone through,it does not indicate how good he is as a human being.A warrior without moral values is not worth being celebrated cuz he is prone to be selfish in times of adversity. I see names of people whom I once knew in the SAF and I think they have come a long way and deserve to be what they are today and for those who are only good at Wayang &amp; Arrowing ....Well I am pretty sure you all know who they are out there so no need for names.</div>
