Not just the parachuting side. During my time when I met him in my reservist, he was sent on various courses... mountaineering, chemical warfare etc etc.  I don't think he was in cold storage in my reserve unit, in fact we had a few regulars, officers and WOs with us , who were ex- SOF and other "high flying" vocations.
