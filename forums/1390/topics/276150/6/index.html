            <div class='col-md body'>I had fever outfield once.  It started at 37.9or smth abt there.<br><br>Then I went to the medic to show him my temperature.  He asked me to drink water on the spot and then take the temperature.  So after gulping down some water.  The temperature drop to 36.6 or smth.  Then the medic smiled at me, n say, "SEee nO fever!"<br><br>So I continue training for another 2 hrs or so b4 my buddy urged me to see the medic again.  So i went there, Fever was 38.5 or smth already.  The medic asked me to drink water again b4 taking temperature.  Then it showed 37.4.  No fever he says.<br><br>So went back.  So i made it a point to keep drinking water cos I really didnt feel well.  Until the 3rd time, I went to see him again, 38.5 or so, he asked me to drink again... so happened my OC was around.  Den I highlighted wad the medic asked me to do to him.<br><br>On the spot, the OC farked the medic, and sent me to medical center straight away.  Which was damn heng, cos by the time I reach medical center to take temperature, it was already 39.8.  And yes. I remember I felt like I didn't want to move but lie down somewhere cool n shady n just sleeeeep.  Walking feels like you're on a bus where the bus driver like to step the break a lot.<br><br>Anyways, strangely.  The MO saw me, and sent me packing home on Attend C.  I asked the MO if I could stay in sick bay instead, but was refused.  Im still mystified by the decision.  Ended up, I had to march all the way to ferry terminal on my own, cos the COS was on duty doing "something else."<br><br>Managed to make it home and lived to tell the tale.<br><br>Moral of the story, Not all OCs are bad, and all medics are good.  If you sense something wrong, ask someone.  If you don't look after your own life, you'll probably lose it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Shotgun:</div><div class="quote_body">I had fever outfield once.  It started at 37.9or smth abt there.<br><br>Then I went to the medic to show him my temperature.  He asked me to drink water on the spot and then take the temperature.  So after gulping down some water.  The temperature drop to 36.6 or smth.  Then the medic smiled at me, n say, "SEee nO fever!"<br><br>So I continue training for another 2 hrs or so b4 my buddy urged me to see the medic again.  So i went there, Fever was 38.5 or smth already.  The medic asked me to drink water again b4 taking temperature.  Then it showed 37.4.  No fever he says.<br><br>So went back.  So i made it a point to keep drinking water cos I really didnt feel well.  Until the 3rd time, I went to see him again, 38.5 or so, he asked me to drink again... so happened my OC was around.  Den I highlighted wad the medic asked me to do to him.<br><br>On the spot, the OC farked the medic, and sent me to medical center straight away.  Which was damn heng, cos by the time I reach medical center to take temperature, it was already 39.8.  And yes. I remember I felt like I didn't want to move but lie down somewhere cool n shady n just sleeeeep.  Walking feels like you're on a bus where the bus driver like to step the break a lot.<br><br>Anyways, strangely.  The MO saw me, and sent me packing home on Attend C.  I asked the MO if I could stay in sick bay instead, but was refused.  Im still mystified by the decision.  Ended up, I had to march all the way to ferry terminal on my own, cos the COS was on duty doing "something else."<br><br>Managed to make it home and lived to tell the tale.<br><br>Moral of the story, Not all OCs are bad, and all medics are good.  If you sense something wrong, ask someone.  If you don't look after your own life, you'll probably lose it. </div></blockquote>Shotgun.. drinking water lowers your temperature temporarily just as puting ice in your mouth will affect the temperature reading.</div>
