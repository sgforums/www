            <div class='col-md body'>Your 6 years bond starts after you complete your degree. I don't think it includes NS since you need to complete your NS before going for your degree. 6 years is not a long time, but adding the 2 years NS and 4 years degree programmes will bring you to your mid-30s.<br><br>Its not a bad programme though. Having a salary during your studies makes you one-up against your peers. You will have a peace of mid concentrating on your studies, without worrying about money. And for getting a regular pay during NS and for 4 years of study, it is only right to serve a bond after that.<br><br>The question now is what you intend to do after 30 years old. If you discipline yourself properly, and start investing wisely while still in the Army, you will be prepared for your next step into civilian world.<br><br>Its a big step out. At the rank of MAJ to LTC, you can expect a big pay cut, if you are seeking employment. There are success stories from ex-regulars, but many end up as insurance agents, housing agents and taxi-drivers. I know some ex-regulars who cannot even get a job half the pay. So, save up while still in the Army, because the next best thing is start your own business.<br><br></div>

Just curious, what is the job prospect like for regulars after they finish their bond with the SAF? And are there any rules/guidelines suah that when you're serving you cannot be like owning a 2nd job or owning a company in your own name? I'm asking because my group of 4 friends are intending to like start an ad.agency or marketing firm. So yeah...hope to gain some valuable insights on that.</div>

I can understand why people signed on as Specialist in technical posts, but never understood the rationale for infantry specialists.<br><br>Air Force technicians have skill set that is required in the market. About being able to lead and people management is bull****. I do appreciate some integrity and good planning abilities, but that does not justify for the kind of pay.<br><br>I think COLs and above can get jobs as Directors in other Government Ministries or Government-linked companies. Below that rank, things seem not so rosy. In a big company, why employ a MAJ / LTC to be a Manager, when there are so many candidates within the set-up to fill that post. Surely, you want to groom your existing loyal staff. In a small company, how many can afford to pay a MAJ / LTC salary. Fresh, young and 'teachable' graduates that cost less than half makes more sense. If you end your contract with the Army below the rank of Captain, I think the general perception is that this fella is screwed up.<br><br>There are rules on moonlighting, but I do not want to cross the line to suggest something else.</div>

I was one who saw the monetary benefits offered by SAF and nearly sold my soul to them.  Finally, when I remembered the regimental life style, the sh!t rollin down the hill, I asked myself, "Is this what I really want for the next 10 years? Working with unmotivated ppl who shrug their responsibilities, arrowing NSFs? Having so much beauracracy built around me..."<br><br>The money may be attractive, but who is to say that there aren't better opportunities in future? Don't sign on, unless u really love the military.

Post largely based on what I have heard!<br><br>If you are doing it for the money, have you though of other uniformed organizations like the Civil defence? Same salary but the retirement age is 50.<br><br>Further, in the CD, you will have plenty of opportunity to practise what you trained for and possibly to get qualifications like Hazmat (dealing with hazardous materials) certs etc.<br><br>I know the CD isn't seen in the best light by everyone but if you can get over that i think it is a good option.</div>
