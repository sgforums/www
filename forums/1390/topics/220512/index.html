            <div class='col-md body'>Need some advice from our bros here. I'm a poly student currently studying business and i plan to further my studies to a degree. I've always thought of a career either in the army or the business world. I've since chanced upon the SAF academic scholarship. Would it enable me to rise in ranks quicker. and does the 6 years bond include NS? what if i apply for it after my ns? or would a life in the business world be better (pay-wise)?<br><br>A Big thanks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Coz you will stagnate all the way as an officer if you only have a poly dip.<br><br>Dont wanna be a wet blanket but unless your poly results are really superb-like top 5% every sem,you can forget about securing for any SAF academic scholarship. SAF scholarships are reserved for air levels people with S papers.The Local Study Award(LSA) is a more realistic option for you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My suggestion:-<br><br>Do ur best, get the best grades u can in poly but dun sign-on yet.<br><br>Then go into army, do BMT liao then make decision.<br><br>Reason is simple, a job in SAF is NOT EQUAL to the commercial u see on TV. Experience the BMT first, if u fit into the army dude persona then go ahead sign on! If u do ur BMT liao but u are still a business man mentality then sign-on is definately a big no-no.<br><br>DUN become my friends, being psycho by the recruitment talk, action, money, etc, etc then sign-on for 10 years then found out they are not army material then KPKB. Y? sign-on liao black and white, army is not something u cannot suka suka quit one, got penalties one.<br><br>So be wise, experience first then decide.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>even better, sign on after u have experienced unit life. cos BMT/SISPEC/OCS is pretty much sheltered from the reality of the SAF.<br>we are talking about 6 yrs of ur life here. remember; when u get out of the army, u have almost ZERO industry work experience.<br>anyway, how many ppl actually encourage u to sign on? think this is a good indicator of how "good" the SAF is, rite?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>feel free to ask us questions.<br><br>cheers,<br></div>
