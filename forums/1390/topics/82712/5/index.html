Including carrying of heavy loads, cleaning up big tanks, loading supplies. They are as physically exhausting as those in combat side. Compares tp those instructors who sit around doing nothing all day., they deserved better.</strong><br><br>2) Those in clerks vocations, have tons of paperworks to do. Some of which are very important and they always have to rush reports. This no doubt gives them mental stress so they deserved better.<br><br>3) Most combat personnel get to stay in. They don't need to have transportation allowances. Service personnel are likely to go home everyday. They need their transportation fees and of coz dinner... Combat get 3 meals a day. Service only gets lunch.<br><br>4) They already have their combat pay. What more they want? Service are as dangerous as combat. Some deal with ammo, some deal with tanks, some deal with heavy machinery, some deal with tons of highly sensitive paperworks, all these are as dangerous as those in combat.<br><br>5) Service personnel are always the ones to be tasked to do sai kang. Because combat people are more important, sai kang always left to the service personnel.<br><br>In other words, SAF SUCKS!!!!!! They looked down on service personnel. Without us, the SAF could'nt work at all. GO TO HELL, top personnel of the SAF. [/b]</blockquote>I totally agree with you, especially the fact that logistics and maintenance do form the backbone fo the SAF, and without us, the combatants would be fighting with guts and bare hands.Many do not like to face this fact, but who does the grunt work for the combatants to fire their weapons, drive their Bionixes, sleep in their bunks, eat at the cookhouses, jump out of a plane and land safely...the list goes on.<br><br>Maintaining the increasingly lethal and complex weapon systems is no mean feat.There is a reason why NSF technicians and ammo personnel are given Specialist ranks..Due to the very specialised and vital tasks of their jobs.How many combatants do understand the whole process of getting that often- IA SAW or L7A1 GPMG fixed?They merely see the process of sending that defective weapon to the unit armourer, then their loop is closed.Do they see the high stress level involved in shouldering the repair and upkeep of the entire SAF's inventory of small arms and heavy arms? The term "Service" is a misnomer.We are not living in wonderland as most uninformed combatants perceive us to be.Yes, the only privilege we may get over the combat vocationalist is the higher chance of staying out in a 8-5 job.But our work is just as onerous.<br><br>This is not to say that we are bitter towards our brothers in combat, its more of a deal which has been found wanting for a very long time.Put us in company-level combat SOP and we might screw up the whole show, place a Guards BRC to interact with DSTA, ODE or ST Logistics, or handle the documentation, maintenance programs and perform BCMIS costing for a whole formation, and he might be at a complete loss.We perform equal but dissimilar tasks, and furthermore as conscripts, we do not have a choice in our posting or vocation.What is needed is fair remuneration.Any increase in pay should not allow too much of an imbalance between vocations and smart pay polices to compensate at unique levels of need are required.If there is a pay increment, it should be across the board.Nothing more, nothing less.We serve the country, let her be an appreciatve mistress. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Percieve it this way: The raises given to combat vocations are a fair compensation towards the risk that they take. I mean, being in combat means putting your live at risk all the time. Why do you think that people in armour get higher pay than normal infantry? They risk getting hurt even in normal peacetime. Why do divers get a "diving allowance"? They risk getting hurt underwater, with little recourse to save them in time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by edLow:</div><div class="quote_body">Source I heard:<br><br>MEN/SPECIALISTS: add $150<br>OFFICERS: add $300 to $400<br><br>For the men/specialists' increment, it's likely confirm. My frd heard it from his CO parade already, but the amount isnt confirm.<br><br>As for the officers' increment, I have no idea. They shouldnt increase the officers allowance. Becos there are too many of black sheeps among them whom are doing nothing except wasting SAF resources</div></blockquote>Hmm... I would say that such an increase for officers might be an overkill... Sadly speaking, as would some from service vocations would state, such a skewered increase would be an unfair proposition biased towards the pyramid peak of the whole armed forces, leaving the base of the pyramid with a rawer deal. We see this even in everyday life: CEOs earning the top dollar, all the while common workers for the same company earn multiple times smaller, but do more work.<br><br>I do agree, support vocations are hardly recognised. Do you think a tourist to Singapore would commend a road sweeper for the impeecably clean roads, or give the kudos to the entity called "the Singapore government"?<br><br>In my secondary school, I chose to join AVA, a support oriented club to all the performing CCAs, and the school functions. However, there was hardly any recognition for the work we did. As a committee member then, I had to boost the members' morales whenever the organisers went on stage and thanked "the canteen auntie for feeding them, the teachers for their inputs".<br><br>Conclusion? When you are doing support stuff, it is very unlikely you get the recognition you deserve.</div>

How do I know? I am a bike rider, so I know the risks drivers face. I have seen fellow platoon mates, tired from training, drive from the expressway lane 3 to 2, and sometimes tailgate other vehicles in their semi-conscious states.<br><br>I have also personal experiences with being "given the snub" in secondary school. The crux is that as long as we are the "guys behind the stage", we can expect lesser perks than those who show their faces to everyone (sorry for the stage analogy, I have AVA background). No matter how you plead, beg, threaten, society as it is now will remain ignorant of the sacrifices of the support personnels.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the reason why recruits are getting combat pay soon is mainly becos frm recuit rank to private rank is what we call a progressive promotion. it's like u will definately be promoted reguardless of anything. (now recuit don't even need to pass IPPT to pass out of BMT).<br><br>another example is from OCT to 2LT, it's also a progessive rank. that's well a OCT's pay is not much different frm a 2LT.<br><br>it's unlike 3SG rank where we have to earn it by going through hell in SISPEC. that's why a 3SG's pay is $200 more than a CPL.<br><br>so in the end, to all those soon-to-be recruits out there, enjoy your pay.</div>
