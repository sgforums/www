I would not be jealous of my children getting more;things will obviously cost more in the future. That's progress.<br>A better analogy would be the comparison of prices for consumers goods between the "thens" the "now" and the "future". Does'nt make sense that nsfs are paid 500 bucks now and 220 bucks like 3-4 years before. Things just ain't that expensive nowadays. I don't even see a 100% price hike in transportation. It just does'nt add up.</div>

That's progress.<br>A better analogy would be the comparison of prices for consumers goods between the "thens" the "now" and the "future". Does'nt make sense that nsfs are paid 500 bucks now and 220 bucks like 3-4 years before. Things just ain't that expensive nowadays. I don't even see a 100% price hike in transportation. It just does'nt add up.</div></blockquote>btw, 3-4 years ago (tts.. 2000-2001?) the recruits were already getting $350.<br><br>and this 500 thing is, at this moment, still hearsay.<br><br>i hear that you are saying, the quantum of increment is not justifiable. i will agree with you if they really increase it to 500 when they have already done so recently (around 2000-2001) when it was revised to the current 350.<br><br></div>
