              <p>Singapore by "law" did not recognize dual citizenship, but depend on your case like if one of your parent are foreigner, then dual citizenship will only be flexible to be "vaild" until you reach to the age of 21, you would have to make your choice whether you want to be Singaporean or "other" : <a href="http://singapore.usembassy.gov/dual_nationality.html">http://singapore.usembassy.gov/dual_nationality.html</a></p>
              <p>And by 21 year old if you decided to be an Singaporean, You will have to serve NS. And since Singapore is an multi-racial society, why you afraid knowing only English is an disadvanage ?</p>

              <p>Be safe and renounce it now at the embassy. It's as easy as walking in and filling in a few forms.</p>
              <p>If you're a citizen, you're in the system and will be called up, no citizen slips through. At 16.5-17 you'll be asked to "register" for NS, at 18 to serve it, and it is not a choice presented to you at the age of 21.</p>
              <p>On Sg law not recognising dual citizenship: Singapore can't stop you from holding foreign citizenships or make you drop them, but it can enforce the obligations of Singapore citizenship. Holding foreign ones is not a barrier to having to serve NS.</p>
              <p>Letting a Sg passport lapse does not equate to renouncing citizenship. For the sake of the serving population Singapore has to make visible efforts to pursue NS "defaulters". You possess the right to reside in another state. So drop Singapore's now.</p>

              <p>alize are you saying that I should renounce my singapore citizenship, because from what I understand that is not possible until the age of 21, I am reluctant to go but I understand my duty so I am willing to, however, my main concern is that since the CMPB has not yet sent me any notification and since my knowledge of all of the small technicalities is close to none, I might have already done something wrong to penalize my family. </p>
              <p>Also, the 75k bond, is that something that I cannot avoid? My family is not doing great financially and I would hate to have them have to put up 75k bond just because of me.</p>
              <p>M the name, I am mostly concerned because of the cultural differences and the fact that my lifestyle there will be more difficult without being able to relate. I was just wondering whether people would be open to a foreigner like myself rather than being harsh or demeaning. I understand the fact that being in the army might mean more to some than others, and that power might lead them into being not as welcoming so to say.</p>

              <p>@ntoh,</p>
              <p>You think just because we are singaporean you think we have "special" treatment in NS? Go and ask your singaporean friends especially those in combat side whether they go through BMT, have to walk 8km route march with "Ali Baba" bag, drink water parade with a bottle of water, and if during late night, got changing parade to dress in full battle order etc. Surprisely it is these "hardship" that bound us together and make many new friends.</p>
              <p>And in Singapore, unless your batch have some "white horses" 's sons (you can also check out what this term mean) when you served your term, chance are your training might not be so tough after all. And their son might also be mixed blood with one parent being an foreigner like you. You are not the only one if you know what I mean.</p>

              <p>While recognizing the existence of <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1753.html">dual nationality</a>,
               the U.S. Government does not encourage it as a matter of policy because
               of the problems it may cause. Dual nationality may hamper efforts by 
              the U.S. Government to provide diplomatic and consular protection to 
              individuals overseas.  When a U.S. citizen is in the other country of 
              their dual nationality, that country has a predominant claim on the 
              person.  A foreign country might claim you as a citizen of that country 
              if (a) you were born there; (b) your parent or parents (and sometimes 
              grandparents) are or were citizens of that country or (c) you are a 
              naturalized U.S. citizen but are still considered a citizen under that 
              country’s laws.  (The oath you take when you are naturalized as a U.S. 
              citizen (<a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/get-cfr.cgi?TITLE=8&amp;PART=337&amp;SECTION=1&amp;TYPE=TEXT">8 CFR 337.1</a>)
               doesn’t mean the foreign country does not still regard you as a citizen
               of that country.)  Public inquiries about the citizenship laws of other
               countries should be directed to the embassy or consulate of that 
              country in the United States.  <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-4140.html">8 U.S.C. 1185(b)</a> (Section 215(b) INA) and <a href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=3c1bc943f003a0dfdce7af7585dcba6a;rgn=div5;view=text;node=22%3A1.0.1.6.35;idno=22;cc=ecfr">22 CFR 53.1</a> require that U.S. citizens exit and enter the United States on a U.S. passport, with certain limited exceptions (<a href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=3c1bc943f003a0dfdce7af7585dcba6a;rgn=div5;view=text;node=22%3A1.0.1.6.35;idno=22;cc=ecfr">22 CFR 53.2</a>).</p>
              <p>Under Singaporean law, an individual who automatically acquires 
              Singaporean citizenship at birth retains that status even after 
              acquiring U.S. citizenship. Singapore does not recognize dual 
              nationality beyond the age of 21. </p>
              <p><strong>If you wish to renounce your U.S. citizenship, please send an

              <p>A
               U.S. citizen who is a resident or citizen of a foreign country may be 
              subject to compulsory military service in that country.
                                       Although the United States recognizes the 
              problems that may be caused by such foreign military service, there is 
              little that
                                      we can do to prevent it since each sovereign 
              country has the right to make its own laws on military service and apply
               them
                                      as it sees fit to its citizens and residents.</p>
              <p>Such
               participation by citizens of our country in the internal affairs of 
              foreign countries can cause problems in the conduct
                                      of our foreign relations and may involve U.S. 
              citizens in hostilities against countries with which we are at peace. 
              For this
                                      reason, U.S. citizens facing the possibility of 
              foreign military service should do what is legally possible to avoid 
              such
                                      service.</p>
              <p>Federal statutes long in force prohibit certain aspects of foreign military service originating within the United States.
                                      The current laws are set forth in Section 958-960 of Title 18 of the United States Code. In <strong><em>Wiborg v. U.S.</em></strong> , 163 U.S. 632 (1896), the Supreme Court endorsed a lower court ruling 
              that it was not a crime under U.S. law for an individual
                                      to go abroad for the purpose of enlisting in a 
              foreign army; however, when someone has been recruited or hired in he 
              United
                                      States, a violation may have occurred. The 
              prosecution of persons who have violated 18 U.S.C. 958-960 is the 
              responsibility
                                      of the Department of Justice.</p>
              <p>Although a person's enlistment in the armed forces of a foreign country may not constitute a violation of U.S. law, it could
                                      subject him or her to Section 349(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001481----000-.html">8 U.S.C. 1481(a)(3)</a>]
               which provides for loss of U.S. nationality if an American voluntarily 
              and with the intention of relinquishing U.S. citizenship
                                      enters or serves in foreign armed forces engaged
               in hostilities against the United States or serves in the armed forces 
              of
                                      any foreign country as a commissioned or

              <p>Loss of U.S. nationality was almost immediate consequences of foreign military service and the other acts listed in Section
                                      349(a) until 1967 when the Supreme Court handed down its decision in <strong><em>Afroyim v. Rusk</em></strong> , 387 U.S. 253. In that decision, the court declared unconstitutional 
              the provisions of Section 349(a) which provided for
                                      loss of nationality by voting in a foreign 
              election. In so doing, the Supreme Court indicated foreign election. In 
              so doing,
                                      the Supreme Court indicated that a U.S. citizen 
              "has a constitutional right to remain a citizen... unless he voluntarily
               relinquishes
                                      that citizenship."</p>
              <p>Further confirmation of the necessity to establish the citizen's intent to relinquish nationality before expatriation will
                                      result came in the opinion in <strong><em>Vance v. Terrazas</em></strong> , 444 U.S. 252 (1980). The Court stated that "expatriation depends on 
              the will of the citizen rather than on the will of
                                      Congress and its assessment of his conduct." The
               Court also indicated that a person's intention to relinquish U.S. 
              citizenship
                                      may be shown by statements or actions.</p>
              <p>Military
               service in foreign countries usually does not cause loss of citizenship
               since an intention to relinquish citizenship
                                      normally is lacking.  In adjudicating loss of 
              nationality cases, the Department has established an administrative 
              presumption
                                      that a person serving in the armed forces of a 
              foreign state <strong>not</strong> engaged in hostilities against the United States does <strong>not</strong> have the intention to  relinquish citizenship.  Voluntary service in the armed forces of a state engaged in hostilities against
                                      the United States could be viewed as indicative of an intention to relinquish U.S. citizenship.</p>
              <p>Pursuant
               to Section 351(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, a person who 
              served in foreign armed forces while under
                                      the age of eighteen is not considered subject to
               the provisions of Section 349(a)(3) if, within six months of attaining 
              the
                                      age of eighteen, he or she asserts a claim to 
              United States citizenship in the manner prescribed by the Secretary of 
              State.</p>

              <p>My understanding is that Singapore law says you cannot renounce 
              citizenship before the age of 21, but that Singapore law can only apply 
              within Singapore territory. It cannot dictate that you cannot renounce it outside Singapore.</p>

              <p>Those who are liable to serve national service but refuse are

              <p>Controversy arose when the penalties were increased in January

              <p> </p>

              separated from other conscription offenders. The government does

              <p>You think just because we are singaporean you think we have "special" treatment in NS? Go and ask your singaporean friends especially those in combat side whether they go through BMT, have to walk 8km route march with "Ali Baba" bag, drink water parade with a bottle of water, and if during late night, got changing parade to dress in full battle order etc. Surprisely it is these "hardship" that bound us together and make many new friends.</p>
              <p>And in Singapore, unless your batch have some "white horses" 's sons (you can also check out what this term mean) when you served your term, chance are your training might not be so tough after all. And their son might also be mixed blood with one parent being an foreigner like you. You are not the only one if you know what I mean.</p>

              <p>and when u finish your ns.your pay would not be close to what a macdonalds worker gets in the usa even if you worked as an engineer in singapore with decades of experience.the pay of $1million/year only applies to the selected few such as the 200 singaporean politicians or other  business owners!so if u are not a singaporean politician with the PAP and dont own a business raking in millions a year.......why bother with singapore in the first place?</p>
