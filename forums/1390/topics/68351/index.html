You're not the first nothing to come up with some cock-and-bull story about how you caught them off guard, so you've got nothing to be afraid of - the boys will just have a good laugh.<br><br>If you'd actually met us, you wouldn't be depending on the myth what "they say", would you?  That seems to indicate that you know nothing about us.<br><br>Look, forum members like the Bear and the_don (amongst others - y'all know who you are! :mrgreen) have met me in person, so why don't you ask them how "screw loose" I am?

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh, by the way, that kind of mission sounds familiar.  The boys are supposed to raid something like an airbase, and the base commander is told when the attack will be.  The base commander sets up sentries all along the perimeter, and we send some guys to rustle bushes to make them feel better about their alertness.  In the meantime, the other guys scam their way right past the RPs at the gate and casually go do the job.<br><br>Our guys have done that so many times it's no longer funny - you probably fell for the oldest trick in the book, hook, line and sinker.</div>

The boys are supposed to raid something like an airbase, and the base commander is told when the attack will be.  The base commander sets up sentries all along the perimeter, and we send some guys to rustle bushes to make them feel better about their alertness.  In the meantime, the other guys scam their way right past the RPs at the gate and casually go do the job.<br><br>Our guys have done that so many times it's no longer funny - you probably fell for the oldest trick in the book, hook, line and sinker.</div></blockquote>haha that your funny story lor.. everyone have their fair share of they story from ns. haha. but i guess u never read to carefully about my post... haha.. i said i was training with them and take cover with them too. haha....get it??? with and not against.. sighz.. and mi dun need more loose screw commando brothers lah.. i got enough.. haha...my cousin also one of them and just got into a court case for nothing.. haha..</div>
