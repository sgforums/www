              <p>i have a question... my cousin is a regular army officer... if i'm not wrong his rank should be a major at our last Chinese New Year gathering. (only see him once a year), only 28 years old.</p>
              <p>his family owns a steel business, not very big but annual turn-over is about 50 million.(mum told me, i cannot confirm) i understand from my uncle that his son's name is in the business registration since its family business... forgot to mention he's the only boy in his family, the next one is a gal.</p>
              <p>he helps out in his family business frequently, in accounting or even paperwork... i don't know, just hear say and he's paid $200,000 every month, almost a million annually... (just bought a new car again - heard from mum)</p>
              <p>is it legal since he's in the SAF?</p>

              <p>Eh. So what's the point of this entire thread eh?</p>
              <p>You're upset because a specialist says that he earns more than your 'ocifer' husband? I don't know kopiosatu personally, but I can tell you that I do personally know of a regular spec who's a millionaire through shrewd financial planning and investments. And he holds only a PSLE cert. And that's something I think all of us can learn from.</p>
              <p>It's a very narrow-minded way of thinking to imagine that your army rank corresponds to your level of success in life. And ArmyWife, I think you might need some psychiatric assistance. Hard as it may to believe, your husband is NOT the centre of the universe. There ARE people who are more successful than him. For more details, I refer you to the infamous <a href="http://www.mrbrown.com/blog/2001/10/i_is_a_saf_ocif.html">"I is a SAF ocifer"</a> email.</p>
              <p>You keep saying that you want to get the SAF &amp; Mindef to come and look into this thread to investigate this and that. But have you thought about how it'll affect your husband's career prospects if this gets blown up? At a bare minimum, he's gonna become the laughing stock of his entire camp if his identity is ever revealed. Try getting him to read your threads and see his reaction.</p>
              <p>Grow up.</p>

              <p>You amuse me greatly. You must think that a div comm is lower in
              rank than a NSF clerk in Mindef who wears no.3. I don't have to
              tell you his rank or appointment, just that AOs are very common,
              depending on what circle you are in.</p>
              <p>I'm just surprised that you're as naive and silly as to think
              the uniform indicates the CEP or rank or appointment. So a SAFOS
              CPT OC is lower in rank than a private clerk who wears no.3? And a
              38yr old BG Div Comm in no.4 is lower in rank than a 35 yr old MAJ
              CO. very smart....Are you sure you're the guy here who's been
              through NS and i'm the lady?</p>
              <p>Even Neo Kian Hong wears his no.4 to work sometimes when he
              likes! Hahahaa! Are YOU sure you've gone through a DAY in the SAF
              if you even had the wits and embarrassment to say what you said?
              I'm even more shocked that you ask me to show you a COL who wears
              no.4. Are you sure you have gone through army??! Battalion, Brigade
              and Division commanders don't wear no.4? And these appointments
              must be held by LTA and CPT lah in your universe lah?!?. Even for
              just CO, battalion commander the lowest of the 3 command
              appointments i named, I already know those that are LTC (they're
              SAFOS scholars)..... maybe you served in some other army like
              M'sia??</p>
              <p>Vendetta against people with brains? I guess you think a down
              and out sign on spec who now is deluded to boast he earns as much
              as the minister is a president's scholar or something.</p>
              <p>Really, this is funny. it's like the people who are naked think
              they are wearing clothes. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And they have goggles that make them
              think the clothed people are naked.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Funniest is you ask me to know more abt SAF. I think your
              friends here who have actually done their NS are cringing for you.
              Go and serve first then come back.</p>

That's what you said. I quoted you so please, don't try to edit your post. Please read. You said my husband must be around MAJ-LTC because he wears no.4 and you asked me to show you a COL who wears no.4! you said, no.4 = at most MAJ/LTC1. LTC2 and above= no.3"</p>
