              <p><br>Many Thanks. It's great to know that our fellow citizens army are ready to defend our country, however you have sadly missed the point here whereby our fellow regular have decided to leave the force with whatever reasons.</p>
              <p>i don't really see any army bashing except some disatification on his part in the army.</p>

              <p>basically, you admitted to me that you were leaving in 3 days time in order to 'boast' that your freedom is such a short time away. you're basically so farking dumb, because SAF can and will take action against you, even after you leave. You mean they dont have your IC no.? Oh they don't have your address? You don't have to go back to ICT ah?! The only way you can escape punishment for your sideline ah beng 2nd hand hp business is if you leave S'pore ala Melvin Tan, the pianist, and never come back because even Mr Tan was taken to task when he finally returned 30 yrs later! Hahahah!</p>
              <p>The funniest thing is because of your boast, Mindef will even more easily zero in on you, the sign on regular specialist who's leaving in 3 days from yesterday because you have narrowed it down to the exact date for us. Gawd this is god damn funny!</p>
              <p>And at the end of day, i'm not surprised that you're leaving.</p>

              <p>Oh and btw i'll also inform Minister Teo about this case personally after Mindef investigates after the alert sounds. Of cos I'm referring to <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>YOUR claim</strong></span> that only if anyone earned as much as him, then that pay would be higher than your pay when you were/are a non-graduate regular specialist in the SAF. I'm sure he'll be extremely interested in such a sensational news.</p>
              <p>These ah beng hp and lan shops business must be very good, no wonder they're earning more than AO perm secs and close to ministers' salaries.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, Minister Teo will be intrigued too by your amazing ability to control the SG bourse. I'm sure they'll believe you'e divine after you part the Pasir Ris beach and help the PUB find the crocodiles that're hiding there. Then SG gov will even build a church for people to worship you.</p>

              <p>What is the 'show'? Would you like to substantiate the claim that kopiosatu earns close to Teo Chee Hean in the private sector? I'm sure you have been to the moon also and the Bear is actually the US president. Anyway, if it's indeed true that he earns close to Teo Chee Hean in the private sector at his age, it's newsworthy and encouraging for all Singaporeans now battling inflation worries, if his self-proclaimed earning was publicised in a broadsheet. Even motivational speaker Adam Khoo didn't earn so much and Khoo was celebrated for being a young millionaire. So he who got his millions (what he claimed) while moonlighting WHILE he was in the SAF as a REG SPEC should stand up to the scrutiny of truth and the test of his claims? We all know that Minister's salary is over 1 mil per annum. Many parties can test it. From Mindef who has to take him to task for breach of contract to the press who will see this story as the landmark story of the yr.</p>
