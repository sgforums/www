              <p>What is the 'show'? Would you like to substantiate the claim that kopiosatu earns close to Teo Chee Hean in the private sector? I'm sure you have been to the moon also and the Bear is actually the US president. Anyway, if it's indeed true that he earns close to Teo Chee Hean in the private sector, it's newsworthy and encouraging for all Singaporeans now battling inflation worries, if his self-proclaimed earning was publicised in a broadsheet.</p>

              <p>His main crux was the claim/boast of his sideline income close to Teo Chee Hean WHILE he was in the SAF. It was later when he was afraid he'll face reprisals because it had come to my knowledge (an inevitable and unwelcome side-effect from boasting the lie to me), he would face reprisals from the SAF, so he stressed his ORD date.</p>
              <p>Once again i give you face for assumed nominal knowledge as a mod. I'm sure you know as well as i do that ORD date doesn't do anything to reprisals of contract breach.</p>

              million (US$800,000) a year, should be earning S$2.2 million (US$1.45
              million). the story is dated

              <p>"Ministers in the Prime Minister's cabinet will get a 32.5 percent
              increase to US$1.05 million in 2007, rising to US$1.26 million in 2008."</p>

              <p>no no my dear. you can go read. he said he can beat an AO's pay hands down but only a minister's pay can beat his. Ministers are also AOs! AO is a group of people, not one person! Minister, perm sec, directors, generals, all can be AOs if they get into AS. Minister's pay is many more times than Perm Secs. So he claimed his sideline income was so much, that only a Minister's pay can beat his, so he earns much more than Perm secs! Would you like to use Perm Sec's pay instead? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
