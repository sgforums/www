              <p>Hahahaha you can try. You seem to think if a lot of you do it, it will have more effect even when you have no case. Mindef doesn't care that wives of soldiers don't like the uniform! of cos they don't! So you can go and complain that I complained about that. So they wil take action on wives, aunties, uncles and mothers of soldiers who dont like the new uniform ah? What about what anyone does in their married lives? I'm sure it's so incriminating to Mindef??! very very amusing. More people in it, just means more people look stupid.</p>
              <p>Anyway, he said "only a minister's pay of $2 mil" He's not aware that ministers are AOs. So are perm secs. So are Generals. They're ALL AOs. Minister's pay is much more than Perm Sec's. So lets see if his sideline income is anything of a perm sec's? Shall we? Ta!!!!!</p>

              <p>i read through all the posts and what he claims is tat his pay is definitely more than your "supposed" occifer hubby or a superscale grade. Do you know what is superscale grade? Why dont you tell us how much your 2LT/LTA/CAPT/MAJ husband make so we can have a comparison?</p>

              heh i know whats frontpage news gonna be:
              
              SAF officer wife turns to online forum for relieve - 
              Hubby can no longer satisfy her sex life without the old no4 uniform. 
              
              Since Tuesday, an anonymous claimed wife of a current SAF officer has invaded a SAF discussion forum, ranting about her displeasure. It seems the problem had initially stemmed off from the replacement of the no4 uniform that resulted in her possibility of losing what's left of her almost non-existence sex life.  Fellow forumers gathered in-flocks instantly for their lunch-time entertainment, to try to catch a glimpse of the woman who has a uniform fetish. The surprise attention that she has gathered from forumers has most likely sparked off her desire to create more sensational entertainment for the lunch-time crowds, to create more release for her pent-up no sex frustrations. Forumers are encouraged to spread the news about AW to everyone in SAF to try to find out her real identity and to provide a good laugh to more SAF personnel.

              <p>he helps out in his family business frequently, in accounting or even paperwork... i don't know, just hear say and he's paid $200,000 every month, almost a million annually... (just bought a new car again - heard from mum)</p>

              <p>His main crux was the claim/boast of his sideline income close to Teo Chee Hean WHILE he was in the SAF. It was later when he was afraid he'll face reprisals because it had come to my knowledge (an inevitable and unwelcome side-effect from boasting the lie to me), he would face reprisals from the SAF, so he stressed his ORD date.</p>
              <p>Once again i give you face for assumed nominal knowledge as a mod. I'm sure you know as well as i do that ORD date doesn't do anything to reprisals of contract breach.</p>

              <p>i have a question... my cousin is a regular army officer...
              if i'm not wrong his rank should be a major at our last
              Chinese New Year gathering. (only see him once a year), only 28
              years old.</p>
              <p>his family owns a steel business, not very big but annual
              turn-over is about 50 million.(mum told me, i cannot
              confirm) i understand from my uncle that his son's
              name is in the business registration since its
              family business... forgot to mention he's the only boy in his
              family, the next one is a gal.</p>
              <p>he helps out in his family business frequently, in accounting or
              even paperwork... i don't know, just hear say and he's paid
              $200,000 every month, almost a million annually... (just
              bought a new car again - heard from mum)</p>
              <p>is it legal since he's in the SAF?</p>

              <p>As long as he declares his business to SAF, it is legal. It is in the GOM I read before, I think it is under manpower.</p>
