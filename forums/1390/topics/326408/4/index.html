              <p>I know there should probably be a huge number of NSFs who moonlight. I dont know whether there is a rule against that, since NSF are full time like regulars, but they're not career soldiers (regular). Even if there are, I don't think SAF minds. Or don't think they enforce the rule against them.</p>
              <p>As for regulars, is different story.</p>

              <p>if he is Jesus, he can earn $3k everyday of the year. Yes then he earns more than the people he hopes to be on par with. Did you hear him say "only a minister's pay can win his easily"? Cos he can earn $3k from shares everyday cos he is Jesus and only Christ can dictate the bourse by waving his hand. Why dont you worship him also?</p>
              <p>if its not from shares, even worse!!!</p>
              <p>Anyway, we'll see whether he declared or not in due time. Don't worry. Stay tuned!!!</p>

              <p>You amuse me greatly. You must think that a div comm is lower in rank than a NSF clerk in Mindef who wears no.3. I don't have to tell you his rank or appointment, just that AOs are very common, depending on what circle you are in.</p>
              <p>I'm just surprised that you're as naive and silly as to think the uniform indicates the CEP or rank or appointment. So a SAFOS CPT OC is lower in rank than a private clerk who wears no.3? And a 38yr old BG Div Comm in no.4 is lower in rank than a 35 yr old MAJ CO. very smart....Are you sure you're the guy here who's been through NS and i'm the lady?</p>
              <p>Even Neo Kian Hong wears his no.4 to work sometimes when he likes! Hahahaa! Are YOU sure you've gone through a DAY in the SAF if you even had the wits and embarrassment to say what you said? I'm even more shocked that you ask me to show you a COL who wears no.4. Are you sure you have gone through army??! Battalion, Brigade and Division commanders don't wear no.4? And these appointments must be held by LTA and CPT lah in your universe lah?!?. Even for just CO, battalion commander the lowest of the 3 command appointments i named, I already know those that are LTC (they're SAFOS scholars)..... maybe you served in some other army like M'sia??</p>
              <p>Vendetta against people with brains? I guess you think a down and out sign on spec who now is deluded to boast he earns as much as the minister is a president's scholar or something.</p>
              <p>Really, this is funny. it's like the people who are naked think they are wearing clothes. And they have goggles that make them think the clothed people are naked.</p>
              <p>Funniest is you ask me to know more abt SAF. I think your friends here who have actually done their NS are cringing for you. Go and serve first then come back.</p>

              <p>kopiostu might have a business outside which is doing very well.
              He <span style="text-decoration: underline;">controls</span> the
              business, BUT it is not registered under his own name. Maybe he
              register it under some relative's name. All those income is there
              for him to keep, but not under his name nor account.</p>
              <p>Get it? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              depending on what circle you are in.</p>
              <p>I'm just surprised that you're as naive and silly as to think
              the uniform indicates the CEP or rank or appointment. So a SAFOS
              CPT OC is lower in rank than a private clerk who wears no.3? And a
              38yr old BG Div Comm in no.4 is lower in rank than a 35 yr old MAJ
              CO. very smart....Are you sure you're the guy here who's been
              through NS and i'm the lady?</p>
              <p>Even Neo Kian Hong wears his no.4 to work sometimes when he
              likes! Hahahaa! Are YOU sure you've gone through a DAY in the SAF
              if you even had the wits and embarrassment to say what you said?
              I'm even more shocked that you ask me to show you a COL who wears
              no.4. Are you sure you have gone through army??! Battalion, Brigade
              and Division commanders don't wear no.4? And these appointments
              must be held by LTA and CPT lah in your universe lah?!?. Even for
              just CO, battalion commander the lowest of the 3 command
              appointments i named, I already know those that are LTC (they're
              SAFOS scholars)..... maybe you served in some other army like
              M'sia??</p>
              <p>Vendetta against people with brains? I guess you think a down
              and out sign on spec who now is deluded to boast he earns as much
              as the minister is a president's scholar or something.</p>
              <p>Really, this is funny. it's like the people who are naked think
              they are wearing clothes. And they <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>have goggles that make them
              think the clothed people are naked</strong></span>.</p>
              <p>Funniest is you ask me to know more abt SAF. I think your
              friends here who have actually done their NS are cringing for you.
              Go and serve first then come back.</p>

              <p>Does AO refer to Admin Officer? My previous AO is a DX9 or something, a very nice auntie. So, why does he have to wear no. 4 if he is doing a job that a DXO can do?</p>
              <p>And why is he an AO? Is he a "Pikachu" who is Pes C something &amp; ain't combat fit to be deployed in the field.</p>
