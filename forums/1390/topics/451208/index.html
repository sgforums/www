Recently my psychiatrist issued me a report stating that I have sleep walking problem and due to some incident that happen before, I can't sleep elsewhere other than my own house especially if there are people around I would get stress and I can't sleep. The MO told me that he cannot give me a pes status only the psychiatrist can and was given a pes D temp for 1 month. What pes status would I get usually?thanks man!</p></div>

              <p>Yes, it's true. Only saf psychiatrist can decide to give you excuse stay-in since it's a mental condition. MO handle &amp; can give pes for physical conditions only. In my experiences, saf psychiatrists are generally nice. I have appts with them before due to my severe condition (prefer not disclose). I'm currently not serving.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure whether you have a chance of stay-out tekong. It can be one of the possibility too. I thought usually if posted to tekong is all stay-in. I heard camp-mates always said if get posted to tekong is confirm stay-in.</p>

              <p>Insomnia? Insomnia can be caused by many different reasons. You should tell your psychiatrist about your insomnia problems. Since you have sleepwalking problems, your insomnia might be caused by your anxiety of sleepwalking if you sleep in different environments. The insecure feeling is what made you have sleep difficulty if you sleep elsewhere.</p>

              <p>Only a psychiatrist can rate the severity of your somnambulism.</p>
              <p>You can just mention it to your saf psychiatrist about your additional problems. They usually do another check-up for everyone and ask you the same questions for your problems. You should also bring up your cut fruits sleepwalking. I could imagine what if you ended up cutting people in bunks or clinics while sleeping. They'll find an appropriate environment for you to stay-out.</p>

              <p>If your psychiatrist mentioned that you've immense fear from staying in other environment, you'll be excuse stay-in. The word "immense" already can tell that it's severe enough to give you excuse stay-in.</p>
              <p>Another check-up means he'll ask you questions during your up-coming appointment with the saf psychiatrist. Your condition diagnosed from medical report will remain the same. They only want in detail in order to understand you further. It's good for people since memos/reports only give brief understanding of your condition. This is where you can bring up more detailed problems like your immense fear of staying in other environments. From there, they can work out and know what to excuse you from.</p>
