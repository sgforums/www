Military Police (MP) is a combat vocation drawing combat pay. You will be given S$1,897 as a recruit and after 31 weeks of training, S$2,160 as a 3SG...<br><br>Consider carefully, you won't wanna regret your decision, especially if you're on JPSDS... I would recommend that you experience BMT first before deciding whether a military career is suitable for you... it's never too late...<br><br>To me (personal view), MP is a Liang3 Tou2 Bu4 Zhao2 An4 vocation...<br><br>Firstly, considering it as a law enforcement career, it's nowhere near a SPF/CNB/SPS career where you get better recognition, authority and exposure...<br><br>Secondly, as a military career, although it's a combat vocation, it does not expose you to too much of actual combat... plus there's little recogition, lesser overseas expedition chances and slower pace of promotion compared to larger formations...<br><br>my point is, being a MP is somewhat a unique career... but dun take it as a alternative to a conventional law enforcement or military career... if you're happy with performing during NDP/SAF day, arresting ppl for AWOL or looking after the guard room... by all means go ahead  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
