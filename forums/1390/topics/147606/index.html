            <div class='col-md body'>In this day and age of kid-glove militarism, can you imagine what would happen if the Battle of Trafalgar had been conducted according to current regulations?<br><br>Nelson: "Order the signal, Hardy."<br>Hardy: "Aye, aye sir."<br>Nelson: "Hold on, that's not what I dictated to the signal officer.What's<br>the meaning of this?"<br>Hardy: "Sorry sir?"<br>Nelson (reading aloud): "England expects every person to do his duty,<br>regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religious persuasion or<br>disability. What gobbledygook is this?"<br><br>Hardy: "Admiralty policy, I'm afraid, sir. We're an equal opportunity<br>employer now. We had the devil's own job getting 'England' past the<br>censors, lest it be considered racist."<br><br>Nelson: "Gadzooks, Hardy. Hand me my pipe and tobacco."<br>Hardy: "Sorry sir. All naval vessels have been designated smoke-free<br>working environments."<br>Nelson: "In that case, break open the rum ration. Let us splice the main<br>brace to steel the men before battle."<br>Hardy: "The rum ration has been abolished Admiral. Its part of the<br>Government's policy on binge drinking."<br>Nelson: "Good heavens, Hardy. I suppose we'd better get on with it. Full<br>speed ahead."<br>Hardy: "I think you'll find that there's a 4 knot speed limit in this<br>stretch of water."<br>Nelson: "Damn it man! We are on the eve of the greatest sea battle in<br>history. We must advance with all dispatch. Report from the crow's nest,<br>please."<br>Hardy: "That won't be possible, sir."<br>Nelson: "What?"<br>Hardy: "Health and safety have closed the crow's nest, sir. No harness.<br>And, they said that a rope ladder doesn't meet regulations. They won't let<br>anyone up there until a proper scaffolding can be erected."<br>Nelson: "Then get me the ship's carpenter without delay, Hardy."<br>Hardy: "He's busy knocking up a wheelchair access to the focsal Admiral."<br>Nelson: "Wheelchair access? I've never heard anything so absurd."<br>Hardy: "Health and safety again, sir. We have to provide a barrier-free<br>environment for the differently abled."<br>Nelson: "Differently abled? I've only one arm and one eye and I refuse even<br>to hear mention of the word. I didn't rise to the rank of Admiral by<br>playing the disability card."<br>Hardy: "Actually, sir, you did. The Royal Navy is under-represented in the<br>areas of visual impairment and limb deficiency."<br>Nelson: "Whatever next? Give me full sail. The salt spray beckons."<br>Hardy: "A couple of problems there too, sir. Health and safety won't let<br>the crew up the rigging without crash helmets. And they don't want anyone<br>breathing in too much salt - haven't you seen the adverts?"<br>Nelson: "I've never heard such infamy. Break out the cannon and tell the<br>men to stand by to engage the enemy."<br>Hardy: "The men are a bit worried about shooting at anyone, Admiral."<br>Nelson: "What? This is mutiny."<br>Hardy: "It's not that, sir. It's just that they're afraid of being charged<br>with murder if they actually kill anyone. There's a couple of legal aid<br>lawyers on board, watching everyone like hawks."<br>Nelson: "Then how are we to sink the Frenchies and the Spanish?"<br>Hardy: "Actually, sir, we're not."<br>Nelson: "We're not?"<br>Hardy: "No, sir. The Frenchies and the Spanish are our European partners<br>now. According to the Common Fisheries Policy, we shouldn't even be in this<br>stretch of water. We could get hit with a claim for compensation."<br>Nelson: "But you must hate a Frenchman as you hate the devil."<br>Hardy: "I wouldn't let the ship's diversity co-coordinator hear you saying<br>that sir. You'll be up on a disciplinary."<br>Nelson: "You must consider every man an enemy who speaks ill of your King."<br>Hardy: "Not any more, sir. We must be inclusive in this multicultural age.<br>Now put on your Kevlar vest; it's the rules."<br>Nelson: "Don't tell me - health and safety. Whatever happened to rum,<br>sodomy and the lash?"<br>Hardy: "As I explained, sir, rum is off the menu! And there's a ban on<br>corporal punishment."<br>Nelson: "What about sodomy?"<br>Hardy: "I believe it's to be encouraged, sir."<br><br>Nelson: "In that case ..kiss me, Hardy."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Quite funny! Oh! And don't forget that the french are only to be referred to as the 'reds'. Further, England must be referred to as 'the blues'.
