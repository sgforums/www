And guess what? anyone NOT in NTU would know that. its only the deluded cheena pok students in NTU and NUS with cheena diction and low IQ, who are in denial about their status and think they're some bright 'leaders' to be when even their own govt knows that they are worthless. and I never said that people from NTU do not drive the economy in their little ways. even the bangla table cleaner drives the economy. Like you admitted above, they're very useful in driving bus and working as sales assistant.I;m glad you admitted that when asked to justify their worth. I said the degree is WORTHLESS. do you intend to be a table cleaner?then maybe we have different measurement of success.</p>

              <p>yup, not sure about china military but in the US, after col is senior col. And US military for four general ranks, not three, which means got four stars.</p>
              <p>all these are dependent on the size of the armed force. Small military like us, so only 3 stars. maybe a smaller military elsewhere like NZ's would have 2 stars only?</p>
              <p>And in the US army, one unit (movable for war = unit) is 1 division. In SAF, it's just one battalion.</p>

              <p>Just to clarify, the United States military has no Senior Colonel. After Colonel, they proceed to BG. For the US Navy, the equivalent is Captain to Rear Admiral.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the US military rank goes up to 5 stars, like Eisenhower in World War Two. The rank is given to a general only in large scale wars like WWII and Vietnam.</p>

              <p>I think you are the more ignorant one from e beginning. you started attacking abt degrees from NTU &amp; NUS being useless right? so now because I expose you being a disgrace and demeaning to the total defence concept tat you are telling ppl that I'm ignornant.</p>
              <p>are you sure by what you are saying? If you dun have foreigner, most of the SBS buses would not even be driven to fetch you to work, to school or to play. There's a limit on how much foreigner we can take eventually on this small island though.</p>
              <p>Dun ever forget SAF could only buy 2nd hand items back in 1970s because the country's economy was simply in its infancy, could not provide any budget.</p>
              <p>I think you got it all wrong, Mr Eddie Teh is a Malaysian from Penang.. He was poached by PSA from HPH back in around 2003</p>

I can't call you a a snob because you're not one of the elites - you're just a wannabe, so stop pretending to know everything. If you derive great pleasure from defining yourself and other people by their wages and material gains, then you have more in common with those you claim to despise than you think.</p>
              <p>So how was your command of the English language when you were schooling here? Did you have good teachers or parents, or did you have to pull up your socks somewhere along the line? Do you dare to repeat the same remarks that you have posted in front of your ex-classmates or relatives who weren't as fortunate as you and did their undergraduate studies here?</p>
              <p>It's a shame that no one's been upfront with you about how insufferable you are. The less that you tell other people that you're from Singapore, the better. And if you have no imagination or up-to-date knowledge, don't try to make assumptions about who or what I am.</p>

              <p>By the way, how come you deleted and edit your post. No balls? Show 'em to me. You have a lot of guts being your humblite, so what now?</p>
              <p>And did your P2 Maths teach taught you division properly? My brother's last IRAS notice of assessment was somewhat in the range of +50K, so if your peanut 7K multiplied by 12 divide by 2 is anything nowhere close to this figure, go have your calculator checked by Casio. Better still, go buy another one, it probably ran out of battery.</p>
              <p>From Jan 2008 to Dec 2008, I was assessed on an annual income of SGD 60100, and not shy to admit that I have reached this figure as of my Oct 2009 paycheck. Go figure what is my OTE this year. I bet you my last piece of underwear ( get my 84K by 35 instead of your 45... wanna take it on?</p>
