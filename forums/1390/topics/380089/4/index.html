              <p><a href="/forums/1390/topics/users/70552">SBST390</a> I edited my post because I have "no balls" to show you what i wanted to say? Uh Why? Did you see what I said to you before I edited it?  How do you know I didn't edit my post to fuck you more?</p>
              <p>You mean your brother's pay is so little?! Per annum he draws only $50+K..???! How old is he again? is he like ..a teen? Why is he drawing a salary that other people drew at 22 years old?  Oh my freaking gawd. he makes only 40% of what 20 plus yr old CPTs and MAJs in SAF are making, it is obvious that he is condemned, even for farmer standards. Please don't be in denial that he's condemned, now that you have declared his salary out and loud in a public arena..and thanks for confirming what I have known all along. Just that the truth you confessed to is even uglier than what I had imagined.</p>
              <p>Btw, $7k x 12 divided by 2, as recommended by you is only $42k. Your brother's pathetic pay is a measly $8k A YEAR more than some rubbish figures I threw out when $8k is not even the monthly pay of some friends of mine in their mid 20s and you dared to sound so smug to me and think you 'won'... Amazing.</p>
              <p>Your intellectual deficiencies also prevented you from understanding my earlier post (which you quoted so dun accuse me of editing), I said your farmer brother's pay is $7k a month when he turns 45 ah? Is that why you say there are farmers who can make $7k at 45 yrs old? And I added that if he hadn't signed on he won't even command 1/2 that elsewhere. And you replied me accordingly declaring jubilantly that his IRAS declaration is $50K a year. So are you saying he's really 45 yr old and earning $50K per annum?! Seriously, at that old age and he only makes that amount, he should just commit suicide.</p>
              <p>I find it even funnier that you went on to throw more pathetic figures, this time about yourself, believing that you'd impress me. How old are you again? Are you older than your fucking loser farmer brother? Why do you dare to throw lousy figures (thinking that they're impressive but really, they're not even allowance in my universe), without daring to declare your age? Your last declared income, a measly $60k a year is not even 1/3 of the lowest earning person in my family, who is 24 years old.</p>
              <p>And your targeted income for a freaking old shit when you're 35 year old, is a measly chickenshit $84k per annum, really shit pay that's not even fit to be announced to anyone at all. It's not even 70% of the salary of friends my current age, which is nowhere even at the end of 20something and there you go thinking that its such big shit, earning minimum wage at 35. Please lah.. try not to go around declaring such 'dui lian' statistics about yourself, really. If i were you, i'd have migrated to Nigeria or gotten myself a mail-order bride from Vietnam cos that's the only kind of place that such income is considered acceptable.  And to think you proudly told me with such arrogance feeling so damn good. From your low pay now to your 'dream' pay at 35 years old (an 'upgrade' of only $2K a month, I can estimate
                                                                                                                                            your current age, and my words to be said are: God you're old!</p>
              <p>Regarding your P/S: The only thing I said was that your brother is a navy farmer from NUS. And the first thing you thought is that I have access to "confidential" data. Why?? Have you been telling your brother that you post in Sgforums, and have you told him your handle? Or do you imagine he went around telling people he sees that he's a farmer with a brother called SBST390? Maybe I am a medium? Or I have ESP? How ridiculous. There's really no substitute for basic IQ.</p>
              <p> sbst275 U said "it simply makes e system bigger, getting harder to manage and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            control. talking abt making an alrdy inefficient system bigger".</p>
              <p>no dude. An additional rank does not make a system bigger, because the no. of officers in the system remain the same, without or with the additional rank. The system size, the size of the officer corp, remain the same. The system's hierarchy became larger, maybe. what it does is add another layer in the ROA (route of advancement) for the idiots who are meant to henta kaki at LTC to get a final promotion in the recently ADDED last five years of the officer's career now. gettit? And Eddie Teh took up Singapore citizenship.</p>
