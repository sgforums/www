              <p>The Senior LTC rank was made for those whose CEP does not and cannot go beyond LTC and on to COL, this is to accommodate the 'longer' career for these hantak kakis now that the officer career has been extended to 50. So what will they do with all these hanta kakis from age 42 to 50?! Of course come up with something in between for them so it doesn't look so pai seh that they remain as LTC for 10 years and cannot make it to Full Colonel.<br><br>The high fliers will probably skip this mickey mouse Senior LTC rank altogether and progress from LTC directly to COL since Senior LTC was made for those who CMI to COL.</p>

              <p>Thats true. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> There are some COL I know who are damn CMI..esp those who are COL at 45 type. Without the career 'extension', these dumb farmers would have been kicked out long ago. Even got some fell through the cracks and can get BG in their mid 40s just because SAF recognises that they have "aspirational needs" (can be quoted)</p>
              <p>Instead of promoting people who otherwise wouldn't have been promoted just to give allowance to their "aspirational needs", SAF should revert back to its previous standards. What it has done has also cheapened its ranks. I have heard many officers saying that because the BG rank has been cheapened by these undeserving people, now they're not happy to have a BG CEP.</p>
              <p>SAF opened up more BG positions to let undeserving people take them on, just to prevent them from leaving - a short sighted stop-gap measure, which has invited a larger problem to be fixed now - angry officers who now feel BG is a cheapish rank. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> It should first reduce the number of BG appointments, for a start. And stop promoting rubbish just because of career extension.</p>
              <p>Let them henta kaki for as long as their CEP demands. Continue to peg the CEP to 42 years old. The extension should only serve to help the henta kaki remain employed and still have a ricebowl until 50 year old when their dependents have grown up. This was why the policy was changed. Stick to it.</p>

              <p>There're a lot of contradictions in your post. First, LTC is not top. It's considered middle and depending on who you talk to, some officers consider it a sia suay rank and will kill themselves if they retire with it.</p>
              <p>Second, the top cannot be heavier than the bottom, if you know anything about army structures. How many division commanders, how many battalion commanders are there, and how many platoon commanders? How many CO spots are there for the OCs? 70% of the farmers sign on and can go through their careers with no chance of doing CO tour. Where do they go from OC until retirement leh? Of course the loser staff tours eg GS ops, and all the instructor tours in 'retirement village' like training schools hahahaha. I remember there was a bozo here once who argued stubbornly about instructor tours being for hentak kakis donkeys. Obviously doesn't know squat about the SAF. Its so common I dun understand how there are bozos who have no idea and their eyes on their butts. So many people going from one staff tour to another repeatedly for years or instructor places in OETI and infantry institute. An officer may sign on to command boys on the field but whether he can cut it beyond commanding 100+ boys is another issue. As a result, the incompetent people spend the rest of their careers no longer in command.</p>
              <p>Anyone who says that any large organisation is top-heavy has no idea how organisational structure and HR are run. Probably only worked in miserable 3-man SMEs all their wretched lives or working in the HDB ah-beng used handphone shop. That's how all organisations that have more than 20 people run. It is
                                                                              called the pyramid. The ones who can't make it, are weeded out by
                                                                              hentak kaki at CPT, MAJ, LTC and now 'senior' LTC. Great officers are
                                                                              naturally shown the way to the next level and to the top. Dumb ones
                                                                              stay still. The dumber the person is, the sooner he starts staying.</p>
              <p>Third, based on the pyramid structure, those at the bottom who are good, would naturally get to the top by ascending each layer. The laggards stay on. There is no need for any contrived and laborious policies to machinise the laggards' 'way' to the top if they can make it. What you are suggesting is to basically let those who CMI get ahead simpy by claiming that they're not CMI. If a person is CMI, then of course he'd require such machinations and be begging for such handouts. If someone is good, the system will reward because it is a pyramid. If not, its cos you are not good enough. No need to look everywhere else to blame except yourself.</p>
              <p>If your friends at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bottom</span> already can't CMI in the system through natural progression, you really have no right to criticise the CMI middle management donkeys we look down on, like the 10-year LTCs in their 40s cos your friends are even worse than them, or at best headed the same direction if they stayed, doing long-term instructor and loser staff tours.</p>

                  The laggards stay on. There is no need for any contrived and
                  laborious policies to machinise the laggards' 'way' to the top if
                  they can make it. What you are suggesting is to basically let those
                  who CMI get ahead simpy by claiming that they're not CMI. If a
                  person is CMI, then of course he'd require such machinations and be
                  begging for such handouts. If someone is good, the system will
                  reward because it is a pyramid. If not, its cos you are not good
                  enough. No need to look everywhere else to blame except
                  yourself.</p>
              <p>If your friends at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bottom</span> already can't CMI in
                  the system through natural progression, you really have no right to
                  criticise the CMI middle management donkeys we look down on, like
                  the 10-year LTCs in their 40s cos your friends are even worse than
                  them, or at best headed the same direction if they stayed, doing
                  long-term instructor and loser staff tours.</p>

              <p>yup, not sure about china military but in the US, after col is senior col. And US military for four general ranks, not three, which means got four stars.</p>
              <p>all these are dependent on the size of the armed force. Small military like us, so only 3 stars. maybe a smaller military elsewhere like NZ's would have 2 stars only?</p>
              <p>And in the US army, one unit (movable for war = unit) is 1 division. In SAF, it's just one battalion.</p>

              <p>They are useless farmers wasting taxpayers' money..worse, now the 'enhanced' scheme sponsors all of officers and specs who do not have a degree for some lousy low-quality uni degree. Waste more of taxpayers' money. Why should the state be paying for the 'degree' of any tom, dick, or harry who otherwise wouldn't have been able to gain admission to any loser state university here and have to pay for their paper, JUST BECAUSE they made the choice to sign on? This is especially since the criteria for signing on is very low. Only have to make it into OCS and nowadays majority of Singaporeans have either a poly diploma or A levels, so showing some leadership skills during BMT is an option open to all and sundry.</p>
              <p>Yup i agree with you. With a NTU degree which is worthless, just as worthless as NUS, you won't make $7k in your lifetime. A survey conducted once that showed 9.5 out of 10 local grads do not make enough to buy private housing, most can't afford to buy a car, and at least 1 in 2 never make enough in their lifetime to ever buy private housing.</p>

              <p>Oh, you definitely dunno this, <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> the 'enhanced' scheme to 50 only means those who can't get promoted beyond a certain low rank get to have employment until 50. So they aren't the group you're talking about who go on to GLC and stat boards. They're more like people like you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Wanna know why? SAVER remains up to 42 now  No change from before. Ask any regular <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Officers can cash out their SAVER at 42, as it will mature at 42 like before. Any earlier they won't get the full sum. Those who can't find jobs can contnue to stay from 42 to 50 but will not get any SAVER contribution during this period. What this means? A lot of implications and it says a lot of things, for those clever enough to pick them up.</p>
              <p>Scholars will leave the force at 42. The jobs awaiting them in the ministries, stat boards and GLCs are ripe for 42 and won't want them to stay until so old in SAF then go over.Just nice. The only ones who leave later would be the ones who choose to go SAF all the way (2 star, 3 star). service chief, the whole shebang. As we speak, many AO SAFOS scholars leave the SAF prematurely to cross over, like the new deputy CEO Of CAAS only in his mid 30s, not sure why they don't care about the SAVER. Or maybe it's just a secondment.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>This means their CEP is pegged at 42 for retirement from SAF, just like before.</p>
              <p>For the rest, CEP also pegged at 42, cos that's when they have the choice to leave (SAVER maturity). Those who can't get alternative employment at least can stay in SAF for 8 more years, still got some $ to bring home and won't be jobless. If SAF wanted the change to be a blanket
                      one that was meant for everyone, it would have kept everything
                      consistent, and extended SAVER maturity to 50. SAF KNOWS that to wait
                      for SAVER to mature at 50 is way way too long. It still matures at 42.
                      Those who can't make it in the SAF and will have a hard time finding a
                      job after leaving the SAF at least can keep their rice bowl until 50,
                      but will have to cash out their SAVER at 42 as well.</p>
              <p>So sorry to rain on your parade..pun unintended since you'd never ever have a parade done for you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>They are useless farmers wasting taxpayers' money..worse, now the 'enhanced' scheme sponsors all of officers and specs who do not have a degree for some lousy low-quality uni degree. Waste more of taxpayers' money. Why should the state be paying for the 'degree' of any tom, dick, or harry who otherwise wouldn't have been able to gain admission to any loser state university here and have to pay for their paper, JUST BECAUSE they made the choice to sign on? This is especially since the criteria for signing on is very low. Only have to make it into OCS and nowadays majority of Singaporeans have either a poly diploma or A levels, so showing some leadership skills during BMT is an option open to all and sundry.</p>
              <p>Yup i agree with you. With a NTU degree which is worthless, just as worthless as NUS, you won't make $7k in your lifetime. A survey conducted once that showed 9.5 out of 10 local grads do not make enough to buy private housing, most can't afford to buy a car, and at least 1 in 2 never make enough in their lifetime to ever buy private housing.</p>

              <p>Dun say abt signing on or watever, ppl after ORD and work are driving the economy. So if like how you put it, then tell me where are the MRT/ bus svs, retailers manpower coming from?</p>

              <p>true. some can even earn more than 7k by 45. </p>
              <p>don't judge the degree by the salary that you can get. a degree is something to help you improve your knowledge and gives you better perspectives on issues that require more in depth knowledge.</p>
              <p>so even if the degree is from some no name uni, the knowledge you gain from the course of study is never wasted.</p>

              <p>who am I to say? I just did. And guess what? anyone NOT in NTU would know that. its only the deluded cheena pok students in NTU and NUS with cheena diction and low IQ, who are in denial about their status and think they're some bright 'leaders' to be when even their own govt knows that they are worthless. and I never said that people from NTU do not drive the economy in their little ways. even the bangla table cleaner drives the economy. Like you admitted above, they're very useful in driving bus and working as sales assistant.I;m glad you admitted that when asked to justify their worth. I said the degree is WORTHLESS. do you intend to be a table cleaner?then maybe we have different measurement of success.</p>
