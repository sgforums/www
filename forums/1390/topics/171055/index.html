I suspect it is only during ATEC that they pay attention to your movement.</div></blockquote>What can I say? You simply can't account for every single contingency and scenario. No matter how sui sui you do the fire movement drills, you can still get hit by stray rounds and fragmentation shards from grenades. One of the worst things that could happen to the infantry platoon is that the medic gets hit, and there's no way to prevent that totally.<br><br>The only thing you could do to protect the medic is to keep him at the back of the platoon and get him to stick to the PS. And arm him with a rifle to protect himself if he does get shot at. It's not a perfect arrangement, but nothing's perfect.<br><br>Going back to the main topic, I reiterate that what you should do is leave your buddy who's bleeding for the platoon medic. Maybe bandage him quickly with your first-aid dressing, but that's about it. As heartless as it may sound, the best thing you can do for your fallen buddy is to win the mission. Let the better-trained and better-equipped medic save him.<br><br>I know that's the idealistic answer - in times of war, we can never predict what our actions will be like. It's perfectly understandable for any soldier to stop and aid their fallen comrades. As I've said at the very beginning, you had asked a very subjective question with no clear-cut answer.<br></div>
