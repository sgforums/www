              <p>You are required to standby for practice and actual
              mobilisation. Mobilisation can occur anytime and requires both you
              and your employer’s full support.<br> <br> In this section, you will be guided through the process of
              mobilisation and what it entails.<br> <br> <strong>(A)    Operationally Ready</strong><br> <br> To be operationally ready means that our armed forces are able to
              transform ourselves from a disciplined and well-prepared force in
              peace time to an effective fighting force in war time. To maintain
              this efficiency of operational readiness, you must report to your
              Mobilisation Centre immediately once you are mobilised.<br> <br> <strong>(B)    Mobilisation Systems</strong><br> Every NS unit has a mobilisation plan and you will be briefed on
              your role in the mobilisation exercises. Once you are mobilised,
              you are to report immediately to your Mobilisation Centre in your
              uniform with your personal equipment.<br> <br> Mobilisation systems can take place in 2 forms:</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div>
              <div style="width: 100%;"><strong>Silent Mobilisation
              System<br></strong> <strong>i. Primary Means:</strong><br> The eMobilisation system will notify you via the telephone (home,
              office or mobile) or facsimile. It is therefore crucial that your
              personal details, especially your contact numbers are updated
              through <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ns.sg/nsp/web/esvcs/mindef/selfupd/main">eSelf-Update</a> in the NS Portal (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a>).<br> <br> <strong>ii. Back-up Means – Personal Contact:</strong><br> A Mobilisation Order (SAF 98A/B) or Mobilisation Notice (SAF 98C/D)
              will be served to your home if you cannot be contacted through the
              primary means.<br> <br> <strong>iii.</strong> The <strong>SAF 98A/B</strong> are used only
              during actual operations, while the <strong>SAF 98C/D</strong> are
              used for practices.<br> <br> <strong>Open Mobilisation System<br></strong> The <strong>mass
              media</strong> such as the television, radio, Omni-theatres and
              cinemas are used to inform you that your unit has been mobilised.
              Upon announcement of the Code words, you are required to report
              immediately to your Mobilisation Centre for military
              service/exercises in your uniform with your personal
              equipment.<br></div>

              <p>NSmen are required to apply for an Exit Permit for overseas
              trips of 6 months or longer. NSmen who go overseas for more than 14
              days but less than 6 months must notify MINDEF of their overseas
              trips through the MINDEF Notification Centre (MNC). The possession
              of an Exit Permit or the notification or the notification of MINDEF
              Notification Centre does not absolve NSmen from mobilisation and to
              report for NS duties when required.<br>  <br> During mobilisation manning period, NSmen <strong>can still travel
              overseas but are required to seek approval from their unit to be
              exempted from mobilisation prior to departure</strong>. Failing
              which, disciplinary actions will be taken.<br> <br> <strong>(C)    Mobilisation Manning</strong><br> Before you ORD or your first operational manning, your unit will
              brief you on the following:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Your <strong>unit code words</strong>. Stickers with your code
              words will be given to help you and your family members remember
              the code words.<br></li>
              <li><strong>Mobilisation Centre location</strong> to report during
              mobilisation.<br></li>
              <li><strong>Mobilisation Means</strong>. This could be through
              telephone, SMS, fax, email or written notices and
              orders.<br></li>
              <li><strong>Frequency of Operational Manning</strong>. Manning
              occurs about twice a work year during which you are liable for
              mobilisation exercises.<br></li>
              <li><strong>Special arrangements</strong>. If you are performing
              emergency service, or your immediate absence from your work place
              may be critical or hazardous to life, you need to inform your NS
              unit and report as soon as your functions are satisfactorily handed
              over.<br></li>
              </ol>
              <p>During mobilisation exercise, your NS unit may be required to
              move out for field exercises after the normal reporting is done.
              Being mindful of your varying commitments, the SAF will make every
              effort to minimise disruption to your civilian careers when
              mobilisation exercises are held.<br> <br> <strong>How can my family support my mobilisation?</strong><br> You are encouraged to keep your family members informed of your
              whereabouts especially during your Operational Manning Periods.
              They should also be informed of how and where they can contact you
              to facilitate your speedy mobilisation.<br> <br> Your family members should also know your NS unit's code words and
              be prepared that you are required to remain at the unit for a
              longer period if the mobilisation should involves field
              exercises.<br> <br> If you have any family members that are 16 years of age or above,
              they can acknowledge any call-up notice serve at your residence.
              Upon receipt, they must contact you immediately.</p>

                                mindful of your varying commitments, the SAF will make every effort to 
                                minimise disruption to your civilian careers when mobilisation exercises
                                 are held.<br> <br> <strong>How can my family support my mobilisation?</strong><br> You are encouraged to keep your family members informed of your 
                                whereabouts especially during your Operational Manning Periods. They 
                                should also be informed of how and where they can contact you to 
                                facilitate your speedy mobilisation.<br> <br> Your family members should also know your NS unit's code words and be 
                                prepared that you are required to remain at the unit for a longer period
                                 if the mobilisation should involves field exercises.<br> <br> If you have any family members that are 16 years of age or above, they 
                                can acknowledge any call-up notice serve at your residence. Upon 
                                receipt, they must contact you immediately.</p>
