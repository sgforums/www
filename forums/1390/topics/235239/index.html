Been on 3 days MC might not put you so-called Out-Of-Course, but you might still be able to complete the rest of the ICT... Unless you took it for granted and didn't report back after the 3-days MC...<br><br>As for your previous offences, they can be taken reference during your summary trial in absence without official leave from ICT... For example, should you be convicted and punished with sentencing to DB of seven days in previous trial, you can be tried and convicted for more than seven days of DB...</div>

This will unlikely save you, but will be a mitigating factor that you did fax, but your unit has a screw-up system of tracking and follow-up.<br><br>Good luck !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Brad, I think you are really in trouble.<br><br>First of all, in SAF, never assume anything expecially when doing ICT. 3days MC still means you have to report after your MC expires. Preferable you go down to the unit and get a WRITTEN CONFIRMATION that you no need to do ICT.<br><br>Secondly, I am surprise that after kenna send to DB and you still want to take the risk of not reporting. If I were you, I will report on the first day.<br><br>Thirdly, for depression, I think you really have to proof it. The SDO doing your case may refer you to another doctor to confirm you really depressed. You may get temporary reprieve if you are diagnosed with depression but still you may have to go DB, expecially you already have a record.<br><br>Fourthly, no offence, but I think that you really stupid to skip RT and ICT.<br><br></div>
