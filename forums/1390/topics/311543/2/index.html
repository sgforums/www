              <p>It wouldnt hurt calling them up to confirm your doubts. After all the information they can render you with are far more reliable then what this forum mates can.</p>
              <p>Also, theres really not much time wasted, I don't see the difference between the two, its either you get signed now, or after your BMT. Do note that those who get signed now do not mean that they go for air-grading immediately after their BMT. Of course thats the ideal arrangement, but do keep in mind the schedule conflicts that might occur in their system.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>i feel that there will be a little time wasted if everything goes smoothly coz if i get the chance to go for a 2nd attempt on interview plus the medical, everything will take damn slow to process my reapplication. i may reapply if i get into OCS and they may take at least 1 mth to ask me for another interview if possible. if hopefully i pass with the 2nd attempt, the medical results will be out earliest by 2.5 mths. so i definitely see a little loss of time though i cant reali gauge the amount lost...</p></div>

              <p>You will be serving OCS by then should you qualify for the second interview. Since serving the OCS is a must for pilots, wheres the time wasted?</p>
              <p>Its time to get the facts right. Call the RO.</p>
              <p>To be more straightforward, imo, by the end of the day, the only difference between getting signed now or later, is that you will feel better if your signed now. Probably, everyone will feel the same (putting the consideration of salaries aside).</p>

              <p>i can definitely say i like flying a lot and has set my sights on a career with RSAF. its the interview today tt i feel i said something wrongly and they started to bombard mi with qns abt my days in yfc. my last sortie was a complicated one and was unable to make to 1st solo. i feel just i wasted this chance and its damn sayang la. tt recruitment officer ask mi to get into OCS and re-apply again, i dun even noe wat he means by tt. how can i hav gd performance in OCS so as to reapply? coz he say get into OCS and reapply so i assume tt if i'm posted to OCS den i will reapply immediately?</p>

              <p><br>ahh... yeah! flying is very fun! but being a military pilot is totally different! ask urself will u be able to take the office politics, playing of ranks n seniority, strict regimentation n being on standby wif disruption to ur life? sign on if ur ans is yes.</p>
              <p>anyway, 1 advice for u, if u managed to get into OCS, apply asap when once u get in during common term, otherwise they will not be able to release u to air force once u commence on ur training. oh yah, if u r in commando, then it's different liao, i dunno wat's the SOP of handling pilot trainees for commando cadets in OCS but i do noe abt infantry (personal experience). once u get ur 2nd white bar, u have to finish ur whole OCS training b4 going over to air wing. however, if u managed to secure a place in air force when u r in common term, then u will be going over to air wing to get ur 2nd bar.</p>
              <p>the above r my own personal experience in 2004, the way i got into air force was rather different due to administrative lapse, i applied b4 BMT, then completed BMT, SISPEC BSLC, SISPEC ASLC n was recommended to go to OCS as an infantry cadet but i rejected it cos i noe i will be going over to air force n didnt want to waste time in OCS. so i went over to air force sch only after completing my SISPEC ASLC n i was already into the 10th month of my national service back then.</p>
              <p>a typical career path for a pilot trainee will be... BMT --&gt; Air Force Sch --&gt; Airgrading</p>
              <p>mine was... BMT --&gt; SISPEC BSLC --&gt; SISPEC ASLC --&gt; Lobo for 1 mth --&gt; Air Force Sch</p>
              <p>hmm... btw, care to shed more light on ur interview? interested to noe how come u failed ur interview. i rem i screwed up my interview, cos i was rather low profile during my sec sch n poly days n they said they were looking for outstanding characters so i told them honestly i wasnt outstanding at all. at the end of the interview, i tot i failed but the person-in-charge told me i got thru!</p>

                  interview, cos i was rather low profile during my sec sch n poly
                  days n they said they were looking for outstanding characters so i

              <p>hey tetsu, i got seriously bombarded by them la. i juz found out i said sumtink wrongly leh. blardy hell! they ask mi abt my yfc experience and y i didnt go for 1st solo since i made it into phase 2. actually was coz of my poor performance on the last sortie then i said coz of external factors like weather which was actually reasons for the sorties before my last 1. i was confused and mixed it up and tot i was telling the truth when in fact i'm actually lying unknowningly. tt's y they tot i was lying and the colonel juz said to mi,"are you sure? we are looking for honest officers..." once i heard this, i knew i screwedÂ my interview liao. the truth abt the interview is tt be as honest as possible, they reali dun care how outstanding you are, they believe honesty is the best policy!</p>
