Just to answer your  qns, there will be 3 MO's present, a chairman of board which is usually a Maj and 2 other MO, your unit MO and another. How long it'll last depending on how many people on board and how complicated are the cases, ranging between 2-10 min per case. As for where it's held, there are several places including some units like Tekong, Dieppe barrack etc. But the most common place is CMPB. btw air force hold their own MB in aero med.</div>

By right, waiting time should not be longer than one month. During my time, in order to cut short the waiting time and the lapse cases, we go to MB everyweek sometimes even on sat, before i left manage to bring the waiting time to only 3 wks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
