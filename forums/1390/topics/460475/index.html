              <p><strong>Basic Military Training (BMT)</strong> marks the beginning of military life for all Singaporean males at the age of 18. It is the transition from fresh-faced teenager to combat-ready fit soldier.<br><br>They learn basic soldiering skills, which include weapon handling, individual field craft, bayonet fighting, etc to ensure their survivability in the battlefield.<br><br>Besides the training in basic military skills, Physical Training (PT) lessons are also conducted to build up the soldiers' physique and stamina, to instill a firm sense of discipline and teamwork amongst the soldiers.<br><br>In 1995, MINDEF approved a revision in the BMT to ensure that the best are selected to become officers and specialists, through a better-structured and more focused training programme.<br><br>With the revised BMT system, the new Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) was set up as a central institution responsible for most basic military training. The institute was inaugurated on 26 November 1996 and officially opened as SAF BMTC by DPM and Defence Minister Dr Tony Tan on 17 Aug 1999).<br><br>This improved programme not only ensures that the right personnel are assigned to the command and combat vocations but also provides for the training to address the different fitness levels of the recruits.<br><br>It ensures that the recruit who completes his basic military training at BMTC is suitable for his subsequent deployment and training for the remaining period of his full-time national service.<br><br>The centralised training for recruits at BMTC in Pulau Tekong also ensures a more efficient and effective management of basic military training and sharing of common resources. Time spent travelling from camp to the training grounds has been reduced as all training is done within the island itself.<br><br>The new SAF BMTC boasts a comprehensive range of training and general facilities for recruits. These include well-equipped lecture rooms, training sheds, rifle and grenade ranges, a sophisticated Marksmanship Trainer, and Obstacle and Battle Inoculation Courses.<br><br>It also has a sports complex with standard 400m running track, tennis and squash courts. It also has a big parade square with a 2,400-seating capacity, a well-equipped medical centre and an auditorium.<br><br>There is also a SAF E-Mart on the island where recruits can use their 'credits' to purchase their clothings and other military-related essentials.<br><br><br><br><strong>Types of Basic Military Training</strong><br><br>PES A/B1 BMT<br><br>This 9-week programme trains combat-fit recruits in the basic military skills to prepare them for advanced vocational training. The programme includes weapon training with the SAR 21 rifle which will teach recruits technical handling and marksmanship skills; a Battle Inoculation Course that simulates a real battlefield; a Field Camp which develops basic survival skills; progressive training to complete a 24-km route march which builds combat fitness and endurance; and hand grenade training.<br><br>For those who fail to achieve the NAPFA test silver award, they are required to undergo an 8-week Physical Training Phase prior to the Pes A/B1 BMT.<br> <br>PES BP BMT<br><br>Previously, obese enlistees would undergo a 15-week or 26-week BMT depending on their obesity level. As evidence has shown that obese recruits are able to achieve optimum fitness levels and weight loss in about 19 weeks, the new BMT programme for recruits with Body Mass Index (BMI) scores exceeding 27.0 will be 19 weeks. This BMT programme is designed to help obese recruits improve their physical fitness progressively while equipping them with basic soldiering skills and knowledge. (Effective Feb 10)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PES B2 BMT<br><br>Enlistees who were PES C1 previously underwent a 7-week BMT programme. The new 9-week PES B2 BMT programme will be conducted for recruits who are medically fit for deployment in selected combat and combat support vocations, such as signal operators, combat medics and naval system operators. These recruits will be given a new medical classification of PES B2, in place of the existing PES C1 classification. This is to ensure that the medical classification of our soldiers is consistent with their deployment. The new 9-week programme will include customised physical training, as well as basic combat training to prepare them for their combat and combat support roles. (Effective Jun 10)<br> <br>PES C BMT<br><br>Previously, PES C enlistees underwent a 7-week BMT programme. The new 9-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES C recruits. This programme will include light physical training and vocational training to prepare them for combat service support vocations, such as service medic, and those related to logistics and administration. (Effective Jun 10)<br> <br>PES E BMT<br><br>Previously, PES E enlistees underwent a 1-week BMT programme. The new 4-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES E recruits. This programme will focus on, vocational training as well as National Education, SAF core values, regimentation and discipline to prepare recruits for combat service support vocations.
