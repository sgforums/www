            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting article from last year.<br><br>Exchanging WOs<br>4/26/2004<br><br>For the past six years, the SAF and the Australian Defence Force (ADF) have been conducting the ADF-SAF Exchange Programme for their Captains and Warrant Officers. Over five weeks from 19 October to 24 November last year, 1WO Karamjit, a communications specialist from HQ Signals was attached to the 104th Signal Squadron of the 1st Command Support Regiment in Darwin, Australia. His exchange counterpart, 2nd Warrant Officer (WO2) David Wilkinson, a Signals vocationalist from the ADF paid a reciprocal visit from 16 February to 23 March this year.<br><br>So how did the warrant officers feel about the experience? Viewing the exchange programme as a goodwill mission, WO2 David said, 'This trip is to come here to observe the training and see the differences in how it is conducted, to tour Singapore to have a good time, basically!.' 1WO Karamjit agreed, and noted that it was a good learning experience, whereby we get familiarisation in force capabilities, equipment and training systems not available to our armies- for example, the vast use of satellite technology for communications in Australia.<br><br>Besides the training, there were also memorable experiences aplenty during the trip for the Warrant Officers to savour and remember. 1WO Karamjit recalled attending the ADF Signal Corps Anniversary Celebrations in Australia. 'It was an impressive event, with Signal units from all over Australia taking part. Some, like the squadron that I was attached to, had to travel by land for five days and four nights just to reach the place!'<br><br>Such distances, common in Australia, must have made the trip to Pulau Tekong for WO2 David seem like a routine fording of a river. However, he found the visits to the Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC), School of Infantry Specialists (SISPEC), and HQ Infantry interesting and memorable. He was particularly impressed with BMTC, and said. 'I went to see the recruits' bunks, the mess, ate from the cookhouse, and observed the training. The facilities and everything is really top-class!'<br><br>When asked if he previously had similar chances to go on such exchange programmes during his 22 years in the army, 1WO Karamjit looked thoughtful. He said, 'I've gone overseas for unit training regularly, but none like this one. This exercise provides the opportunity for personnel to broaden their military experience, knowledge and to promote understanding between the two armies.'<br><br>For the Army such exchange programmes could be just the first step in giving more overseas exposure opportunities to its servicemen. That can only be a good thing, judging from the goodwill, learning points and enjoyment gained and experienced by the two WOs. The lessons from Down Under could point the way up for the Army.<br><br></div>
