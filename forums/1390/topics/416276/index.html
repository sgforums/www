              <p>Sure you can go out.  But do not be 'caught' laughing and generaly enjoying yourself. Go somewhere quiet for self reflection, enjoy the scenary at the lakes, like mandai lake, Chinese garden, etc. </p>
              <p>If you need to meet with friends, go chit-chat.  Make sure it is only one friend, not a group.  Again do not be seen laughing and joking.</p>
              <p>Because long term MC means  you are depressed, and so act so.  Depression could be all types, the bi-polars get 'high' at certain times of the day, usually in the evening.  But the public do not understand.  And you get yourself misunderstood, you could be deemed as a malingerer.  Then it becomes difficult for you to explain your behaviour.</p>

              <p>Always have an excuse before going out. </p>
              <p>Try to go out during lunch/dinner time, so that you can say you are eating.</p>

              <p>in certain places, the boss [usually the OC or his deputies/ICs] does the call up... but since the doctor 'encourages' the fellow to go out, it's fine. just dont do anything crazy and so on.</p>
              <p>rmb got 1 time 1 of my fren on long term mc due to operation, then his OC call him [routine check] say: cannot go out la.. not i say one is the directive say one. then he told the OC that bo bian, his kids want go zoo.. end up panjang abit lor</p>

              want to go out? how about going to work? And for you, that is camp.
              
              If everybody claim to be depress, get long MC, and still get to enjoy life, who will want to serve? They do NS, you do NS, they have to endure training, you have to endure.... staying at home.

              <p><br>You tell those NSF guys under that 2LT officer that there is no food left in the house. If you don't go out to buy some food to eat, then you will starve to death at home. Unless you tell the guys to tell the officer to ask him to buy food for you as and when you call him whenever you are hungry and then free delivery to your house like a personal driver. Then that officer will not bother you anymore...</p>
              <p>If it is justifiable as a necessity to go out on a short while to do essential things such as buying a takeaway from a coffeeshop or rush to attend to an emergency outside, Mindef will not take any action against you. This is the exception rule of it. It can be found in the official Mindef GOM directives guidelines.</p>
              <p>The NSF guys are just scaring you. Use mouths anyhow utter to say, anyone also can.</p>
              <p>Anything, just ask them to show you officially this exception rule in the GOM directives.</p>

              <p>You can get a memo from the doctor at IMH, and then go back to camp to get endorsement from MO. </p>
              <p>This way, your commander will not be able to touch you anymore. I was thinking that you seek out some private specialist~~those specs are usually not "powerful" enough for your MO to accept their memo.</p>
