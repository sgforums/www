The notice saying this is to inform that you have been issued a medical certificate for the period of time (date) and is required to rest at home for the said duration etc etc...

              <p>NS is like that, it was never fair. Anyway those NSF only come once a week right? </p>
              <p>I think all these random house visit only once a week, they wont be that free to conduct home visit twice or thrice every week. So after they visit you that week, you can do whatever you want.  That's what i assume.</p>

              <p>I wish you the best and hope you are on the road to recovery.  Depression ( I guess that's why you have long MC) is no joke.  There's been lot of advice given here, and they are all good.  And yes, I agree laughter is good for you, lol.  What I mean't was just you should not be seen laughing and joking with a group of friends in a public place,  that sends a wrong message, ie you are not in the least depressed.  That's just the impression your officers may get , that 's all.  Obviously when friends gather to cheer you up, you will laugh, and no crime in that absolutely.</p>
              <p>Anyway, your friends will notice you are different from your usual self.  You could be quieter, less willing to participate in chit-chat etc. and they can vouch for you, that you are not the cheerful person you were previously.</p>
              <p>Lots of things you could do at home.  Watch DVDs, read books, etc.  Go on line to forums that have groups suffering from the same ailment. </p>
              <p>Have you read, Captain Bader's story?  The RAF guy who became a war hero despite his losing both legs?  Or seen 'Band of Brothers'?  You get loads of inspiration from these guys and realise ours are small sufferings to endure.</p>
              <p>Focus on helping others, despite the fact that you may not feel like doing anything.  Offer to help mom with her cooking, learn some new dishes.  Yes I know you are a guy and may not enjoy cooking, lol.</p>
              <p>Offer to help your younger siblings with their homework.  Set up your own blog.  Get someone to borrow library books for you.  Keep fit, learn new sets of exercises so you can return fully fit physically.</p>
              <p>For each of your new initiatives to help yourself become better, think in terms of taking 'baby steps' Take your weight weekly.  Are you sleeping and eating well?  Are you still losing weight despite eating well?  These are stuff the Medical Board will want to know.  If you think it is better for the Medical Board to reasign your scope of responsibility, think again.  You might not want to harm your own career in the future.  The record stands, and it will be difficult for future job options.</p>
              <p>I hope i don't get you more depressed when you read this.  Recovery is a long , long road.  Finally you are your own decision maker.  The choice is yours.  You want to get well, get a hobby, plug into a social network (on line ) , do volunteer work - do these at home since you are supposed to stay home for the time being.</p>
              <p>Go for morning or evening walks nearby, let your family know where you are, remain contactable though.</p>
              <p>You are very young, don't allow this temporary ailment to hamper your belief in yourself, in family and friends.  Your officers are merely doing their job.  </p>

              <p>There are a few things the medical board may do. Note that the probability for each of these are obviously not equal.</p>
              <p>a) Do nothing. </p>
              <p>b) Call you up and ask you to go down for further tests. They will likely down-PES you and revocate you as lizard has said.</p>
              <p>c) Down-Pes you and revocate you straight away. Unlikely, but possible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The medical board is like the HQ of all the MO in SAF. Serious medical problems as well down-pesing cases are referred to them.</p>
              <p>Now, just wait for them to call you up/send you letter and ask you to go down to Nee Soon camp (If I am not wrong, should be this camp). </p>

              <p>It's hard to explain the feeling i am feeling right now. Imagine being a slave and forced to listen to someone, do the things you don't enjoy doing anymore. Like listening to officer's order and do their job for them whereas they sit down and push all their work to you. They get paid high as well. For some you are more educated than them. </p>
              <p>I'm so young and not ready for military training. I hate war, weapons etc.</p>

              <p>Bro, let me explain the army system to you.</p>
              <p>your officers are scared of 2 things:</p>
              <p>#1 They don't want you to be making use of MC time. For most people this includes socializing and doing things for yourself like taking driving lessons, giving tuition etc. In your case, you just cannot do the second bunch of things.</p>
              <p>#2 They are very afraid of official records that you were outside when supposed to be at home. Lots of admin bullshit for them. Like if you are arrested, or only check IC when clubbing, or your driving test pass date was during your MC period.</p>
              <p>So...</p>
              <p>#1 go out and socialize but don't enjoy it too much (like by clubbing)</p>
              <p>#2 always have excuse, whether true or not. get your friend to say you were having lunch with him, then go and take your driving test. just don't get into an accident!</p>
              <p>#3 when those NSF come to check, invite them in to waste time before they go back to camp.</p>
              <p>Here is the thing. If you are a pai kia, they will be afraid you do bad things outside. If you are a good obedient boy, they will bully you with the rules. Generally the pai kias get away with more because they can be very uncooperative when they are needed. Don't be too much of both.</p>
