            <div class='col-md body'>Within the MPs, there are sub-vocations.... one of my friends was with a  investigative support unit. You get to visit camps to follow-up on incidents of a "criminal and serious" nature, e.g. such as shootings, murder, fraud, big time theft , any crime that goes beyond the CO's jurisdiction.....  Any vacancies are usually reserved for A level or poly grads , since there is a bit of paper work and tech stuff involved.<br><br>There are other MP units that are more mundane.... e.g. guard units. Here, you have to learn to live with the boredom. There have been a few cases in the good old days, where MPs have accidentally discharged their pistols , when they were playing with them while bored at their post. So be careful and responsible.</div>

He is definitely not the type who would want to be a MP guard ... if you know what I mean. Actually he went to SAFINCOS (SISPEC) and then posted to the MPs.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys, I got posted to be an MP, and I have urgent questions about being an MP:<br>1. As part of MP training, must we go outfield?<br>2. Must we put camo cream?<br>3.I heard there are 10 weeks of basic training where it's stay-in.. is it 5-day week or 5 and a half day week for Mowbray camp?<br>3. Do we get to book out/in in civvies?<br>4. Is there any way during the 1st 10 weeks where we can state our preference of our future posting within MP?<br>5. Is it totally stay-in for the first 10 weeks?<br>6. While doing PT/other training, do we still wear those grey ARMY tanktops/admin shirts, or are there "MP" tanktops/shirts that we now wear?<br>7. How xiong is the PT sessions/commanders in general? Is it worse than in BMT? Are they fiercer/stricter?<br><br>Thx guys! Any info is greatly appreciated--</div>
