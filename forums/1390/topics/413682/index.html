              <p>Wow thats seriously stupid, you pay someone to get rid of the camera fixed to your phone, and get a certificate for it so you can bring it to camp. That's like OMGWTF.</p>
              <p>Why don't you just hide the camera phone in your bagpack, and declare your 40 dollar no camera phone from your pocket? SIM card can swap around easily you know, unless you happen to be an iphone 4 user.</p>

              <p>  There are few posibilities that can happen to your hp or you . First you may be charged if your officer cb enough , 2nd they may confiscate your hp then there goes your iphone4 , 3rd and most minor consequence , they will paste a mindef sticker onto your camera lens covering it so that you can't take any pictures with the sticker covering the lens .</p>
              <p>  I've seen mindef phones with the camera covered with the sticker when i was in nokia care center . And once the sticker is on your lens , whatever pic you take using the camera will be blurred even if you remove the sticker . Unless you really spent effort to clean the lens after you peel the sticker off . Why make your hp subject to such things ? Bring a normal hp without camera to camp so difficult meh ?</p>
              <p>   I had a colleague whom was a civilian technician working inside one of the airbase , was caught with a camera phone , he immediately had his hp confiscated and clearance revoked . If you still want to take chances with your iphone4 , go ahead .</p>

              <p>You better not do this... Its troublesome... and also they simply damage your phone.... <br><br>I think you have to go down to Mindef HQ to get the certificate.<br>What I heard they do is that they either damage your camera function of the phone or cover it with metal bars to prevent you from ever using the camera function again... Its an irreversible procedure and you can never use your camera function ever again.... I guess its usually done for regulars who like a nice phone but dun mind the camera function being disabled forever.... and not done for 2 year NSFs.... <br><br>If you don't mind the hassle and also your camera being damaged, you can go ahead with it though.</p>
