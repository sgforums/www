As for DB or sort, I dun really know much abt this</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nope, at the end of his service, SAF will give ur friend a choice.<br>1.) To take up accelerated citizenship. (A normal person who does not serve NS will take sometime, as well as the chances when applying for citiizenship. However in army, this is accelerated, so hence accelerated citizenship.<br><br>2.) Or Decline the offer.<br><br>If he choose to decline the offer now. Later on when he wish to take up again, it will be based on his merit liao. No more accelerated citizenship even though he serve NS before. However, NS will be take into account. The wait and chances is the same as those who did not serve NS.<br><br>So make sure ur friend think carefully.<br><br>cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"></div>
