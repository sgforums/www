            <div class='col-md body'>First you must get a place in NUS Medicine. Under the selective disruption scheme, if you do well during BMT and not downgraded below PES B, you can proceed to MOCC. It is not just 'a few weeks'...the period of training in MOCC kept changing...it was 3 months at my time in SAFTI, then it was 6 months and at one time they changed it to 9 months like OCS for combat officers. They then realized it won't work cos' they did not have enough MOs..currently it's 4 months.<br><br>If you did not do well enough to get into OCS, you will complete your NSF in whatever vocation you have been given (from rifleman to signaller). You will then complete your medical studies and do your reservist in your NSF vocation. If the SAF is desperate for MOs in the reservist, they may negotiate with the hospitals to allow a batch of you to come in to do an abbreviated MOCC in stages...as reservist they cannot call you back for more than 40 days a year. The hospitals do not like that and so after an initial trial, I dun think there are many of such MOCC conversion courses. My colleague who is a consultant in the hospital goes back for reservist as a storeman...he just reads his medical journals during ICT and gets paid his civilian salary <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Think you are expecting too much of the hospital A&amp;E staff. Lets look at it from their perspective, they have potential heart attack patients, stroke patients, trauma patients... and here you have a young adult with a fever but is still walking and talking.<br><br>Ok, your high fever may be indicative of some serious problem. But once determined it is just a viral fever or perhaps an URTI, the medications are quite standard... panadol, NSAIDS and perhaps antibiotics if indicated. What else do you expect the A&amp;E staff to do? Admit you for IV drip or monitor in the A&amp;E with drip? Do you want to be admitted in the first place, and secondly is it necessary at all.<br><br>The A&amp;E purpose is to screen out potentially serious and life threatning cases for further management and treatment. By the fact that you are now here and posting on the net means the assessment and subsequent treatment is correct</div>

After NS, you can apply for a place in medical school overseas, either through a graduate or post-graduate path. If your poly results not good, you may need to apply for a graduate course.. get good results and then apply for med school (Singapore approved one) . This may take approximately 7 years. After that, complete your houseman training and do your medical officer rotations. Notify NS manpower that you are now a qualified doctor, and there are several NS MOCC courses conducted. It is a one month course for reservists... fastest commisioning in history... and you will get your CPT rank.<br><br>But frankly lah, there is nothing great in being an MO in army. As a recruit I know the MO seems like god in Pulau Tekong, but the MO there is the most pitiful of the lot.. seeing 100-150 people in a day, and most with just minor issues but blown out of context. Also, NSF MO pay allowance is high relatively, but understand that the MOs take a 50% paycut when entering army, and some of these people are married with houses and cars to fund.<br><br>My advise is just finish your NS, get a job earning millions and the army will not call you back ever</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, if only it were that easy. I've ORDed and am currently in sydney most likely studying medicine next year. i almost fainted when i saw that u may be a doc n not be a MO. if that were the case i'd rather stay in aust all the way.<br><br>it isn't like i wanna have an easy way out for reservist but i think the army has had 2 years of my life and that's more than enough. had a really bad time in there and now most of my platoon are trying they're best to siam reservist.<br><br>anw, the combat officers can look down on MOs all they want. just think abt it, MOs are trained and if they work in hospitals, constantly tested while the combat officers are largely untested. besides, when my friend once said that combat officers have pride, i told him, this is a civilian world. people respect a civilian job of higher status, not nec a doctor, than any military job. so, you can go ponder that fact.</div>
