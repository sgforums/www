              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Republic of Singapore Ship (RSS) Persistence was out at sea for training manoeuvres when tragedy struck.</span></em></p>
              <p>One of its sailors was found unconscious and had to be evacuated to a hospital in Singapore.</p>
              <p>20-year-old Lance Corporal (LCP) Mar Teng Fong was on engineering watch duty on board the RSS Persistence on 17 November 2009.</p>
              <p>He went for a routine check of the ship's engineering systems at about 11.40pm, but the engineering systems specialist did not return.</p>
              <p>After another 15 minutes, there was still no sign of LCP Mar, so a fellow serviceman went to look for him.</p>
              <p>LCP Mar was found at 12.01am, in the vicinity of the door connecting the engine room to the propeller shaft compartment of the ship.</p>
              <p>He was unconscious between the hydraulic door and its door frame.</p>
              <p>LCP Mar was given immediate medical attention by a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) doctor on board the ship, according to a statement by the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF).</p>
              <p>His condition was then deemed serious enough to have him evacuated by helicopter to Singapore General Hospital (SGH) at 1.15am. Throughout the flight back to shore, an SAF medical doctor and a medic continued to resuscitate him.</p>
              <p>LCP Mar was given emergency medical treatment upon arrival at SGH at 1.26am, he was then warded in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, LCP Mar could not be saved and passed away at SGH this afternoon at 2.44pm.</p>
              <p>LCP Mar's superior and Commanding Officer of RSS Persistence, Lieutenant-Colonel (LTC) Lee Soon Tat, said, "The RSS Persistence family is deeply saddened by the incident. Teng Fong was a positive and hardworking young man who was well liked by his peers and superiors."</p>
              <p>One of the late LCP Mar?s crew mate added, "Teng Fong was always willing to lend a helping hand to his buddies and never failed to bring a smile to everybody's faces. We will miss him very much."</p>
              <p>MINDEF is currently investigating the incident.</p>

              <p><br>Obviously you and many people don't understand what kind of shit goes on behind the scenes.</p>
              <p>RIP to him...</p>
              <p>But IMO, it shouldn't come as a surprise....the ship is an inherently dangerous place, and the worst thing is that the only time people usually knows something happens to you in a place like the engine room is when you don't appear when you should or when someone walks the rounds, by which it can be too late.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Edit: My heart goes out to the crew as well.....it will surely affect them quite badly especially his parent engineering dept.</p>

              <p>the design could be an issue or the soldier could be already suffering from some discomfort operating the door</p>
