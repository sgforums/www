              <h2 class="news_brief">The new <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/safvc">SAF Volunteer Corps</a></em></span> - a unit under the 
                      Singapore Armed Forces - is for those not required to do National 
                      Service but are willing to contribute to the country's national defence. <br></h2>
              <p>Those keen to volunteer in the army can
                       start applying from Monday (Oct 13, 2014). The new SAF Volunteer Corps - a 
                      unit under the Singapore Armed Forces - is aiming to recruit 100 to 150 
                      people in its first year, with the first batch to be drafted in next 
                      March. It is for those not required to do National Service but are 
                      willing to contribute to the country's national defence.</p>
              <p>The 
                      scheme is open to female Singaporeans, first generation permanent 
                      residents, and new citizens - between 18 and 45 years old. Applicants 
                      will undergo a medical screening and interview to assess if they have 
                      the right attitude for military service.</p>
              <p>Colonel Mike Tan, 
                      Commander of SAF Volunteer Corps, said: "National Service remains the 
                      cornerstone of Singapore's national defence and everyone has a part to 
                      play to support this. The SAFVC is an important commitment for 
                      individuals who are willing to take a step forward to be trained in 
                      roles that support the SAF and do their part for national defence."</p>
              <p>The Volunteer Corps was one of 30 recommendations made by the Committee to Strengthen National Service (CSNS) earlier this year.</p>
              <p>Applicants
                       can indicate the roles they want to serve in, from medical to 
                      engineering and naval operations. But some roles have certain 
                      requirements. For example, those applying as field psychologists must 
                      have at least three years of professional work experience. And they can 
                      switch roles at a later stage.</p>
              <p>Colonel Mike Tan said: 
                      "'Re-roling' is possible. Somebody wishing to be a security trooper at 
                      first may find later that he or she is more suited to be in the business
                       of information. We have facilitated this (role switching) as part of 
                      the SAFVC scheme."</p>
              <p><strong>SINGLE-TRACK SCHEME FOR VOLUNTEERS</strong></p>
              <p>Volunteers
                       will be placed on a single-track scheme to establish an identity for 
                      the Corps. Previously, a two-track - operations or specialist scheme - 
                      was floated.</p>
              <p>Colonel Mike Tan said: "It is very important for 
                      identity purposes that we have one track. Everybody that comes in is 
                      trained during the basic training in a same way so that they establish a
                       certain identity for the Volunteer Corps. The other thing is that as we
                       worked along the feasibility of having a two-track system versus a 
                      one-track system, we found that the one-track system is easier to 
                      administer and allows for greater flexibility for people to want to 
                      re-role."</p>
              <p>Volunteers will serve seven days each year, and be 
                      deployed alongside NSmen and regulars doing the same role. Under a 
                      ranking structure, volunteers will start off as an SV Trainee, and can 
                      be promoted based on their performance and length of service. The 
                      highest rank they can attain is SV 4.</p>
              <p><strong>UP TO THREE TRAINING CYCLES FOR VOLUNTEERS</strong></p>
              <p>They also have to undergo at least three training cycles:</p>
              <p>1.
                       A two-week basic training for an understanding of national defence. Key
                       features include a field camp and hand-grenade live throw. Volunteers 
                      can choose to either stay in camp for two weeks while undergoing this 
                      basic training or take up modular courses over a series of weekends.</p>
              <p>2.
                       A week-long qualification training, tailored for specific roles. For 
                      instance, volunteer nurses will train in the SAF Medical Training 
                      Institute and undergo on-the-job training.</p>
              <p>3. The advanced 
                      course will be for roles requiring additional training, like close 
                      combat and equipment training for security troopers.</p>
              <p>For both 
                      the qualification and advanced training, volunteers can opt for a 
                      one-week in-camp training or take modular courses over a series of 
                      weekends.</p>
              <p><strong>VOLUNTEERS TO GET SERVICE BENEFITS</strong></p>
              <p>Volunteers
                       will also get service benefits like meal and transport claims, and 
                      treatment at SAF medical and dental centres during call-ups. Career 
                      professionals will also get make-up pay for their service. Other 
                      benefits include being placed under the SAF Group Term Life Insurance 
                      coverage during call-ups. </p>
              <p>But volunteers will not receive 
                      allowance increment even if they are promoted. Volunteers also have to 
                      seek deferment from the SAF Volunteer Affairs Department if they are 
                      unable to serve their call-ups. And should they decide to leave the 
                      Corps, they have to give three months' advance notice. While under the 
                      Corps, they will also be subjected to the disciplinary framework based 
                      on military law.</p>
              <p><strong>ASPIRING VOLUNTEERS KEEN TO SIGN UP</strong></p>
              <p>Some
                       had planned to sign up as volunteers, even before applications opened. 
                      Singaporean Kweh Ting Ting had expressed her interest to Mindef through 
                      an email. The 27-year-old, who works as a coordinator for a company 
                      selling biomedical laboratory equipment, said she is able to contribute 
                      in the administrative and logistics department.</p>
              <p>"This is something
                       that I wanted to do and try since young. For females, we don't go 
                      through National Service. So this lets us open up and lets us see 
                      different vocations," she said.</p>
              <p>Another hopeful is Calven 
                      Bland, a PR who has lived in Singapore for nine years. The 42-year-old 
                      business development manager, who is married to a Singaporean, said he 
                      sees volunteering in the army as a way of giving back to the community 
                      and a continuation of his military background.</p>
              <p>He said: "I 
                      come from a military background. My family back in New Zealand have all 
                      served in the military. I used to serve, and I see this as a 
                      continuation of that tradition within my family. Secondly, if we have 
                      children, my son will have to serve National Service and I think it's 
                      important that as a father, I have some kind of an affinity with the 
                      Singapore Armed Forces to pass on to any children I have."</p>
              <p>The
                       scheme has raised questions about PRs using it to fast-track their 
                      citizenship process, but some like Mr Bland said that is not the 
                      intention.</p>
              <p>He said: "I am a PR now and I don't intend to go 
                      for citizenship yet. I am a New Zealander and my wife is a Singaporean. 
                      So, I think we have quite a good balance. I'm not looking at this as a 
                      platform for fast-tracking any citizenship application."</p>
              <p>Colonel
                       Mike Tan said it is important to send a clear message to potential 
                      volunteers that they should come forward to volunteer because they want 
                      to serve and also in appreciation of the security that they have 
                      benefited. "So, motivation is a very important thing for us," he added.</p>

              <p>By Jermyn Chow<br><br>SINGAPORE - Those who sign up for the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Volunteer Corps from Monday will have more leeway to decide how they want to serve their stint and contribute to the country's defence.<br><br>The military corps, which will enlist its first batch of volunteers in March next year, has been made flexible, in an effort to make it easier for people to step forward and match their skills and expertise to their volunteer roles.<br><br>Trainees can choose to stay in camp and undergo a four-week course that will familiarise them with the military's modus operandi or spread out their training sessions over a few weekends.<br><br>In a turnaround from an earlier proposal to make military volunteers serve up to 14 days for at least three years, the SAF has shortened the annual call-up period to seven days. Volunteers, who at anytime feel they no longer want to serve, will be allowed to drop out. They will need to inform commanders three months before they leave the corps.<br><br>These details were announced by Colonel Mike Tan, who has been appointed the commander of the SAF Volunteer Corps.<br><br>He said doing away with a compulsory three-year stint in the volunteer corps does not "take away the seriousness of the commitment".<br><br>"If volunteer is not able to keep pace with training and found to be unable to follow the training, then maybe its in everybody's interest to allow the volunteer to leave...you are not likely to give your best if you feel you are being tied down," he said at a media briefing on Oct 10.<br><br>For a start, they will get to choose from 17 vocations including defence psychologists, airbase civil engineers and security troopers. They may even get the chance to work onboard the Republic of Navy's ships and sail out to sea.<br><br>These volunteers will get the flexibility of switching among volunteer roles.<br><br>Women, first-generation permanent residents and new citizens, aged between 18 and 45 and are not liable for NS, are being targeted by the SAF Volunteer Corps. About 100 to 150 volunteers are expected to be enlisted in three batches next year.<br><br>Employers will have to let them serve and they will be given an allowance or make-up pay during their in-camp stints.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>After hanging up his army boots a decade ago, Mr Calven Bland is thirsting for another spell in the military.<br><br>The New Zealand-born Singapore permanent resident (PR), who was a logistician with the New Zealand Army for 12 years before coming to Singapore in 2005, plans to sign up with the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Volunteer Corps as a security trooper.<br><br>The 42-year-old, and others who are interested in getting a "stint" in the military, can sign up as military volunteers today.<br><br>Mr Bland, who is married to a Singaporean, said he is stepping up to be a volunteer as he admires the common bond that Singaporean males share as national servicemen.<br><br>"I get a little jealous when they have something common to talk about... after 10 years in Singapore, I would want to be part of the brotherhood," said the business development manager in a marine construction firm.<br><br>The father-to-be added: "If I expect my son to serve, as his father, I have to do something that is similar in nature... it's as close as I'm going to get to defending the country."<br><br>Vietnam-born PR Dao Tuan Son, 30, who has also been in Singapore for 10 years, said he wanted to go beyond the day-to-day acts of volunteerism to serve the country that has groomed him into what he is today.<br><br>The commercial analyst at General Electric Oil and Gas, who is also keen to sign up as a security trooper, said: "Everybody can donate but not everyone can be an SAF volunteer... it's a challenge that is well worth it."<br><br>While people like Mr Bland and Mr Son are stepping forward as volunteers to fulfil their personal aspirations, the SAF also benefits from the sharing of their expertise.<br><br>Major Alvin Phua, who heads the Air Force National Servicemen Branch in the Air Manpower Department, said volunteers with engineering expertise can act as consultants and share their industries' best practices to "improve work processes" in the air force.<br><br>Pharmacist and part-time polytechnic lecturer Jeremy Wong Weng Joon, 29, a Malaysia-born PR, said he is keen to sign up as a medical trainer.<br><br>Although he has yet to inform his employer about his intentions, he is confident that he will get the go-ahead.

              <p><strong>Q1. </strong><strong>How did the idea of an SAFVC come about?</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>The Committee to Strengthen National Service (CSNS) engaged more 
              than 40,000 people from all walks of life through extensive conversation
               on NS. One feedback that arose from these discussions is how more 
              Singaporeans want to be involved in national defence. A survey by the 
              Institute of Policy Studies found that 8 in 10 respondents supported 
              creating opportunities for women, new citizens and first generation PRs 
              to contribute to defence.  We took these feedback and have taken steps 
              to establish the SAF Volunteer Corps, to include the wider Singapore 
              community in contributing to our national defence.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Q2.</strong><strong> Who will manage the SAFVC?</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>An SAF Volunteer Affairs Department (SVAD) has been set up to manage
               the SAFVC. It will be responsible for personnel administration, 
              training, deployment and engagement of the SAFVC Volunteers.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Q3. </strong><strong>When can we expect the first Volunteer to be deployed?</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>SAFVC Volunteers can be deployed upon completion of their training. 
              The SVAD will work with SAFVC Volunteers to arrange for their 
              deployments. The first intake of Volunteers will begin their training in
               Mar 15. We can expect the first Volunteers to be deployed as early as 
              the second half of 2015.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Q4. </strong><strong>What can a Volunteer expect in his/her Volunteer journey?</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>SAFVC Volunteers will undergo the requisite training to be 
              proficient in their respective roles and be familiarised with service in
               the SAF. Over the years, SAFVC Volunteers will deepen their skills and 
              knowledge, and eventually have the opportunity to coach and mentor other
               SAFVC Volunteers.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>We have a general development plan for our Volunteers. The 
              development plan for SAFVC Volunteers is based on the SAFVC Volunteers’ 
              length of service and rank progression in the Corps. As the SAFVC 
              Volunteer becomes more experienced and familiar with the SAF, he or she 
              will be given the training to take on greater responsibilities. 
              Flexibility, however, will also be given to SAFVC Volunteers to progress
               at their own pace. </li>

              <p><strong>Q1. </strong><strong>How long does the application process take?</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Upon receiving the hardcopy/softcopy application, the application 
              will be immediate processed. Depending on the volume of applications, an
               applicant may receive a letter from Recruitment Centre to schedule for 
              an interview in about four weeks. Applicants will also be required to 
              bring certain documents and fill in some forms for the purpose of the 
              interview.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Upon passing the interview and submitting the completed set of 
              required documents, the applicants should expect to wait up to four 
              weeks before being called up for a medical screening. The duration for 
              medical screening may vary from individual to individual depending on 
              the individual’s health status.</li>

              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Q2. </strong><strong>Who is eligible to join the SAFVC?</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li> The SAFVC is open to all individuals who are not required to serve NS. These include Women, 1<sup>st</sup> generation PRs and new citizens. We welcome all Singaporeans and PRs 
              who desire to contribute and are aged 18-45 years old to sign up.  
              Applicants will undergo medical screenings and interviews to determine 
              if they are suitable to serve as Volunteers. Find out more by visiting <strong><span class="redLi">www.mindef.gov.sg/SAFVC</span></strong>.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li><em>[For NSmen in the SAF]</em> Those with NS training are strongly 
              encouraged to contribute in their NS capacity. NSmen who have completed 
              their NS liability can apply to volunteer through their former NS units.
               NSmen who wish to contribute their civilian expertise can contact <a href="mailto:ecs_query@defence.gov.sg"><strong><span class="redLi">ecs_query@defence.gov.sg</span></strong></a> to find out more about the Expertise Conversion Scheme.  </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li><em>[For NSmen serving in the SPF/SCDF]</em> If you meet the 
              eligibility criteria, you can join the SAFVC. However, service in the 
              SAFVC does not replace your NS obligations in the SPF and the SCDF. If 
              there is a conflict in call-up schedule, your obligations in the SPF/ 
              SCDF will take precedence over that of the SAFVC.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li><em>[For NSFs] </em>NSFs serving in the SAF, SPF and SCDF will not be considered for the SAFVC.</li>

              <p><strong>Q3.  </strong><strong>What are the minimum requirements for the Roles?</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>SAFVC Volunteers will need to meet the pre-requisite qualifications,
               and fulfil the relevant training requirements so that they can 
              contribute in their roles safely and effectively. The minimum 
              requirements vary for roles to roles. Some of these requirements are 
              relevant work experience, physical fitness level and assessed overall

              <ul>
              <li>SAFVC Volunteers will undergo Basic Training conducted in SAFVC. The
               training cadre comprises staff from the SAFVC, augmented by a cadre of 
              experienced regular trainers from BMTC.  The Qualification and Advance 
              training to qualify SAFVC Volunteers for deployments are similarly 
              conducted by experienced SAF trainers from the respective domain 
              expertise. Training is designed to ensure SAFVC Volunteers are 
              adequately trained and ready to fulfil the roles that they have 
              volunteered to perform.</li>

              <p><strong>Q2. </strong><strong>Will training be safe?</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>The SAF takes a serious view of safety. Safety is an imperative. 
              Sufficient resources will be committed to ensure the safety of training.
               Furthermore, SAFVC Volunteers will be trained by experienced Regular 
              trainers from BMTC. All SAFVC Volunteers will also undergo medical 
              check-ups to determine their suitability to participate in training and 
              be deployed to their roles.</li>

              <ul>
              <li>SAFVC Volunteers will typically be called up for 7 days each year. 
              During their service, those who are unable to fulfil this duration of 
              service (e.g., due to relocation or injury) can request to be placed on a
               holding list. They can request to resume their volunteer service

              <li>The SVAD will provide early notice when issuing call ups to the 
              SAFVC Volunteers so that they can make the necessary arrangements to be 
              excused from their other commitments and hence minimise the number of

              <li>All SAFVC enlistees are members of the SAF, just like our NSFs and

              <p>More than 200 people have applied to join the Singapore Armed
              Forces Volunteer Corps (SAFVC) a week after recruitment began — a
              response Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said was encouraging.</p>
              <p>Giving this update in a Facebook post Sunday (Oct 19), Dr Ng
              said 40 per cent of the applicants are permanent residents and 60
              per cent are citizens. A quarter of the applicants are women.</p>
              <p>Among the reasons cited for wanting to volunteer were to “give
              back to Singapore”, “lead by example for my son” and offer their
              “talent and service”, he said, adding that he was “happy with the
              encouraging response so far”.</p>
              <p>The SAFVC was among the recommendations of the Committee to
              Strengthen National Service and is aimed at giving more people a
              chance to contribute to Singapore’s defence. The SAF plans to
              recruit 100 to 150 such volunteers a year over three recruitment
              drives.</p>
              <p>Applications opened last Monday. Depending on the number of
              applications received, an applicant may be informed via a letter to
              schedule an interview in about four weeks.</p>
              <p>After passing the interview and submitting the required
              documents, an applicant may wait up to four weeks before being
              called up for a medical screening.</p>
              <p>“The SAF will screen applicants carefully to find those with
              suitable aptitudes and skills to be pioneer batches of the SAFVC
              that can strengthen our national defence,” Dr Ng said.</p>
              <p>Volunteers can choose to serve in wide-ranging fields, from
              operational deployments to professional roles such as legal
              specialist staff and doctors — alongside regular soldiers in active
              units.</p>
              <p>They can switch roles during their stint and there is no minimum
              period of service. They are expected to be called up seven days a
              year.</p>
              <p>Training is expected to begin in March next year and volunteers
              could be deployed as early as the second half of next year.
              Applications are still open.</p>

              <p><strong>SAF Volunteer Corps Allows More to Contribute to National Defence</strong></p>
              <p>We refer to the forum letters "Initial success depends on applicants"
                   by Mr Kwan Jin Yao and "Issues with volunteer soldiers" by Mr Lee Yong 
                  Se (both dated 20 Oct 14), as well as "Transform Volunteer Corps into 
                  Military Reserve Force" by Mr Chew Kok Liang (dated 22 Oct 14).</p>
              <p>The Singapore Armed Forces Volunteer Corps (SAFVC) is the first 
                  uniformed service scheme that will provide more Singaporeans and 
                  Permanent Residents the opportunity to contribute to national defence, 
                  show support for National Service (NS) and deepen their understanding 
                  and ownership of national defence. Other existing volunteer schemes 
                  within the SAF allow national servicemen to continue serving beyond 
                  their NS obligations, as well as for Singaporeans who are experts from 
                  the private and public sectors to serve on MINDEF's boards and 
                  committees.</p>
              <p>The success of the SAFVC will depend on the commitment of Volunteers 
                  to give their best while serving in their respective roles. Volunteers 
                  will be carefully selected, taking into account their motivation, 
                  aptitude and experience, to determine if they are suitable for military 
                  service. Volunteers will also undergo medical and security screening 
                  processes similar to our national servicemen.</p>
              <p>The SAF takes the contributions and proficiency of Volunteers 
                  seriously. Volunteers will be trained to standards before they are 
                  deployed. This emphasis will ensure that Volunteers continuously improve
                   their skills, in order for them to contribute meaningfully to our 
                  country's defence and security.</p>
              <p>In evaluating the SAFVC, the context of Singapore's defence must be 
                  taken into consideration. NS is the cornerstone of Singapore's defence, 
                  and every national serviceman is an essential part of the SAF. The 
                  training that our national servicemen undertake ensures that the SAF is 
                  operationally ready to deal with a range of security threats and 
                  challenges. The roles and expectations of Volunteers are different as 
                  they will be trained and deployed in roles that support the duties of 
                  our national servicemen.</p>
              <p>We welcome feedback from the public, and look forward to engaging our future Volunteers.</p>

              <p>Or maybe you recently made Singapore your home, and would like to do your part in keeping it safe for your family and friends.<br> <br> You'll now have the chance to fulfil these wishes.<br> <br> Come 2015, the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) will welcome more people 
                      into its family of Regulars, Operationally Ready National Servicemen 
                      (NSmen) andâ€¨Full-time National Servicemen (NSFs).<br> <br> With the establishment of the SAF Volunteer Corps (SAFVC), non 
                      NS-liable Singaporeans and Permanent Residents (PRs) - such as women, 
                      first-generation PR sand new citizens - will now be able to contribute 
                      to national defence, show support for NS, and deepen their understanding
                       and ownership of national defence.</p>
              <p>During his Committee to Strengthen NS Press Conference on 22 May, 
                      Defence Minister Dr Ng Eng Hen noted that through the year-long process 
                      of engaging the public and listening to their ideas and feedback, 
                      committee members met with "many, who do not have NS obligations, but 
                      wanted to contribute to national defence". Thus, the SAFVC, a uniformed 
                      volunteer scheme, was set up following the committee's recommendation.</p>

              <h3>New look, old traditions</h3>
              <div>
              <p><br> The SAFVC was officially set up in end-September, and is helmed by Commander SAFVC, Colonel (COL) Mike Tan.</p>
              <p>Headquarters (HQ) SAFVC is located in Maju Camp, where training will also be held.</p>
              <p>The SAFVC may be new, but it follows in the footsteps of a long and 
                      distinguished tradition of volunteerism for national defence.</p>
              <p>Beginning with the Singapore Volunteer Rifle Corps (a private 
                      organisation established in 1854 to combat lawlessness), the corps of 
                      volunteers evolved over the next 48 years into the Singapore Volunteer 
                      Corps (SVC), the SAFVC's predecessor.</p>
              <p>The SVC played an important role forming the Singapore Military 
                      Forces in 1953 together with Regulars and part-time national servicemen.</p>
              <p>The volunteer units were then subsumed into the People's Defence Force (PDF) in 1965.</p>
              <p>With the subsequent growth of NS and the SAF, the number of 
                      volunteers declined, and the last Volunteer battalion, 101 PDF, held its
                       final parade in 1984.</p>
              <p>As homage to the illustrious 160-year history of Volunteer Military 
                      Service in Singapore, the SAFVC logo incorporates elements from the 
                      original SVC coat of arms, such as the circular shield, banner and 
                      laurel.</p>

              <h3>Finding the right fit</h3>
              <div>
              <p><br> Applications to the SAFVC began on 13 Oct and within a week, more than 
                      200 Singaporeans and PRs had dropped off their forms at the Army 
                      Recruitment Centre (ARC) or signed up online. Dr Ng revealed this on his
                       Facebook page, adding that he was "happy with the encouraging response 
                      so far".</p>
              <p>COL Tan echoed Dr Ng's comments, remarking that the growing numbers 
                      were indeed encouraging. The SAFVC plans to recruit three batches of 
                      volunteers in the first year, with 30 to 50 enlistees in the inaugural 
                      batch commencing training on 23 Mar 2015.</p>
              <p>After being shortlisted, applicants will have to undergo an interview
                       as well as a medical screening before they are accepted into the SAFVC.
                       COL Tan plans to oversee the interview process, and recognised that it 
                      would be an onerous task.</p>
              <p>"Certainly, the SAFVC is not for everybody; (for instance) if you are
                       not the outdoorsy type, you may find that it is not your cup of tea. 
                      There are other MINDEF (Ministry of Defence) volunteer schemes 
                      (available).</p>
              <p>"That's why the interview is so important - I want to make sure that 
                      the volunteers we select really want to be here, and will also fit in 
                      with us." He added that motivation and aptitude are crucial factors in 
                      determining the applicants' suitability.</p>
              <p>COL Tan also noted that although there is no minimum commitment 
                      period for volunteers, those who indicate that they are prepared to 
                      commit for the long term will be considered more favourably.</p>

              <h3>Welcome to the uniformed life</h3>
              <div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Upon successful application, volunteers will receive their letters of
                       enlistment and embark on a three-phase training programme, designed to 
                      give them a taste of Basic Military Training (BMT) and equip them with 
                      the skills necessary for their respective roles.</p>
              <p>The SAFVC Volunteers (or SVs, as the enlistees are known) will 
                      undergo a two-week Basic Training (BT), followed by a one-week 
                      Qualification Training (QT). Some will be required to attend another 
                      week-long Advanced Training (AT) to further prepare them for their 
                      vocations.</p>
              <p>The two-week stay-in BT is a module common to all SVs.</p>
              <p>It aims to develop in the SVs a basic appreciation of the SAF and understanding of national defence.</p>
              <p>The SVs will have the opportunity to try their hands at firing a 
                      Singapore Assault Rifle 21, throw a live hand grenade, and even go 
                      through a field camp.</p>
              <p>Training will be supervised by COL Tan, and led by a Head of Training
                       and a company commander. They will be assisted by a team of experienced
                       trainers from BMT Centre and parts of the Infantry.</p>
              <p>COL Tan emphasised that "the idea is not to train someone from a 
                      civilian to a soldier; that will take nine weeks (the length of BMT). 
                      However, the two weeks is sufficient for them to have an introduction to
                       NS and learn about the military ethos and what it means to wear a 
                      uniform".</p>
              <p>Currently, there are plans to offer the modular option of completing 
                      the BT over a series of weekend days instead of the continuous fortnight
                       stay-in. This option would be helpful for volunteers with heavy school,
                       work or family commitments.</p>
              <p>Although the curricula for both the continuous and modular options 
                      are similar and will equip the SVs with the necessary knowledge and 
                      skills, COL Tan encouraged those who could afford the time to choose the
                       stay-in option for "the most complete experience", as it includes the 
                      field camp component.</p>

              <p>A unique rank structure was created for the SAFVC Volunteers (SVs). 
                      As their contribution are different from those of Regulars and NSmen, 
                      there is no comparison between the SV rank and others in the SAF. It 
                      also differentiates them from SAF Volunteers, former NSmen who continue 
                      to service past the statutory age.</p>
              <p>New enlistees begin as SV (Trainees), and will be promoted to SV1 
                      upon completion of their Qualification Training. Subsequent promotions 
                      are dependent on years of service, as well as conduct and performance.</p>

              <div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After BT, SVs then move on to QT, where they will train under the 
                      respective domain experts to prepare for their specific roles. One of 
                      the trainers they might meet is Military Expert (ME) 5-1 See Yen Ling, a
                       Nursing Officer at the SAF Medical Training Institute. ME5-1 See trains
                       doctors and medics when they return for their annual ICT, and will 
                      train SVs who sign up as medical trainers.</p>
              <p>Elaborating on the second phase of training for medical trainers, 
                      ME5-1 See said: "As medical professionals in hospitals, the types of 
                      cases they see are different from those in the military.</p>
              <p>During QT, they will be introduced to the Medical Corps and become 
                      familiar with our work environment, such as the equipment, simulation 
                      labs and outfield environments.</p>
              <p>"Upon completion of the QT phase, SVs will be considered full-fledged
                       SAFVC Volunteers and can begin to be deployed to SAF units. However, 
                      some roles, such as the Auxiliary Security Trooper (AST), will require 
                      the AT.</p>
              <p>While AST trainees will gain proficiency in rifle handling and learn 
                      when to make use of their weapons during the QT, an additional week at 
                      the AT is necessary for them to acquire the required knowledge and learn
                       the application of their skills - such as apprehending and securing 
                      targets.</p>

              <div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SVs can choose from 17 roles in nine categories. They will typically 
                      be called up to serve seven days annually, alongside servicemen and 
                      women from the Army, Navy and Air Force, donning the SAFVC formation 
                      patch on their respective green, grey or blue uniforms. Some roles, such
                       as those in engineering, medicine or law, require prior work 
                      experience, while others like the AST, InfoMedia Staff and Bridge 
                      Watchkeeper are open to all.</p>
              <p>Working with SVs will be a new experience for Regulars, NSmen and 
                      NSFs alike. However, COL Tan believes the experience will be beneficial 
                      to all.</p>
              <p>ME5-1 See agreed: "I look forward to working alongside the SVs, 
                      because they will be able to share their experience in their respective 
                      fields with us. This will, in turn, enrich our training as well."</p>
              <p>During call-ups, the SVs will report directly to the various SAF 
                      units which they are attached to. They will receive instructions from 
                      their Regular and national servicemen commanders.</p>
              <p>"The section or mission commander is expected to take charge of the 
                      mission and guide the SV in becoming an effective member of the team. 
                      This is because he has undergone two years of NS and several ICTs and is
                       therefore better trained and more experienced (in fulfilling 
                      missions)," COL Tan explained.</p>
              <p>He added: "This is why NS will always be the cornerstone of national 
                      defence and will not be replaced by the SAFVC. They are trained much 
                      more rigorously."</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, "We hope the NSmen will come to respect and appreciate 
                      the SVs because, while they may not be as intensively trained, they come
                       with life and career experience," said COL Tan. "They will also bring 
                      another set of eyes and perspectives to situations that have become 
                      commonplace to us."</p>
              <p>Interested volunteers may obtain their hardcopy forms from ARC, or download the electronic forms from the SAFVC website (<a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/join_us/safvc.html">www.mindef.gov.sg/safvc</a>) and email them to <a href="mailto:safvc@defence.gov.sg">safvc@defence.gov.sg</a>. Applicants must be 18 to 45 years old, and will be eligible to serve from the ages of 18 to 50.</p>
