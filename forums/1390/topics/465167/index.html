The detention may take effect on any date and shall be terminated on payment of fine.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">(B)    Central Defaulters Management Branch (CDMB)</strong><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">CDMB was set up as a tri-service shared services structure within the NSmen Services Centre (NSSC) to manage all IPPT/RT defaulter offenders on behalf of their parent NS units. The NS Commanders maintain the prerogative to summary trial the NSmen if they wish to do so. Under such circumstances, CDMB will provide the use of its premises and facilities to conduct the Summary Trial.</p>

The annual IPPT requirement will be fulfilled upon successful attainment of the required PPT during non-ICT/ICT IPPT sessions. NSmen whose BMI is 27 and above will, by default, be enrolled into the weight loss IPT program. The PPT will be raised automatically on a yearly basis to motivate NSmen to seek continuous fitness improvement. See <strong style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Figure 1</strong> for the enhanced IPT program.</p>

NSmen are free to book the days for their training sessions as reflected at the NS Portal Booking System. However, for safety reasons, they must have a break of 1 day in-between training session. The IPT timings are as follows:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.1em; margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; color: #303030; line-height: 20px; font-family: Tahoma, Arial; background-color: #d3d3d2;"><strong style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Determination of PPT</strong><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The PPT standard for the NSmen in a typical birthday window will be derived from the first IPPT test result conducted during the 1st session of the IPT. Test results from the 1st session will be compared with the previous year, and the results with the higher IPPT standard will be used. For NSmen who just transited to ORNS, the 1st session IPPT result in IPT will be used instead. The entry level of the lowest performing IPPT station will be used as the starting point to derive the target PPT standard for all stations. NSmen must achieve the next higher level by the 10th session (IPT IPPT) in order to be considered as having met their PPTs. See Table 1 below for illustration of PPT starting points.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.1em; margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; color: #303030; line-height: 20px; font-family: Tahoma, Arial; background-color: #d3d3d2;"><strong style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Discharge from IPT</strong><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">As participation in IPT is voluntary, NSmen can choose to attempt a non-ICT IPPT before the 10th session or anytime within the first 9 months of the IPPT birthday window. However, separate IPPT booking is required. The NSmen will be discharged from the IPT program if (1) obtain a pass in IPPT or (2) achieve the required PPT for that year. Any absentees from any IPT session will not be disciplinary dealt with. <br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></p>

NSmen are assessed on their Personal Performance Target (PPT) during this test in relation to their past year’s IPPT result, if any. The test on the 10th session evaluates the level of fitness achieved by the NSmen during the IPT program. NSmen who did not manage to clear their PPTs must do an additional 8 sessions of Remedial Training (RT) to prepare them for their next IPPT cycle.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">NS Liability and Pay</strong><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Participation in IPT is strictly voluntary, thus NSmen will not be given service pay or make-up pay, and the attendance will not be counted towards the annual 40 days NS callup. The sessions are recognized for call-up/payment if they contribute towards the first 3 IPPT attempts. SAF will not bear the responsibility for any injuries sustained by the NSmen arising from the training. However, all IPT sessions attended will be recorded in the NSman Training History as a voluntary training activity so that the Nsman's participation in IPT is duly acknowledged.</p>

                  Officers and 40 years for WOSPECs. The NSman's IPPT annual requirement 
                  commences on his birthday immediately after his NSF Operational Ready 
                  Date (ORD) and ends on his NS Run Out Date (ROD) or MINDEF Reserve Date

                  commences on his birthday and ends on the day before his next birthday, 
                  both days inclusive. NSman who has just ORDed can take his IPPT 
                  immediately. The results will be counted towards his IPPT requirements 
                  for the first NS year. The IPPT window is divided into two parts as

                  window. They can make as many attempts as they want within their first 9 months of
                  the IPPT window. Regardless of the number of attempts made at the FCC, only the first
                  3 attempts by the NSman will be considered towards his NS liability and will be paid
                  service and make-up pay, if applicable. Notwithstanding this, the SAF will continue to
                  bear the responsibility for service injuries sustained by the NSmen whilst attempting the
                  IPPT beyond the third attempt. NSmen will not be allowed to make any more attempts

                  are considered Partial Failures. They will be allowed to make multiple attempts to pass
                  the particular static station within 3 months of their IPPT window after the original test
                  date. Should they fail to pass the particular static station within 3 months duration, they
                  will have to retake the complete ippt. NSmen attempting single-station retest will not be
                  eligible for monetary awards unless they retake the complete test in one sitting.</p>

              <p>As frontline soldiers, it is essential that you maintain physical fitness and undergo regular training.</p>
              <p>The Enhanced NS IPPT system was implemented on 1 Apr 2011. It 
              incorporates principles of fitness training science to enable NSmen to 
              train more effectively, while offering flexibility in planning their 
              fitness training to stay fit. Individual Physical Proficiency Test 
              (IPPT) is a standard physical fitness test to gauge the basic physical 
              fitness of an individual. The IPPT is a standard physical fitness test 
              designed to test the basic components of physical fitness and motor 
              skills of an individual soldier. In this service package, NSmen can find
               out about policies governing IPPT and book their IPPT dates.</p>
              <p><strong>In the IPPT Gazette under the Enlistment Act dated 26 May 06, if 
              an NSman fails to pass, or fails to take, the IPPT within any IPPT year,
               he will have to attend and complete a remedial training programme at 
              any SAF FCC. <br> </strong>    <br> IPPT can be divided into the followings:</p>
              <ol>
              <li><strong>ICT IPPT</strong><br> This is a requirement for all NSmen participation as part of the ICT programme, unless exempted due to medical reasons.<br> </li>
              <li><strong>Non-ICT IPPT</strong><br> This is conducted at various IPPT test centres and the NSman can make as many attempts at the <strong>Fitness Conditioning Centres</strong> (FCCs). Note that only the first 3 IPPT attempts will be considered 
              towards the NSman’s NS liability and be paid service and make-up pay, if
               applicable.<br> </li>
              </ol>
              <p><strong>SAF Health Screening Programme</strong><br> With effect from 30 May 2011, “IPPT-FFI” was incorporated into the revised<strong> SAF Health Screening Programme</strong>,
               which is the compulsory medical examination for all IPPT-eligible NSmen
               35 years of age and above. There is no need to do a separate "IPPT-FFI"
               if you have already completed the SAF Health Screening Programme for 
              that year.The SAF Health Screening Programme review should be initiated 
              by your NS unit administrator once your IPPT window, i.e. your birthday 
              window is open. <br> <br> If you are IPPT-eligible, 35 years of age and above, you are required to
               complete the SAF Health Screening Programme every year before your IPPT
               attempt. The aim of this medical screening is to detect any medical 
              conditions which may make you unsuitable for the IPPT.Note that if you 
              have not completed your SAF Health Screening Programme requirements for 
              the year, you will not be allowed to take your IPPT. You will be issued 
              with a certificate once you have completed your SAF Health Screening 
              Programme requirements. The certificate is valid for 30 days until your 
              next birthday; i.e. if you are 35 years old, this certificate will be 
              valid until (and including) the 30th day after your 36th birthday.</p>
              <p><strong>Applicability</strong><br> The annual IPPT is applicable to all PES A, B/B1, B2/C1 NSmen and DXO 
              with NS liability, till age 45 and 40 years old for Officers and WOSPEC 
              respectively. The NSman's IPPT annual requirement commences on his 
              birthday immediately after his NSF Operational Ready Date (ORD) and ends
               when he is posted to MINDEF Reserves (MR), or medically downgraded to 
              PES C2 and below.<br> <br> <strong>What is the IPPT Window?</strong><br> <br> The NSman's IPPT window is based on his birthday. The IPPT window 
              commences on his birthday and ends on the day before his next birthday, 
              both days inclusive. NSman who has just ORDed can take his IPPT 
              immediately. The results will be counted towards his IPPT requirements 
              for the first NS year. The IPPT window is divided into two parts as

              month of NSman birthday window and ends on the day before his next 
              birthday. RT must be completed within this period, and will be applied 
              for the following cases:
              <ul>
              <li>20 sessions of RT for IPPT failures and defaulters, and IPT defaulters who did not complete the 10-session IPT program.</li>
              <li>8 sessions of RT for those who completed the 10-session IPT/E1 PEP program but did not meet the PPT.<br> </li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Test Frequency</strong><br> NSmen must attempt at least ONE IPPT within their first 9 months of the 
              IPPT window. They can make as many attempts as they want within their 
              first 9 months of the IPPT window. Regardless of the number of attempts 
              made at the FCC, only the first 3 attempts by the NSman will be 
              considered towards his NS liability and will be paid service and make-up
               pay, if applicable. Notwithstanding this, the SAF will continue to bear
               the responsibility for service injuries sustained by the NSmen whilst 
              attempting the IPPT beyond the third attempt. NSmen will not be allowed 
              to make any more attempts within their annual IPPT window at the FCC 
              after attaining the GOLD standard, regardless of the number of attempts.</p>
              <p><strong>IPPT Requirement<br> </strong>All eligible NSmen must attempt their IPPT once within the first 9 
              months of their IPPT window. They may attempt IPPT during their ICT or 
              at any FCC and may make as many attempts as they want to improve their 
              IPPT results, except for NSmen who have attained the IPPT Gold standards
               for the IPPT year. The best result achieved will be taken as the record
               for that IPPT year.<br> <br> <strong>What are the IPPT exemptions?</strong><br> You are exempted from your annual IPPT if you fit into the following conditions:</p>
              <p>All IPPT-liable NSmen will only be exempted on the following conditions.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Permanently downgraded to <strong>PES C2 and below</strong>. <br> </li>
              <li>Have <strong>continuous</strong> medical exemption (from IPPT) for a period of <strong>4 months or more</strong> during the first 9 months of the IPPT Birthday Window.</li>
              <li>Have accumulated medical exemption (from IPPT) for a period of <strong>7 months or more</strong> during the first 9 months of the IPPT Birthday Window.</li>
              <li>NSmen who are disrupted from ORNS duties.<br> </li>
              </ol>
              <p><em>*The onus is on the NSmen to inform their NS units and present 
              their medical documentation as evidence, when called back to answer to 
              the IPPT related charges. Alternatively, they can request for a medical 
              review by a SAF Medical Officer though his NS un</em>it.<br> <br> The annual IPPT is designed to test your basic components of physical fitness and motor skills.</p>
              <p><strong>What if I fail one test station?</strong><br> <br> NSmen who achieve the required total number of points, but fail only one
               static station are considered Partial Failures. They will be allowed to
               make multiple attempts to pass the particular static station within 3 
              months of their IPPT window after the original test date. Should they 
              fail to pass the particular static station within 3 months duration, 
              they will have to retake the complete IPPT. NSmen attempting 
              single-station retest will not be eligible for monetary awards unless 
              they retake the complete test in one sitting.<br> <br> <strong>What if I sustain an injury due to Service?</strong><br> MINDEF will continue to bear the responsibility if you sustain an injury
               whilst attempting your non-ICT IPPT beyond your 3rd attempt. Be sure to
               pre-book your training programme and register before each training 
              session starts. This is to ensure that your training records can be 
              verified when filing for compensation claims.<br> <br> <strong>Where can I take my IPPT?<br> <br> Non-ICT IPPT Centres</strong><br> <br> Non-ICT IPPT is conducted at the following Fitness and Conditioning Centres (FCC) and SAFRA Gyms:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Khatib Fitness and Conditioning Centre</li>
              <li>Maju Fitness and Conditioning Centre</li>
              <li>Bedok Fitness and Conditioning Centre</li>
              <li>Kranji Fitness and Conditioning Centre<br> </li>
              <li>SAFRA Tampines<br> </li>
              <li>SAFRA Jurong</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Khatib, Maju, Bedok and Kranji FCC conduct 5 sessions per week.</p>
              <p>The centres operate from Mondays to Thursdays and Saturdays 
              (excluding public holidays). On the day of your IPPT, you are required 
              to report in PT kit (short sleeved T-Shirt, shorts and jogging shoes) 
              and arrived at the stated registration time with your Identity Card or 
              SAF11B.</p>
              <p>(A)    <strong>SAFRA Gymnasium</strong><br> As part of MINDEF’s continuous effort to provide you with greater 
              accessibility, you can also take your IPPT at either  Jurong or Tampines
               SAFRA EnergyOne Gyms. <br> <br> This option of IPPT in SAFRA gyms will only issue a “pass only” standard
               as it aims to complement the outdoor IPPT. Those who aspire to achieve 
              monetary awards should continue to take their IPPT at FCCs or during 
              their ICT. <br> The test protocol for the static stations remains unchanged at the SAFRA
               gyms. The 2.4km Run is conducted on the treadmill, which has been 
              calibrated to negate any advantage from running on the treadmill. Note 
              that this scheme is not applicable for Commandos and Divers.<br> <br> The test in SAFRA gyms is available everyday except Mondays, Fridays and
               public holidays and will be alternated between the 2 clubs. If you are a
               SAFRA member, the usage of gym equipment and facilities will be free. 
              Otherwise, for non-SAFRA members, you will pay a nominal fee.</p>
              <p><strong>What are my IPPT incentives?</strong><br> A 3-tier monetary incentive awards system was previously implemented to 
              motivate and encourage you to achieve beyond the PASS standard for 
              better results. <br> <br> If you are a Category X to Z and Z1 to Z2/V NSman and you attempt the 
              full IPPT of 5 test stations and the 3-station IPPT respectively in one 
              sitting, and attain the required standards, you are eligible for the 
              IPPT incentive.You are allowed unlimited attempts to qualify for the 
              award within the same IPPT window. NSmen will be paid the incremental 
              difference when they improve on their current standard. To illustrate, 
              an NSman who was paid $100 after achieving the Incentive award, will be 
              paid the difference of $100 if he is able to achieve a Silver Award in 
              his next test.</p>
              <p>Since all IPPT, RT and IPT are regarded as SAF training activities, you will also be entitled to <strong>Service and Make-Up Pay</strong>. Payments include:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>First 3 sessions of non-ICT IPPT taken during the IPPT year, if applicable.</li>

              <p><span><strong>Q1 What is the NS IPPT System? </strong><br> The current NS IPPT System was enhanced from the 1-year IPPT “birthday window”<br> system and implemented since Apr 2011. As a system, the NS IPPT window remains<br> as 12 months. The first 9 months can be used by NS men to train and attempt IPPT or,<br> opt for the Enhanced IPT. The remaining 3 months will be used to further provide<br> training support to better help NS men to meet their annual IPPT obligations. If there is<br> an ICT within the qualifying window, NSmen can take and pass their annual IPPT<br> during the ICT. If there isn't any ICT during the qualifying window, NSmen should<br> book for a test session at any Fitness Conditioning Centres (FCCs) or the Gym IPPT at<br> SAFRA Gyms.<br><br> <strong>Q2 How long is each IPPT qualifying window? </strong><br> The IPPT window commences on NSmen's birthday each year and ends on the day prior<br> to his next birthday, both days inclusive. It is divided into 2 parts:<br> 
              </span></p><ul>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The first 9 months</span>. Commences on the NSmen's birthday till the 9th month of
              their window. For example, if your birthday is 26 Dec 1990. Your 2012 window
              will start on 26 Dec 2012 and ends on 25 Sep 2013.</li>
              <br>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The next 3 months</span>. Commences on the 10th month of the birthday window. RT
              must be completed within this period, and will be applied for the following
              cases:
              <ul>
              <li>20 sessions of RT for IPPT failures and defaulters, and IPT/E1 PEP
              defaulters who did not complete the 10-session IPT/E1 PEP program.</li>
              <br>
              <li>8 sessions of RT for those who completed the 10-session IPT/E1 PEP
              program but did not meet the PPT.</li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              <br>
              </ul>
              <br><strong>Q3 Will I be reminded of my IPPT qualifying window and the need to take my IPPT?</strong><br>All
               NSmen deployed in IPPT eligible NS Units are required, under Section 14
               of the Enlistment Act Cap 93, to report and undergo IPPT activities, 
              including RT if required, every year till they are posted to the MINDEF 
              Reserve. The onus is on the individual to attend IPPT or RT. However, 
              the booking system will automatically send out reminders to NSmen via 
              email or SMS. An SMS would be sent to NSmen who have not attempted the 
              IPPT 5 months prior to the qualifying window's closure; and another 
              would be sent to NSmen who have yet to pass the IPPT 3 months prior to 
              the qualifying window's closure.<br><br>Please take note that the SMS 
              will be sent based on the handphone number that has been updated in the 
              eSelf-Update module on ns.sg. Hence, please make sure that you update 
              the system whenever there is a change in your personal particulars. You 
              can change your particulars online through www.ns.sg.<br><br><strong>Q4 What happens if I attempted my IPPT but failed to achieve at least a pass standard by the end of my qualifying window?</strong><br> You will be deemed as an 'IPPT Failure'. No disciplinary action will be taken against<br> you, provided you book for Remedial Training within one month after the closure of<br> your IPPT window, and attend the Remedial Training within the remaining 3 months of<br> your birthday window.<br><br><strong>Q5 What happens if I did not attempt any IPPT (including during ICT) by the end of my qualifying window?</strong><br> You will be deemed as an 'IPPT Defaulter' if you cannot show proof of long term<br> Medical Excuse (4 months continuous or 7 months accumulativeMC within the first 9<br> months of your IPPT birthday window) that prevents you from taking your IPPT. You<br> will be disciplinary dealt with by your NS Unit. Once the disciplinary actions are taken,<br> you will be put on Remedial Training.<br><br><strong>Q6 My current qualifying
               window is ending and I have not attempted any IPPT. My unit then served
               me a SAF100 to attend non-ICT IPPT. Why?</strong><br>One month before your 
              qualifying window closes; your unit has the option to serve you a SAF100
               to attempt your IPPT. The intent is to assist you to attempt the IPPT 
              so that you would not become an 'IPPT Defaulter'. You have to either 
              attend the call-up or inform your unit of your non-attendance by showing
               proof that you have attended a non-ICT IPPT prior to the call-up date.<br><br><strong>Q7 How do I book for my non-ICT IPPT? </strong><br> A non-ICT IPPT can be booked up to 3 months in advance. You can book for a new<br> qualifying window's non-ICT IPPT when you are still in the previous year's window,<br> provided you have passed your IPPT in that window. You can book for an IPPT session<br> through the following means:<br> 
              <ul>
              <li>Online at: <a href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a></li>
              <li>By phone: 1800-eNSNSNS (or 1800 – 3676767)</li>
              <li>Download the iOS apps "MyIPPT" at Apple Apps Store</li>
              </ul>
              <br><strong>Q8 When should I start booking for non-ICT IPPT?</strong><br> You should book your IPPT immediately after your IPPT qualifying window 
              has started. Attempting your IPPT early is the best way to prevent 
              yourself from being an 'IPPT Defaulter' subsequently. There have been 
              many cases whereby NSmen defaulted on IPPT due to work or overseas 
              commitments or forgetfulness. <br><strong><br>Q9 How far ahead can I book for a non-ICT IPPT session? </strong><br>You
               can book a session up to 3 months in advance. However booking for a 
              session closes by 1200 hrs the day before the intended date of the test.
               <br><br><strong>Q10 What are the time slots available for me to book my non-ICT IPPT?</strong><br> The time slots can be viewed when you book for IPPT through www.ns.sg.<br> Alternatively, you can call 1800-eNSNSNS(1800 3676767) or Download the iOS apps<br> "MyIPPT" at Apple Apps Store to check out the details.<br><br><strong>Q11 What is the purpose of the transaction/acknowledgement code given to me after booking the non-ICT IPPT?</strong><br> For every successful booked slot, you will be issued a 
              transaction/acknowledgement code. You should retain the transaction 
              code. This code is used to verify that you have booked for an IPPT slot.
               In addition, this code is used as a proof to your employer that you are
               attempting the non-ICT IPPT.<br><br><strong>Q12 Will I be reminded when the date of the test approaches?</strong><br> You can opt-in for a free reminder service through SMS, fax or email so 
              that you can be reminded of your test date as it approaches. The 
              reminder service can be subscribed online through www.ns.sg, or by phone
               1800 eNSNSNS (1800 3676767) or Download<br> the iOS apps "MyIPPT" at Apple Apps Store. Hence it is important that 
              you update your personal particulars (including handphone number and 
              email address) in the e-self-update module on www.ns.sg to receive the 
              reminders.<br><br> <strong>Q13 Can I make amendments to my Non-ICT IPPT booking date? </strong><br>Yes.
               All amendments can be done online through www.ns.sg, by phone 1800 
              eNSNSNS (1800 3676767) or Download the iOS apps "MyIPPT" at Apple Apps 
              Store. However, all bookings, amendments and cancellations of test dates
               must be done by noon (12 p.m.) of the day before the scheduled test 
              date.<br><br><strong>Q14 Will I be punished for not turning up for a session that I have booked? </strong><br><br> By booking a non-ICT session and not turning up, you have just wasted 
              the resource and deprived your fellow NSmen to take his IPPT during that
               time slot. You are advised
              to attend the session booked or make changes to your booking if you are 
              unable to
              attend. <br><br><strong>Q15 How many times can I re-take my IPPT? </strong><br>NSmen
               are allowed unlimited attempts to qualify for the award within their 
              qualifying window. However, NSmen will not be allowed to make any more 
              attempts within his annual IPPT window at the FCC after attaining the 
              GOLD standard, regardless of the number of attempts.<p></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Q1 How will my participation in IPPT activities be counted towards my NS liabilities of 40 days a year?</strong><br>If the IPPT is initiated by your unit (e.g. during ICT), your call up is already covered within the call-up period as stated in your SAF100 served. If you book and attempt IPPT on your own at any of the FCCs or SAFRA EnergyOne Gyms (i.e. non-ICT IPPT), you will only be paid service pay (SP) and Make-Up-Pay (MUP), when applicable, for the first 3 sessions you took within the same qualifying window. Each of these non-ICT IPPT sessions is recognised as a half day call-up. Further IPPT attempts within the same qualifying window will not be counted towards your NS liabilities.<br><strong><br>Q2 How do I prove to my employer that I am attending a non-ICT IPPT since there is no SAF100 to be issued?</strong><br>With your NRIC No. and date of birth, you can log in to your NS booklet on www.ns.sg or Download the iOS apps "MyIPPT" at Apple Apps Store where your record of IPPT can be found. With this you can proof to your employer that you have indeed signed up and attended the IPPT. Alternatively, when records have not been updated, you can call 1800-eNSNSNS to clarify. Also, you will be issued an IPPT result slip at the end of the test session, which can also be used to confirm your attendance.<br><br><strong>Q3 Must I notify my unit when I take my IPPT?</strong><br>No. There is no requirement to inform your unit when you take IPPT. Your unit will be able to view your detailed results and training history through the backend systems.<br><br><strong>Q4 I was initially disrupted and now I am posted to a NS unit and I am required to take IPPT. When will my qualifying window start?</strong><br>You can start taking your IPPT from the effective date of posting to the new unit. Provisions to allow the early opening of your qualifying window ahead of your next birthday have been implemented. Any IPPT attempts, incentive awards achieved during this early opening window are considered as within the same IPPT qualifying window.<br><br><br><strong>    Q5 If I am posted to MINDEF Reserve, am I still liable for IPPT?</strong><br>NSmen who have been posted to MINDEF Reserve will receive a letter from the respective unit. Once posted to MR list, your status as active NS will cease and you are not required to take IPPT.<br><br><strong>Q6 I am a DXO, can I take IPPT with the active unit that I am working in? Will I be paid service pay/make-up pay?</strong><br>As a DXO, you can take your annual IPPT with the active unit. However, you will not be paid service/make up pay but you can qualify for monetary awards if you meet the required standards. The IPPT session taken with the active unit will not count towards the 40-day NS liability or one of the three self-initiated non-ICT IPPT sessions.<br><br><strong>Q7 I travel frequently in and out-country for overseas assignments, am I still required to take my annual IPPT?</strong><br>As long as you are still deployed in an IPPT eligible NS Unit, you are required to fulfil your annual IPPT requirement within your qualifying window. As the booking system allows for advance booking and booking via the internet, you can forecast your return from overseas and attempt the non-ICT IPPT.<br><br><strong>Q8 What happens if I need to be overseas for work commitment for more than 6 months to less than a year?</strong><br>As long as you are still deployed in an IPPT eligible NS Unit, you are required to fulfil your annual IPPT requirement within your qualifying window. However, in such an instance, you are required to apply for Exit Permit. As part of the application process,<br>it is clearly stated that you need to ensure that you do not have to fulfil any NS liabilities within the period of departure before applying for the exit permit.<br><br>Your IPPT and RT (if applicable) is one of such NS liabilities that must be fulfilled, failing which deferment must be granted prior to Exit Permit approval. You are advised to attempt your IPPT prior to your departure. If you are undergoing Remedial Training (RT), you are to seek deferment from RT, similar to seeking deferment from ICT. Hence, you will need to ensure this before you leave for work and assignment.<br><br><strong>Q9 What happens If I need to be overseas for work commitment for more than 1 year?</strong><br>You should apply for disruption from National Service. Once disrupted, you will not be required to take IPPT. However, as part of the administration to process your disruption application, your IPPT history will be checked to ensure that you do not have any outstanding IPPT/RT related offences.<br><br><strong>Q10 Upon my ORD, when can I begin taking my IPPT for the 1st year IPPT window?</strong><br>You can begin taking your IPPT upon ORD and subsequent posting to a NS unit. The IPPT that you take during the period between your ORD and your first birthday after ORD will count towards your annual IPPT liability for the 1st IPPT window. Refer to Q4, Figure 1 for a clearer idea of the policy regarding the immediate opening of the 1st IPPT window after ORD.</p></div>

              <p><span><strong>Q1 What if I am injured or medically unfit to take my non-ICT IPPT during my qualifying window? </strong><br> It is important that you seek medical treatment on your own should you be injured or is
              medically unfit. The medical certificate that your doctor issued to you is recognised as
              valid medical excuse. However, you can only be exempted from the annual IPPT if you
              have a 4 months continuous or 7 months accumulative MC within the first 9 months of
              your IPPT birthday window) You are advised to contact your NS Unit to request for a
              medical review if you have more than 3 months of medical excuse for a particular injury
              that prevents you from taking your IPPT.<br> <strong><br>Q2 What if my 4 months continuous or 7 months cumulative medical excuse
              straddle across two IPPT qualifying windows?</strong> <br> You would be dealt with as an 'IPPT Defaulter' in the 1st qualifying window. Hence it is<br> strongly encouraged that you should book your IPPT immediately after your qualifying<br> window has started. If you have more than 3 months of medical excuse for a particular<br> injury that prevents you from taking your IPPT, you are advised to contact your NS<br> Unit to request for a medical review.<br> <strong><br>Q3 Do I need to inform my NS unit as and when I am awarded medical excuse from IPPT? </strong><br> As the onus of taking IPPT is with the individual, you should be able to
               determine whether your medical excuse for your injury will last beyond 
              your current qualifying window and whether you have accumulated enough 
              medical excuse to be exempted from the IPPT. You will need to keep 
              records of all your medical excuses and submit to your NS Unit within 1 
              month of the close of your qualifying window to appeal against being 
              dealt with as an 'IPPT Defaulter'.
              <br><br> <strong>Q4 I have reached 35 years old and was informed that I need to do an "IPPT-FFI". What is an "IPPT-FFI"?</strong><br>"IPPT-FFI"
               was the term used to refer to the compulsory medical examination done 
              for all IPPT-eligible NSmen aged 35 and above. The "IPPT-FFI" has been 
              incorporated into the revised <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SAF Health Screening Programme</span> which came into effect on 30 May 2011. There is no need to do a separate
               "IPPT-FFI" if you have already completed the SAF Health Screening 
              Programme for that year.<br><br>All IPPT-eligible NSmen aged 35 years 
              and above are required to complete the SAF Health Screening Programme 
              every year before attempting IPPT. The aim of this medical screening is 
              to detect any medical conditions which may make you unsuitable for the 
              IPPT. You will not be allowed to take the IPPT if you are 35 years old 
              and above and have not completed your SAF Health Screening Programme 
              requirements for the year.<br><br>The SAF Health Screening Programme 
              review will be initiated by your NS unit administrator when your IPPT 
              window (birthday window) is open. You will be issued with a certificate 
              after completion of your SAF health Screening Programme requirements. 
              The certificate is valid until 30 day after your birthday. For example, 
              if you are 35 years old, the certificate will be valid until (and 
              including) the 30th day after your 36th birthday.<br><strong><br>Q5 Can I 
              book for non-ICT IPPT when I have not completed my SAF Health Screening 
              Programme ("IPPT-FFI") requirement (applicable for NSmen aged 35 years 
              and above)?</strong><br>As you can book a non-ICT IPPT session 3 months in 
              advance, the booking system will accept your booking even if you have 
              not completed you SAF Health Screening Programme ("IPPT-FFI") 
              requirements. However, upon detecting that you have not been issued with
               a Health Screening ("IPPT-FFI") certificate, the booking system will 
              inform you that you have to complete your FFI before the scheduled test 
              date. If you have not completed the requirements before the scheduled 
              test date, you will be barred from the test session.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Q1 What are the safety precautions that I should take note of on the day of my scheduled non-ICT IPPT session?</strong><br>You
               should make sure that you have at least 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep 
              the night before the IPPT. Also, drink as much plain water as you 
              comfortably can, preferably beyond the point of thirst, 2 hours before 
              you sleep on the night before the IPPT, and again not earlier than half 
              an hour before the test. You should avoid having a meal within one hour 
              of the test. In addition, please do not attempt the IPPT if you have a 
              valid medical certificate for the last three days before the day of the 
              test. <br><br><strong>Q2 What do I need to bring along for a non-ICT IPPT Session?</strong><br>Besides
               your PT attire, you will need to bring along your SAF 11B or your NRIC 
              to register for the IPPT session. If you are 35 years and older, you 
              have to bring along your valid FFI certificate for verification if you 
              had attended your medical screening within the past week.<br><br><strong>Q3 What time must I report for IPPT? </strong><br>You
               are to report 15 minutes before the commencement of the non-ICT IPPT 
              session as stipulated in the Booking System confirmation note. This is 
              to facilitate in-processing and completion of the exercise early so that
               all NSmen will be able to finish their IPPT sessions in a reasonable 
              time. <br><strong><br>Q4 Am I covered for injuries sustained during my non-ICT IPPT at FCCs and SAFRA EnergyOne Gyms? </strong><br>Yes.
               For every IPPT session that you attended, you will be in-processed 
              before you can take the test. Once you are in-processed, SAF provides 
              the necessary medical coverage as well as being liable for any injuries 
              as a result of taking part in these sessions. </span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Q1 How do I know that I have to attend Remedial Training?</strong> <br>If you did not attend any IPPT session or have yet to attain a pass within the first 9
              months of your birthday window, you are liable for RT. The IPPT RT Information
              System will automatically issue a system generated SMS/email to you to remind you to
              book your RT immediately. The reminder notice will be triggered when RT window
              opens, if you have yet to clear your IPPT.<br><br> <strong>Q2 Will I be reminded to book for RT? </strong> <br>Yes. if you did not attend any IPPT session or have yet to attain a 
              pass within the first 9 months of your birthday window, IRIS will 
              automatically issue a system generated SMS/email to remind you to book 
              your RT immediately and it must be completed before your birthday window
               ends. You are expected to do this booking via the NS portal.<br><br> <strong>Q3 I'm 35 years old. Am I exempted from booking for RT till I have passed my IPPT medical screening?</strong> <br>No. You will still have to book for your RT if you did not attend any IPPT session or
              have yet to attain a pass within the first 9 months of your birthday window and you
              must have a valid FFI before commencement of your RT.<br><br> <strong>Q4 My family doctor had given me 3 months medical leave effective from my birthday. Would I be excused from booking RT?</strong> <br>No. It's the responsibility of the NSman to seek deferment from his RT obligations. You
              would have to submit your medical certificate to your NS Unit. Your NS Unit will also
              advise you to book for your RT sessions immediately after your medical leave has
              expired.<br><br> <strong>What happens if I have to defer/extent my RT after attending a few RT
               sessions due to long medical leave or any other commitments whilst 
              attending RT?</strong> <br>There is no option to defer your RT as your new birthday window will start afresh every
              year upon its opening. However, you can apply for extension thru the FCC (during RT
              session and if your birthday window has not ended) or NS unit (if your birthday has
              ended). If your application for extention is approved, you will be given up to a max of
              one month so as to allow you to complete the remaining RT sessions.<br><br> <strong>Q6 I'm on permanent night shift and cannot attend the weekday sessions. Am I exempted from RT?</strong> <br>No. You should print out your RT booking confirmation slip from the 
              web-based IPPT/RT booking system and show it to your employer. Your 
              employer is required to release you for RT under the Enlistment Act. <br><br> <strong>Q7 I did not pass my IPPT during my last IPPT window. I'm on ICT just
               after my birthday. Will I be able to attempt the IPPT before completing
               my RT?</strong> <br>Yes, you will be able to take the ICT IPPT. If you manage to pass, 
              you will be released from RT and this result will be considered in your 
              current birthday window.<br><br> <strong>Q8 My ICT is in the midst of my RT sessions booked earlier. Will I be able to get
              released from my ICT during the evenings to attend my RT sessions?</strong> <br>No. ICT has priority over RT. You should NOT book RT sessions that overlaps with your ICT.<br><br><strong>Q9 Will there be Remedial Training on a day with adverse weather conditions? </strong><br>NSmen
               are required to report for Remedial Training regardless of the weather 
              conditions. Training will be conducted indoors during adverse weather 
              conditions. <br><br><strong>Q10 What is the required attendance for Remedial Training? </strong><br> The required attendance for Remedial Training is 100%. Every Remedial Training<br> session is compulsory and NSmen are advised to quickly book another RT session(s) to<br> replace missed training sessions.<br><br> <strong>Q11 What happens if I have approval of absence from Remedial Training? </strong> <br>NSmen are advised to quickly book another RT session(s) to replace 
              those training sessions missed. However, if they fail to turn-up for 
              training for 3 consecutive RT sessions that is booked earlier, the 
              remaining booked sessions will be canceled automatically and NSmen will 
              be notified of the cancellation via SMS. NSmen who are not able to 
              complete their RT obligations in the last 3 months of their birthday 
              window will be deemed as “RT defaulters” and will be called up by their 
              NS Unit/CDMB for investigation, and those without valid reasons will be 
              disciplinary dealt with. <br><br> <strong>Q12 Can I exit from the RT program earlier?</strong> <br>Yes if you pass your RT IPPT or if you are able to meet your own 
              Personal Performance Target (PPT), (for those attending 8 RT sessions 
              after completing IPT without meeting PPT). <br> <strong><br>Q13 Will the IPPT I have taken during RT be counted? And how will it be counted? </strong> <br>Yes, the IPPT taken during RT will be counted towards your current IPPT window
              requirement, regardless of whether you pass or fail. You will qualify for all incentive
              awards pegged to the result that you have achieved if the IPPT is taken within your
              birthday window. <br><br> <strong>Q14 What if I failed my IPPT during RT?</strong> <br>Three IPPT sessions would be conducted during RT ( 8th, 14th and 
              20th RT sessions). If you fail the first two RT IPPT, you will continue 
              RT till its last session. However, even if you fail all 3 RT IPPT, you 
              will be recognized as fulfilling your IPPT obligation for the current 
              IPPT window. NSmen who obtain a "Partial Failure" during RT IPPT may 
              also opt for the partial failure retest policy.</span></p>

              sentences or court martial.  In the event if the NSman is
              unable to pay the fine, the DO may order detention in default of
              payment within reasonable time based on prevailing guidelines. The
              detention may take effect on any date and shall be terminated on
