I believe that much of the criticism is levelled at the latter fact, don't think you'll accuse him of breaching security if he is not an officer rite?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I got one as I was asked to photograph events in camp. It is signed by the Unit Security Officer and CO. The LOA is supposed to be returned before leaving the unit. Camera phones are strictly not allowed as unlike normal cameras, PDAs, laptops, there is no relation to work.</div>
