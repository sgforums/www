(Dunno about his time as staff officer, which was beyond my realm.)<br><br>The whole Arty formation still hold him in awe when I was posted there in 1986, even though he'd already left for politics for quite a while. Particularly at Khatib Camp (back then not "Home of the Gunners" yet), where his influence lingered even when I returned to do reservist there.<br><br>But in context, lah. NS only began in 1968, with new combat units being formed with each new intake. The pioneering SAF scholars began with LHL in 1971 &amp;, in the next few years, also included the likes of George Yeo, Lim Hng Kiang, Teo Chee Hean, Lim Neo Chian (he lasted the longest &amp;, along with Teo, also climbed the highest as 2-star Generals) &amp; Lim Swee Say (retrospectively the "pai kia", cuz he left the SAF as only a Major, joined a stat board &amp; started growing his hair long ~lol~). They were basically commanding on the fly &amp; developing SOPs on the way &amp;, under those circumstances, I'll say they've done very well. But, again, in context cuz the 1970s still has a lot of anti-NS prejudice (the mentality changed only with Total Defense), drugs &amp; gangsterism among the conscripts, plus proficiency standards like the IPPT not being set until 1980. IMO Says a lot when the SAF could help coordinate the Cable Car rescue effort by 1983, &amp; mobilise quickly for the Hotel New World collapse during my BMT .<br><br>You know those old NS photos? Tin helmets, Temasek Green, tucked-in uniforms? That was their heyday! ~lol~ LHL must've led a M71 Battalion (12 men per gun, quite siong with a lot of manual labor); the FH88s were introduced only during my time. I don't think I can mention his tangible legacies here, except for perhaps one (since it's now obsolete). The HP-41 calculator, which gunners used to compute data through 1980s, was said to be one of his pet projects. He'd pushed for its re-programming to fit Arty purposes, based on his experienced acquired out in the field.</div>

(Dunno about his time as staff officer, which was beyond my realm.)<br><br>The whole Arty formation still hold him in awe when I was posted there in 1986, even though he'd already left for politics for quite a while. Particularly at Khatib Camp (back then not "Home of the Gunners" yet), where his influence lingered even when I returned to do reservist there.<br><br>But in context, lah. NS only began in 1968, with new combat units being formed with each new intake. The pioneering SAF scholars began with LHL in 1971 &amp;, in the next few years, also included the likes of George Yeo, Lim Hng Kiang, Teo Chee Hean, Lim Neo Chian (he lasted the longest &amp;, along with Teo, also climbed the highest as 2-star Generals) &amp; Lim Swee Say (retrospectively the "pai kia", cuz he left the SAF as only a Major, joined a stat board &amp; started growing his hair long ~lol~). They were basically commanding on the fly &amp; developing SOPs on the way &amp;, under those circumstances, I'll say they've done very well. But, again, in context cuz the 1970s still has a lot of anti-NS prejudice (the mentality changed only with Total Defense), drugs &amp; gangsterism among the conscripts, plus proficiency standards like the IPPT not being set until 1980. IMO Says a lot when the SAF could help coordinate the Cable Car rescue effort by 1983, &amp; mobilise quickly for the Hotel New World collapse during my BMT .<br><br>You know those old NS photos? Tin helmets, Temasek Green, tucked-in uniforms? That was their heyday! ~lol~ LHL must've led a M71 Battalion (12 men per gun, quite siong with a lot of manual labor); the FH88s were introduced only during my time. I don't think I can mention his tangible legacies here, except for perhaps one (since it's now obsolete). The HP-41 calculator, which gunners used to compute data through 1980s, was said to be one of his pet projects. He'd pushed for its re-programming to fit Arty purposes, based on his experienced acquired out in the field.</div></blockquote>Care to share how good a field commander LHL is?? It is hard for people to believe you based on hearsay...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah, a skeptic.<br><br>Can't directly help you since I wasn't a first-hand eyewitness. What I can say that there were enough dubious scholar-officers around in the 1980s to make the WOs yearn for the first-generation highfliers (deemed to be more personable). One of them -- who was quite famous actually; his nickname is a Hokkien play on 'nail' -- used to insist that LHL only learnt to connect with the commoner when he was a junior officer.<br><br>The SAF fast-track system is obviously still in place; all I'm saying here is the social differentiation was more acute in my time (when a A-Level cert or Poly diploma was quite respected). I mean, these guys got posted in as CPTs, sometimes already with acquired MBAs &amp; SCSC courses under their belt, clearly serving time before moving up higher. The dubiety thus becomes where so-&amp;-so will simply treat his time as a mere stepping-stone -- with the Hokien peng on the receiving end accordingly. Of the 3 Battery Commanders during my active time (each staying about 6-9 months), one was bookish, another completely snobbish, &amp; the last one super gung-ho. Projecting back from his present mannerisms &amp; communicative style, I'll say LHL was probably a cross between the first &amp; the last. The scholar-officer environ wasn't that dissimilar from my time either, since I read online that he was an Arty BN CO only in 1980 -- 9 years after getting the scholarship!<br><br>The controversy, if you want to call it that, was how fast he shot up the staff-officer ranks. The latter is a different world altogether, even in those days. He was already ("suddenly") a COL when the media spotlight shone on him during the Cable Car rescue in 1982 &amp;, more "astonishingly", made B-G a year later.</div>
