            <div class='col-md body'>Talk to your PC regarding your status. Say that MO say you will get 3 months but you did not.  Usually is because MO forgot to type it in.  If your PC is motivated enough, he should bring you to MO again and get yoru status.<br><br>As for being forced back to tekong, try to talk to your manpower officer in the unit you will be posted. He will usually defer your transfer back to tekong.<br><br>But if your mpo is not doing anything and you end up in tekong when you are not recovered...  easy....   just report sick back at tekong. Not teaching you to chao keng... but if you are hurt, you are hurt.<br><br>If you really dun feel at ease about what's going to come in future.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think we can have a better idea if we know what is your PES status or ur medical condition (if you don't want to tell, nevermind, we understand)<br><br>Here is my views<br>1.) Not true BUT there is chance that you might.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>2.) Not true. BUT let say you temp PES E for 3 mths, during this period, you post out as let say storeman, but you recover in 3 mths time, you get PES A or B again. Sorry, you come back to Tekong, do your BMT and re-vocate again you don't go back as storeman. Sorry.<br><br>3.) I believe there will be periodic medical reviews pior to any Medical Board or change of PES status.  If you have not recovered but you are given back the same PES grading, please do appropriate actions. This is your health, if you are not well, please make sure the MOs hear you. But I caution you also, if you try to keng when you already recovered and the MOs find out please be also prepared to face the consequences.<br><br>4.) If you are downgraded and ooc, just wait for your posting orders. Your PES grading already govern what you can or cannot do.<br><br>5.) As ColdMilk have said, physical size does not govern what you are posted as.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From what I know, if you are given the status 'OOT' you will be given 3 sheets of paper in the medical centre -- 1 is the status slip which is to be kept by your coy and another one is to be given to MPO informing him that you are OOT and the reasons of OOT, the last one is to be kept by the MO as a reference........<br><br>I believes that after that your PC will give you an immediate interview and he will take the 2 sheets of paper away and the one which should be given to MPO will be transfer from PC to OC to CO to MPO and now MPO should have your records and you should be on the waiting list...........<br><br>In another words, you will be posted out anytime and it's not necessary to attend medical board before posting out as medical board can be held either in before or after posting out. Don't forget that now MPO had your info already so you will be posted out anytime............... Since you are OOT, it's of no use to stay in your coyline......... Medical board and postings are 2 different matters. Since you are OOT, you will definitely be posted out.<br><br>As for PES status, you will still be posted out regardless on whether you get to downgrade your PES or not........... You might not be recovered shortly (thus will not be able to recourse within a short period) yet the MO didn't downgrade you so it's no use for you to stay in Tekong....... Might as well post you out first.......<br><br>From what I have read, you have been OOTed more than 2 weeks but haven't get a posting, maybe you can enquire your PC or call them personally to enquire about your postings.<br><br>Correct me if I have make any wrong statement.........</div>
