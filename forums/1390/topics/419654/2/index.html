              <p>RSAF will accept pilot applicants up to age 27, even if their NS was served as an enlistee. This is because the ultimate pass rate is 2.5% and they need everyone they can get. Half the male are corporals and they cannot write them off as a group.</p>
              <p>SAF doesn't consider Corporals for naval officers because it doesn't have to.</p>
              <p>Obviously the SAF is insecure about itself because it does not treat its men well. If enlisted men get promoted over their superiors, when former underlings get posted back to the same unit, it will affect the good order of the SAF.</p>

              <p>Well, as much as you were taken on a merry go round by the HR department, it doesn't mean that SAF is inefficient. I think they could have handled it better when rejecting you, shd have told u much earlier though. But does it matter to them? In their eyes, you are probably just another sign on wannabe. They have plenty others in the queue.</p>
              <p>You probably feel really disgruntled and you come here with an axe to grind, then again, your emotions are understandable. I personally feel your headlines are misleading. for every ten failures to sign on, there are two others who have succeeded I'm sure.</p>
              <p>Anyway, it is a little childish to post here and since you have done so, be prepared to be subjected to ridicule and scorn. Suck it up and move on man. Anyway, all the best for your future. There's more than a life outside SAF. Got a naval officer friend who signed on and regretted it big time, paid the bond and lost a lot of money. Who knows? Your blaze of glory is somewhere else. Cheers.</p>

              <p>yes, it's true that the SPF (Singapore Police Force) requires a recognised degree to sign on as senior police officer i.e. Inspector and above.</p>
              <p>however, even if you had been an NSPI (NS Probationary Inspector), but have only a poly diploma, you may only sign on as a police Sergeant. your NS police inspector rank is not valid if you want to sign on as a diploma holder, as it only entitles you to a rank of police sergeant.</p>

              <p>Be all you can be! Nothing wrong with wanting to serve in a foreign military. If you want to diss foreigners serving in another country's military, why don't you head down to the French Foreign Legion and tell them that? Or maybe the Gurkhas as well?</p>
              <p>I myself intend to go down that same path as you but I was only a man during NSF, so I can say that I'm really disappointed in what you've said about needing to be a commissioned officer during your 2 years service to be accepted. That said, I'll still give it a shot at signing on in the SAF.</p>
              <p>True my time as a man made me realise SAF is quite inefficient in certain aspects, but the brothers I served with has made the 2 years totally awesome. Not to mention SOME of the regulars I worked with, in particular the NCOs, have my total respect.</p>
              <p>As for the US military, they've tightened up on all fronts after 9/11(including military recruitment) on their policies about foreigners so its much harder to be able to get in. If its possible do keep me updated on your progress in getting into the military. Best of luck!!</p>

              <p>both guys mentioned are CPL during their NSF days, and u need to have A levels or Diploma in order to get the rank as an NSF man, but the qualification stays with them for life, so they can get to sign on as officers where minimum u need either an A level or diploma to get the officership.</p>

              <p>Those of us who have been in the army, know of the inefficiencies and inefficacies of this government organisation, but besides serving as banter and jokes for fellow NSmen to bond on, it has never truly been revealed to the public that behind the big posters and glorious commercials, is a sloppy and ineffective organisation that employs people based on illogical employment policies. I am very sure, that being merely a corporal in my NSF days, does not indicate that I am not suitable for a leadership position.</p>

              <p>That's why i'm telling you that Obviously the SAF is insecure about itself because it does not
                                          treat its men well. When when former underlings get posted back to the same unit and promoted over their
                                          superiors,
                                          it will affect the good order of the SAF.</p>
              <p>When I say that I mean the (relative) orderliness of the SAF. I don't mean that it is good or orderly.</p>
