              <p>For all the guys out there who have intentions of signing on with any part of Singapore's armed forces, do ensure you take the necessary precautions, otherwise you might just end up like me.</p>
              <p>P.S. This will be a long story, so beforehand I would like to thank you guys for having the patience to read it.<br> <br>This was the experience that I had with the Republic of Singapore Navy's administration/HR department recently. <br> <br>First, a little about myself. I am a 3rd year student at the Singapore Management University, currently pursuing a Bachelor in Social Science. I was thinking about signing on with the RSN as a Naval Officer after I had graduated. My plan was to start out as an officer, and do my very best to be converted to a Naval Diving officer. This was necessary because apparently, there is no other possible way to sign on with the Naval Diving Unit. With this plan in mind, I decided to contact RSN indicating my interest. <br> <br>I had originally sent an online application through their website. I can't remember the date exactly but it is likely to be around the 15th of October, 2010. There was no response from them. On the 20th of October, I made my first phone call to the RSN via their recruitment hotline at 1800-278-0000. The guy on duty picked up my call, I introduced myself, and told him my intention of joining the RSN as a Naval officer. It was then, that I was told that the people eligible for application had to have at least been through SISPEC and been a rank of Sergeant during their NSF days. Because my highest rank was only a Corporal during NSF, my case would be deemed as a 'special' case, and they would have to review my profile properly before I could carry on any further with the application.<br> <br>On the 22nd of October, I received an invitation to attend a career talk held by a captain, who was part of the Head Recruitment Officer Section. The career talk would be held on the 25th of October. I was happy to receive the email, although I was aware that it was just a career talk, and there would probably be interviews that I had to pass later on. At that time, I was also aware of the possibility that the captain might not be cognizant of the fact that I was merely a corporal in my NSF days.<br> <br>During the career talk, we were introduced to life as a Naval officer, as well as the salary and benefits that we would be entitled to if we were selected to be one of them. We were made to submit our education and other relevant certificates. We were told there would be 3 obstacles we had to pass before we were selected: a 1st interview, a medical screening, and lastly a board panel interview. After going through our documents, they would notify us if we were shortlisted for the 1st interview.  <br> <br>On the 26th of October, I was sent an email indicating that I had been shortlisted for an interview with the captain. The interview would be held on the 29th of October. Is it logical/reasonable for me to assume that I had fulfilled the basic requirements to be a Naval officer and now had to only be concerned with how well I did in my interviews? I think it is safe to think that that is the case.<br> <br>I passed the interview on the 29th, and was sent an email as well as SMSes indicating that I had to attend the board panel interview that was scheduled on the 7th of December. I knew I had no problems passing the medical screening process, and so the board panel interview was really the only thing left to prepare for. Subsequently, I was informed via SMS that the board interview had been changed to 10th of January 2011. I was instead required to go for a medical screening on the 6th of December. In the email, I was addressed as Mr Huang, when any person with a little common sense would have looked at the email add. and known that my surname was not 'Huang'. A slight confusion arose and after clarifying with them, I went for the check-up on the 6th of December. <br> <br>After the check-up, I did not receive any news from them, and I did not receive any rejection letters as well. It was safe to assume that I had met the requirements of the medical check-up because we were told if we failed at any phase, we would be sent a rejection letter, and the application process would end there and then. <br> <br>On the 5th of January 2011, 5 days before my last obstacle, I was called by the captain, who revealed that they had just found out that I did not meet the basic requirement of having at least gone to SISPEC in my NSF days, and therefore, I need not go back for the last interview. Sorry, good bye. That was the last I heard of them. <br> <br>This government organisation, had led me on a wild goose chase for more than 2 months, before letting me know that I never really had a chance from the beginning. From an employment practice perspective, it is perfectly normal for an organisation to check through the profiles of its applicants, making sure that they had at least met the most basic requirements, before the applicants were shortlisted for any interviews. By not checking my profile clearly and making me go for interviews, medical check-ups and blood checks during a span of 2 months before letting me know that I had not even met their original basic requirements,  is just downright unfair and irresponsible. My aim is not to use this as a trump card to secure a position with the Navy, because to be honest, after what they had done, it scares me to work for an organisation that cannot even take care of their administration procedures. <br> <br>Those of us who have been in the army, know of the inefficiencies and inefficacies of this government organisation, but besides serving as banter and jokes for fellow NSmen to bond on, it has never truly been revealed to the public that behind the big posters and glorious commercials, is a sloppy and ineffective organisation that employs people based on illogical employment policies. I am very sure, that being merely a corporal in my NSF days, does not indicate that I am not suitable for a leadership position. <br> <br>For all the prospective sign-ons out there, do be aware of the 'cock-ups' that are a part and parcel of the Army administration. Some of the 'cock-ups' are a mere irritation, but some can be downright devastating. Also do ask for information and clarify things with them in advance, I am glad I applied early instead of only applying after I had graduated.</p>
              <p>Another issue is this, forget about the advertisements that they put out there encouraging you to sign on as a officer. If you weren't previously commissioned as an officer during your NSF days, the SAF and RSAF will not accept your application. The RSN might accept you if you weren't an officer but you had gone through BSLC and graduated as a Sergeant. In my opinion, leadership and physical attributes can be improved or learnt along the way, it does not mean that if you weren't a leader previously that you arn't qualified to LEARN those skills. For a person to graduate and want to sign on, it can either mean one of two things: The person is unemployed and desperately needs to find a safe job with relatively high starting pay, or the person really has a desire to do the job. I fall into the latter category, and despite my determination and motivation to want to achieve something, somehow there is always going to be one of these obstacles blocking my way.</p>
              <p>You guys are free to comment, flame me etc etc, but take note that my post here is not for the purpose of garnering sympathy, but for the purpose of informing you guys, so that no one has to go down this path which I am standing on at the moment. Take care guys.</p>

              <p>Seriously, you are just being dumb for considering signing on. There are many other more useful uniform group in Singapore. Why SAF? </p>
              <p>You should be happy that you see the true face before you get into it. Else it is too late to regret. You are wasting your time on an useless organisation. You dont know how sucky is the organisation. The organisation cant do their things properly at all. </p>
              <p>The people there get so used to putting a show, but they dont have substance inside. That why, regulars cannot survive in the outside world when they ORDed. </p>

              <p>I am from SMU too. If you really want to sign on, consider getting into the US by working or doing your masters there. Once you are resident, the US Navy will take you, but not as an officer. No other requirements, maximum age 35. Sailors may get to see the RSN from about 12 floors up.</p>

              <p>I went through the same thing 7 years ago. Measured my limbs, went for talks, passed aptitude tests, passed my interview 2 months later, then told my legs weren't long enough.</p>

              <p>Hi Alize,</p>
              <p>Are you still at SMU? Maybe we can meet some day in campus?</p>
              <p>I am sorry to hear about what happened to you. And I was thinking the exact same thing the day they dropped the bomb on me: move to the US and sign on there, probably with the USMC.</p>
              <p>I still have 1 year left at SMU, so I will probably take it 1 step at a time. Take care dude.</p>

              <p>I'm thinking of getting my masters first, working there, and if I still want it, getting some good MOS.</p>
              <p>I'm sure you've read up about it right? Everyone gets a try, just show up and pass the test, as long as you don't have medical issues. Since the recruitment targets fluctuate, you'll want to be short on the US economy and not hoping for peace.</p>

              put out there encouraging you to sign on as a officer. If you
              weren't previously commissioned as an officer during your NSF days,
              the SAF and RSAF will not accept your application. The RSN might
              accept you if you weren't an officer but you had gone through BSLC
              and graduated as a Sergeant. In my opinion, leadership and physical
              attributes can be improved or learnt along the way, it does not
              mean that if you weren't a leader previously that you arn't
              qualified to LEARN those skills. For a person to graduate and want
              to sign on, it can either mean one of two things: The person is
              unemployed and desperately needs to find a safe job with relatively
              high starting pay, or the person really has a desire to do the job.
              I fall into the latter category, and despite my determination and
              motivation to want to achieve something, somehow there is always
              going to be one of these obstacles blocking my way.</p>
              <p>You guys are free to comment, flame me etc etc, but take note
              that my post here is not for the purpose of garnering sympathy, but
              for the purpose of informing you guys, so that no one has to go
              down this path which I am standing on at the moment. Take care
              guys.</p>

              <p>Are you still at SMU? Maybe we can meet some day in campus?</p>
              <p>I am sorry to hear about what happened to you. And I was
              thinking the exact same thing the day they dropped the bomb on me:
              move to the US and sign on there, probably with the USMC.</p>
              <p>I still have 1 year left at SMU, so I will probably take it 1

              <p>Sorry, didn't choose to be born here. Life is short, I encourage anyone to try their best to live their dream. Serving elsewhere might involve actually doing things like peacekeeping and civil action (and oh yes, even wars) that make the world a better place... which benefits singapore too.</p>
              <p>Obviously when considering naval careers, we are not mad about shooting people up.</p>
              <p>But if you still don't agree with me, I have this to say to you: since singlish is hard for foreign militaries to understand, maybe we will get to serve as interpreters.</p>

              <p>well, considering that you've served in the forces as a man, and that you knew about the inefficiencies and inefficacies of the service (your own words) .... still, you went ahead and tried to be a part of it with eyes wide open .......</p>
              <p>so why the criticisms now ? ..... a rant, a vent ? a bitch ? a whine ? .......... doesn't it smack of sour grapes ? ......</p>
              <p>would you still have the same opinion of the SAF if you did make it ? ..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>too bad that you're not getting all the affirmation that you seek ........</p>
              <p>but here ...... there's a tissue for you.</p>

              <p>If I had made it, my opinion would still be the same, that the armed forces is a leaky organisation with inefficient administration. But I would be there to train and learn, not to worry about the cock-ups. Cock-ups in the SAF occur every day, I am sure you have been there before. Changes in schedule, making you fall-in and wait for 1 hour before calling off the exercise, things like that. But making me go through the application process for 2 months when I did not meet the basic requirements in the first place, that's still the first I have heard of any organisation, much less a government one.</p>
              <p>To be honest, I was surprised. I knew it was bad, but I did not think the RSN could be that bad. If something like that had happened to you, would you want to share it with others? Would it be affirmation that you seek? You would probably be comforted by it, but it would not be necessary. Your aim would be to warn others about the problems in this organisation, just to make sure others do not go through the same thing that happened to you. If you can understand that, you can understand my intentions of posting here. If not, I can't help you also. You are entitled to your own opinions, yet what would you gain from putting others down?</p>

              <p><br>Dude. You already highlighted the flaws of govt sector. Enough said.</p>
              <p>It does not mean the govt sector is beyond hope, but these are weaknesses that tend to be inherent in large organisations, and there are some aggravating factors that lead to unfortunate situations like yours. And the govt is not obliged to tell you exactly why it is not interested in you. Period.</p>
              <p>You would be there to train and learn?? Hahahahahahaha....absolutely wrong. Even in RSN.</p>
