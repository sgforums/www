            <div class='col-md body'><br>To go to SISPEC, here are some possible suggestions.<br>- Do well in your SIT test and tell your SIT test<br>instructors you want to go SISPEC<br>- Pass SOC and IPPT in BMT<br>- Get along well with your fellow recruits loh, coz'<br>I think at the end of BMT got peer appraisals<br>- If in secondary school you are from uniformed group<br>then high chance of kenna Sispec.<br>- Follow instructions and try your best in BMT loh<br><br>I don't guarantee that you'll be in SISPEC after you've<br>done all that lah, coz' I'm not the one posting you wat.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>In SISPEC, a coy is run by WOSEs. There are no commissioned<br>officers in the company line. Almost all the instructors<br>are Infantry, Guards or Commando trained.<br><br>OC = Most likely a SWO who are super garang with lots<br>of badges like war hero like that. Common badges are<br>Ranger and US Pathfinder. May be an SOF too.<br><br>2IC = Same as OC but maybe a 1WO or MWO. Might be from<br>other units other than Inf/Grds/Cdo.<br><br>PC = Likely 2WO or 1WO and background are Inf/Grds/Cdo.<br><br>CSM = Maybe a SSG or MSG or 1Sgt from Inf/Grds/Cdo.<br><br>PS and Sect comds are filled in by trainees. Sect comds<br>roles will be rotated each week within a section so<br>everyone got chance become sect comds. PS is suay suay<br>kenna arrow.<br><br>When you first go to SISPEC, you will know if you are<br>in an ASLC or BSLC coy. If you are in BSLC coy, most<br>probably you'll be posted out after your BSLC course. If<br>you are in ASLC coy, most probably you'll continue ASLC<br>after you BSLC course in the same coy.<br><br>In BSLC you'll learn:<br>- Topo<br>- Handle M203, SAW, LAW, M16 with a scope and trip flares<br>- Different section/platoon movement formations<br>- Section/Platoon Fire movement, quick attacks<br>- Lotsa' IPPT and SOC training... hehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>- Do advance obstacle course and confidence course<br>- Do some basic rappelling during confidence course<br>- Learn to use night fighting equipments such as NVG, NVBs<br>and thermal sights<br>- Fast marches and route marches.<br>- Section live firing<br><br>That's about all I can recall. As for ASLC, you learn more<br>advanced stuffs such as watermanship (river crossing) and<br>heliborne ops. ASLC concentrate more on company level training. And also a 9 day outfield summary exercise in ROC.<br><br>If you finished ASLC, you can be posted as:<br>- BMTC instructors<br>- SISPEC instructors<br>- Inf/Grds rifle coy section cmdr.<br>- Inf/Grds GPMG cmdr.<br>- Inf 120mm mortar specialist (need to go SIW mortar course)<br>- Inf Spike specialist (need to go SIW Spike course)<br><br>I'm not sure about Grds support vocations coz' their support<br>coy a little different from Infantry I think.<br><br>If you got posted out after BSLC, you will end up in either:<br>- School of Armor (possible Vehicle cmdr, AI cmdr)<br>- School of Combat Engineer(Inf/Grds Pnr Spec, 30SCE, 35SCE, 36SCE, 39SCE)<br>- School of Signals (Inf/Grds Signal Spec, other signal specs vocations)<br>- School of Artillery (Arty Specialist vocations)<br>- Go to Inf/Grds Battalions or Brigades<br><br>You go to the different schools to get your 3sgt rank. After<br>that, you'll be posted out of the schools to the respective<br>units liao. I'm not too sure about what vocations other<br>school offers except for combat engr coz' I'm from there.<br><br>If you go to Inf/Grds Bn or Bde, you'll might end up as a<br>scout cmdr in the Bn's scout platoon or recce cmdr in the<br>Bde's recce company. You'll have to attend recon courses<br>at SMI. You might also go become a sniper specialist if you<br>are posted to the Bde's sniper platoon. You need to attend<br>the sniper course at SIW. All scouts, recce and snipers also<br>must attend CST (Combat Survival Training) at Hendon camp.<br><br>Okay, that's all I can write about possible SISPEC vocations.<br>Hope it helps anyone who wants to know SISPEC better.<br>Everyone are encourage to add on or correct whatever I've<br>mentioned.<br><br>WITH PRIDE WE LEAD!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BSLC:<br>Training schedules are damn tight. There're many times where u need to prepare map for topo exerices/ops order chart till the middle of the night and next morning have to wake up very early for training. Appointment holders (held by trainees) will get punished very frequently if u cant meet timing for your men (also trainees) to fall in or get ready. Never fool around with  your Platoon commanders/CSM. They've been in the SAF longer than u're on earth. Section instructors are slightly better cuz they're mostly NSF just like u.<br>Topo exercies an be fun but tiring. It usually spans the whole day where u need to find day and night check points, remedial training for those who cant meet the minimum checkpoint requirement. Remember to say some prayer to the hao xiong di if u need to go to limchukang cemetry area for your exercise. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>There are several live-firing training (not those in bmt). U are required to do fire and movement in this live-firing (ie section live-firing, the whole section will charge together and fire at the target) Sounds frightening?<br><br>ASLC:<br>U have more time and training is less intensive but more specialised.<br>u learn heli-ops, watermanship, rope-repelling, fibua (fighting in builtup area) and fofo (fighting in fortified objective - scraped), some others i cant remember. At my time i also went to commando camp for 2 days going thru the high confidence course.<br>The 9day field camp in Taiwan is one i will never forget. Not sure if trainees go to there for training anymore. There's this ninja van that sells xiang ji pa (deep fried chicken cutlet) and tian bu la. Instructors will spot check us so that we wont bring money out to the field as we are not allowed to buy food and drink.<br>(torch light battery compartment is a good place to hide your money)<br><br>On the whole sispec is the time to remember in your ns life if u're posted there.<br>After passing out from there, no matter u become an instructor yourself or go to a unit and become a combat specialist, u have much more responsibilites.<br><br>*any things i missed out? please add on.<br><br></div>

Everyone passes out from SISPEC (ASLC) as 3Sgt. But when you are one of the best trainee during the course, most probably you'll be back for the PS (platoon sgt) course in ASTW in SISPEC. After you finished that or relevant PS course in your respective combat vocation, you'll be promoted to 2Sgt. One other way is that your unit promote you loh if you are an KAH (Key Appointment Holder). Example, a 3Sgt during NSF will be promoted to 2Sgt if he became a CSM of his reservist unit.<br><br>2. The chances of making into OCS from SISPEC are quite low, if i can remember correctly, during my time in BSLC, only about 20+ people went to OCS after BSLC out of the whole batch (5 coys). The chances of going to OCS during ASLC is even lower.<br><br>3. Nothing! Unless you are the best trainee, you'll get a gold bayonet or a silver bayonet.<br><br>4. Officers do more strategic planning on a larger scale. Specialists are bascially the guy who kao peh his men and executes the orders from his superior officer in the field. So, specialists are nothing special lah, similar to a giant bullseye for people to arrow you.

            <div class='col-md body'>well i was both from SISPEC and OCS.<br>22nd BSLC and the 46/01 OCC<br>yeah for sispec the schedule there was damn pack! non stop field outings and make up sessions. gotta learn how to put on your camou quick enuff and to make lots of cylumme straw without spoiling the needle. Cylumme straw is something you make using pipe cleaners and straw and then injecting the liquid from the cylumme sticks into the straw. Mostly used for night exercise.<br>Few major exercises included Ex Gypsy 1 and 2, Ex Wanderer. Both of this is navigation (wonder if there is any new addition to this?) then Ex Nutcracker (defense ex) and the finale is Ex Grand Slam (platoon exercise). not to mention the gruelling 32km route march when passing out where you walk thru the night and have the parade in the early morning. ard 6. damm shag! for SISPEC, the first few weeks was for IPPT and SOC and the weapons lessons. for SISPEC, once you meet the minimum requirement for SOC and IPPT then tats the end of story. Then the second half was exercise, exercise and more exercise.<br><br>for OCS, when i crossed over it was ST 2 (service term 2), everything that they were teaching was taught in SISPEC already. So kinda boring. the schedule wasn't that packed. they stick closely to TSR so most of the time 1030 lights out. max is 1100. therefore its is more spread out and you wouldn't feel tat shag. fitness is always a main key for OCS so be sure to find lotsa runs and even SOC training. meeting the requirement aint the key, improving your own fitness and individual timings is. Spend 9 weeks doing crap that i already did in SISPEC was boring. after which i got posted to artillery to complete my OCS pro term loh!</div>

In order to get into OCS, i reckon that the planning part and the command and control part is impt coz thats wat officers does. to comannd and control and not ending up doin all the work himself. attitude is very impt too...cannot be too slack. peer appraisal is impt too. for bmt quite simple lah, top few percent goes OCS, then the remaining go SISPEC loh. for sispec instructors, from wat i remember from my frens who was instructors in sispec, they can recommend who they want to come back as instructors. it used to be tat they can select those tat they want to come back as instructors one, but they changed the system not long ago so they can onli recommend now. so if you wanna go back SISPEC as instructor, you can let your section instructor know but of course you must be competent in your field of knowledge as well lah.</div>

BSLC is 10 weeks, ASLC 11 weeks.<br>everyone who go to sispec after bmt will do their 10-week BSLC in one of the 7 companies there (A - G). after BSLC, only about 30% of the whole cohort will stay on in sispec for ASLC, and ASLC will be conducted by only 2 companies out of the 7 there.<br>i don't think there's a special criteria or whatever the sort that they use to choose candidates for ASLC. the saying now is that if you do your BSLC in a company which will conduct the next ASLC, then most of the people in that company will go to ASLC.<br>going to ASLC means you are confirmed as an Infantry Spec and you will only go to Guards or one of the SIR units after graduation from ASLC.<br><br>after BSLC those not selected for ASLC will be posted to support units such as armour artillery etc etc. by the way all who pass out from BSLC is only CPL rank and they will only get their 3SG either after ASLC or after they completed their support unit's course.<br>as to how to know where you might go to after BSLC all i can say is that you don't know until the last minute.<br><br>word has it that the fastest way to get 3SG after BSLC is to go to ASLC (only 11 weeks) whereas the support units courses are all longer than 11 weeks. i heard the armour's course is a whopping 21 weeks! whoa.<br><br>that's about it. further info abt sispec can ask me la. like the training or whatever i can tell u what i know.<br><br>cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
