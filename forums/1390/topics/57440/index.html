Their rapid deployment is by helicopter. Thus, an important part of their training has to do with helicopters. This entails not only rapid disembarkation techniques but also rappelling, coming down from the chopper via long ropes; a nice landing area may not always be available, and Guards units may have to rappel straight into battle zones, or onto rooftops.<br><br>The Guards have to master many kinds of rappelling from cliffs and buildings. In one method, they come down a cliff head-downwards. In case they are wounded in a leg and cannot use their legs to brace themselves against the cliff face, they also learn to come down with their backs facing the cliff, and also in a stretcher*. All this business of jumping off cliffs may sound scary but the Guards are apparently so used to it that it is like child's play to them.<br><br><img src="http://www.specialoperations.com/Foreign/Singapore/Guards/Training/rappel01.jpg"><img src="http://www.specialoperations.com/Foreign/Singapore/Guards/Training/rappel02.jpg"><img src="http://www.specialoperations.com/Foreign/Singapore/Guards/Training/rappel03.jpg"></div>

The objective of the training is to project combat power across a water obstacle quickly while ensuring the integrity of the crossing force and maintaining the momentum of crossing.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><strong>FIBUA</strong></span><br>The progress of modernisation has created an ever increasing number of population centres in the form of small and large towns and cities not only in the region around us but also the rest of the world. As more and more swamps and forests are cleared, the pace of urbanisation has gained rapid momentum. Built-up areas are beginning to envelope more and more areas. This development implies that urban warfare is becoming an increasingly more important aspect of military operations. Troops will encounter more built-up areas (BUA) along their axes of advance than ever before. When transformed into defensive positions or strong points, built-up areas will significantly hinder the progress of offensive operations and restrict oppurtunities for manoeuvre.<br><br>Historically, military strategies and tactics have always advocated that urban centres should be isolated or bypassed rather than risking costly lives, resources and time-consuming operations in BUA. However, in the present day context, fighting in BUA is unavoidable due to the nature of urban development.<br><img src="http://www.specialoperations.com/Foreign/Singapore/Guards/Training/fibua01.jpg"><img src="http://www.specialoperations.com/Foreign/Singapore/Guards/Training/fibua02.jpg"><br><br>I LOVE FIBUA FIGHTING <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
