              <p>Your PC is making empty threats from his ass.</p>
              <p>1. Firsty Stoppage-of-Leave is a sentence, not a charge. The charge is malingering. To prove it, your PC must find a few MO to overturn the professional judgment of the recruit's doctor. Which PC or MO will be willing to do that?</p>
              <p>Most MO are NSF who are fresh out of medical school and have and are serving as MO. They serve their NS later. They will be joining the medical profession after NS.</p>
              <p>2. Secondly what if there really is something wrong with the recruit's health and he dies? PC willing, but any MO willing?</p>
              <p>3. SOL, also known as open arrest, means being unable to leave camp for the duration of the sentence. You are simply limited to company line area doing your normal duties (except guard duty). Not locked up or anything. If you are stay out personnel it matters. If you are stay in, so what? As good as no punishment.</p>
              <p>SOL applies during your normal working days, not during your leave. Your PC cannot apply leave for you then forfeit it during your SOL sentence.</p>
              <p>4. SOL does not extend your ORD date or show up on ORD certificate of service.</p>
              <p>5. Just don't be like stupid people who fail to endorse their outside MC or worse, phone up and say they have MC but actually don't have MC then next day come back kena charge.</p>
              <p>6. Having confinees in camp during the block leave period means one instructor must stay there and account for their safety, whereabouts, rations etc. Cannot go for leave, off or "good performance off". And normally the course period is quite siong for them, very hard to take off.</p>
              <p>Tell your PC to fuck himself.</p>

              <p>Thank you for your replies.</p>
              <p>So double confirmed.</p>
              <p>Got MC, certified by a medical doctor with a medical doctor licence.</p>
              <p>Platoon Commander (Officer) cannot anyhow charge us since he is non-medical trained without any professional medical doctor licence.</p>
              <p>I see, so the only thing the officer can do is to make sure you really stay at home by calling you on your mobile phone or surprise checks via house visits...</p>

              <p>I used to be a medic saf, just ord last year haha.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ya. Officers cannot charge people if they take MC because according to SAF regulations, every NSF is entitled to 365 days of MC per year. However, your Officer can call you back to endorse MC if it is more than 3 days.</p>
              <p>In army, just follow the rules and suck thumb because if your officers want to tekan you, they are able to find some cock reason to do so since so many offences are chargeable.</p>
