            <div class='col-md body'>CSMs and RSMs are scary creatures in training courses.   However, in unit, I had the fortunes of having very nice-guys BSM and RSM.   The RSM was like the father figure in our battalion.   Sometimes, I think that he was bullied by the CO simply because he is good towards the men.   He was almost charged when something went wrong during a 155 life firing (he was acting safety officer).<br><br>When I was acting-BSM, I realised that I do not have to be as nasty as when I was a detachment commander (more than 80 percent of my men were gangster-like Hokkien peng) - I could relax a little having other NCOs doing the dirty work <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I must admit there is this myth around RSMs, which encourages other ranks to fear them. But they can be human too. Also, life is such that it is a small world and things can turn out strange. Let me tell you my story...<br><br>I was a NSF platoon sergeant. As PS, you get to do BOS duty in camp. During one of the duty days, I was reported by the  Camp DO for something (can't remember what). Instead of taking action against me, he decided to inform the RSM to deal with me, which I guess is a smart thing, since all the other ranks fear the RSM more than a regular captain (sometimes !).<br><br>So I was asked to see the RSM the day after the duty day. It was the first time face to face with him, and he had the stern kind of no-nonsense look.  Anyway, cut a long story short, I was given 3 extra BOS duties  ! Which I took gladly, in order to be out of his office, and escape his stare and his scolding, as I was a rather green 19 year old PS !!!<br><br>Story does not end here.... I  finished my NS and went off overseas to study. Got my degree and got a job. First day at work , I passed the security guard at our company's main gate. Guess who was the company security supervisor??? !  It was my RSM !<br><br>Anyway, cut another long story short, we became quite good lunch friends. I did remind him during a chit-chat session, that he gave me 3 extras before, but he conveniently forgot who I was !  In recent years, when I bump into him (I am not at the same site anymore), I noticed he had started to address me as "sir " !  Strange, but I guess it is because I have reached the senior mgmt. ranks of the company.<br><br>SMALL WORLD !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yah, they are human, so they are prone to PMS too.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway, those from Jurong Camp will only fear one RSM, the Div RSM, super strict..he doesnt let off anyone below Captain rank, not even unit RSMs..but of course those who actually noe him or kena from him noe that he will have good reason for everything he does..<br><br>To add on, when i enter my unit ,there is this pretty good Malay RSM, very strict, very rigid, his uniform much smarter than other unit RSMS, kinda gave him lots of respect because he is fair too, he can scold like hell but still dont give a single punishment if the offence is small..<br><br>When I am about to ORD, they actually let in this joker for the RSM job, he is worse than the old one..but for wrong reasons. Whether your day is good with him or not depend on his mood..and your rank. Super childish too I must add, sometimes he proved the phrase "age does not come with maturity"..very sloppy with his work and sometimes look..kena from Div RSM coz of long hair!!!!<br><br></div>
