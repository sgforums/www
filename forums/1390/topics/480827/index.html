              <p><strong>National 
                      Service stints may be shortened by a few weeks </strong>from the current two 
                      years, under a plan by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) to hire more 
                      career soldiers to make NS training more effective.</p>
              <p>Young men due to be enlisted may also face a shorter wait of four to 
                      five months, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen during the debate on his 
                      ministry's Budget on Thursday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span class="content-area-content"><span class="story_body"> </span></span></p>
              <p>Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen 
                      said on Thursday that having more experienced professional career 
                      soldiers in units and training schools to teach the fledgling soldiers 
                      will make NS training more effective and efficient. Having more seasoned
                       hands will also result in "greater impact on training outcomes, 
                      inculcating discipline and transmitting values", he said in Parliament 
                      during the debate on his ministry's budget.</p>
              <p>Even with the 
                      potential time savings, Dr Ng cautioned that his ministry "makes no 
                      promises" as the army will study the details to ensure that Singapore 
                      can continue to generate operationally ready units.</p>
              <p><strong>Dr Ng added 
                      that the ramped-up recruitment will not cut the number of in-camp 
                      trainings that Operationally-Ready National Servicemen (NSmen) have to 
                      fulfill. Currently, they are called up annually for 10 years.</strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do you know? </span><br><br><em>Once upon a time, NS was as long as three years.</em></strong></p>
              <p>When NS started in 1967, officers served 36 months and the other ranks had to complete 30 months of training.</p>

              <p>Training for full-time National 
              Servicemen (NSFs) could be shortened by a few weeks when more 
              professional trainers are employed by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).</p>
              <p>Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said this in Parliament during the ministry's Budget debate on Thursday.</p>
              <p>As many as 1,100 more full-time trainers could be recruited.</p>
              <p>Only one in six trainers is a professional regular at the Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC).</p>
              <p>The SAF wants to increase the ratio to one in three.</p>
              <p>Dr
               Ng said having professional trainers will have greater impact on 
              training outcomes, inculcating discipline and transmitting values.</p>
              <p>He
               elaborated: "In the present system, some time is required for the 
              second year NSF trainers to adapt themselves to the training environment
               in their units and training schools. Having regular trainers will 
              smoothen this transition.</p>
              <p>“But here again let me quell 
              unrealistic expectations. The time savings will be a few weeks at most, 
              if any. MINDEF makes no promises as the army has to study many details 
              to ensure that we can continue to generate operationally ready units."</p>
              <p>Even
               though training duration can be shortened, Dr Ng said this will not 
              reduce the number of In-Camp Training (ICT) that Operationally-Ready 
              National Servicemen (NSmen) have to perform.</p>
              <p>ICTs were reduced
               from 13 to 10 in 2006. The 10 ICTs will still be needed to meet 
              Singapore's defence needs, even with falling birth rates, until 2040.</p>
              <p>The call to improve the training system arose from the Committee to Strengthen National Service (CSNS) discussions.</p>
              <p>The waiting time before enlistment can also be reduced.</p>
              <p>Dr
               Ng has asked the SAF to develop a system where it can commit to enlist 
              all enlistees, except for some exceptions, within a fixed time frame of 
              four to five months.</p>
              <p>The army expects to complete its detailed studies on the issues raised by the CSNS in the second half of this year.</p>
              <p>Another
               suggestion from the CSNS is for the creation of a new volunteer corp, 
              and the Defence Ministry is working on the proposal.</p>
              <p>This will
               allow the broader community -- in particular women, new citizens and 
              first generation permanent residents -- to better understand and 
              contribute to Singapore's defence.</p>
              <p>The proposed SAF Volunteer 
              Corps should harness the different skills of the volunteers to 
              complement Singapore’s defence capabilities.<br><br>Volunteers with 
              expertise in specific areas, such as healthcare, psychology and 
              communications, could be given opportunities to serve in their 
              respective specialist areas.</p>
              <p>Those who wish to serve in other military functions could be trained as necessary for these operations.</p>
              <p>Second
               Defence Minister Chan Chun Sing said: "MINDEF will look into developing
               basic modules to impart relevant basic military skills and values to 
              all volunteers. Specific training will then be conducted according to 
              operational needs.</p>
              <p>"In order for meaningful contributions to 
              be made, volunteers could commit to performing various operational 
              duties for a certain period of time."</p>
              <p>MINDEF will also want to
               strengthen its qualification system for employers to better appreciate 
              the skills and leadership qualities of Singapore’s NSmen.</p>
              <p>This will not only help NSmen in the job market, but also provide meaningful recognition for their efforts during NS.</p>
              <p>Members of the House were also given an update on the Safety and Systems Review Directorate formed last year.</p>
              <p>It
               has found the SAF safety system to be robust. Useful recommendations 
              were also made -- for example, paying more attention to recruits' 
              psychological well-being on top of physical safety. </p>

              <p>The Ministry of Defence (Mindef) will continue its approach of steady defence spending over the long term.</p>
              <p>This strategy has reaped significant benefits for Singapore's defence capabilities, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen.<br><br>He was speaking in Parliament during the debate on his ministry's budget on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Singapore's defence budget has roughly kept pace with inflation, growing from $8.6 billion in 2004 to $12.2 billion in 2013.</p>
              <p>Dr Ng said sharp spikes in spending will be avoided unless required by security risks.</p>
              <p>It will also avoid sharp drops that will undermine Singapore's defence capabilities over the medium term.</p>
              <p>Dr Ng also gave an illustration of how the SAF will be like in the future.</p>
              <p>In 2030, SAF will be a highly networked force, he said.</p>
              <p>This
               means that whether it's the fighter pilot in the air, the sailor at sea
               or the soldier on land, each will be able to see the big picture.</p>
              <p>And beyond that, they will also be able to speak to each other to jointly target threats and orchestrate responses.</p>
              <p>Dr
               Ng said: "These capabilities of the SAF, if achieved by 2030, should 
              provide Singaporeans the confidence that Singapore can be protected. I 
              say confidence, not certainty. The future is always unpredictable."</p>

              <p>The Defence Ministry is working on the 
              proposal for a new volunteer corps, which surfaced during discussions by
               the Committee to Strengthen National Service (CSNS).</p>
              <p>This will 
              allow the broader community -- in particular women, new citizens and 
              first-generation permanent residents -- to better understand and

              <p>Second Minister for Defence Chan Chun Sing said this during his ministry's Committee of Supply debate in Parliament on Thursday.</p>
              <p>He
               told members of the House that the proposed Singapore Armed Forces 
              Volunteer Corps should harness the different skills of the volunteers to
               complement the Republic's defence capabilities.</p>
              <p>Volunteers 
              with expertise in specific areas -- like healthcare, psychology and 
              communications -- could be given opportunities to serve in their 
              respective specialist areas.</p>
              <p>Others who wish to serve in other military functions could be trained as necessary.</p>
              <p>Mr
               Chan said MINDEF will look into developing basic modules to impart 
              relevant basic military skills and values to all volunteers.</p>
              <p>Specific training will then be conducted according to needs.</p>
              <p>In
               order for meaningful contributions to be made, volunteers could commit 
              to performing various operational duties for a certain period of time.</p>
              <p>Mr Chan also touched on safety in his speech.</p>
              <p>Last
               year, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen announced the formation of the Safety
               and Systems Review Directorate to conduct safety and systemic reviews 
              on MINDEF and SAF.</p>
              <p>Mr Chan said the panel has since reviewed 
              the safety practices at the Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC), 
              Officer Cadet School (OCS) and Specialist Cadet School (SCS).</p>
              <p>It has found the SAF safety system to be robust.</p>
              <p>In addition, it has also made useful recommendations to help check blind spots.</p>
              <p>For
               example, the panel recommended that as much attention be paid to 
              recruits' psychological well-being as their physical safety.</p>
              <p>It will continue to review the safety systems and practices of more units.</p>
              <p>The Defence Ministry has also commenced the deployment of Unit Safety Officers in every unit.</p>
              <p>Mr
               Chan said as ex-regulars with experience, they will help strengthen the
               system by imparting their knowledge and experiences to new and junior 
              commanders.</p>
              <p>They will complement the "external pair of eyes" from the inspectors beyond the unit. </p>
