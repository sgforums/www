              <p>what does this mean? maybe you can clarify as i could not understand your 'level' of english ie what you meant to say in the NDP thing. It is quite unintelligible.</p>
              <p>You need to back up the selection process bit. it's a fine and the same set of barometers the powers that be work with for almost 40 yrs and is applied to not only the SAF but throughout the whole civil service.</p>
              <p>Whoever's in charge of the 'buses', hahahaha in the NDP is not the chairman. Maybe you want to blame the useless people under him who somehow get promoted because of leaks - somehow if you stay long enough in any place, you get bumped up by default though at a lower rate than talented people. This is as prevalent in the private sector as it is in the public sector and is a fact of the world. The CEP system prevents such people from wreaking damage beyond their core incompetencies, while factoring the default ascension they get, acting as an effective ceiling ie shit plug.</p>
              <p>It takes an irredeemably naive person to attribute the 'buses' at one NDP, I really can't think of anything more banal, to a larger system so complex and beyond his imaginable payscale and talk about its 'selection criteria'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
