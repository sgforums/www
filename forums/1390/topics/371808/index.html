            <div class='col-md body'><p><span>SINGAPORE: It is ever more critical for the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) to have leaders of the highest quality. Hence, it must continue to attract the best young talent who can think ahead and implement bold plans to bring the SAF to the next level. <br><br>Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean said this when he presented this year's SAF Overseas Scholarships to six young men on Tuesday. <br><br>Mr Teo, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said: "SAF scholars are challenged with a fast-paced career with the SAF. They will be sent to premier civilian as well as military institutions of education to mature and sharpen their minds. Success is not assured. Hard work, dedication and commitment are required. But the satisfaction are many. <br><br>"Confidence in the SAF rests on it having the best leadership, so that the SAF will be well-led, well-trained, equipped with modern and superior equipment, ready to respond to all contingencies. <br><br>"Every able-bodied Singaporean male is enlisted for National Service. Ultimately, should the SAF ever be called to battle, Singaporeans want to know that the commanders leading our servicemen are the most capable and committed, and will lead our men to victory in battle. There are no second chances." <br><br>Mr Teo said previous SAF scholars have helped build up the organisation and new challenges await a new generation of leaders. <br><br>He said: "In an ever more interconnected world, the spectrum of threats we face will be wider and even more complex, going beyond the conventional threats to include terrorism, piracy, natural disasters, pandemics and others that we have not yet foreseen. <br><br>"Instability in one part of the world has far-reaching consequences in other regions. Technology for ever more deadly weapons will become available to both state and non-state actors. <br><br>"These could threaten us from beyond the horizon, or assist a lone suicide bomber to evade detection. The SAF leadership of the future must be ready to face this wider and more complex spectrum of threats." <br><br>When the SAF scholars return from their studies, heavy responsibilities await them. <br><br>SAF Overseas Scholarship recipient Stanley Lim Kah Liang said: "Health is very important in the army and we don't want any non-operational incidents. So I will try and improve on the health standards and measures already in place, so that we ensure that our men train hard and train safe." <br><br>Chua Sheng Ho, another SAF Overseas Scholarship recipient, said: "Training my men well, training them to be leaders themselves, and train them to be more flexible in their decision-making process so they can be more able to make good decisions when the situation calls for it." <br><br>Mr Teo said SAF scholars not only serve in the Ministry of Defence and the SAF, they are also seconded to other ministries and government agencies. Six of them have so far entered politics and become ministers. <br><br>But for Nicholas Tay Weizhe, an SAF Overseas Scholarship recipient this year, he said: "For me, I don't think politics is on the top of my mind at this point of time. I am not going to rule it out, of course. For me, I am more attracted to the civil service." <br><br>The SAF Overseas Scholarships have been awarded to 269 servicemen since its inception in 1971. <br><br>- CNA/ir <br></span></p></div>

              <p>Make no mistakes, SAFOS are a special breed of Singaporeans, the cream of the crop. Many aspires to it, but each year, only a few make that grade.</p>
