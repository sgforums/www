              <p>Good afternoon all,</p>
              <p>I posted not long ago regarding about this issue and was met with postive remarks.</p>
              <p>Ok, my situation right now.</p>
              <p>I got testimonials from officers including LTC and awaiting another LTC testimonial.</p>
              <p>I went to the recuitment drive at Taka recently however got rejected when I told them I am a 3SG Nsf planning to sign on as officer in SAF. The person told me to find my S1.</p>
              <p>Thankfully, a LTC from my camp help me to recommend for OCS to DYS1. The manpower branch help me alot by arranging a interview with my camp S1, Head manpower.</p>
              <p>And I pass the interview, in which I will be going for an OCS panel interview.</p>
              <p>however i was told that I have to extend my service by 2 more years so that I have time fame to train in OCS.</p>
              <p>I was wondering, if anyone out there would know.</p>
              <p>1) If I have to extend my service, must I extend before the interview with the OCS panel or after the interview, in which one week later I will get to know my fate. I only got about 5 months plus to ORD as a spec.</p>
              <p>2) Does Ippt plays a very big part in getting into OCS? As in, I got a sliver in Ippt durig my first year, however my 2nd year Ippt i got a incentive. In which i am training very hard to get a sliver again or a gold.</p>
              <p>3) Does my Boss, a LTC has the power to reject my appilcation? I got recommended by another LTC. I fear my boss will not let me go for OCS.</p>
              <p>4) Understand that degree is very important. I am planning to take part time degree after I commissioned. Is University of london and University of Bermingham a notable degree in SAF. Both degree can be studied at UNI SIM.</p>
              <p>5) If lets say my boss disapprove, is there any resource/ ways  I can look up to? Example, finding Head manpower again, ask CGO for help etc. I would definitely want to go by the systems, CGO would be my last option.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes your boss has alot of say in the matter and pestering him about it is a no-no.  Just keep a low profile, have confidence in yourself and do what you're supposed to do.  Chances are, if you look like officer material you will get in.  Getting gold for ippt helps but its not essential.</div>

              <p>actually Peace 87, if i recall correctly while surfing the OA intranet the other day, i chanced upon this article whereby CDF signed a memorendum of understanding with UniSIM for certain courses. it allows SAF regulars to further their studies. you might want to follow up on that.</p>
              <p>and having a degree would definitely help you pay-wise. also, it'd be a good fall back plan should you decide to leave the service.</p>
              <p>my encik was complaining to me not too long ago how his juniors were being promoted above him due to education. it would be good to further your studies.</p>

              <p>Hi Peace 87. I had ORD-ed and I served my time as the DyS1 of a bn. It is good that you have the passion to sign on as an officer.</p>
              <p>1)Since you have 5 month plus to ORD, I think it is not an issue. It actually depends when OCS panel can interview u. If you approaching ORD date and no news yet, go and bug your S1 branch.</p>
              <p>2) I shall answer your point number 3 first. I think you really need to talk to your Commanding Officer. Your S1 is a PSO level and he or she will usually discuss manpower issue with your CO. If your OC supports you and he thinks that you have the calibre, your S1 and OC actually can convince your CO to push you to OCS and for regular service. I dont really understand why u seek help from another LTC. If can, try to talk to him to convince your CO. Once your CO highly recommends you, I dun see y u cant. I actually know 1 LTC and 1 MAJ who converted to OCS from SSG and 1SG respectively. Your CO press green button, you sure go.</p>
              <p>3) IPPT is not an issue.  Let the physical part take care by OCS. of course, if you get gold, it will be a plus point which they will consider. Usually a requirement for OCS is IPPT pass. The only worrying part is that you will need to cope with other cadets in terms of physical training.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) degree is important but from the way i see it, I dun understand why ppl are studying for 1st class honors and stuff like that. Yes, your pay will be higher if u grad with honors but I keep reminding my friend who signed on that he is only a LSA holder. There are hundreds of officers out there who sign on and take on the LSA. They will only consider scholars (SMS to SAFWOS) for future command tour. If you are just a normal degree, be prepared to take on more office bound tours. CO appointment is usually out of the picture. If u have the heart to serve and u believe in what you are doing, you will do well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) Understand that degree is very important. I am planning to
                                      take part time degree after I commissioned. Is University of london
                                      and University of Bermingham a notable degree in SAF. Both
                                      degree can be studied at UNI SIM.</p>
              <p>5) If your boss disapprove, the best person to go to is still S1. Have you try looking for your RSM? Your CO should unlikely to disapprove since its always hard to find a person who has the heart to serve and convert to regular unless you really incompetent and your CO feels that u make a better spec than officer. You may want to send a email to CPC or AOMC. AOMC is the Army Officer Managment Center. You can also consider signing on from website or CMPB coz they sure to arrange you for interview. Ideally, the best is to go through your CO. With a LTC backing you up, your chance is high.</p>
              <p>Things will be different if you get it. First, expect a tough training compare to SISPEC training. OCS really emphasize alot on discipline and regimentation. Expect yourself to kena alot of appointments in admin or outfield coz you will be a regular by then. OCS also emphasize alot on morale values and integrity. I know some ppl thinks officer training are crap coz their officers in command probably sucks. I as an officers thinks it a shameful thing when a wrong officer is being commissioned. Just do your best and I wish you all of luck.</p>
              <p>5) If lets say my boss disapprove, is there any resource/ ways
                                       I can look up to? Example, finding Head manpower again, ask
                                      CGO for help etc. I would definitely want to go by the systems, CGO
                                      would be my last option.</p>

              <p>Peace 87,</p>
              <p>my advice to you is "Do not to sign on as a Specialist as I reckon you have inspiration and desire to be an Officer". The career path for an Officer and Specialist is a whole world of difference. ROE, development, incentives, remuneratiion package, welfare etc for Specialist and Officer are of great difference. This advice applies even if you are not successful in your OCS conversion course.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From my personal perspective, I do not think SAF "recognises" degree as long as it is a part-time degree. Nonetheless, your highest qualifications attainment will be updated in your personal profile upon completion and submission of your Certificate to your Human Captial Divison.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Apply for the SAF local scholarship using your diploma or A levels result.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Speak to your immediate Superior about your desire and inspiration as good testimonial and blessings are highly beneficial and critical. CPC will also evaluate your suitability based on your immediate Superior's recommendation (ie. Br or Dept Hd).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>
