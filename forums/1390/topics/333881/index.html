              <p>and NS does not turn a boy into a man either.</p>
              <p>most SG boys are ok until they go to NS where they learn back-stabbing and gossiping.</p>
              <p>if anything, i would encourage more people to marry foreigners and encourage these foreigners to settle elsewhere and don't do NS.</p>
              <p>if they choose to settle here and let their sons do NS, then they should not cry when war comes, because SAF will mobilize every fit man in SG  and we'll be forced to go to war. Against our will.</p>

              <p>I agree with the "me me me" comment. Too many people are just so concerned about their own well being that its like committing sucide slowly. One day, when we learn our lessons, it will be too late.</p>
              <p>I remember that my first lesson during BMT was all about WHY we are there, going thru the BMT.  The first question is whether you want to see your mother, wife, sisters or daughters being raped in front of you by the enemies while you watch on helplessly.</p>
