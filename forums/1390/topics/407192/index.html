              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>does anyone know whether I will be able to get into OCS with a conviction. I have heard that with a conviction on record, the chances of getting into OCS is significantly dimished. The conviction is not having an exit permit, so it is a very minor conviction. Apart from that, my record is entirely clean.</p>
              <p>However, I have a degree in law and I train and go to the gym often. Please advice.</p>

              <p>It sounds like you have a personal grude against OCS whom you have refered to as the "dirty dozen".</p>
              <p>Look buddy, I did not write this post to piss anyone off. Apart from me, more than half of recruits aim for OCS so is it wrong to aim for OCS?</p>
              <p>And FYI, the sorry to be ambigious about the degree "in law". To be specific I have a LLB(Hons) hows that? Specific enough?</p>

              <p>Apologies if I misinterpreted your comment Arpra. To be honest, I have not seen that movie so, forgive me.</p>
              <p>I understand this is a very controversial debate. I have heard many people say you should have come back to serve before doing your degree. But at the same time, others express that I should finish my degree before comming back to serve. My parents surpported the latter idea and I thought it made sense.</p>
              <p>I entered uni at 17 before I had to serve and I was in my second year of studies when I was called up. If I returned, I would have to put all these on hold, drop (hons) as that component can be postponed for only a year and put my place in 3rd year law at risk.</p>
              <p>So tell me, what would you do if you were in my position? It is not an easy decision to make. Bearing in mind that Singapore has a culture where academic pursuits are placed above all else. It would hence seem hypocritical for anyone to say that an average Singaporean in my position to put his studies on hold to return to serve NS.</p>
              <p>I just feel dismayed by the fact that Singapore is penalising its citizens from seeking a better education elsewhere, despite the fact that they do this with the full intention of returning to serve NS. And yes, I know some people will say "apply for deferment la!" but since 2005 the system was tightened up so as to make deferments practically impossible to get unless you are president scholar. To make matters worse, this conviction will stick with me when I apply for jobs ....</p>
              <p>So can anyone provide a straightforward answer? ... No</p>
              <p>As for why I want to get into OCS, I am aware that the motive for some, is to make their parents pround, cos their friends are in OCS etc. As for me I want to get into OCS not for the sake of others but so that I can improve myself. I was thinking, if I had to serve, I must as well make the best out of it and try to get into command school. I want to learn other skills such as leadership which are taught in OCS. In addition, I am contemplating signing on as a regular depending on how it goes. So hope this helps</p>

              <p>Well.....you just have to hope for the best that you get selected.</p>
              <p>Basically You made an informed decision not to return for NS. That was it. </p>
              <p>My personel view (which is in no way a reflection of your capabilities) is that the decision was not well thoughtout. Why....you choosen a field that required you to be spotless depending on your career path. (n you are thinking of going Prof military with a "spot"....!!!)</p>
              <p>In some way the act of giving up to serve NS is a personal sacrifics and believe me it happen to alot of overseas Singaporean....It reflects on character.</p>
              <p>Sometime "Maybe" and is a big Maybe that you were just too young to made that decision. So ironically for "You" maybe serving NS first will helps to sharpen your senses and maturity before entering University.</p>
              <p>I would suggest you talked to relevant profession for alternative view on your career goals and get a perspective. Sometime career achievement comes differently so be open minded.</p>
              <p>I would still suggest you to watch the classic Dirty Dozen and look at the symbolism behind the movie characters.</p>

              <p>I think if you really want to sign on, you might as well make your intention known earlier. That way the recruitment officer can tell you what your chances are. Although they are known to stretch the truth to get you to submit an application. Maybe they have a quota to fill.</p>
              <p>But during the interview and such when you meet other officers, you can ask them about it. It'd be easier for them to look past your conviction if you want to sign on.</p>

              <p>officers are not supposed to come with a conviction.this aint some kinda rebel army from star wars ya gonna join into.joinin into the SAF is like joining the dark side of the imperial stormtrooper forces as in star wars movie.ya either need to be some kinda jedi knight and have connections with the emperor palpatine himself or be some kinda clone.and clones dont have bad records in the forces.</p>
              <p>chances of u ever being someone in SAF is low.they will check all yer papers...dun matter if u intend tobe a commando or stormtrooper with a one way ticket to hell.u have a conviction with the imperial forces......u havent much chance un lessthe emperor there has uses for u.which i doubt it as yer law degree dun count for much in spore.they have criminals who have gone to gyms in spore but i doubt that counts much for the emperor.</p>
              <p>no pun intended but making some similarities with the SAF and star wars is the only way u could see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>u may try to join the armed forces of the country where u got yer degree law from.it makes more sense.</p>

              <p>from past experiences in ns back in 1990s,those that screwed up a bit in basic military trainings from having a misfire at range were thrown out of SAF officer jobs even b4 they had the chance to sign anything for the job.these folks didnt have any convictions on record but they were harshly discplined in camp.</p>
              <p>its 20 years ,,,,perhaps the military has changed.its the rules u need to abide to.....and how many degree holders are applying for yer job u badly want.and also most or all have no criminal convictions or anything.perhaps its fated u never should go into that side from looks of it.well apply anyway and see if u get the second interview.</p>
