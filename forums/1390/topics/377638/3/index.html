              <p>A lot of you are very ignorant ppl here. If you say that
              PRs enjoy better benefits than citizens, then I am telling you F**k
              you! There is a reason why some PRs want to be citizens.</p>
              <p>A lot here say that PRs dont need to serve NS = BULLSHIT! Abt
              10% of my BMT platoon were PRs!</p>
              <p>btw, PR stands for PERMANENT Resident. And I do not see the
              reason why PERMANENT residents should not be allowed to buy HDBs
              since they are permanent. And even in buying HDBs, they also have
              less benefits such as buying only resale, no HDB loan only bank
              loan etc. And for a lot of PRs the reason to become permanent
              resident was because the want to live here but cannot afford
              private property (which btw can be bought by any foreigner). So
              thru become PR is the only way to own a home.</p>
              <p>As for everyone here, we should not forget that our parents,
              grand parents or/and great grand parents were immigrants one
              day too</p>
              </div>

              <p>first generation or second generation PR? there is a difference.</p>
              <p>those
              boys you see in the army are all second generation.  they are doing it
              so that they have an option to be a citizen and it is up to them if
              they want to take it up when they complete NS.</p>
              <p>i still stand by my perspective that PRs shouldn't be allowed to BUY a flat. (i don't give a shit what loans they get).</p>
              <p>like you said, they are permanent residents, they are NOT
              citizens. if they did their NS and choose to get the pink IC, go right
              ahead and get your HDB flat because they are now : citizens</p>
              <p>if they can't afford to live here, then why come here?</p>

              <p>1. Anybody who wish to express their opinions on any issue
                                      except religious speeches, and speeches that would cause feelings
                                      of enmity, hatred, ill-will or hostility between different racial
                                      or religious groups, could simply type in their views.<br> <br> However any topics related to those stated above will be closed in
                                      24 hours and repeated offenders will be put into consideration for
                                      banning.<br> <br> Reason why this is done so:<br> Singapore is a small, compact, multi-racial and multi-religious
                                      country. Past events show how easily it is for troublemakers to
                                      make use of gatherings to incite racial and religious riots,
                                      resulting in loss of lives and property. Indeed events in the last
                                      two years around the world, demonstrate the disruptive forces that
                                      can be unleashed due to racial and religious strife. Regulation of
                                      public talks is therefore necessary and continues to be
                                      needed.<br> <br> 2. All Statements here <strong>Must</strong> be backed with facts
                                      and not baseless allegations.<br> <br> 3. Any topics that eventually ends up as a flame war will be closed
                                      after 3 warnings. A 24 hour grace period will be given after the
                                      last warning to allow users to give reasons on why the thread
                                      should remain open.</p>
