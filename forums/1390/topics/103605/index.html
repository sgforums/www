            <div class='col-md body'>most of the time they drop out due to injury.<br><br>but showing attitude is not an excuse. most probably he's pretty much disgruntled at being a specialist instead of an officer.<br><br>i say, just take what you have and give what you can give. not an officer then do a good job as a specialist. no matter where you go, people can recognise a person who does his job well... whether to give reward is another thing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is indeed quite rare for cadets to OOC for "attitude problems".<br><br>This is because such cadets will usually be given a chance (in the form of a warning letter  and possibly, an interview with the Dy Commandant (Army) of OCS) after the first offence. That'll probably scare them enough to behave for the rest of their stint at OCS.<br><br>So if he's indeed OOCed from OCS due to "attitude", he probably really has some serious, pathological problem...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>During my time had 2 good friends who served as instructors in my BMT training unit. The 2 of them were senior term OCTs (at that time there was no differentiating of pro and junior terms and there were no tri-service courses). One of them was OOC in senior term because he could not qualify as a pilot (solo flying failed). But because he did his junior term OCS, he was deemed to have qualified as an infantry section cmdr. So he was posted to my unit.<br><br>The other friend, suffice to say , he was a "jee-seow kia" !  He is a nice chap but just too playful. Finally, got up the a@@ of the wrong instructors and mentors in OCS and was kicked out. Then served as sect. cmdr in my company. Later in reservist, because he graduated from NUS as a lawyer, he served as local captain at the court martial centre !<br><br>I know of 2 other chaps .. not close friends but acquaintances. One was OOC because he was charged and served 7 days DB for falsifying his IPPT results in his docket.  This happened during junior term. He then served the rest of his NS as a clerk (Lance corp) somewhere in Mindef HQ.  The other friend was OOC during junior term because he lost his rifle during a topo exercise in Mandai forest.  Anyway, this guy actually became famous. You may have seen him on CNN Asia , as the CEO of a up and coming IT company !!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Talking about decommissioned officers, these cases are quite rare. Only case I read in the Straits Times was in 1990 or so. There was a chap who was charged with rape of a young woman. Happened during his NS time when he was a 2LT. He was found guilty and naturally "de-barred".  If I am not mistaken, the ST said that he was a good cadet during OCS and a prize winner of some sort .</div>
