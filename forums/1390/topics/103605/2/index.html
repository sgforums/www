Hmm ....thats common....i got a fren last time who went to this checkpoint , Hotel or India, they bunked at this motel nearby , those japanese spring kind, slipped into their PT attire, hid their weapons in the room and went drinking in the local town pub and had Mah la steamboat somemore....<br><br>i'm wasn't too sure of the SOC timing in OCS, different Wings had different timing, i know standard passing timing is 9.30 min. My PC made those that ran more than 8min to retake tests.<br><br>i think it really depends where u run the SOC back in OCS, those that ran down from the Medical Center into the 3rd Division's SOC will find it relatively easy due to the downsloap, but the one at Pasir Laba, where all the cadets are bounded to get the 7-11 deal *sigh* Thats hell</div>
