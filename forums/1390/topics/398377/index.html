              <p>Hi guys, I am heading for a NS check up for enlistment at around the end of May. I was told that after the checkup then 6-9 months. I will receive a letter to gather at where or something. As you can see I am very very new to this. Would like to know advices about the checkup. I heard that there is a test going on.</p>
              <p>I read around the forum but was very confused since I'm very new. If can, mind giving me a link to the threads that I can relate to? Sorry for the trouble. Really tried searching around.</p>
              <p>Also do I need a decent hair cut to attend? (As in short?)</p>
              <p>Thanks</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Its basically a checkup to determine what Pes you belong. For haircut no, just dont go over the limit with long silky hair, reason is you need to take picture of yourself to make a ID there. Advices will be go early, best around 8 or 9 if possible, since the whole checkup will last 4 or 5 hours. Bring your medical reports (if any) to there, at the last station where the guy checks your kkj, tell that guy your problems (if any). K thats basically about it, if you have no more questions.</p></div>

              <p>ok let me help u out a little with regards to your quries. upon reporting to CMPB for your check-up, the following checks will be carried out:</p>
              <p>1.photo taking ( for your NS NRIC aka 11B)</p>
              <p>2.urine test</p>
              <p>3.draw blood for blood test</p>
              <p>4.declaration of tatoo if any.</p>
              <p>5.X-ray done for lungs</p>
              <p>6.eye test</p>
              <p>7.dental check up</p>
              <p>8.hearing test</p>
              <p>9.ECG or heart rate monitoring</p>
              <p>10.height and weight</p>
              <p>11.. Docter interview / visual check by SAF MO. ( expect to strip naked for 1-2 min, declare any medical condition to the MO)</p>
              <p>12.Upon completion on all the above, you will be directed to a computer lab to do your IQ test. Just follow the instruction on the computer.</p>
              <p>completion of your IQ test will mark the end of your NS check up. After 6-9 months, you will receive a letter from CMPB of your posting ie. Police/SCDF/Army/Navy. Im not sure of the reporting procedure for police and scdf. The letter will state the time and date for reporting and also the items to bring on enlistment day. If you are posted to the army, most likely you will receive your basic military training(BMT) in tekong whereas navy, you wil receive your BMT at RSS Panglima, IMOS at Changi Naval Base. Medics at CMPB can be quite "dao" and are rather unwilling to answer some of your queries for further instructions. Never to worry, specific instructions will be pasted on the walls around the check up area to guide you through the whole check up. Unless you lan lan bo bian than consult the medics there. hope all this helps and good luck!</p>

              <p>Thanks for the help guys! Really appreciates it. I kind of have a bit of heart problem. Do I see a doctor first or tell it to them at the checkup? I heard that I can prepare for the 400 questions to be asked? Does it matter if I do well or not? I'm kind of overweight and short as well. My friends told me that I most likely go in Pes C due to being unfit. What does Pes C usually do?</p>
              <p>My sibling told me that there are quite a few bullying cases inside? Is it true?</p>
              <p>Very sorry for all the trouble.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the reply.My hair is kind of long but not too long.For the 400 questions, when I did the registration online, there is a part that says how to prepare for the questions...I'm not too sure as well.Does it matter if I do well on it or not? So I go to a clinic and get a memo and give it to the person during the check up? I'm thinking of going to a poly clinic.</p>
