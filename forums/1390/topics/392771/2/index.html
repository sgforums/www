              <p>yes i agree with wat u said. drivers vocation have a few a lvl and poly ppl and is minority. but some ppl are saying all are uneducated ppl which is very unfair to them. and i can tell u , mostly the uneducated ones are the one who always get rich. they are just not academically inclined , but i am sure their brain can be more creative and more lively , and i mean they can think out of the box.</p>
              <p>obviously u dunno a lot abt army , have u even been enlisted? i feel so sorry if u have ord-ed or are in service and u are still so ignorant. obviously mono intake soldiers are all low educated ppl , and there are bound to have black sheep , but let me tell u , all those cases u talk abt like awol , theft and etc still happens after their mono intake bmt. and right now in my mt line , there is also soldiers from mono intake posted to my camp as drivers and they dun act like wat u said , instead they gt a good performance and 1 of them is going to ord already. and u are wrong not all the ppl who have problem are being posted out , some being posted out is because of medical reason or some of the vocation in nid of manpower , tts y they are being posted to tat vocation.</p>
              <p>yes there are black sheeps in every vocation , but ppl including u are always talking about drivers being fuck up and everything , think abt it , is it fair for us? bringing down the reputation of drivers. and ppl are thinking tat they are too highly educated for drivers vocation. those nerds will cry when their instructors start shouting at them. Think army instructors are like those bbdc instructors? pay them money to teach you but instead they sleep in the car. i seen all these on the road before , wearing a shade , but from the side view u can see they are closing their eyes sleeping. Can those nerds even take the shouting and scolding from their instructors? Hell no , they will cry for momma and papa.</p>

              <p>"Mostly the uneducated ones are the ones who get rich"? Wake up betty. Out of 100,000 uneducated people, you get a small handful who made it and because they are considered unusual, rare and went against the grain of their type, you notice them and they may even get the odd newspaper coverage because the papers are desperate for stories. Out of 100,000 rich people, I assure you that 99% of them is marginally educated. And what uneducated/not smart means "can think outside the box or can be more creative and lively"? Why don't you say all ugly people are smart because they are ugly and all stupid people are rich? Just because you're shortchanged in one department does not mean God compensated generously with another one.</p>
              <p>The very basis of scientific research requires one to go against standard conventions and disprove status quos. So why don't you find me a Nobel laureate who is uneducated? And in what ways are Steve Jobs, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates or Donald Trump uneducated or not smart? Bill Gates was smart enough to make it to Harvard.</p>
              <p>And obviously you're an idiot who doesn't know what goes on in command school and think that those who coast through their NS life without going to one have it 'tougher'. Lunatic.</p>
