              <p>Hi, I'm a girl and really interested to join SAF. I'm in JC taking 'A' Level this year.</p>
              <p>Many curious questions have surrounded girls enlisting to SAF for years, and some really bother me. For example, how noob girls are and how we cannot compare ourselves to men in military terms. Just to tell you that not all girls are like that and doesn't mean that these people do not exist in the private sector outside of SAF. I've been thinking of enlisting to SAF for some time now, and many girls express dismay and disapprove my choice for military.</p>
              <p>I have a few questions to ask on girls joining the SAF to check and confirm if SAF is really the work-life balance that I desire for life militarily. <br><br>What's your say from a man's perspective? <br>I will be hearing the women's perspective in the SAF women's seminar 2012.</p>
              <p>Hope to receive your honest feedback! :)</p>
              <p>1. Do girls do different roles in SAF? Combat or non-combat? Sensitive vocations?</p>
              <p>2. Career prospects for women? Do exam results matter? Scholarship?</p>
              <p>3. Must girls undergo BMT with boys before Uni or after we gotten our degrees?</p>
              <p>4. Will guys go ga-ga over the SAF girls in camp since their birds are in their cages for weeks? My seniors advise me not to join as some guys will stalk girls offline/ online.</p>

              <p>But it seems like in recent times the govt is encouraging girls to join the army, so i want to see if the negative responses about girls in army is still prevalent.</p>

              <p>3. Do we have to enter BMT before entering uni before signing on? or do we only talk about army after finishing uni?</p>
              <p>4. Are guys crazily over the girls in army? My senior told me not to join cos every guy will know about the girls. So there will be some stalking of girls. LOL.</p>

              <p>For one thg you miss out? what you wish to do in army?</p>
              <p>support staff, or combat?</p>
              <p>If you are into combat, i think you can only go into combat support, as eg artillery, medics, signal etc.</p>
              <p>How do you feel about being stuck in a small confine place with 6 or 7 men, in a dirty stuffy condition.... or as a tankers where your butt (sorry for being crude) will be a constant sight to the loader underneath you?</p>
              <p>when feild excercise woman have a privelledge to be driven to a nearby toilet to freshen up. But this may not always true...so chances sometimetimes you need to do business in the wild. where your men, if well trained enough with the proper gear being issue.. You wont detact them peeping at you... I was a guilty party donkeys years ago...</p>
              <p>If you really want to go in, go uni before joining..</p>
              <p>Best part in the army, you will have free facial mud mask at least every month once.</p>
              <p>I ever went to field excercise with a group of women, we chatted.. majority of them regretted and not what they expected.. and almost all of the 9 women attached to us.. state they going to get out once the contract is up...</p>
              <p>so if you really want to go in, do your research well.. and be prepare you wont get what you want..</p>

              <p>My SGT and Mdm are ladies.</p>
              <p>1. There are many vocations in army. They will post you when there is an available place somewhere. Who knows? Some COL may find you pretty and next you are his personal assistant.</p>
              <p>2. Career prospect for girls, like all guys are shady. Unless you are an overseas SAF scholars, you cannot raise a high rank. </p>
              <p>3. If you plan to go Uni, then sign on after you finish it for ladies. You can get a SAF scholarship to sponsor you for your uni.</p>
              <p>4. May be I am gay. I don't give flowers to my SGT.</p>
              <p>The career perspective for ladies are simliar to man, in ranks and promotion. If you are degree holder, you follow the MDES rank normally. </p>
              <p>Consider airforce and navy too.</p>

              <p>I bet on my dollar 100% that TS will cry in the camp and will realized the prize of being naive, that is if she choose to serve in combat vocation, just say her prayer that she didn't go to report to IMH later. And just in case she still didn't understand what an army's life is :</p>
              <p>Sergeant to Chao Recruit : Ow, Early in the morning your want to play punk with me is it ? Knock it down, sit up postion change, jumping jack position change, push-up position change... talking about good old memory !</p>
              <p>Still talk is cheap, if TS still want enthusiastic, she can always train herself to drink 1 full bottle of water or learn change her clothing fasting or even jogging while carrying the Ali Baba bag, since drink water and uniform parade will just be part and parcel of life in BMT which is not difficult to understand once she is in camp.</p>

              <p>4 paths - Trooper, Specialist, Officer, Military Expert<br>- Troopers are for N/O/ITE<br>- Specs are sergeants/warrant officers (small team leaders)<br>- Officers (Dip/A/Degree)<br>- Military Expert (specialise in tech/weapons/engineering/intelligence; degree holders start with ME4 - Senior Expert)</p>
              <p><strong>2. Career prospects for women? Do exam results matter?
              Scholarship?</strong><br><br>Your questions might indicate that you're either a nerd of simplistic in thinking. Of course results matter.... If you sign on as an officer and qualify for NUS/NTU/SMU, your course will be paid for + a good allowance. For specs/officers, who went poly, their poly fees can be back-paid and still qualify for scholarship if they can get into NUS/NTU/SMU.<br><br>Prospect WITHIN the organisation is good. Promotion is almost guaranteed, unless you're an underachiever/mistakes/discipline issues....<br><br>However if you intend to serve 10 years and leave, pure combat vocations will mean total irrelevance when you switch careers. Knowing how to fight wars has no meaning in the business world. <br><br>Although officers/senior ME/engineering positions will still be useful and good in civilian career.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Must girls undergo BMT with boys before Uni or after we
              gotten our degrees?</strong></p>
              <p>For specs/military expert/officers - BMT has to start before going to Uni, otherwise will be too old. <br><br>Only if you qualify for NUS/NTU/SMU and accepted on scholarship, then you can disrupt for your uni (do note while studying you're still required to serve while on term breaks).<br><br>SIM not eligible for scholarship at the moment. <br><br>Do note the bond (minimum term of engagement). Once signed, turning back = pay alot of money.</p>
              <p><strong>4. Will guys go ga-ga over the SAF girls in camp since their
              birds are in their cages for weeks? My seniors advise me not to
              join as some guys will stalk girls offline/ online.</strong><br><br>Stalkers are everywhere..even in school, uni or ordinary workplaces right? SAF protects women very well, no men are allowed into the bunks(rooms) of female personnel, under ANY circumstances - completely out of bounds. Whenever a female personnel is under training, a more senior female officer/warrant officer will be attached throughout as well. Any indiscretion or misconduct between male/female = court martial (military discipline) + dishonorary discharge (fired)<br><br>Male/female problems are generally a non-issue....nothing to be worth considering about. Although if you're serving in a combat vocation and you have to relieve yourself outfield, you have to exercise your own precaution and wisdom lah...don't show your naked butt to everyone.</p>

              <p>Rank/Career progression is highly dependent on one's capabilities. </p>
              <p>Stable promotion for stable progress. Every 2-3 years change of appointment, to gain experience, exposure, learn new skills. Upon completion of certain benchmark appointments, promotion will follow. Unless they fail their minimum performance expected (ie. fail IPPT or poor work performance), they will be promoted.</p>
              <p>For scholarship holders, officers can expect at least a Major in 10 years or 3rd Warrant Officer/ME3.</p>
              <p>Beyond that is purely based on performance - nothing to do with paper qualifications anymore. </p>
              <p>I have seen Diploma holders convert from a 3rd sergeant to officer and Lieutenant Colonel in about 15 years, but also officers with a degree who retire with Major in 20 years. There're people who spend 20 years and retire only as a Captain (today's entry rank for degree holders). When you meet this kind of early retirement people who can't get promoted, you'll immediately realise why...they are just... well....cannot make it.</p>
              <p>For officers who fail to obtain at least a LTC by age 45, will have to retire. Otherwise may remain till 55. </p>
              <p>If you ask....there certainly is competition and politics. So does every other job, even construction workers have politics. There are nice and bad people....but generally its quite okay, people will get along because sour relations will make life difficult for everyone, you will still need each other's help at times, so it can't go too bad. </p>
              <p>In summary - its one's capability, not paper qualifications or anything else.</p>
