              <p>Hi all, I am the brother-in-law of Yoko. Appreciate the interest and the good words. My sis and nieces are now in South Africa with him. I had started an open Facebook group 'Friends of Yoko Tan Poh Eng' for people who know him to pay tribute to this imperfect but unique man. If you want to drop a few lines, share your personal experiences with him or even share pictures etc., you are most welcome to do so in the Facebook account. Would appreciate the language used please out of respect for the man. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Official story is not out yet. The above was a speculation. The army usually releases an official statement only after the investigations are completed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How many times has a jumper counted to 3, shouted "check" and really registered the real situation of his chute's opening via visual evaluation, and how may times has a jumper acknowledged his canopy is screwed (when it is) and did the drill without hesitation?</p>
              <p>There is always a hesitation. It's a moment of denial, being unable to accept his situation. The drill does not take care of that adequately, what really helped was when your PJI screwed you in PTW when you did not react fast enough.</p>

              <p>Yes I am aware of my surroundings. And I never assumed that I am absolutely right on this one, and it was never my intention to be disrespectful to a deceased PJI. If you still want to pursue this feel free to private message me. If anyone here who is genuinely hurt emotionally by what I had to say here, please feel free to write to me. If my observations do eventually contribute to finding out what actually led to the accident, I am happy that further such incidents may be averted. If it is not of any help at all, you may call me names if you want to. </p>

              <p>Specifically this was what I was refering to. There are 2 ways to "calibrate" an altimeter (not sure of a freefaller uses the same method). One uses local area air pressure taken at sea level. When using this method, the user has to keep in mind the actual elevation of the ground. Which in this case is about 4500+ feet. This meant that the jumpers had only less than 8000 ft to reach the ground. . The other method is to use air pressure taken on the "hard deck", which is the ground. WIth this, the altimeter shows the user his exact height off the ground, when on the ground his altimeter should read 0. According to preliminary reports from the news, the team broke off at 3500ft, making no reference to whether they used the sea level or the ground elevation as the datum. If both 12,500ft and 3500ft used in the report was based on ground elevation, then the jumpers would have been exposed to an altitude of 17,000ft. This is the height at which a normal person without the aid of a breathing aparatus like 100% oxygen gets exposed to hypoxia. What is not possible is that the report uses the datum as sea level for both the altitudes reported, as this would inevitably meant that the team broke off 1000ft below the ground.</p>
              <p>Regardless which method is being used, it is absolutely essential that the correct pressure setting be input into the altimeter. Errors can be big or small, and can be attributed to erroneous input( due to a large number of human errors possible) and changes to the air pressure with time, with the latter being negligible most of the time. With sky diving sports, ground elevation becomes more important as it gets higher, as factors such as low air density, higher vertical velocity and unusual readouts complicating an otherwise simple jump.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>With regard to Crosshairs' speculation, I can surely say that any experienced PJI (Yoko had served 37 years as a red beret) who had jumped all over the world, will never make a mistake with their altimeter settings. Please do not 'ridicule' the professionalism and expertise of our PJIs with this simplistic speculation. However, I appreciate your educating us on the altimeter etc. Thanks for taking an interest on this matter.</p></div>
