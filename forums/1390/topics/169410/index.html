What you must realize is that joint locks are 'locks' for a reason - You joints are locked out, and further pressure means your jopints will break. The tap is a safety mechanism to tell your opponent to ease off the pressure.<br><br>I am surprised that has not been explained to you.<br><br>wait....   SAF instructors.... nope not surprised.

            <div class='col-md body'>Fire and movement works.  Its been proven in how many wars le.<br><br>What doesn't work is the anti-aircraft drill.<br><br>Thing is, ur 5.56 traveling upwards to the sky isn't gonna do anything to an attack aircraft or gunship except piss the pilot off.  In all respects, those things pack enuff firepower to splatter ur section all over the floor.<br><br>Bullsh!t i 1:  "the amount of lead flyin at the aircraft would frighten the pilot away."<br><br>Absolute truth: Pilots are so full of themselves, down right annoying ppl that they would just drop a CBU down ur throat the moment u do that.   If not, just their external fuel tanks will do.<br><br>Bullsh!t 2:   "In the vietnam war, small arms ground fire shot down many US planes."<br><br>Absolute truth:   US Napalm from attack aircraft killed a lot more suckers shooting at them.<br><br>Bullsh!t 3:   "We line perpendicular to the aircraft path, so that the line of bullets would affect us minimaly."<br><br>Absolute truth:  Real attack pilots dun strafe like the movies do.  Instead of strafing in the verticle line path, they got for tight circles of lead.  YES... U dun see those line of bullet plopping away from u.  They will rain like there is a 5 x 5 meter raincloud over ur heads.<br><br>Only absolute truth in the anti -aircraft drill is, "FREEZE.  Don't even move."  Even doppler radars when in ground attack mode, is trying to look and differentiate moving objects from the background terrain.   Theoretically, if u don't move, u won't appear on the radar screen in the GMT mode.</div>
