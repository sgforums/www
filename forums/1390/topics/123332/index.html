            <div class='col-md body'>yup correct.<br><br>anyway, you may be wrong to say they dun get any working experience in working sector.<br><br>many officers (maj and above) after they retire from SAF, they can get a senior management post in major companies, schools, RIs, defence sector, manufacturing sector etc.<br><br>cuz, since they already command a batallion etc before, their management skills are good. and some more those officers (in order to normally become officer, at least A levels or degree holder)...e.g. engineering.<br><br>therefore since they got management skills and know engineering...etc..what do you expect? their years after retirement could just be as good.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What they are given after retirement depends on their rank.<br><br>BGs and above are usually placed in senior/top management positions in GLCs and ministries.

The ex-CMC who was a BG retired and was given a Professorship in the Faculty of Medicine, NUS.
