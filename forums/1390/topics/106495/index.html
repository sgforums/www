The malay command is " Senang Diri". Took me 30 seconds to remember this !  hahaha ... been a long time since I thought of this word.<br>It was a muster parade, and the WO2 was acting RSM of the unit. And CO was standing to one side, waiting to receive the nominal roll report.<br>By the way, both WO2 and CO were regular (commando and ex-SOF). A bit on the ball even when treating us reservists. Plus 30% to half of the unit were NS men about to ORD, they were receiving their conversion training with us 1st ICT reservists. The NS men were quite on the ball even though they had 2 to 3 months before ORD.<br><br>A few of us SGTs and LTAs (all reservists) were late. We thot 0800 hrs means report to admin building at sharp 0800 hrs. But nobody told us that we have to "fall -in" and be part of the muster parade  5 mins before 0800hrs !!!  As I said, only  a couple of older officers (reservist Captains) that came in from other units were sort of excused from parade. They were "rescued" by the S1 who asked them to come into his office to get some papers.<br><br>No scolding... but we got a very nasty look from the WO2 and CO.  Later, we were all laughed at by the men.<br></div>
