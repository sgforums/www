The harder and more realistically we train them, the more likely they are to fight well and survive when called upon to defend the nation. The training also has to be conducted professionally and safely. MINDEF therefore constantly aims to strike the right balance between training realism and safety. We take all the safety precautions and measures feasible to minimise risks. But in the nature of military training, there will always remain some risks which cannot be completely eliminated.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh.. In any case, my sympathies go out to the family and parents  of the Guardsman. To lose a son like that, especially when he is supposed to be helping 'defend the nation' seems like an absolute kick in the guts, to put it mildly. Being a citizen army, every loss is a hard one to bear.<br><br>As for the training regime, i was not surprised to hear that Adm. Teo remarked that it may not be the first time that it (the dunking of trainees in water) has happened, and that previous cases may have been unreported. To me, a layman (and a pretty blur one, at that), it seems that it was a case of pushing things until the line snaps. I guess these instructors had done it before, and had just kept doing it until things got pushed too far. I think the mentality needs to change, and it should be made known that TSRs should not and cannot be pushed. TSRs should of course take into account realistic training, but safety should be paramount, no matter what. What's the use of training soldiers to fight if they end up killed by it?<br><br>Overall, Adm Teo seems to be going around kicking ass, and i think its a good thing. The Commandos have had a bad year. The good thing (at least) is that everything seems more 'above-board' than previous years, which (hopefully) means everyone sees it and there will be more pressure within SAF to change.<br><br>Just my two-cents worth.</div>
