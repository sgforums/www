            <div class='col-md body'>I have started this thread as an avenue for seasoned shooters and would be enlistees to discuss and share their experiences with regards to the art of shooting. It would be helpful to focus on the established basics of shooting before any unorthodox methods are are introduced, which may or may not be useful. Useful links to other sites are welcome (if it doesn't go against their policy). I hope this thread will continue to benefit our boys (ok and girls if you are in the armed forces) when they enter their combat training.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I have since laid off my rifles and taken up pistol shooting. Air pistol.<br><br>For me, I take in a deep breath (2/3 max lung capacity) while I raise my arm and align my weapon to the target. During the last 10% of my inhaling stage, I put my sight right where it should be, exactly. Then I will begin a slow exhaling process. The flow of air from my lungs is regulated not by the diaphram(how the XXX do you spell it?) but rather by constricting my air passage or osophegus (how the XX do you....nvm). Much like how some divers will exhale while resurfacing. I find this method particularly effective.<br><br>1)Retains  a certain amount of oxygen rich air in the lungs to aid concentration. This part is usually overlooked.<br><br>2)Stabilizes the body and "cushions" the effects of minute "twitching" on the weapon's aim.<br><br>3)Feels more natural squeezing off on the exhale rather than inhale.<br><br>4)"Times" the shot. If you are out of breath, you have been aiming too long.<br><br>The above method was developed (by moi, if not, then it must have been a coincidence of some sort) for the purpose of 10m .177 air pistol events. However part of it is derived from years of shooting semi-auto rifles in various positions, useful in particular for standing positions.<br><br>For prone position, I recommend the constant light breathing method as an alternative to the other methods mentioned here. The constant light breathing method does away with thinking about how to breath and when to squeeze off. It is assumed that the firer has an ample amount of time to engage a static target. By breathing lightly and constantly, the firer is supplied with a near constant flow of air. My experience with prone position suggests that heartbeat overtakes breathing as the main culprit of sight movement. With consistent slow breathing, the rate and magnitude of the heartbeat is reduced. Thus allowing the shot to be taken in between beats.</div>
