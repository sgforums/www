            <div class='col-md body'>i think whatever it is, in my opinion, 2 principles should remain:<br><br>1. book in and out timings should not be stipulated to the hour and mins.<br>2. book in and out timings should be at the commander's discretion.<br><br>of course, the commander and his subordinates will have various reasons for certain timings - and hopefully good reasons at that (although i agree that there are times when the timings are ridiculous for unknown and unclear reasons). to the trainees, who are at the receiving end, any book out timing is probably late, which is understandable. but do try to understand the rationale too. and of course, alot of times, its the trainees (or some of them) who influence these timings.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

There had been enough comforts in the army, Chalets-like accommo during BMT , not so tough training for BMT now, so much better combat rations, and cook house food, just the bed itself is a luxury. AND the reduced NSF time. And now you complaining about booking out/in timing..??<br>Tell you what ask the Minister of Defence to revert back to 30 mths NSF, then you will be able to book out earlier. Its give and take. Less 6 mths.. and you are not alone in the booking in/out issue. But you are already serving less time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You guys have it easier these days.Even the BMT is slightly different from mine..and mine was in end 2002-early 2003.That says a lot on how BMT currently is.<br><br>They have to squeeze in the same amount of training in a shorter time, and actually, most training syllabuses have been slashed by G6.<br><br>Give and take, that's all I can say.Sometimes, miscommunication breaks down, sometimes the shit hits the fan and we get doused.But in the end, it's just a tough reality.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, it seems i can't get a productive discourse here... i guess i blame myself for bringing up issues that ever-so controversial and that i cannot drive the message across well.<br><br>My main intention was just to bring up the lack of "measures" in place that could lead to abuse which may lead to unpleasantness while serving NS liability.<br><br>Yes, i have sometimes little private time... but over the months, i have gotten used to it. But what i can't bear is the lack of justification why our time offs is cut short.<br><br>Such as the situation i brought up, early book in, only to wait in camp doing nothing. Or a breakdown in communication whic lead someone somewhere to believe we need to book in early.<br><br>Since most of the replies are hostile in nature (e.g. "just serve your 2 years and fark off") or accusatory... i guess there's no point i should carry on this topic further.<br><br></div>
