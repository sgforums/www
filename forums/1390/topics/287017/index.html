            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>It is a Division Service Support Base, not a frontline fighting unit.

I knew all the "DS" units under DISCOM stood for "Direct Support" so, for a moment there, I thought there's been a name change. But your designation isn't correct too, leh, cuz DSSB is combat support &amp; not service support.<br><br>DSSB should still stand for Direct Support Supply Bn; their sister units are DSMB (Direct Support Maintenance Bn) &amp; DS Med Bn (Direct Support Medical Battalion). Each combat DIV has one of these outfits, commanded by an internal DISCOM (Division Support Command), but operationally they're more often deployed as smaller elements or detachments during BDE-level Exs (in rear staging areas).

Second-line soldiers, to be precise, athough as a formation they style themselves more as Army Logisticians than as combatants. Put it this way, their troops will still move out in helmet &amp; rifle.<br><br>I do know Sembawang Camp is supposedly known more as Home of the Logisticians, &amp; to a lesser extent Kranji Camp too.

My perception has come from an old commemorative edition of the Logistics Fomation (celebrating their Anniversary sometimes in the '90s). Checked my copy last night, &amp; it did mention that Sembawang Camp &amp; a new Kranji Camp were supposed to house all their units, the latter site designated for their HQs &amp; planning facilities.<br><br><blockquote>I would say 6DSSB should be somewhere in the 6Div area maybe Nee Soon or Mandai since that was where the 6Div HQ was last and currently located.

Wasn't that sure cuz I can vaguely recall seeing a prominent DSSB signage on the shuttle-bus route towards the recent AOH. Guess that's the 3rd BN at Jurong Camp, then.<br><br>Among the Arty equivalent too, I know only 3 Div Arty is based in Amoy Quee (the Formation's other "home" camp, along with Khatib). 9 Div Arty, for example, is in Selarang too.</div>
