            <div class='col-md body'>No actual policy. If you want to follow policy strictly, that means you need to take leave but no one in army does this.<br><br>Whether you can book out just for the road test is discretionary one.<br><br>usually the factor you have to meet is,<br><br>1) that day have light training<br>2) you have not missed previous training<br>3) training you will miss you go road test does not affect your IPPT or any "big" event like field camp, etc<br><br>Don't assume it's automatic.  ALot of PC/OC will play you want. like will say at first the week before, but during that week, they will threaten you say, you give me attitude, you cannot book out etc.<br><br>if it falls during your Field Camp, Sit test, Range, usually the answer is "no". unless they want to take the trouble of accomodating you with another company.</div>
