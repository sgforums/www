            <div class='col-md body'>Your educational qualifications should already be noted down in your profile records, though it'll be further positively reinforced if you have relevant prior job/attachment experience as a complement.<br><br>But note that there are some purported 800 vocations in the various armed forces, generally categorized as combat, technican or support - i.e. a lot of jobs for each branch. No matter how scientific the job-matching, the odds are still against you getting precisely what you desire, esp. if you don't qualify for OCS or SISPEC or has signed on along the way.<br><br>For me, the "My Son, The NS Man" Parents' Handbook remains the biggest publicly-hinted disclosure on what factors will affect SAF vocational deployment. To quote:<br><br>"II. Vocational Training. For those who are not selected for any of the Junior Commander courses after their BMT, they will be trained for specific vocations. The SAF matches servicemen with vocations according to its organizational needs. The following points are considered in the assignment designating of vocations:<br><br>a. Educational qualifications.<br>b. Working experience.<br>c. Physical characteristics, eg. height and weight.<br>d. Physical fitness.<br>e. The SAF's organizational needs.<br>f. Unit Commander's recommendation<br><br>For each vocation, there is a job description stating the responsibilities for the job. If there is no vacancy in the vocation which the serviceman is suitable for, he will be matched with the next most suitable vocation."<br><br>In other words, what you could presently do is only with "f". You could perhaps mention your hopes during your PC interview, but otherwise had better perform accordingly in training to prompt him (&amp;/or your DIs) into recommending you along. Who knows, maybe all they want is to see solid effort on your part. That said, requisite fitness criterion for specific RSAF deployment - considering your obese status - may be itself out of their hands, &amp; may not yet favour you in the longer run if you end up being saddled with something you'll physically struggle in. Not every soldier is happy with his vocation, but in certain ways the system does ensure you get posted to a "suitable" one.</div>
