              <p>Hmm yea more admin time i guess and not as rushed since we go in earlier. Oh I heard this rumour etc., that the earliest timeslot (0845) is meant for school 4 since have to take the tonner in. If school 4 then apparently 5th coy is currently the toughest company :O Haha oh well fun though i guess!</p>

              <p>Yea not anymore was only implemented recently i think. I think so that in case some reshuffling occurs and the recruit gets allocated to another coy in a diff school then won't have to update him ?</p>
              <p>The only way (before enlisting) is to refer to the web (not updated currently) or ask our friends who enlisted early which are the empty coys <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/sunglasses.png" alt="sunglasses.png"></p>

              <p>Hmm yea more admin time i guess and not as rushed since we go in
              earlier. Oh I heard this rumour etc., that the earliest timeslot
              (0845) is meant for school 4 since have to take the tonner in. If
              school 4 then apparently 5th coy is currently the toughest company
              :O Haha oh well fun though i guess!</p>

              <p>2.4? no problem after PTP, chin up well depending on how much effort u put in.</p>
              <p>For me, I was running something like 12.30-13 before PTP. After that, I think I could hit almost 10. As for chinup, I was 2 and during PTP, at 1 stage, I could not even do 1 but after that 10-12 seem so simple...lol</p>

              <p>Haha yea! I heard the running's really effective! Yea my current timing's about the same as yours before PTP around 12:30 - 13 usually I just scrape through a D to get silver.</p>
              <p>Chin up used to be able to do 9 without much swaying and all but now only 1 :X But training back again so hopefully by PTP can do at least 6 -7 since have to do before every meal or something right? Haha yea!</p>
