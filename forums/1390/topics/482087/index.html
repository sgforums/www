              <p>Hi, I want to help my dear apply for NS deferment. <br>I need help from kind hearted people.</p>
              <p>My boyfriend is 17 years old as of Jan 2014. He just received his NS registration letter in March 2014. He is a half-way school dropout at Sec 3 in 2013. In 2013, he decided to continue with his studies and take GCE 'O' Levels. He attended a pre-course for 'O' level in a private school end 2013. But he didn't continue from 2014 due to the fees were unaffordable to us. Thus he decided to do self home-study instead. Knowing it's tough road ahead, however his determination and obstinate did not stop him. He is now determined to do it good for 'O' levels, get into a polytechnic for our future together. But one day, he will have to serve NS in duty of our nation building...</p>
              <p>For further studies, what is MINDEF/ SAF's policy on NS deferment?</p>
              <p>We want to go find our Member of Parliament (MP) to write letter to CMPB. </p>
              <p>How?</p>
              <p>Help. Thanks in advance.</p>
              <p>Note: We are not going to any private school due to the fees are not affordable.</p>

              <p><strong>On what basis is deferment allowed?</strong><br><br>    Under the Enlistment Act, all male Singaporean citizens and permanent residents are liable to serve National Service (NS) upon reaching 18 years of age. In determining when a person is to be enlisted, MINDEF considers two main factors:<br><br>        1. The need to enlist NS-liable males for rigorous military training while they are young and fit. <br>        2. The need to preserve equity in terms of educational attainment before NS.<br><br>    MINDEF exercise flexibility by granting deferment from full-time NS for those pursuing full-time studies up to the GCE ‘A’ levels, Polytechnic Diploma or their equivalent, both locally and overseas. NS-liable males are enlisted at the earliest opportunity upon turning 18, or when they have finished such course, whichever is later.<br><br>    MINDEF does not grant deferment for university studies. Those pursuing university studies will be enlisted at the earliest opportunity upon turning age 18. This policy applies to all who are liable for NS.<br><br><strong>Can I defer if I am studying private courses?</strong><br><br>    If you are graduated from a full-time course before Sep 2011, you may be granted deferment to pursue a full-time private course if you are below the age of 18 years as at 1 Jan of the course commencement year.</p>
              <p>    If you graduated from a full-time course from Sep 2011 onwards, and are pursuing a full-time private course that commences later than 1 Jan 2012, you may be granted deferment if you are below the age of 19 years (for Secondary 4 students) or 20 years (for Secondary 5 students), as at 1 Jan of the course commencement year. <br><em><br>    [Note: The private course must not lead to a degree qualification, and must be registered with the Council for Private Education (CPE).] </em><br><br><strong>Can I be deferred from full-time NS if I am doing a degree course?</strong></p>
              <p>    Deferment from full-time NS is not allowed for courses leading to a degree qualification.</p>

              <p>Even if you go find your MP, I foresee either one of the 2 outcomes that the MP will say:</p>
              <p>1. Enrol in a private school/ government school to do his GCE 'O' Level.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Enlist for NS as soon as possible under the Voluntary Early Enlist Scheme (VEES) to do NS, and get over and done with it sooner than later. After ORD from NS, you can do whatever you want with your life.</p>
              <p>For the minority who complete their basic educational qualifications 
                  before age 18, they can apply for early enlistment if they are above age
                   16 1/2 under the Voluntary Early Enlistment Scheme. This will enable 
                  them to enlist slightly earlier and complete their full-time NS before 
                  proceeding for any further studies.</p>

              <p><em>This would also undermine our key NS principles of universality and 
              equity.</em> <strong>The NS system will not work if we allow individuals to choose 
              when they would like to be enlisted. </strong></p>
              <p>MINDEF therefore grants deferment for pre-enlistees to gain their basic 
              educational qualifications of up to 'A' levels, polytechnic diploma, 
              international baccalaureate or equivalent qualifications.  This is 
              reasonable as most of our NS-liable males would either have completed or
               are completing their basic educational qualifications when they turn 18
               years of age. NS-liable males are therefore enlisted at the earliest 
              opportunity after turning 18 or when they have finished such courses, 
              whichever is later.</p>
              <p>This will strike an appropriate balance as our NS liable males will be 
              given the opportunity to complete the basic qualification at 'A' levels,
               polytechnic diploma or equivalent, and be enlisted for military 
              training while they are young and fit.</p>

                  enlistment.</p>
              <p>They will be scheduled for enlistment into the respective
                  enlistment intakes based on numerous considerations such as the
                  medical &amp; physical fitness and educational qualifications of
                  the individual, as well as the manpower and operational
                  requirements of the various intakes.</p>
              <p>In general, pre-enlistees from the same 'A' level/International
                  Baccalaureate (IB) or polytechnic cohort are enlisted over two
                  intakes due to capacity constraints at the NS training schools. For
                  example, 'A' level/ IB holders who graduate in Nov/Dec are
                  typically enlisted in the Dec and Mar quarterly intakes.
                  Polytechnic diploma holders who graduate in Mar/Apr are typically
                  enlisted in the Jun and Sep quarterly intakes. ITE certificate
                  holders and pre-enlistees with other qualifications are enlisted
                  throughout the year.</p>
              <p>Pre-enlistees can only be assigned to an enlistment intake after
                  being certified medically fit for enlistment at the pre-enlistment
                  medical screening. Pre-enlistees will receive Enlistment Notices to
                  notify them of their enlistment date about 2 months before their
                  scheduled enlistment.</p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notes:</span></em><br> <br> Pre-enlistees who are graded PES A/B1 and who attained a NAPFA
                  Silver or Gold award in the 12 months before their enlistment date

              classification of our soldiers is consistent with their deployment.
              The new 9-week programme will include customised physical training,
              as well as basic combat training to prepare them for their combat
              and combat support roles.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES C

              <p>For study wise, if your BF want to look for 'cheaper' option, he could considered taking part time O level class under General Education at ITE : <a href="https://www.ite.edu.sg/wps/portal/pts.secedu">https://www.ite.edu.sg/wps/portal/pts.secedu</a> or go to CDAC for their O level tuition programme : <a href="http://www.cdac.org.sg/eng/programmes/tuition/tuition_programme.htm">http://www.cdac.org.sg/eng/programmes/tuition/tuition_programme.htm</a> . Both of them are cheap and non-for-profit organization for students like your BF. But whether your BF can be exempted from NS will depend on whether these group have this policy for helping you.</p>
              <p>   However, if your BF is the '3 minute enthusiastic' type or cannot excel in academic area (no offence), then I advised he didn't waste time and he can considered joining WDA's CET qualification which can enabled him to join work force as well as study part-time poly if he want to : <a href="http://www.wda.gov.sg/content/wdawebsite/programmes_and_initiatives/L701D-CETQualificationAward.html">http://www.wda.gov.sg/content/wdawebsite/programmes_and_initiatives/L701D-CETQualificationAward.html</a> still, whether he can be exempted from NS will depend on WDA's policy.</p>
              <p>Finally do your BF have 'N' level (Is he from Normal Academic class?). The reason I am asking this is because do you know that polytechnic can accept N level for entry requirement if you can pass English, Maths and Science (different poly had differenet policy for this as well)? Hope this help. </p>

For his case, sadly the ITE does not offer part-time NS deferment on a case-by-case basis. I will check out the WDA/ e2i by NTUC.</p></div>
