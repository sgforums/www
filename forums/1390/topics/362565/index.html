              <p>Don't worry, there will be lifeguards to look after you.</p>
              <p>When you enter BMT, there will be a CAT test for you, and after you have been put into CAT C ( Which you probably will be, since you do not know how to swim at all ), you will be made to go for swimming lessons where there will be PTIs teaching you swimming.</p>
              <p>Before you enter the water, be sure to tell the lifeguards that you are a non-swimmer, though usually they will make you wear a swimming cap before you enter the water.</p>
              <p>Look on the bright side, while your platoon mates are doing 'sai-kang', you will be swimming and having fun in the pool.</p>
              <p>Once you pass out of BMT, you might be sent to units where you will be required to swim with an inflated life-jacket as part of their training. In this case, there is even less to worry about.</p>
              <p>If you enter sispec/OCS though, they might require you to go for aqua- jogging sessions at time with the Aqua Belt, just relax and run in the water and you should do fine.</p>
              <p>In any case, if there is any questions you want to ask about on water safety and such, you are free to post them here and ask me.</p>

              <p>It is also partially dependent on which company you get post to. If you got posted to a slack company, and that bunch of specs during that time is bor-chap one, then you will get to sleep in the bunk while the divers go for their swimming lessons.</p>
              <p>If you get posted to some company like ninja, and the batch of specs are very sadistic ones, then while your buddies are enjoying swimming lessons, you will be "enjoying" something else.</p>

              <p>It depends on the PTI you got. I have seen sadistic PTIs making recruits run around the pool 10 rounds before asking them to get in. I have also seen slack PTIs who ask the spec to do warm-up for his recruits, and then ask them to shower and go into the water when they are ready.</p>
