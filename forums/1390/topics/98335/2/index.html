            <div class='col-md body'>when you are THAT tired PLUS in the dark.... do you think you would really care if the ET plate or changkul hits the ground at an angle?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But in answer to your question, yes, its easier if you strike the ground frm an angle. If you try and whack it full on, it will not go as deep and you end up expanding more energy than needed.<br><br>When i did my field camp (recourse BMT but attached to a Standard BMT batch), the entire Coy was in the shit with the OC/PCs/PS/CSM since day 1 (viper coy, early '03) so was expecting a hell week! But guess what? the TCO cocked up the indent and so we ended up with 3 days of fresh rations!!! On top of that all, Mr Raincloud decided to go on holidays so we had 5 full days of sunshine! We started digging shellscrapes at abt 2pm and finished at about 5pm (cos it was all sand at the reclaimed site) and i dunno which monkey (to which i am thanking said monkey) decided that TWO sections dig ONE fire trench!! Think about it... 24 monkeys digging a fire trench!!! we finished just under 2 hours if i'm not wrong!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>And to top it all off, a deal was struck with the OC/PCs that if we performed up to scratch, we will return to Coy line on Friday afternoon after BIC and BOOK OUT! so long weekend!!<br><br>It was some consolation to an otherwise shitty BMT experience!<br><br>to the original poster, you better be super on the ball during field camps! Cos when you are away from HQBMTC and civilisation, your instrs can do <strong>anything</strong> they want... and you want to complain OO also no chance! unless OO come outfield with you (never gonna happen)</div>

After that 4 e next 2 OO meeting sessions, we just sat in e lecture hall waiting 4 him to cme...n he just never turned up!!!

Yup, rain is seriously demoralising. My batch was the 'guinea pig' that tested out 10-day field camp. It rained pratically everyday, all of us were wet for the whole field camp... eat in rain, sleep in rain, do IFC in rain, dig in rain.... u get the idea. And it wasn't juz drizzling, it was torrential rain most of the time.<br><br>Got so cold, esp at night, keep shivering. Lousy basha isn't waterproof.<br><br>But was lucky enuff not to sleep in flooded shellscrape, thanks to wild boars. For safety reason, OC let us sleep on hard ground around training shed  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
