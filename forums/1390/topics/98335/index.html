            <div class='col-md body'>Check w ur pc wt can n cannot bring to ur field camp. Diff comp gt diff rules. Sme r stricter than e others.<br><br>Like mine, a siong company in sch 2, only SAF issued items were allowed. We were nt even allowed to bring extra packet of tissue paper (only can use e single pack included in e combat ration package) n no outside brand powder like snake powder. My friend company good sia, his pc still told them to bring wet tissue along 4 field camp.<br><br>4 us, they did a major check on e 1st day of field camp , everything out fm ur field pack, they oso went through all ur pockets in e sbo n physically pad dwn on ur lng 4 2 ensure nothing were hidden in e pockets.<br><br>If u kana a siong company, n only can use saf issued items, do not bring anything that is nt saf issued on e 1st day.  But on e following days secretly ask 1 of e out of course personnel to bring in 4 u when they deliver stuff. But dun get caught!<br><br>But oct field camp still nt so bad as compared to us in dec. 1 day a lot of CAT 1, smetimes in e middle of e nite, hve to wake up, in FBO walk far far away to shelter. N unlike other companies just leave their field pack in e bashar, we brought ours along too. N we oso were nt allowed to wear our ponchos (last time no goretex jacket), e poncho just only added extra weight in our super wet (soaked in e rain) sbo. n oso do expect a lot of tekan like everything in" in 30 secs, n "everything out" fm ur field pack in 30 secs. But e field pack u all r using nw, hve longer pockets on both sides, so more space, therefore easier when kana "everything in" tekan. During our time, e side pockets were only half e length of nw.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is what I remember for my SIT Test......it was 4 years ago, so my memory's a bit faded:<br><br>Boarded the tonner  to this reclaimed area with lots of little shrubs and little cover....yes, it was hot. But nowhere as hot as Australia.<br><br>Debussed, went to the training shed and got divided into groups. After that, they pick your job, whether you are a CT or a terrorist, whether u take AWP or AK47....just joking  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  you will become a LAW guy, signaller, demo man, medic or something else, I can't remember.<br><br>I was the signaller so I went to another training shed for some super-quick signal training and got my little handheld radio. I stuck it in the side pocket of my fullpack, and with the antenna sticking out, looked kinda cool.....<br><br>Then went on to pitch basha. By now you should be very familiar with pitching bashas. Enjoy them, coz when u go to unit no more such luxury, just throw down your SBO and sleep.<br><br>More talking and admin stuff, training to tie knots and boring stuff. THat was the end of the first day. Clean weapon and powder bath at night, and I slept pretty well. It was much better than in IFC where I slept in rainwater.<br><br>Bright and early the next morning, we woke up for breakfast, 5BX, admin stuff again. Got a mission "briefing" before moving out in groups at 9am. Each group will rotate going to each station.<br><br>The most irritating thing here was the walking. Although you may be near to the station, your spec will lead you on endless walks through the safari-like area, to admire the plethora of flora and fauna in the area. I don't think we should disclose the details of each "mission", you should try them for yourself. They were all pretty interesting and some took thinking. Some were plain stupid and we solved in less than 5 mins.<br><br>Peppered through these leisurely walks are "arty-drills" to enhance the excitement, and somewhere in the festivities, someone will be declared a casualty. The remaining members of the group have to use a poncho to carry the fallen soldier and not walk, but RUN 2.4km to the next station. This is BLOODY TIRING. Apart from the fact that we had a Moby Dick in the poncho, the sun was glaring down on us and the satay pasta I had was sloshing in my stomach. One of the worst times I had in the whole course.<br><br>The other thing that bothered me constantly was the lack of general hygiene leading to rashes breaking out on my back. I had to take off my shirt often because it was so hot and try and pour cold water on the rash to lessen the pain, much to the chagrin of the instructor. Apart from the fact that I fell asleep in the proning position while guarding a "bridge", consequently failing the entire mission, compounded by the crappy answers I gave in the interview on the last day led me to proudly become a MAN in combat engineers..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>On the whole, not a bad experience although I was dreaming of MacDonalds fried chicken by the end of the field camp. (I don't live in Singapore anymore, do they still sell that stuff?) Nowhere near anything as bad as the things I would experience later on in unit days.<br><br>But that's another story.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BMT field camp... I still cannot imagine I clocked 7 days of enduring continuous inhumane treatment out in the field.<br><br>I still remembered how on the day we set out, we did around 3 sets of 20 push ups, because we were slow to pick up our field packs. We also did 2 sets at the harbouring site on day one, because some of us blur recruits couldn't get the basha up within 10 minutes, and had to take them down. 2 more for not falling in FBO within 10 minutes of dismantling basha. 3 more sets for not building it back up within 10 minutes, 1 more for not falling back in FBO within 10 minutes, 1 more set for not managing to display everything inside the field pack properly, 1 more for not shoving everything back in within 1 minute.<br><br>And that was day one. But it was fun, especially when the instructors did a demonstration on field discipline. One of the officers was like puffing very hard on his cigarette, trying to show us how easily smoke is detected outfield. He emerged from the foilage rather red faced...<br><br>Reclaimed land was one of the worse places, and the second last day of the camp. Dug a shellscrape and firetrench in one day, all with a naggy sergeant on my back, then endured countless rifle jumping jacks because we couldn't finish the shellscrape and firetrench. I took 10 hours to dig my shellscrape, and got "personal attention". Then I got too shacked and fell asleep after RO without hugging my rifle. Woke up at 3 am to find it missing, went to the training shack to find it, but did not have the guts to stun it right from under the duty sergeant's nose. Woke him up, got a huge dressing down for "sneaking up" on him (is that why they picked me to be a scout?), got rifle back, went to sleep. 2 hours later, got turned out with thunderflashes, had to put everything inside field pack, cover up shellscrape, then fall in within 15 minutes.<br><br>Fell in, and whole company got pumped for being late. Then got pumped because shellscrape was not filled in properly. Given another 15 minutes to cover shellscrape properly. Got pumped again, because somebody buried his ET stick. 15 minutes for whole company to find ET stick. Got pumped again, instructor found combat rations half buried inside shellscrape. Then we settled down for breakfast at 7 am.<br><br>The funny thing was, amidst all that tekanning, we had some welfare. Cold syrup drinks, cooked out rations, and all that. Totally awesome.<br><br>Field camp is the time where you really learn how much mental stress your mind can take, and the true faces of your section commanders. You will also discover who your true friends are.<br><br>Be prepared for tons of unreasonable requests and be punished for not meeting them. If you are good enough, sneak in some stuff in your underwear (at your own risk, but chances are they won't check your underwear), or ask for permission to go back to bunk to bring some stuff you "conveniently forgot" after field pack inspection. If your sergeant is a kind soul, he might carry some civilian comforts for you...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>during my very wet field camp, on the 5th or 6th day, we began digging our selfscrapes and fire trench. we started digging after dinner at around 1900/2000HRS. the worst part is it rained for the past 2 days, the ground was so muddy it was very hard to dig since mud is heavier than soil because of the water inside. we wasn't allowed to use our flash lights, only candles is allowed. but candles burn out very fast so for most of the night we were digging in total darkness.<br><br>the fire trench is the hardest part. as expected, many of us couldn't finish digging so we were finally allowed to sleep at round 0200HRS. sad thing is, we have to <strong>sleep in the muddy selfscrape! yes i repeat, sleep in the muddy selfscrape!</strong> we were ordered not to cover our selfscrape with ground sheets. as we were so tired, we couldn't care less, we lan lan crawl into the cold muddy selfscrape and slept. well, that's not all, sleeping halfway, it rained in the middle of the night! it was shivering cold. everyone's selfscrapes became flooded!<br><br>everyone's mood hit a all time low. many just stand there in the rain staring at the ground. it's was that demoralizing.</div>
