              <p>Signals is probably the least physically taxing combat vocation which is why they can even take in PES Cs.The only way you are going to get out of it is if you downgrade to C9L9 and below as L9 would mean that you are not eligible to go outfield at all but signaller vocation still requires a fair amount of outfield.</p>
              <p>Don't worry too much,life as a signaller at the Brigade/Div level tend to be more relaxing then at the battalion level but that is not always the case.I'm not too sure about the unit but if I were to make an educated guess,I would say that you will likely end up manning the comm store with your PES.Are you IC1 or 2?</p>
              <p>Take comfort in the fact that you do not have to do SOC and IPPT while those PES A and B signaller still have to do it yearly<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>Ppl who ask abt stayin stayout super common lah. Ask yourself whether you would have ask if you had gotten an unknown vocation. Curiousity is normal.</p>

              <p>thanks for all the replies. and yes i have intent of leaving and i will go and see a specialist about this. well, you may not understand why i would want to stay out. i have 1 year left and for the past 6 months plus, ive been working in an office environment; 8 to 5. </p>
              <p>also, because of my past experience with staying in camp, im honestly quite traumatised. you may say that its a form of escapism and perhaps, a very negative and relenting attitude that i portray, but if you were in my position - i just fear even having the thought of staying in. </p>
              <p>its just so mortifying for me.</p>
              <p>anyway, do you guys know anything about hq 3 sib? i heard from my friends, its quite bad. But im still doubtful. Please enlighten me.</p>

              <p>See specialist also i doubt you can revocate. PES C you not the only 1 who go signaller so just accept that fact and grow up. Everyone face problems and running away won't help. If you choose to runaway from everything, you will be really living a pathetic life.</p>
