It also indicates its will to set the pace and be the testbed for the SAF to conceive and refine land operations system.<br><br>3 Div promises to do its utmost in all its undertakings, to succeed even when success is only remotely possible and to reach beyond all limits. The division is not only capable, but is continually striving towards more challenging realms, to plan, prepare and train to the highest level possible. 3rd Singapore Division was formed as the first Combined Arms Division in the SAF on 21 Mar 1991. This means that the division infantry elements are integrated with the various support arms. Under this arrangement, 3 Div became the Army's principal testbed for the development of new operational concepts, doctrines and tactics for land battles, as well as a ready force to deal with unexpected peacetime contingencies.<br><br>When crises strike, 3 Div is always ready to respond to the call of duty helping out with occasions like the Hotel New World Disaster and floods that plagued Singapore in the late 70s.<br><br>3 Division is currently located in Jurong Camp.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/army/3div_index.htm" rel="nofollow">Click here to learn more about the Tigers</a></strong></div>

The NSmen in 6 Div proved that they can be on par with their active counterparts in fitness, combat skills and tactics, as they now train and operate together with Full-time National Servicemen and regulars as one effective force.<br><br>The concept of a Division Family System was also implemented. National Service has now become a continuous process as the soldiers who complete their NSF training may be transferred into an NS Brigade within the same Division. The system not only provides continuity in training, but also promotes a greater sense of identity and esprit de corps within each Division. On 3 Apr 2000, HQ 6 Div moved to its new location in Nee Soon Camp.
