They are expected to succeed on missions where others cannot.<br><br>Commandos are the raid specialists in the army. They strike mostly under the cover of darkness and employ various means to get to their target undetected. They are thus adept at infiltrating enemy territory using airborne raids, helicopter assaults or sea landings. All Commandos learn the use of assault boats and other light vessels for stealthy infiltration into enemy territory. Commandos will usually operate at small unit level, to carry out raids on important targets.<br><br>Travelling by boat allows silent entry and exit to and from enemy territory, thus lessening the chances of detection. Reconnaissance (or recce) operations are something the Commandos can do much well than the average soldier. Such operations demand high combat fitness, stamina, drive and mental agility and push them to their limits.<br><br>Commandos on recce patrol avoid contact with enemy forces but are expected to observe and report enemy activities and terrain information until their mission is accomplished. As such, the Commandos are adept at living off the land. Commandos can also sabotage enemy installations and are thus well trained in various skills like demolition, signals, and medical aid. Most Commandos are usually cross-trained in various skills and arms used so that they can take over each other's functions if necessary.<br><br>Commandos undergo demanding mental and physical training to attain top combat fitness, exceptional leadership skills, unbreakable mental strength, lightning reflexes, and razor-sharp intelligence.<br><br>As part of an elite fighting force, and in recognition of your exceptional qualities, the Commandos wear the prestigious red beret and carry the coveted stiletto as symbols of honour.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/army/cdo_index.htm" rel="nofollow">Click here to learn more about the men of the Red Berets</a></strong></div>

The specialised skills that Guardsmen possess are vital to the SAF as they add a new dimension to the modern battlefield.<br><br>To achieve such high standards is not without blood, sweat and tears. The men are put through some of the most rigorous training. To be worthy of adorning the much sought-after 'Guards' shoulder tab and the Khaki beret, trainees have to go through the gruelling 'Guards Officers Conversion Course' for officers and 'Guards Specialist Conversion Course' for Specialists.

Just as the human body requires a continuous blood flow to every part of the body, any failure or choke in achieving that will cause parts of the body to feel numb and break down. Similarly, the Logistics arm of the Army seamlessly delivers material as needed to sustain the ArmyÂ’s effort, harnessing state-of-the-art technology in this area. The timely delivery of Integrated Logistics Support, to the forces in the battle field, across land, sea and air, will be a key to the success of the ArmyÂ’s mission.<br><br>Army Logistics will allow the Army to transit from peacetime to war footing seamlessly and in the shortest possible time. Through greater assets visibility, they can deliver the right material that is critically needed by the combat forces at the right time and right place. Army Logistics will be able to optimise all available delivery systems to deliver the 'punch' Â– The Combat Multiplier effect.<br><br>Without Logistics Specialists, our Army would not be able to function as an efficient and cohesive force.<br><br>Supplies would be cut off. Information would be lost. Electronic systems would fail. This could mean our Army having to face the enemy unprepared-no food, no transport, no firepowerÂ…<br><br>That's why we depend on the Logistic arm to ensure that these scenarios never occur. They see to it that our Army is well managed and support our Army's most important assets - our people.<br><br>The Army Logistics is made up of HQ Supply &amp; Transport (HQ S&amp;T) and HQ Maintenance and Engineering Support (HQ MES).<br><br><strong>HQ Supply &amp; Transport (HQ S &amp; T)</strong><br><img src="http://tinypic.com/f49jb"><br><br>The primary role of HQ S&amp;T is to plan, command and provide the Supply and Transport support to the Army during peacetime, transition to war and during wartime. HQ S&amp;T is to act as Senior Specialist Staff Officer (SSSO) HQ as well as Vocational Advisory Authority (VAA) for Supply &amp; Transport Vocationalists in the Army.<br><br><strong>HQ Maintenance and Engineering Support (HQ MES)</strong><br><img src="http://tinypic.com/f49j6"><br><br>The primary role of the Maintenance and Engineering Support Formation is to monitor and control the available maintenance resources within the Army and facilitate optimal utilisation of these resources on the maintenance of all vehicles, weapons and electronics systems in the Army. It also ensures that equipment are repaired as quickly as possible with the available maintenance resources and achieves this through establishing the appropriate maintenance policies and by constantly applying information technology (IT) and system engineering.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/army/log_index.htm" rel="nofollow">Click here to learn more about the Army Logictic</a></strong></div>
