            <div class='col-md body'>There's 2 MWO coxswain in RSN. MWO Ibrahim and MWO Hussein. MWO Hussein, i think, have duly retired. They were the first few Malays who helped to bring Naval Education to future Naval Officers. Initially, starting out as a MIDShipman Course Commander. Now, i doubt there are other full blooded Malays in the Navy besides those two.<br><br>Airforce, there are 2 pilots. One of them being, LTC Zakir (should be..think he got promoted). He pilots the KC over at CAB. One of them is a MAJ Noor, who used to fly but now works in HAL's office. Only a handful of Malay Specialists/Officers serving at RSAF but only at staff appointment levels.<br><br>Commandos... Quite a few old soldiers were Malay Commandos. Now, they should be at the WO level liaoz. Known a few commando Malay Enciks who i think have a few years left in the army. Mostly, they were from Lakiun Jungle Survival Training Camp.<br><br></div>

If the policy makers were afraid that the Malays here could be potential troublemakers, or traitors, or won't be loyal to Singapore, what makes them think that sending them to the Police/CDF Won't make these people potential troublemakers too, if they decide 2 align themselves with their muslim brothers, in the event of war against Indonesia/Malaysia or any other muslim country?<br><br>Let's not kid ourselves that our society is still as harmonious as ever.

            <div class='col-md body'>Perspective changes when one is outside and inside the loop. From an enlistee's perspective (Me perspective), yes, it might be unfair to barred ppl from entering certain services based on pre-requistes.<br><br>However, from a commander's perspective (We perspective, here refers to higher ups in the Military). It may be necessary, if there is a uncertain factor on the ground that MAY change the situation. Do you<br>a.) Remove that uncertain factor.<br>b.) Or allow the factor to exist and take the risks involved.<br>And from wat I know, all militaries are out to win a war and not lose it, so do you choose (a) or (b). The choice is obvious.<br><br>Of course, the current situation is unfair. However, that doesn't mean it will forever stay that way, so it will be a matter of time where the uncertain factor no longer applies and we already seeing it more and more nowadays as Singapore become more integrated.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

In the interests of national defence, we close an eye to a ''necessary evil" that contributes to the degradation of social intergration? Seeing as how Singapore is nowhere near to being a homogenous society but a rojak-like fusion of different peoples, I would say in the big picture, this is the larger evil. All Singaporean males undergo National Service and will be witness to this discrimination, therefore making this, ultimately, detrimental to national interests.<br><br>So the people in the ivory towers want Singaporeans to stand up and fight should the need arises. The question I pose to them is why should the Malays fight for a state that sidelines them, that holds the view that they might be potential backstabbers out in the field? The "tactical" basis for this discrimination does not justify it much because of the ultimate cost to the fabric of society.<br><br>Furthermore, I do not see any forseeable conflict with the neighbours up north till 2061 when the current water agreement expires. By that time, many of you here will dead or far too old to be called up back to camp. Face reality. It is sheer stupidity to go to war with the Malaysians. Many Singaporean armchair generals sit back and talk tough, perenially comparing the military capabilities of our two nations in tones that would sound as if the current bilateral situation is as tension gripping as the one hanging over the Straits of Taiwan. It is not. The most serious spat between us right now in recent years is over Pedra Blanca, a rock with nothing on it save for a lighthouse and seagulls' droppings. Our past differences such being cheated out of the Common Market and subsequently being kicked out Malaya, are in today's context far too trivial and irrelevant to go to war with. We have too much in common with them in culture etc food or style of speech and many other such shared grounds.<br><br>I would not feel any better shooting a Malaysian Chinese over a Malaysian Malay, would not feel any better shooting a Malaysian Hindu over a Malaysian Muslim. Nor would any of my Chinese, Malay and Indian friends. If you think differently, then I would go as far as saying go get your passport and get the hell out of here, Singapore has no such place for racial bigots and that you sir, are an ***hole of the first degree. If you have friends who would be more at ease having someone of a different race in the iron sights of his rifle, then you are mixing with the wrong crowd.<br><br>This is just one of the small things that make Singapore a f***ed up island to reside on. Such unhappiness with discriminatory policies against locals, this time a specific section of the citizentry, will little by little accumulate and coagulate with all the major issues we have with our ruling government.<br><br>Perhaps when the time really comes for us to call up arms, we should just hand that SAR-21 over to the nearest Bangla on his way to work. Or raise a few divisions of Gurkhas to fight our battles.<br><br>Racial harmony. Embrace it. Cheers to all Ah Bengs, Mats and Thambis reading my post.<br><br>I know my post carries over bitter sentiments laced in candid statements, for that I apologize in advance.</div>

Secondly, it raises the question of what our intelligence services are doing? Anyone can be a threat to military operations in times of war, regardless of race or religion.<br><br>Have we placed ease of policy implementation on the top of the pedestal over the over-arching need to build inclusiveness?<br><br>I'm playing devil's advocate but I feel that he who fights, is not necessarily determined by his race not ethnic ties in an absolute sense.</div>
