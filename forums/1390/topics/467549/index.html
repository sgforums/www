            <div class='col-md body'><p>Good evening<br><br>Heightened Security Environment and Measures Taken<br><br>While Singapore has enjoyed many years of peace and tranquility, we cannot take our security for granted. We have a duty to safeguard the safety and security enjoyed by everyone. Our security agencies have already stepped up vigilance and enhanced our security measures. We cannot afford to slacken our vigilance, as just one successful terrorist attack can be disastrous. Look at what happened in Spain recently.<br><br>KINS Units - Protecting Our Homeland<br><br>2 Our enhanced security measures include the tightening of border control and stepped up protection of key installations. In these two areas, the contributions of the Police National Service Key Installation Protection (KINS) Units have been critical. Deployed to enhance the security of key installations, such as those at checkpoints and oil refineries, since Oct 2001, members of the KINS Unit, like all of you here, were mobilised because you have the required specialised skills and expertise.<br><br>3 Since the formation of its first troop in 1994, the development of KINS units has achieved several milestones.<br><br>4 Firstly, the Police National Service Department (PNSD) underwent a re-organisation on 1 Nov 2003. PNSD now takes on the centralised command and control, training, and administration of KINS units, in addition to its NS human resource management portfolio, to focus on building its expertise on the protection of key installations. This centralisation under the PNSD will ensure that the KINS units are commanded by officers who know the men well. I understand that PNSD aims to put our KINS units on the world map to gain international recognition as experts on facility protection. I look forward to that day.<br><br>5 Secondly, the inaugural Open Mobilisation Exercise for PNSmen was conducted on 21 Feb 2004 when four KINS units were mobilised through radio and TV. This exercise was an overwhelming success, with a 100 per cent response rate within slightly over four hours. Clearly, adopting an open mobilisation system, in addition to our silent one, will enhance our operational readiness capabilities in dealing with emergencies.<br><br>6 Lastly, the new Police KINS Training Camp (PKTC), located at the junction of Clementi Road and Ulu Pandan Road, will be operational next month. Equipped with enhanced training facilities, the camp will be used to train all KINS officers.<br><br>Recognising KINS' Contributions<br><br>7 This evening's appreciation dinner has been specially arranged to recognise the commitment and effort put in by all of you - our KINS officers. Thank you for your effort and sacrifices.<br><br>8 Let us not forget your employers. They too, play a crucial role in supporting your commitment to national security. We are fortunate that many employers today understand the importance of National Service and have adapted to the inconvenience. Despite the tough economic times, they have displayed unwavering support.<br><br>9 Equally important are your families and loved ones. I am sure that their support and encouragement have made it easier for you to fully commit yourselves to fulfill your duties to the country.<br><br>10 Once again, let me extend my sincerest thanks to all of you, your employers as well as your families. I hope you enjoy this dinner tonight.<br><br>Thank you.</p></div>
