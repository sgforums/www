            <div class='col-md body'>Taken from the Istana's website http://www.istana.gov.sg/guard.html:<br><br>The Istana Ceremonial Guards' main role is sentry duty at the Istana Main Entrance on Orchard Road and at the entrance of the Istana Building.<br><img src="http://www.istana.gov.sg/jpeg/main-gate-l.jpg"><br>The average age of these Guards is 19. One Unit of 20 guards from Singapore Armed Forces Provost Unit (SAFPU) would perform duties in the Istana for one month before another unit takes over. The take-over by a new unit is signified by the Changing of Guards Ceremony.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Changing of Guard Ceremony </span><br>When the late Encik Yusof Bin Ishak took office as the Yang Di-Pertuan Negara at the Istana on 3rd December 1959, the Istana was guarded by combat troops from the only infantry regiment we had at that time, the 1st Battalion of the Singapore Infantry Regiment. The guards were posted round the clock. There was no Changing of Guards Ceremony. Mounting and dismounting of guards were done within the Istana itself.<br><img src="http://www.istana.gov.sg/jpeg/guard1-l.jpg"><br>The use of combat troops to guard the Istana ceased in 1968 with the formation of the Singapore Armed Forces Guards Unit (SAFGU). In 1969, it was decided that a Changing of Guards Ceremony be <span style="color: red;">held on every first Sunday evening of the month</span>. The Ceremony was held in 1969 and has continued ever since.<br><br>The format of the Ceremony is based on the British Changing of Guards Ceremony at Buckingham Palace, England. Thirty-six Guards and two Guard Commanders are involved in the Ceremony. The Guards, are specially selected and trained for their turnout, bearing and drill.<br><img src="http://www.istana.gov.sg/jpeg/guard2-l.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.istana.gov.sg/jpeg/guard3-l.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.istana.gov.sg/jpeg/guard4-l.jpg"><br>The in-coming Guards march from the Yan San Building to meet the out-going Guards at the main entrance of the Istana. The Changing of the Guards Ceremony is then carried out at the entrance of the Istana with military bands in attendance. Included in the ceremony is a Rifle Precision Drill Performance to entertain the spectators.<br></div>

This article appeared in the New Paper in January this year.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guarding the royals 'a unique pain'</span><br>From correspondents in London</strong><br><br>GUARDING Buckingham Palace is one of the worst jobs in the British army, according to the guards' commanding officer.<br><br>A letter from Major General Sebastian Roberts says soldiers posted at the gates of the impressive royal residence suffer a "very onerous and repetitive" job that "constitutes real and unique pain".<br>The complaint from Maj-Gen Roberts, head of the Household Division, was reported by Britain's Sunday Telegraph today.<br><br>He told the army director of infantry, Brigadeer Jamie Balfour, that service in the Household Division was an "honour and a privilege".<br><br>But he added: "It must be recognised that MT 2-5 is a debilitating routine task."<br><br>MT 2-5 is short for Military Task 2-5, the code for the job that includes guarding royal palaces and other public and ceremonial duties.<br><br>Maj-Gen Roberts said: "The challenge within MT 2-5 for recruiting, retention and maintaining operation capability is enormous. The task constitutes real and unique pain."<br><br>Roberts said the number of soldiers from one regiment seeking to leave duty early had risen 50 per cent since they were assigned to some royal guard duties.<br><br>The vision of Britain's soldiers in their red-coated uniforms took a lot more work than it seemed, the paper said, since they spent hours each day cleaning and pressing their uniforms and polishing their boots.<br><br>The romance of the job, Maj-Gen Roberts said, wore thin quickly, especially after a few days living in the "atrocious" Victorian barracks at the Tower of London.<br><br>"The fun aspect of the job evaporates after the first week. It's not what soldiers join the army to do. It requires a very high level of personal discipline but that's about it. It requires no intelligence, zeal, athleticism or initiative."</span><br><br></div>
