(i think cock up in the S1 or what) he knows what the man go through and also see quite a lot of f**k officers before he go for OCS. before that i told him to be a good officer and not like those in my unit.<br><br>10 month later, i got invited by him to his commissioning parade and he is the parade commander and also gotten his sword of honour. he is still very good to us like before. not like some people who like to use rank. a nice guy but too bad did not come to my unit.</div>
