              <p>Hello guys.. im asking a DECENT question regarding the checkup.</p>
              <p>No jokes and no kidding..</p>
              <p>As we all noe, there is a station which requires all guys to strip and be half-naked throughout in a room.</p>
              <p>So my qn is, regardless u are gay or straight, do u have a tendency to steam when u see a whole bunch of half naked guys in the room? And what happens if u really do steam and when during the checkup, the MO see ur **** steaming?</p>
              <p>I noe this question is a bit g@y. But thats not the point.. my point is i really want to know what is the outcome of this and whether anybody had this tendency before.</p>
              <p>Before u are gg to say.. "Only g@ys will have the tendency.. BUT.. there can be cases whereby even straight guys might have it.. it might be just the sudden rush of adrenaline or hormones so lets not just pin-point it to the g@ys. "</p>
              <p>I really hope u all can treat this question with the utmost respect and frankness.. Just be open..</p>
              <p>And mods, pls dun lock this topic.. but rather, let this topic be known and open to those who might want to noe..</p>
              <p>Thanks :)</p>

              <p>U guys change my topic again! Why make it sound so g@yish when it does not have anything related to g@y?</p>
              <p><strong>Original topic: DECENT question regarding checkup</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Modified topic: Declare g@y during Checkup</span></strong></p>
              <p>Must u really go to the extent of emphasizing the word g@y so that more forumers would come here to take a look at it??</p>
              <p>Im seriously annoyed by how u mods judge a topic..</p>
              <p>Do u judge a topic by <strong>ITS CONTENT</strong> or do u judge it by the word <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">G@Y</span></strong>? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"></p>

              <p><em>from: </em><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.letstalkaboutsex.sg/men/sexuality_1.asp"><em>http://www.letstalkaboutsex.sg/men/sexuality_1.asp</em></a></p>
              <h3><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Do You Really Prefer Guys or are You Just Different?</span></span></strong></h3>
              <p>There is no easy way to say it, so here goes. No one really knows - except you.</p>
              <p>OK, so you would rather be chatting with your male friends. The girls that the other guys are drooling over do not appear on your radar. Or maybe the girl friends you have love your great tastes in trends and fashion. (I remember <em>all</em> my female classmates asking me to go shopping with them.)</p>
              <p>A sensitive new age guy, metrosexual, gay? It is never so simple, is it? Look, for all the fashionista or culture vulture you may be, it does not mean you swing one way or the other just like that. Whether you like sweat or cologne (or both), just don't rush into conclusions when it comes to your sexuality.</p>
              <p>Lots of smart people debate and research into it. Yet, it is hard to say for certain what makes an individual gay. Some argue for environmental factors, while others believe genetic factors determine our sexual preferences.</p>
              <p>No matter what the origin or attributes, one thing is clear - whether you are gay or not is something that you will have to carefully determine for yourself. It is your life after all.</p>
              <h4>Is it love I'm feeling?</h4>
              <p>Here are some facts. As you mature, you naturally develop as a person, and so do your sexual preferences. Throughout your life, it's quite natural to have role models. Because you admire them, you would also feel strong attachments and identify with specific groups or individuals.</p>
              <p>This can be your close friend from school whom you hang out with all the time. Or it can be that good guy from the office you can knock back a few beers with, and talk about anything. As a matter of fact, lots of us have army buddies who went through crazy times with us and are still our best friends.</p>
              <p>You can all share similar interests and tastes in movies, fashion and other leisure activities. You thoroughly enjoy one another's company and often feel a sense of loss without each other around. But what if you've developed strong feelings for any of these male figures?<br><br>We all tend to develop an attachment to people who understand us, who encourage us when we're down, and who care about us. Don't be surprised if you find yourself feeling strong emotions such as:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Admiration </li>
              <li>Respect </li>
              <li>Infatuation </li>
              <li>Idolisation </li>
              </ul>
              <p>But is it love?</p>
              <h4>Help in the name of love</h4>
              <p>While some emotions may give you butterflies in the stomach and make you giddy with excitement, they may not imply sexual attraction. Give yourself enough time to ascertain the emotions you are feeling. Regardless of sexual inclinations, crushes may not lead to true love - however old - fashioned this may sound. And it applies to <em>all</em> people.</p>
              <p>It is also possible that other factors such as family, stress or peer pressure may be influencing your emotions. It always helps to talk to someone knowledgeable and sensitive about your feelings. Don't repress your emotions. Talk is good in most cases.</p>
              <p>Is there someone at home you can confide in? You may be surprised that the best people who can help you are the ones you are looking at every day. If there is no one close you can turn to, help is available from experienced and professional folks.</p>

              </ul>
              <p>Try these people, they are good.</p>
              <h4>Relax, don't do it?</h4>
              <p>Here's a dose of reality, like it or not. Homosexuality is still officially illegal in Singapore. Those caught engaging in homosexual activities can be arrested. OK, no one is going to come barging into your bedroom, but let's be sensible and responsible for ourselves.</p>
              <p>Many in Singapore prefer a neutral stand. Don't ask, don't tell seems to be the order of the day. The truth is more people are realising that being gay does not make a person any less a part of our community.</p>
              <p>People in homosexual relationships are subject to the same feelings of happiness, belonging, hurt and rejection. Even the government has openly accepted gays in the civil service. To cut to the chase, everyone in Singapore has equally important roles to play in our society and economy.</p>
              <h4>Use your big head and play it safe</h4>
              <p><em>Gay or not, it is safe sex or no sex.</em> When it comes to sexual health, homosexual couples, as with heterosexual couples, should practice sexual prudence. While it is natural to be curious about your sexuality, it is important to be wary of major sexually transmitted infections such as:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>AIDS </li>
              <li>Herpes </li>
              <li>Gonorrhoea </li>
              <li>Syphilis </li>
              </ul>
              <p>No matter what your sexual orientation, always ensure that you are protected. Exposing yourself to unnecessary health risks through casual sex is not cool. It's a much better idea to take good care of yourself.</p>
              <h4>You do not have to walk alone</h4>
              <p>So, what's it all about? Do you swing one way or the other? Is it love or just sexual curiosity? Or are you just different in your own ways?</p>
              <p>Just do yourself a big favour, and take it easy. Talk to people you trust; approach professionals, if you wish. You do not have to walk alone. Enjoy your life.</p>
