              procedures and medical screening before they are scheduled for
              enlistment.</p>
              <p>They will be scheduled for enlistment into the respective
              enlistment intakes based on numerous considerations such as the
              medical &amp; physical fitness and educational qualifications of
              the individual, as well as the manpower and operational
              requirements of the various intakes.</p>
              <p>In general, pre-enlistees from the same 'A' level/International
              Baccalaureate (IB) or polytechnic cohort are enlisted over two
              intakes due to capacity constraints at the NS training schools. For
              example, 'A' level/ IB holders who graduate in Nov/Dec are
              typically enlisted in the Dec and Mar quarterly intakes.
              Polytechnic diploma holders who graduate in Mar/Apr are typically
              enlisted in the Jun and Sep quarterly intakes. ITE certificate
              holders and pre-enlistees with other qualifications are enlisted
              throughout the year.</p>
              <p>Pre-enlistees can only be assigned to an enlistment intake after
              being certified medically fit for enlistment at the pre-enlistment
              medical screening. Pre-enlistees will receive Enlistment Notices to

              <p>There are 2 important notices you'll receive from <abbr title="Central Manpower Base">CMPB</abbr>, these are listed below:<br> <br> <strong>Registration notice</strong>: you'll get this notice when
              you reach 17½ years old. It will inform you to do your NS
              registration.</p>

              you about 2 months before the Date of Enlistment (<abbr title="Date of Enlistment">DOE</abbr>).</p>
              <p>The objective of these tests is to ascertain your medical
              condition and accord you a suitable Physical Employment Status
              (PES). Based on your PES, you will be assigned to a suitable
              vocation.</p>
              <p>Here are the various PES gradings:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>PES A</strong>: Fit for all combat vocations</li>
              <li><strong>PES B1</strong>: Fit for most combat vocations</li>

              </ul>
              <p>Note that if you are given a <abbr title="Physical Employment Status">PES</abbr> D grading, it means that

              This normally takes about 2-3 months. However, this duration may be
              longer depending on your medical condition.</p>

              BMT</span></strong><br> This 9-week programme trains combat-fit recruits in the basic
              military skills to prepare them for advanced vocational training.
              The programme includes weapon training with the SAR 21 rifle which
              will teach recruits technical handling and marksmanship skills; a
              Battle Inoculation Course that simulates a real battlefield; a
              Field Camp which develops basic survival skills; progressive
              training to complete a 24-km route march which builds combat
              fitness and endurance; and hand grenade training.<br> <em><span style="font: inherit;">For those who fail to achieve the
              NAPFA test silver award, they are required to undergo an 8-week

              BMT</span></strong><br> As evidence has shown that obese recruits are able to achieve
              optimum fitness levels and weight loss in about 19 weeks, the new
              BMT programme for recruits with Body Mass Index (BMI) scores
              exceeding 27.0 will be 19 weeks. This BMT programme is designed to
              help obese recruits improve their physical fitness progressively
              while equipping them with basic soldiering skills and
              knowledge.</p>

              BMT</span></strong><br> Enlistees who were PES C1 previously underwent a 7-week BMT
              programme. The new 9-week PES B2 BMT programme will be conducted
              for recruits who are medically fit for deployment in selected
              combat and combat support vocations, such as signal operators,
              combat medics and naval system operators. These recruits will be
              given a new medical classification of PES B2, in place of the
              existing PES C1 classification. This is to ensure that the medical
              classification of our soldiers is consistent with their deployment.
              The new 9-week programme will include customised physical training,
              as well as basic combat training to prepare them for their combat
              and combat support roles.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES C
              BMT</span></strong><br> The 9-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES C recruits. This
              programme will include light physical training and vocational
              training to prepare them for combat service support vocations, such
              as service medic, and those related to logistics and
              administration.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font: inherit;">PES E
              BMT</span></strong><br> The 4-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES E recruits. This
              programme will focus on, vocational training as well as National
              Education, SAF core values, regimentation and discipline to prepare
              recruits for combat service support vocations.</p>
