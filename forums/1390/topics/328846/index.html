              End up i have to call up this n that to settle the bo liao unwanted problem.
              
              As my birthday is nearing..i highlight to the person i need to book my ippt asap. they told me not to worry.
              
              After wasting my precious time etc..manage to 'settle' the problem.
              
              I was told to go back for RT and they even help me to book n schedule my Rt.
              
              I told them how abt my ippt? they say NEVERMIND! jus go back for rt.
              
              After 1 mth of RT, i received a letter saying to charge me as i nv went back for Ippt/Rt...
              
              WTF?

              i am not that worried abt what going to happen..cos 
              
              first the most is fine.if i not wrong.
              
              2nd i m NOT in the fault at all.
              
              Prob is i v fedup with them.
              why i need to go thru the trouble to do all this shit when they are the one who cock up.
              
              Obviously they nv inform or update their respective dept n they jus charge u for no reason.

              <p>basically all saf department were extremely busy. And probably they had forgotten abt ur application for ippt/rt. as u know, humans tend to forget things if work gets into their ways.</p>

              <p>I'm also studying full-time.</p>
              <p>Then out of the blue a few weeks ago, I got a letter ordering me to clear my IPPT or I will be liable for RT.</p>
              <p>My chin-ups and SBJ are shot; no way in hell can I pass them with my own training.So...... boh pian.... I signed up for IPT. Luckily my current window closes in June next year.... still got time to do it.</p>
              <p>The way I see it, might as well go for 8x IPT than risk 20x RT sessons. In fact, it's only seven sessions; the 8th session is the actual IPPT (which we all must take anyway). I've already cleared two sessions; six more to go.</p>
              <p>It sucks that they changed the ruling.... but what to do? Gotta make the best of things.</p>
