Hence, I was very surprised when I was informed of the cancellation.<br><br>I called up Human Resource Centre and my unit. It took them approximately seven hours to confirm that I was not required to do ICT.<br><br>I have always believed that every NSman should do his part for the country. Hence, even though I had just started working for a new company, I decided not to apply for a deferment.<br><br>Because of the ICT, I had postponed the renovation of my flat.<br><br>Much personal and family time had also been spent settling administrative matters relating to the ICT.<br><br>NSmen are also civilians with day jobs and other commitments. If our service is not required, Mindef should not send out ICT notices only to cancel them later. This causes much inconvenience.<br><br>Moreover, going for the pre-ICT briefing and inoculation are a waste of our nation's time and resources if, at the end of the day, the ICT is cancelled.<br><br>I would like to stress that I am not against national service. I just want to highlight NSmen's plight.<br><br>Ang Sze Hwee </blockquote></div>
