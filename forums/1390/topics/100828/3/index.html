The webbing was a spartan version (no pouch behind), so I had to go down to Beach Road to buy a patrol bag to hook onto it, to carry the cambat rats &amp; sometimes the spare battery for the PRC-77 set. The other method would be to pack them into the fullpack, &amp; "tompang" your socks &amp; other personal stuff with my officer or other servicemen. As a frequent attached personnel, imagine the ad-hoc negotiations I had to do with unfamiliar infantry peng. Most of the time I had to carry something for them in turn (usually an ammo box).<br><br>I ended up "arming" myself further with a satchel bag as well. Not the saht waterproof stuff that's commercially available, but a cheapo primary-school bag (green, of course) to contain the standard SAF fire-mission forms I must bring along. They didn't even have Ziplocked plastic then, so I had to wrap the forms carefully too.<br><br>Man, some units enforced field discipline to the extent that they conducted stand-by-used-tin cans after R.T.U.!<br></div></blockquote>I always extract the milo pills/ chocolate bar, lemonade and beans from the rest of the packs. I dumped the others as we move. In Lancer, I just drop them down the slopes...muahahahahahahaha. You know, they could have given us canned fruits instead.

I served NS in the mid 80s. Then came back to do reservist in the early 90s. So kind of saw the end of the "old soldier" era and the start of the modern SAF.  There were already "advancements" / increases, in the type and weight of load carried within the 3 /4 years I was away.<br><br>Tin can food was being phased out. I remember humping tin cans  and dark greem packets of stuff, during NS days,  all over the place, whether exercise or field camp.  I also bought one of those school bag type satchels to carry extra food (e.g. Yeo's curry chicken, soya sauce pork and maggi mee).<br><br>Then when I did reservist in the 90s, it was all different. And the mission load went up, to include NVGs, mobile phone for emergency comms ! (yes ... no kidding), batteries and more spare batteries (can start a business here in recycling !) , maps, whatever shit...  But the food and packaging changed, which compensated. Also, my unit was less strict about what food supplement you brought to outfield.... I guess reservist unit is like this.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">from armynewsInteractive</span><br><br><strong><span class="large">The Rationale for our Rations</span></strong><br>7/24/2004<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/armynews/image/issuePic/1_153.jpg"><br><br>They have been called Â“Operations RationsÂ”, Â“Combat RationsÂ” or Â“Field RationsÂ”, but all three terms would conjure up the same image to our veterans of the past - green packets of hard biscuits, stout cans of beans and a brown box plainly labelled Â“jamÂ”. These were the food supplies for soldiers when they went for outfield training, food that could be eaten quickly while still providing the energy needed for a soldier hungry after a gruelling dayÂ’s work.<br><br><strong>1968: WHEN RATIONING BEGAN</strong><br>Rations were first introduced into the Army in 1968, consisting of dehydrated meals and enough to last a soldier a day. It is not documented what exactly the rations were at that time, but reports showed that the soldiers did not generally find the food palatable. Improvements were steadily made and when the revised rations were introduced in 1970, they were reported to receive better acceptance.<br><br><strong>1975: THE WEALTH OF RATIONS</strong><br>Rations had to be eaten fast while soldiers were on the move, and they soon earned the nickname of Â“fast foodÂ”. There were two different types of rations: conventional type Â‘CÂ’ rations and lightweight type Â‘LÂ’ rations meant to be eaten on the go. Furthermore, there were different menus to cater to Muslim and vegetarian diets.<br><br>For all the ration types, the staple was twelve packs of hardtack biscuits that provided 65% of the total energy yield for a soldier. Soldiers found various ways to eat the biscuits - with pineapple jam, or broken into pieces, soaked in lemonade and eaten as porridge. Canned food was the main source of protein, with baked beans, sardines, pork cubes, braised chicken and vegetarian food on the menu. The meals were supplemented by chocolate, sweets and vitamin tablets to round off the nutrition a soldier needed for a day.<br><br><strong>1994: ACQUIRING A LOCAL FLAVOUR</strong><br>1993 saw more research and studies done for a review of combat rations with the rapid advancement in technology and the changing needs of soldiers on the modern battlefield. Feedback from soldiers was also taken into consideration.<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/armynews/image/issuePic/2_153.jpg"><br><br>The main issue was having hardtack biscuits as the staple food, with complaints about the dryness of the biscuits as well as the need to consume a large quantity of biscuits to meet a soldierÂ’s dietary requirement. With the food mostly having to be eaten cold, food items like sardines and baked beans proved unpopular. Added to this was the need to provide a greater quantity and variety of food, based on feedback from soldiers that the daily food supply was insufficient and the menus repetitive.<br><br>The new rations were thus adjusted, and while still small, light and portable, they offered improved nutrition, variety and taste to satisfy soldiers. The menus now catered to an Asian palate with rice as the staple, and also included drinks and a dessert to round off the meal. There was even a supply of solid fuel, matches and tissue paper.<br><br>Today, soldiers can enjoy dishes such as Nonya curry rice and seafood pasta, with red bean or soya peanut dessert, supplemented by energy food bars and instant drink mixes. To continually improve the variety, Singapore Food Industries and HQ Supply &amp; Technology are coming up with new dishes every year while still ensuring adequate taste and nutritional value of the food. Currently, in the works are dhal rice with chicken, oriental seafood noodles and chilli flake glutinous rice.<br><br>Our appetites are whetted!</div>
