The webbing was a spartan version (no pouch behind), so I had to go down to Beach Road to buy a patrol bag to hook onto it, to carry the cambat rats &amp; sometimes the spare battery for the PRC-77 set. The other method would be to pack them into the fullpack, &amp; "tompang" your socks &amp; other personal stuff with my officer or other servicemen. As a frequent attached personnel, imagine the ad-hoc negotiations I had to do with unfamiliar infantry peng. Most of the time I had to carry something for them in turn (usually an ammo box).<br><br>I ended up "arming" myself further with a satchel bag as well. Not the saht waterproof stuff that's commercially available, but a cheapo primary-school bag (green, of course) to contain the standard SAF fire-mission forms I must bring along. They didn't even have Ziplocked plastic then, so I had to wrap the forms carefully too.<br><br>Man, some units enforced field discipline to the extent that they conducted stand-by-used-tin cans after R.T.U.!<br></div>
