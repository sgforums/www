            <div class='col-md body'>Bravo 2 0 is GOOD.. read that when i was in sec 1 or 2.. then there's BHD as  you all know, that one is a classic too. another good book is Task Force Dagger by robin moore; -hell, after reading that book i wanted to go to afghanistan as a merc to hunt down taliban. the book by michael durant (pilot of super 6-4) titled 'in the company of heroes' is quite good too as it tells you what happened to him during his captivity. really compliments BHD. there's one by matt eversmann too but i haven't read that one. but i think the BEST, and i mean really GOOD forever, would have to be Band of Brothers. man that book rocked my socks... just my 2 cents worth.</div>
