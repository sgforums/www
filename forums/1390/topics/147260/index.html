I am speculating....<br><br>It could be because of the "manpower" crunch during the 90s... because of falling birthrates....<br><br>Also during that time there was more emphasis on NSmen being "operationally ready".<br><br>So maybe they decide to cut out one active Gds Bn and then maybe use one NS Gds Bn as the 3rd Bn for the 7th Gds Brigade.<br><br>Initially the different units like 1st, 2nd, 3rd Gds and HQ 7th Brigade are in at least 2-3 seperate location.<br><br>I think there was a move to centralize them.... i think now there are all in Dieppe baracks the ex-home of the kiwi 1st Infantry Bn.<br><br>So i guess during the time where they move the Gd Units, somehow 2nd seems more convenient to disband whereas 1st and 3rd are centralized together with the Brigade HQ.<br></div>
