              <p>Enlisted NS just a month ago. <br><br>Down PES due to my rare skin allergy. <br><br>I've been posted to MES COMD HQ as a SUP ASST GE TRAINEE (aka storeman) with effect from 160413.<br><br>I have not been informed of who to report to. <br>I only got the address of the camp.

              <p>1) <span style="line-height: 1.231;">SA(GE) is a fancy term for storeman - with your skin condition, you might be posted to do clerical work instead</span></p>
              <p>2) MES Command Hq = Maintenance &amp; Engineering Support Formation - As the name tells, they maintain stuffs<span style="line-height: 1.231;">- it is then branched into the many Army Maintenance Bases - So you may have a chance of being posted into 4 of the other AMBs which will then have other sub units that you maybe posted into</span></p>
              <p>3) Most AMBs are Stay Out, so you book out after 1730 / 1600 and book in before a certain time of the day.</p>
              <p>4)KC3 is walking distance from YewTee MRT. Take a cab if you have to - wouldn't cost more than $8.00. </p>
              <p>5)As for SAF issued items, probably not (call again to confirm), yes you may have to rebmt if you have not completed your BMT.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the info!</p>
              <p>My skin allergy is very rare/ special.</p>
              <p>I am allergic to even my own sweat and the heat in Singapore.</p>
              <p>When my body gets too heaty, it will start to become itchy and whenever I perspire and if I don't get a bath, I will be bleeding all over. Sad right?</p>
              <p>How to downgrade PES further? <br><br>Get a very strongly-worded hospital specialist memo?</p>
              <p>Medical report from a very senior consultant in the hospital?</p>
              <p>I hearsay that clerks and storemen are the most best relax vocations in NS already... <br>I heard that almost all the time is simple work, eat, sleep routine...</p>

              <p>Go to your unit and address your concerns to your superiors on the first day when you are there - there will be an interview for new post ins, so you shouldn't worry so much.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">As much as I can type here, your superiors can better advise you and help fit you (in mind of your medical condition) into appropriate roles that you can help to contribute to the unit. </span></p>
              <p>Firstly, go in with an open mind and not worry so much. Try out the job/jobs you are allocated and reflect to your superiors (in a polite manner) if it's too much for you. </p>
              <p>Unit life is really different as compared to BMT life. You will meet with even more kinds of people - i will leave it to you to explore. </p>
              <p>Your superiors are also not as scary previously imagined in tekong - most are approachable, and friendly but always don't go too far or cross the line. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I am taking into assumption that you are currently seeing a specialist - External / Military. You can always reflect how you are feeling to your doctor in your next Medical Appointment.</span></p>
              <p>AMB = Army Maintenance Bases - you will find out more when you are there. </p>
              <p>Most units have something called HLS (Healthy Life Style) - where PES fit will train for ippt and the non ippt eligible will go for walking, static exercises etc. </p>
              <p>In a way, what you said about the roles and responsilbilities are what a storeman does but then again, it's just the pinch of the ice berg. </p>
