For the Course, i had to fork out $100 of my own money(non-refundable).The pioneer badge was made of teens as old as 20, i was the youngest back then (17). In fact most of the pioneer badge for Exercise Lancer have gone thru ns, 1 made it thru commando, another in the police n the rest i've lost touch.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by decepticon25:</div><div class="quote_body">they go Brunei just to see uncontrolled tripflare set-up? By the way how come the tripflare has only one picket and the igniter is on top of the flare cake? neber see b4!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div></blockquote>*Nope we didn't go there to justwatch tripflare or any pyrotechnics, we were there for training.In fact, we didn't even know that we were to go there for jungle training as during the pre-briefing before Lancer, we were told that we would be only visiting and sight seeing Brunei and get in touch with their Brunei Cadet Force(BCF).About the Alarm mine that you all see, that's the one we learn to set up and disarm from RBAF personels.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by quivalen:</div><div class="quote_body">so what exactly did you guys do? i notice a bruneian uniform in the tripflare picture and the bruneian chopper so i assume you guys did your training under the RBAF? care to tell us more?</div></blockquote>*Here's a list of what we did for the 10/11 days:<br>1)We depart from CIA via SAF SIA chartered flight.My NCC was placed under<br>Packet 9(Those who went thru JCC, (Commandos,OCT's &amp; regulars will know<br>about this).When we arrive at BIA, NCC was transfered 1st to Transit Camp<br>(Jalan Aman Camp) while SAF personels were sent sumwhere else,i Don't<br>know.<br><br>2)From Transit(Jalan Aman Camp), we were den send to Lakiun Camp. For the<br>first 3 days there, we joined SAF personels for Pre-Jungle Training made of<br>Pacing exercise,Casevac Briefing and stuff,Navigation Exercise(the 5<br>checkpoints,the last one dat i took was hard approximately 1 click(1km) from<br>the 4th checkpoint),heli planning &amp; deplanning drills,small animal &amp; birds<br>&amp; bird traps,basic knowledge on jungle plants(datz where i know CB leaf)<br>,pyrotechnics practise(smoke grenade,pen flare and stuffs), visited<br>Mount Biang(the locals don't refer to it as Mount But instead as "Hill",Had to<br>go thru practical and demo in the mock up SAF "Jungle Village"before we<br>were certified ok to go for actual jungle training. Oh ya our Instructor was<br>JCC Training Cadre, Commando CPT Brandon.A lot of stuffs i forgot, sorry.<br><br>3)On the 4th day,we were transfered from SAF Lakiun Camp to RBAF's<br>Penanjong Camp and later in the afternoon To RBAF's Bangar Camp. At<br>Bangar we got in touch with the BCF &amp; RBAF<br><br>4)Next day we were heli-lift with RBAF's Blackhawk to Landing Point,LP311<br>which was located in Kg. meriam, 7km plus in temburong jungle itself. We<br>were escorted by JCC training cadre, CPT Brandon from Commando, SSG Izil<br>from Guards and RBAF's Officers,Wo's,Specs &amp; OCT,Ranger. Down there we<br>had actual practise of wat we have learnt from SAF plus new stuffs taught<br>to us by RBAF's jungle training cadre. We had Night Navex, actual practical(<br>make traps, shelter, plants identification and try out (we dig out wild<br>tongkat ali also), tactical &amp; non tactical jungle movement, learnt how to<br>obtain water), jungle shooting using RBAF's M-16 A2 if im not mistaken with<br>a couple of magazines of 20 live rounds each, Casualty evacuation exercise<br>(CASEVAC),pyrotechnics demo &amp; practical from RBAF's inventory. We were<br>also issued with some SAF's MRE's. On the last day we did area cleaning and<br>trekked out tactically of the jungle with our over 30+ kg load &amp; issued<br>weapon. The trek was 7 click(7km) where we had to go thru 7 small hills<br>which was higher then bukit timah and crossed 2 river before we reach<br>back civillisation.<br><br>5)The final 1 &amp; half days we spent our time for R&amp;R where we went to<br>Jerudong Theme park, Water Village, museums &amp; short shopping trip.<br><br>Basically that's all that i can remember for now on the training that i went thru.

Im the only 1 left now to complete my ns in the pioneer team that was sent by NCC. The oldest in the team was 20 &amp; i was 17, the youngest in the team of 10 back in June 2003.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kwlee:</div><div class="quote_body">all guys go to NS eventually so...<br><br>y are they doing this...<br><br>i wonder...</div></blockquote>*Yep true. Well the organisation have been changing a lot of times within a short period of time.It seems that the NCC training plan seem to focus on more fun &amp; learning for the younger cadets(sec 1 to 3) while seniors(sec 4 to ITE,JC,MI,Poly) are more open to adventure training conducted by SAF alone or joint with NCC. For eg. SAF Basic Airborne Course, NDU Class 3 Basic Diving Course, Private Pilot License (PPL), Jungle Training(Ex-Lancer), Desert Trekking(India), Glider Flying Course(India), Combat Engineers Experiental Camp, 3rd Div Experiental Camp, Service learning (India &amp; Thailand), Visit to (Ex-Crescendo, Ex-Thunderwarrior, Ex Starlight), International Cadet Exchange Programs(ICEP) involving 7 countries &amp; more coming up. Even our training ground in HQ NCC in SAF Amoy Quee Camp have been upgraded with MOC(motivational obstacle Course,easy one!), High &amp; Low elements, Rapelling Station(Currently our Clt's undergo Rapelling training. During our recent Affirmation Ceremony (2005),we displayed the vast rapelling techniques employed &amp; taught to us by SAF), FlyingFox tower cum Rapel station &amp; PaintBall Arena to name a few. If you ask me why all these trainings, i have no idea. In fact for the next 5 yrs(they have planned this) the training syllabus would be intensively revised. Hopefully at the end of the day, the cadets will learn valuable skills &amp; knowledge that would well serve this nations need.</div>

We were only doing Pre-jungle Training for the 1st 3 days in SAF Lakiun Camp. This is to the best of my little knowledge &amp; experience.</div>
