Its really irritating and disappointing , he wasn't like this in the past , i don't know why he changed so much , after being friends since sec sch , its really disappointing , i know bmtc instructor always have to fuck their recruits to make them learn , but he shouldnt treat everyone as his recruit. My another friend who is a golden bayonet in sispec also didnt change at all. How can i really talk to this friend of mine?</p></div>

              <p>Bmtc instructor are normally the bottom percentile of their cohort thats why that ended up there,so dun think so much about it...it is normal.</p>
              <p>in bmt ,mine sgt ask me to tahan,he tell me whatever problem it is,if u dun have the 3 chervons on u,its because u have not suffered as much as me,so dun grumble , dun tell me about ur sufferings....after i heard that....i off course ...stop sharing mine concerns with mine sergeants...its usless and i would receive mockery in return for speaking out.<br><br>Now i am in unit ,sergeant treat us more humane than in bmt, even though training may be, PT may be tougher,we get rest time,we are more willing to put in our effort.Remeber once one guy from our platoon fell into a drain,he twisted his ankle ,our sergeant immediately carried the guy himself to the medical center for treatment and not wait for the medic that is slacking in some shithole to come back.</p>

              <p>Sit down to him, talk to him man-to-man.</p>
              <p>Don't beat around the bush; tell him straight that his attitude sucks and that he really ought to wake up his bloody ideas.</p>
              <p>If he doesn't mend his ways, then you may want to drop him as a friend. No big loss to you if his attitude really is what you say it is.</p>

              <p>The whole battery buay tahan, u-turn and run back to barrack, the officer came and say wanted to charge us.... the original officer needs to step in, and talk to him not to treat us like recruit as we are actually more experience then him.....</p>
