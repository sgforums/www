              <p>Such a unfortunate thing to happen....I always hated MPs since I was a air force driver.Tried to frighten me in one of my ICTs cos got pulled over over a alleged driving offense.</p>
              <p>I think you should consult your unit CO or RSM and ask him/her for help.Losing IC is not a joking matter.You and I know how EFFICIENT our military is when it comes to admin matters.</p>

              <p>So the MP bluffed you into not signing out and not taking your belongings, by saying someone fetched them?</p>
              <p>Obviously your unit did not order anyone to fetch your belongings, and they forged your signature for the sign out form so it would look different. It should be easy to catch them.</p>
              <p>Would be fucking funny to see the MP in DB, not as a guard.</p>

              <p>It is actually, never your problem at all.Your boss (whichever officer is supposed to settle it for you.) You lost your IC or 11B?</p>
              <p>If it is 11B, your boss will settle the replacement.</p>
              <p>If it is IC, your unit is supposed to return it back. Let the clerks fight among themselves, and see who get the blame.</p>
              <p>What is the problem when there is no problem. The administration is settled by the bosses, let them sort out themselves.</p>
              <p>Your boss must write a statment to cover you in and out of the camp, saying that  you dont have a 11B now.</p>

              <p>if they can lose a simple ic from a soldier then what about all
              the hand  grenades,weapons inventories and ammunition in
              army camp during acceptance shipments into camp???they goin to lose
              all of them too like how they lose the guys ic too?corruption and
              losing stuff goes hand in hand.an ic can be sold in spores black
              market.his passport too can be sold for more.as time goes
              by,ultimax machineguns,hand grenades and rocket launchers could be
              lost from army camps and end up in black markets.</p>
