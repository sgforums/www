              <p>2LT to CPT pay can be seen in all the recruiting materials, but can never find any pay for ranks higher.</p>
              <p>Any idea what the higher ranks get MAJ to LG? Their pay will be affected by their education (eg after SAF scholarship) and whether they are in the Administrative Service.</p>
              <p>According to the Straits Times report on the army CPT who became a loan shark runner, a service side CPT can get $5000 after a few years of service.</p>

              Based on how does a normal executive, manager, senior manager earns and you can scale according. The rank accompanied by education, FYI. 
              
              If you like military life, the pay is better than outside.

              <p>They think money so easy to earn. SHould decrease their pay. Always slack and slp through. USe the glove like nothing. FOC&gt; Provide LUNCH, FREE beer for function. THey think holiday INN is it. GO outfield. WHat there to be proud.</p>
              <p>Parliament should revise the payslip. Dunno what are they doing. SO much difference between officers and non officer. A normal CPT does nothing at all but to have meeting, edits minutes. Most of the time out of office.</p>

              <p>collinnxk88, so you mean that CPTs and above will get yearly increments, with a big jump at some point while holding the same rank?</p>
              <p>Does this mean officers will first get Superscale, then move on to Administrative Service pay grades?</p>
              <p>I found this out how the basic Superscale grade (called SR9) and the basic Administrative Service grade (called MR4) pay are calculated.</p>
              <p><a href="http://app.psd.gov.sg/data/Press%20release%20-%2013%20Dec%2007.pdf">http://app.psd.gov.sg/data/Press%20release%20-%2013%20Dec%2007.pdf</a></p>
              <p>QUOTE:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Staff Grade I (MR4): The annual salary of an Administrative<br>Officer in Staff Grade I is pegged to two-thirds of the salary of the<strong> 24th<br>highest earner (median)</strong> among a group comprising the <strong>top</strong> <strong>8 earners<br>from the 6 professions</strong>; namely bankers, lawyers, engineers,<br>accountants, local manufacturers and MNCs (2/3M48).</li>
              <li>Superscale (SR9): The annual salary of an Administrative Officer<br>in the entry Superscale grade is pegged to the annual salary of the 15th<br>top earner aged 32 years belonging to the 6 professions.</li>
              <li>The salaries of political, judicial and statutory appointment holders are<br>pegged to these benchmarks. The entry grade for Ministers is pegged at Staff<br>Grade I, and the higher appointments (for example, the President, Prime<br>Minister, Chairman Public Service Commission, judges, etc) are set based on<br><strong>predetermined ratios</strong> to the Staff Grade I salary.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>which might explain how the Prime Minister for example got a monthly salary of $115,920 but a yearly salary of $3,760,000 (in 2007).</p>
              <p>According to this report, the benchmarks against the top earners in the private sector are revised regularly and come with bonuses. I wonder if a General for example would get a GDP bonus for "protecting the economy".</p>

              <ul>
              <li><span>The salaries of administrative officers are paid based on a
                          benchmark known as SR9, the first Superscale grade. Those at this grade
                          take home an annual income of $372,000 — an amount currently 103 per
                          cent of the benchmark.
                          <br> <br>The benchmark is calculated using a formula pegged to the top
                          earners aged 32 in the private sector. As the salaries of these
                          superscale grade civil servants are "currently near the benchmark" of
                          $361,000, there will not be any adjustment to the monthly salaries or
                          in the grades below, explained Mr Teo.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>This payment, together with the higher Gross Domestic Product
                          bonus paid out this year, will bump up their pay packets by 3 per cent
                          to $384,000 a year. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li><span> About 36 per cent of this revised package will be variable — depending on how the officer and the economy perform.
                          <br> <br>The salaries for those between the first Superscale grade and the
                          entry-level grade for ministers and senior permanent secretaries will
                          be adjusted accordingly, by between 3 per cent and 33 per cent. </span></li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li><span>"We will watch private sector salaries at the SR9 benchmark
                          carefully. Should we see the market moving, we will move promptly to
                          make a further adjustment, later this year if necessary," he said.</span></li>
