            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ninefold9:</div><div class="quote_body">From the acccount which I heard, some of the regular SAF soldiers were<br>ambushed by Indonesian forces during confrontation era in the 60s.<br><br>The SAF soldiers were believed to belong to 1st SIR, based in Ulu Pandang Road, next to a "Ayam" Brand soap factory.<br><br>The ambush took place in Johor, near or around Kota Tinggi.<br>What caused the ambush was the carelessness on the part of the SAF  soldiers, when they decided to put away their rifles and plunged themselves into a river to take a bath, without realising that the enemy forces were watching them from the bushes.<br><br>Hence when the enemies fired at them they were unable to put up a fight.<br>They should have posted a few guards around them and took turns in taking bath.<br><br>Those who survived the ambush and are still living today, are probably<br>in the late 60s.  It's a painful story to remember.  The person who told me this story was one who survived the ambush, but passed away about a decade ago; I saw his obituary.   He was in tears when he recounted the incident.<br><br>The lesson to learn: Never take things for granted<br><br></div></blockquote>I heard this same story from an old friend who used to be from 1SIR as well.</div>
