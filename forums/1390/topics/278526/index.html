            <div class='col-md body'>Life there has  "worsened" due to higher training standards now.<br><br>I hope you won't cry when you find out you still have to:<br>1. practise IV with fellow medics<br>2. undergo physical training 2 times a week after office hours<br>3. practise building BCS once a month<br>4. go for range (your unit still wants you to be a M16 marksman)<br>5. the random medical emergency drill we always get (few times a month)<br><br>The best memory I ever had was during a medical emergency drill, our simulated patient was this really fat clerk who actually dosed off. The RSM actually blowed his top and scolded him really loud - the clerk still never work up. There was also another where we had triple dose of bad luck. While we were simulating an emergency, we actually had to respond to actual medical emergency on the airbase (some old encik had a stroke) and a SOS call simultaneously. While some of us waited for the old encik to arrive, we had to re-prepare the treatment room as some equipment were already expended during the drill while 2 medical teams were dispatched. We had no doctors in the medical centre due to 2 simultaneous emergencies, so we had to request for doctors from HQ Medical Corp. LOL. I'm sure u can imagine the state of confusion then and the level of stress we had to deal then.<br><br>Plus you have to provide normal medic duties, such as:<br>1. run the medical centre (admin, ambulance, treatment, dispensary, MOPA)<br>2. provide medical cover for airbase activities (Range Training for RP)<br>3. provide RT Cover for Reservice who failed their IPPT (at Khatib Camp)<br>3. tend to "civilians" from Sembawang Country Club (who usually turn to be high ranking military officer or high ranking civil servants in civilian clothing)<br><br>Then you will ask yourself this question: "I thought air force is supposed to be slack. Why I still have so many things to do and I am on duty every other day?" LOL</div>
