            <div class='col-md body'>ENGINEERS and defence scientists may have developed the Primus, but its users, including artillery gunners in their late teens, had a say in how it would be deployed.<br><br>In fact, gunners from the 21st Battalion Singapore Artillery, the first unit armed with the Primus, helped change some 30 per cent of procedures for using the weapon.<br><br>Captain Helen Ang, 30, a battery commander with the unit, said her gunners helped weed out procedures that could be done better while being trained to use the self-propelled guns.<br><br>Most suggestions were offered by full-time national servicemen (NSF) in their late teens.<br><strong><br>She said: 'NSF input is very important as they are the people on the ground who know whether things can be executed or not. </strong>As different batteries went out for exercise, we came back for after-action reviews. From there, we put up suggestions that helped revise the training manuals.'<br><br>For instance, gunners proposed changing the positions at which they stood in the gun turret so the loading process could be less cumbersome.<br><br>Having an armoured heavy artillery gun which can move about at speeds of 50km/h and fire a burst of three shells in about 20 seconds has spurred a mindset change among gunners on how the weapon can best be used.<br><br>Captain Dinesh Vasu Dash, 29, a weapons staff officer from Headquarters Artillery, said the development of the weapon took place alongside efforts to draw up a training programme and methods for using it during wartime.<br><br>On the weapon's impact on tactics, he explained: 'It opened up new tactics, training and procedures that we have incorporated into our system, like the shoot-and-scoot tactic.'<br><br>The gun's unique fire control computers and navigation equipment allow it to dash out from cover, aim and fire three rounds in about 20 seconds, then race to a new hiding place before enemy guns can respond - a tactic big guns towed behind trucks cannot match.<br><br>Added Capt Vasu Dash: 'This gave us insights into a new method of operation, <strong>having to decentralise our batteries so a gunner can make decisions on the battlefield on his own and achieve the mission on his own,</strong> rather than the traditional view of the gunner as a muscleman who lugs and chucks rounds from one point to another.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>PRIMUS<br><br>Width: 3m<br><br>Weight: 28.3 tonnes<br><br>Gun calibre: 155mm, 39 calibre<br><br>Gun range: 30km<br><br>[/quote]<br></div>
