But the thing i don't like is that why the government reports that it costs $20 mil just to send them for a 2 weeks period after people question the government on the lack of support to the disaster strucked countries. I mean if you want to help others, just help  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> , theres no need to advertise how much you spend. trying to show others how "much" they are contributing?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>the NEWS is reporting all these figures. and realise they are reporting similar figures for countries which have come forward to contribute. and realise again, they did not point out countries which have yet to do so. if there is anyone advertising, it should be the news. japan also gave out similar figures for their deployment of their self-defense force, plus the whopping $500m they have pledged. whos complaining?<br><br>and who complained about our lack of response to our neighbours? i just heard the news that we were praised for our swift and substantial response.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The S$20 million is meaningles without context. The Qn is how much would they be spending if they had not sent those soldiers over?<br><br>Would the soldiers still be paid? Would the helicopters still be flying? Will the ships still be maitained?<br><br>I'm sure they spent MORE, but the qn is how much more.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>As of now, not impressed. Anybody knows how much they spent at NDP? I saw before but i dun remember. It was in the millions though. Adn i dun think that inclided salaries of soldiers, etc.</div>

If for eg. they would have spent 15 million anyway just by having those ships stay in base, then 20 million doesn't sound so impressive does it?<br><br>Good taht that charity donated 15 million. Compare it to the 20 million the SAF  projected. Albbeit it is the projected cost for only 2 weeks, but again, we do not know tha exact magnitude of the SAF's commitment.<br><br>NDP you say costs 6 million. I doubt that includes the wages of the Division of men, specialists and officiers involved for at least 9 months. Not counting logistical support like Food, vehicle maintenance, etc.<br><br>I suspect is you factor in those costs, the final figure will be greatly inflated. Just like i suspect the 20 million is greatly inflated.<br><br>Creative accounting only serves to hide the real picture.<br><br>Note: Good that ppl volunteered, kudos to them.

            <div class='col-md body'>1stly, the $6.3m figure wasn't picked out of the air by me.<br><br>2ndly, give up on using the NDP budget as a contrast, lah, cuz the more you're spewing about it (wages, food) the more ridiculous they sound. Heck, I didn't 2 NDPs &amp; a Military Tattoo in my time &amp; the joke used to be that the only things they spent extra on us were the torchlights to wave about (compared to the million $s set aside for the fireworks). Whenever we complained then, it was more about burnt weekends - cuz they were scheduled with the normal training timetable.<br><br>$15 million for the ships to stay in base? Creative accounting only serves to hide the real picture? ~lol~<br><br>LHL didn't specify whether the $20m is total overheads costs so I'm not gonna do the clarification for him. But I note that the civilian humanitarian task forces budget for hundreds of millions in funds even as they expect their volunteers to pay their own expenses, carry own equipment, etc. - so these initiatives are obviously costly expenditures. For our servicemen involved, they won't be compensated extra but otherwise it's noticeable that, aside from the SCE people, we're deploying mostly medical &amp; logistical troops - or people who wouldn't have the chance to go overseas. So I'm guessing we gotta budget extra for them (however spartan), as must for the LST sailing distance (IMO equivalent to heading to Vietnam) &amp;, probably most crucial of them, equipping everyone enough to function some 20 consecutive days on the field (how many NSFs or regulars experienced that before?).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sidetracking: I thought David Boey's ST account yesterday of how the SCE built a landing point from scratch was brilliant stuff. Some of the updated info are welcoming (like the actual fatalities) though there's still bits of anyhow-hantam stuff. For example, today's account mentioned how a TNI unit 2km from the coast was wiped out but another a further km in was spared - yet, yesterday there was a quote about how boats were tossed up to 6km inland. I measured the latter distance on a S'pore map: it'll be equivalent to the waves reaching Paris Ris from Tenah Merah jetty, or MacRitchie Reservoir/Bukit Timah Road from Clifford Pier/Keppel Harbour!<br><br>Very nice to see the dress discipline of our troops on the ground too. Granted, they were likely aware of the media &amp; VIPs around on some occasions, but there were also some more-discreet photo shots &amp; film recordings &amp; they still showed our guys in training #4 attire with SBO. I thought they stood out against the TNI soldiers - particularly during the joint-effort unloading of goods - who were in vest-&amp;-sacks or with American-style rolled-up sleeves.<br><br>I do think we can aim for more consistency with our headgear, though, perhaps imitating the SCDF personnel more. Instead, our SAF servicemen were were wearing their various Formation berets, jungle hats, jockey caps &amp; - I thought I saw this yesterday - a Smokey Bear hat (looks like a signaller; he wore a S'pore-flag patch).<br></div>

Col Tan replied that they were in constant touch.<br><br>Singaporeans form the main foreign presence in this town of about 40,000, which has had about 10,000 of its residents decimated.<br><br>'It's our responsibility,' Mr Lee said when asked by reporters about the extent of Singapore's help.

Three of the Singapore Armed Forces' four helicopter landing ships are at sea, two off Sumatra and one in the Gulf.<br><br>Many of its transport planes and choppers, including half of its fleet of Chinooks, are flying daily relief missions.<br><br>More than 1,200 personnel are on overseas missions, with more than 1,000 in Indonesia, 50 in Thailand and 180 in the Gulf.<br><br>At the same time, the military is keeping its anti-terror guard up at home and continuing with its routine training, including hosting a 10-day exercise between Singapore and Malaysia.<br><br>The annual event started yesterday with six ships from both navies engaging in coordinated maritime surveillance in the Malacca Strait.<br><br>'This is the largest number of overseas missions that we have undertaken simultaneously and the largest number of SAF personnel we have ever deployed on missions overseas at any one time,' Mr Teo said in a Jan 1 letter on www.miw.com.sg, a Web portal for national servicemen.<br><br>SAF regulars, national servicemen, including full-timers, and volunteers are working 'shoulder to shoulder', and many others who did not go have also been hard at work preparing for the deployments, he said.<br><br>'I know that there are many who were not deployed who have worked very hard, and continue to work very hard, to plan, prepare, support, sustain and monitor each mission so that it will be carried out successfully.'<br><br>He praised the SAF for acting swiftly and effectively. Standby teams were ready to go within 24 hours, and teams assembled for the relief missions within 48 to 72 hours.<br><br>'Our people showed a high level of professionalism and commitment, working around the clock to get the teams ready,' Mr Teo said.<br><br>The Asia-Pacific editor of Jane's Defence Weekly, Mr Robert Karniol, described the deployment as commendable.<br><br>He said it was not surprising, considering Singapore's military capabilities have become sophisticated over time, that it has been moving to show it is prepared to be more active in the international front and that the scale of the disaster requires such a response.<br><br>Defence analyst Andrew Tan of the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies does not believe the unprecedented scale of deployment is too big for the SAF to handle, as it has been sending its troops overseas for training over the years.<br><br>Dr Tan, who also teaches at the Safti Military Institute, said that officers at the very top level have been expecting the SAF to be involved in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, and subjects related to this are being taught to its personnel.<br><br>He believes the SAF will be able to build up new non-combat skills, such as dealing with natural disasters and a traumatised population.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aerozapper,<br>Nice sentiments (which I concur wholehearted with) though I must disagree with some of your inferences.<br><br>1stly, this whole HATF (that's what the MINDEF refers to the mission as in its website, compared to "Operation Lion Heart" in Phuket) isn't really a combat campaign, so there's a limited interpretation of what being better soldiers entail.<br><br>2ndly, no dissession with the experience gained but, for military expertise itself, I'll have to contend that our troops involved have already acquired an excellent measure of it prior. That's what being operational-ready means: the constant repetition of drills so that proficiency becomes second nature, complemented by problem-solving skills during regular overseas training to internalize a can-do spirit. (Applicable for both RSAF flyboys &amp; SAF ground troops.)<br><br>So IMO the quip about "No amount of exercises or simulated scenarios would give them this" doesn't really hold. In fact, in many ways those on the ground over there are doing the same sai-kang work that servicemen complain about locally - but of course with a desperately-urgent purpose now.<br><br>3rdly, I just made time to read through miw.com.sg's various reports closely &amp; it appears that relatively few NSF soldiers went to Aceh (different from the DART teams, which use a lot of conscripts). For example, it's reported that some 350 of the 472 on the RSS Endurance are military personnel, &amp; only 63 are said to be full-time NSF's. (TCH said it was 90 in his media briefing). In other words - roughly 20% of the total personnel; no breakdown yet of the 196 on the RSS Persistence that I could find.<br><br>Also, the ST reported that "45 combat engineers" went ashore to clear to the debris &amp; pack sandbags for the new landing point, so my guess are (a) it's possibly a standby SCE company or detachment that went over instead of the whole unit, &amp; (b) 45 of 63 (or 90) suggests the bulk of the represented NSFs were from that Formation. Of course, none of these conclusions negates what a medic or a signal spec is contributing there - but if valid then it's generally more about what we can do for them (rather than gain back in reverse).<br><br>4thly, I'm sure the extended multiple-week field deployment is nothing like what's experienced in normal SAF training but, in another sense, their daily grind ends earlier as well. For example, the medics finish work by 3:30 in order to commute back to camp; the chopper crew chews up incredible mileage but doesn't fly at night; ditto for our ground troops cuz things are streetlights aren't repaired yet. That said, there's still night briefings &amp; repacking of stores to be done, so no attending to personal stuff (like phone calls back home) until 21:00-22:00.<br><br>The biggest reward we're getting out of this is meaningful work, period. As far as professional knowledge gained, I say it's the SAF planners over here, &amp; the various liaison teams over there, who've benefitted most. In other words, military bureaucrats being more than pencil-pushers - unlike what we're starting to hear about the inefficient Indonesian counterparts. It wasn't "customary" (as someone cavalierly suggested) to assemble 600+ different-skilled men within 48 hours, even though existing SAF components like standby personnel &amp; Joint-Staff coordination helped greatly. But such institutional efficiency &amp; preparation don't magically appear out of the air; they're rather the results of what generations of servicemen strove for during NS, no matter how minor their roles.<br><br>By all means, give everyone a medal when they return safely home! ~lol~<br></div>
