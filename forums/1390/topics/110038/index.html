General or no, that cock is overraching himself there and soundbites like that is not doing him any good. He comes across as a pencil pusher there.<br><br>Anyway, such work is infinitely more worthwhile and useful in terms of operational efficiency than providing free labour in the NDP. How about xfering the manpower involved in the NDP to help out in this great disaster? Surely our annual self congratulatory jerk-off fest is not more important than the 100000 dead bodies that need to be collected?<br><br>However, i do note that the countries may not welcome such large numbers of foreign soldiers on their soil.

What do you think  our army uses during exercises? Handphone? (OK - Some of us do use handphones). We are more than capable of handling the situation.<br><br>The SAF is a well-oiled Sai Gang machine.
