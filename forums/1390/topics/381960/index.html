              <p>Since you can't be charged twice for the same offence, maybe you can try seeking redress for the injustice done to you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Sometimes the JDO dunno what to charge, it's like spinning the wheel of fortune and just happens that day he think it's AWOL. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Did you report your problem to your camp MO etc to inform them of your problem?</p>
              <p>If you have not sound out your problem and been wrongly charged, you would be at fault for not highlighting ur problem earlier. Now would be too late since you already served your sentence but what could be done could be to get them to remove that record from your files since a DB record is not something anybody wants.</p>
              <p>If you have informed them of your problem and still were charged, that would be a totally different issue.</p>

              <p>Hi Andrew,</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, since you have served the sentence, nothing could be done. Since you did not raise the issue about your illness when you were charged, even if you are to bring it up now, it is unlikely that you will not be compensated in any way.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>He might be able to benefit from fighting for it. That's assuming he had disclosed his condition before hand.</p>
              <p>Compensation is unlikely, though possible. But at the least, if he succeeds, he can possibly get 2 things:<br>1) Non-extension of his liability. i.e. the days he served in db is counted to his liability and he doesn't need to serve extra days. <br>2) The DB charges and his stay gets struck of the records. Think about all those forms when you apply for jobs and such that ask if you were convicted or jailed.</p>
              <p>Actually even if he didn't know about the condition before the conviction, there's still a chance to at least get the above 2 "benefits".</p>
