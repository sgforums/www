              <p>Seeking Help from anyone here.</p>
              <p><br>I'm currently PES C, an ASA clerk, got downgrade temporarily for depression and anxiety disorder. A few days into my new unit, my symptoms got worse.. trembling...hiding in toilet...scared of everyone...dun even dare to go to cookhouse to eat so i skip lunch by hiding in the toilet. So i called up my SAF appointed doctor (he's a public doctor at khoo teck puat hospital but he used to be from SAF) and seeked help. He gave me 3 weeks mc and increased medication and asked me to see him 2 days before the mc ends, and when the mc ends, he wants me to try going in again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But every since the last week, it has been really torturous mentally for me, realizing that i eventually have to go back to that hell. i've developed signs of suicidal thoughts (slit my wrist once or twice at night cuz i was trembling and shivering so hard). It feels like my mind is about to snap. I tried taking extra medication (like 1 extra tablet a day) to see if it helps, but it doesnt at all....And then... probably since last week (lost track of exact day), there has been "voice" in my head, talking to me whenever i'm alone (like at night when i cant sleep, or when i'm hiding in my house toilet". That voice will just keep mocking me, like "useless", "you deserve to die", "disgrace to your family" and "commit suicide also no balls." then i will just hear laughter in my head and i keep trembling.</p>
              <p><br>My parents have been trying their best to help me. I didn't tell them about the sucidal thoughts and voice as i don't want to stress them out anymore than they are now. My parent's want me to go in and keep trying until i can stay there, but i know deep down inside that, i would rather die than go back. But when i tell them its really difficult, feels worse than dying, they just kinda gave up on me. Not even talking to me anymore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So now i really dunno what to do. My medical appt with the SAF doc is 2 days from now. I've considered the following:</p>
              <p>- Go see my private psychiatrist (i used to see one before shifting over to this current one) and ask for advice/help</p>
              <p>- Report to IMH A&amp;E</p>
              <p>- Just wait until wednesday when i see my saf doc, tell him my symptoms and beg him to not let me go back.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dunno if i can get discharged from army for this. All i know is that if i continue to go back, my mind will literally snap. I understand readers might think "clerk so relax, complain complain, etc". But my fear and anxiety is so bad now that even when see a NSF outside, i will start trembling and run away.</p>

              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">To be
              better prepared, you can participate in Total Defence activities

              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Perhaps
              you should also talk to your family members and friends who have
              lived the NS experience. The more you discuss with others, the more
              comfortable and mentally prepared you’ll become.</span></p>
              <p><strong style="font: inherit; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Because
              NS life is different from civilian life before enlistment, there
              are many adjustments you need to make.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">A good
              way to cope is to get support from your buddy and fellow recruits.
              They are going through the same tough training as you, so talking
              to one another will help relieve some tension.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">In most
              evenings during your leisure time, you’ll also have some time to
              call your family or loved ones to talk. They can give you emotional
              support during NS.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">You can
              have a one-on-one interview sessions with your officer to highlight
              any problems you may have. If you have a personal or family problem
              that need to be addressed, do let the officer know—he may be able
              to give you some advice or time off to settle your
              problems.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Life in
              NS revolves around structure, routine and discipline. This helps us
              stay united as a uniformed organisation as well as imparts the
              rigours necessary to protect our nation and citizens.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">This
              does not mean there is just work and no play. In fact, after a few
              weeks in NS and you’ll find new friends and new reasons to
              smile!</span></p>
              <p><strong style="font: inherit; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">As a
              soldier, one of the biggest adjustments you’ll have to make quickly
              is in regimentation and discipline.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Being in
              a uniformed organisation, you’ll have to obey orders from your
              superiors. Thus some of you may feel a sudden lack of freedom to do
              what you want and you may find yourself having difficulties
              accepting authority initially.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Regimentation and
              discipline build strong character and toughness, so that you’ll be
              tough enough to handle difficult combat, crime-fighting or rescue
              situations without giving up or breaking down.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">When you
              first enlist into NS, you may have concerns of being in a new
              territory, with new faces and new things to do. But don’t let this
              get to you. Just remember the saying that “when the going gets
              tough, the tough gets going”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"> <em style="font: inherit;">Following are some tips on what you can
              do to prepare yourself psychologically:</em></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Adopt a positive
              perception</span></li>
              <li><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Build up physical
              stamina</span></li>
              <li><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Develop good working
              attitude and habits</span></li>
              <li><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Overcome psychological
              stress</span></li>
              <li><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Adopt teamwork
              spirit</span></li>
              <li><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Learn to be
              independent</span></li>
              <li><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Set realistic
              expectations</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">You can
              also speak to your friends or family members who have been through
              NS. Ask them to share their stories. The sharing will help you
              reduce some of your fears, uncertainties and doubts.</span></p>
              <p><strong style="font: inherit; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">During
              NS you’ll be living with different people.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Because
              these people come from different backgrounds, they may not think
              like you do or react to situations like you would. Instead of
              trying to select your type of people, you should cherish the
              diversity. This is a chance for you to learn more about your fellow
              mates and their cultures.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">You’ll
              find that you have many opportunities to absorb the different
              cultures—during training, eating, chatting or just seeing and
              listening. Take these opportunities and learn from people around
              you, you’ll have a much better appreciation of Singapore’s cultural
              diversity.</span></p>

              <div>The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) is a 2,000-bed acute
              tertiary psychiatric hospital situated on a 25-hectare campus at
              Buangkok Green Medical Park. Set amidst serene surroundings, IMH
              offers a comprehensive range of psychiatric, rehabilitative and
              counselling services for children, adolescents, adults, and the
              elderly.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>IMH’s tradition of care started in 1928. We were the first
              mental hospital in Singapore, starting with some 1,000 patients.
              Since then, many advances have been made in treatment, training,
              and research. Our treatment integrates evidence-based therapies,
              supported by the departments of clinical psychology, nursing,
              occupational therapy, and medical social work, to provide holistic
              care for our patients. IMH is equipped with modern facilities, with
              50 wards for inpatients and seven Specialist Outpatient
              Clinics.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>IMH was the first mental health institution in Asia to receive
              the Joint Commission International Accreditation in 2005, a highly
              coveted international accreditation for healthcare
              organisations. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Over the years, IMH has gained a reputation for quality
              research. In 2008, the Ministry of Health, Singapore, entrusted IMH
              with a S$25 million research grant to implement translational and
              clinical research into the causes of schizophrenia and related
              psychotic disorders.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>IMH also plays a key role in training the next generation of
              mental health professionals in Singapore. We train psychiatrists
              and mental health professionals through the NHG-AHPL Residency
              Programme for psychiatry and through collaborations with the local
              tertiary institutions.</div>

              <div>Minister of State for Health Dr Amy Khor announced in
              Parliament on Monday two new community-based mental health
              initiatives designed to improve Singaporeans' access to mental
              healthcare.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"We are developing Assessment and Shared Care Teams (ASCAT),
              which are specialist-led mental health teams based in the
              community, in order to improve access to mental health care. We are
              also developing Community Mental Health Intervention Teams (COMIT)
              to provide improved access to counselling and psychotherapy
              services in the community," said Dr Khor.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Dr Khor also said that the Institute of Mental Health's (IMH)
              occupancy rate for the past three years averaged at about 80 per
              cent and that the hospital has sufficient capacity for new
              patients.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>There are currently about 2,000 beds across public hospitals
              in Singapore dedicated to mental health patients, with the majority
              in IMH.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Responding to queries from Member of Parliament Mr Hri Kumar
              Nair on the criteria for admitting patients to IMH, Dr. Khor said
              those with conditions such as schizophrenia and depression may be
              admitted for closer monitoring. </div>

              When patients feel at their most vulnerable, Head of medical
              social services at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) Ms Esther

              patients may have tried to take their own lives or showed signs of
              wanting to do so. Ms Lim also helps families cope when they have
              lost a loved one.</span></p>

              39-year-old's helping hand is extended not just to patients, but
              also to hospital staff who face challenges at home or at work, for
              instance, if they have been abused by a patient.</span></p>

              she pioneered a programme in SGH to train health-care and social
              work professionals in suicide intervention. It is now also offered

              Institute.</span></p>

              becoming a social worker in 1995, Ms Lim, who leads a team of 85
              medical social workers, has received more than 15 awards. Last
              year, she was one of two recipients of the Outstanding Social

              working in the emergency department years ago, I saw how a crisis,
              such as a life-threatening illness, a serious road traffic accident
              or an attempted suicide, can throw a family off balance.</span></p>

              be vulnerable to feeling hopeless and helpless, which may escalate

              to connect the suicidal person with the resources around him, such
              as family service centres, care facilities and legal aid. Often, a
              person may think nobody can help him, which is not true.</span></p>

              8.30am with administrative duties, followed by morning staff
              meetings or journal club sessions. I meet senior staff members
              regularly to plan and implement assistance schemes which benefit
              patients.</span></p>

              medical social workers also come to me to seek advice on cases they
              are working on. I co-manage the difficult cases, such as those
              which may involve suicide, or in which patients or family members
              consistently display behavioural difficulties.</span></p>

              that families with strong social support fare better in crises.
              After the initial shock and confusion, members organise themselves
              very quickly to protect the affected family member by providing
              physiological and emotional comfort.</span></p>

              who are forthcoming, open to working with their families and

              <p>SINGAPORE'S Institute of Mental Health (IMH) beat over 80
              hospitals in Asia to snag the top accolade at the Asia Hospital
              Management Awards (AHMA) last night.</p>
              <p>The hospital won the inaugural Grand Award for the Hospital of
              the Year, because of its good showing in six out of nine other
              award categories.</p>
              <p>The awards were held as part of the Hospital Management Asia
              2011 conference.</p>
              <p><img src="http://my.effectivemeasure.net/emnb_18_4564.gif?14473151" alt="" width="1" height="1"></p>
              <p>Dr Ashok Nath, chairman of Hospital Management Asia, said that
              the Grand Award was created to "encourage hospitals to excel in not
              just one award category, but to also strive for more wins".</p>
              <p>The AHMA, held yesterday at the Resorts World Convention Centre,
              is in its 10th year. The judges include representatives from Johns
              Hopkins Medicine International and the International Hospital
              Federation.</p>
              <p>Dr Chua Hong Choon, IMH's chief executive, said the hospital was
              honoured to win the Grand Award and that the win "gives us the
              affirmation that our programmes are evaluated by international
              consultants to be of best-practices standards".</p>
              <p>The hospital also won the Most Outstanding Project in the
              Service Improvement for Internal Customers Project category for its
              Case Management Service, a follow-up service for discharged
              patients.</p>
              <p>It was started in 2003 but was tweaked last year to include an
              information-technology system that supports the follow-up care
              process.</p>
              <p>Under the service, patients of IMH are assigned a case manager
              who makes sure that they continue to receive care after they are
              discharged. Case managers also often double as confidants for their
              patients.</p>
              <p>Said Joe (not his real name), 34, an IMH patient who was
              diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2003: "When I have a lot of
              problems on hand and no one to talk to, that tends to increase my
              stress levels. As my condition is easily aggravated by stress, that
              triggers a relapse, causing me to check in and out of the
              hospital."</p>
              <p>However, Joe's condition improved after he was assigned a case
              manager in December 2009. He spends time talking to her every time
              he goes for a medical checkup, and she counsels him on some of the
              problems that he faces.</p>
              <p>Other patients were also found to have fewer relapses and
              re-admissions, after having a case manager assigned to them.</p>
              <p>Between January last year and May this year, IMH saw an
              improvement in patients' compliance with follow-up treatment, from
              78 to 88 per cent, partly due to the improved Case Management
              Service.</p>
              <p>There was also a fall in re-admission rates and the number of
              patients not completing their treatment.</p>
              <p>IMH also received two excellence awards in the Operational
              Customer Service Project, and Marketing, PR or Promotional Project
              categories for its Mental Health - General Practitioner Partnership
              Programme.</p>
              <p>The programme aims to improve access to mental- health care,
              especially in the heartland, by providing general practitioners
              with psychiatric knowledge.</p>

              <div><span>Burst the Silence is a social movement
              that highlights the danger of youths being silent about their
              problems. </span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <p>Justin (not his real name) was developing psychotic symptoms and
              began to have delusions. For a year, he felt confused and lost.</p>
              <p>His grades at school suffered. So did his social life.</p>
              <p>He was sent to the Community Health Assessment Team (Chat) at
              the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) and a youth counsellor
              convinced him to seek treatment early and to share his symptoms
              with his family.</p>
              <p>With treatment and family support, Justin is now completing his
              final-year at a tertiary institution.</p>
              <p>IMH's latest campaign, Burst the Silence, hopes to encourage
              young people with mental issues not to suffer in silence and to
              seek help early.</p>
              <p>It is IMH's first such campaign following a suicide awareness
              campaign, One Last Breath, organised from October to December last
              year.</p>
              <p>Chat youth support worker Nur Khairunisa Ngaiman said young
              people who stay silent cannot access the many resources available
              to them, including friends, family, school counsellors and
              therapists.</p>
              <p>She said: "They may feel a sense of helplessness if the stressor
              gets more and more overwhelming... He or she may then resort to
              self-destructive coping habits like self-harm and excessive
              drinking."</p>
              <p>Chat, set up in 2009, has assessment services for those between
              16 and 30 years old.</p>
              <p>Between April 2009 and last December, it provided psychiatric
              assessment to 169 young people and about 30 per cent of them were
              referred for follow-up treatment in hospitals.</p>
              <p>Youth problems the team sees include adjustment issues in school
              or a new environment and family matters that the young people can't
              cope with.</p>
              <p>Others have mental health issues like depression, anxiety and
              some psychotic symptoms, said Associate Professor Swapna Verma,
              Chat's project director.</p>
              <p>Prof Verma said: "Youth is the peak period for the onset of
              major mental health problems and such problems are often associated
              with high levels of disability."</p>
              <p>The Singapore Mental Health Survey last year found that most
              people with mental illness had their first onset of the illness
              when they were in their 20s.</p>
              <p>The survey found that in most mental illness cases, sufferers
              were not seeking professional help.</p>
              <p>Those suffering from alcohol abuse started at an average age of
              23 and took an average of 13 years before they sought help.</p>
              <p>People with bipolar disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder
              (OCD) waited nine years before seeking help. Their illnesses
              started at the average ages of 24 and 19 respectively.</p>
              <p>Common disorders</p>
              <p>According to the survey, major depressive disorder (MDD),
              alcohol abuse and OCD were the top three most common disorders in
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>It found that 6.3 per cent of Singapore's adult population have
              suffered from MDD at some point in their lives..</p>
              <p>To encourage sufferers to get help, IMH is organising an event
              at *Scape on March 17 from 6pm that will feature performances and
              graffiti artists.</p>
              <p>Last weekend, a performance outside Shaw Centre involved a
              "bubble" with a young person "trapped" in it.</p>
              <p>A passer-by, Mr Luther James Balat, 32, called the bubble an
              "attractive" metaphor.</p>
              <p>"It gets people to ask, 'What's the meaning behind this
              structure?'</p>
              <p>"Young people do need to talk to parents about their issues.
              Some might just tell their friends, but the latter might not give
              sound advice."</p>

              <p><span>Depression, alcohol abuse and obsessive
              compulsive disorder (OCD) are the most common mental woes in
              Singapore.</span></p>
              <p>One in 16 people had depression while one in 29 people suffered
              from alcohol abuse in their lifetime.</p>
              <p>For OCD, the figure is one in 33 people.</p>
              <p>The findings emerged from the Singapore Mental Health Study,
              which surveyed some 6,600 Singaporeans and permanent residents aged
              18 and above last year.</p>
              <p>Led by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), the $6.9 million
              study is the largest and most comprehensive of its kind here.</p>
              <p>The study also found that 12 per cent of people here will have
              some kind of mental disorder in their lifetime.</p>
              <p>For most, mental illness will hit by the time they are 29 years
              old.</p>
              <p>But there is a big gap between the onset of mental illness and
              the time a person seeks help.</p>
              <p>It took an average of four years for someone with depression to
              seek help. For alcohol abuse, the treatment gap is some 13
              years.</p>
              <p>Clinical Associate Professor Chong Siow Ann, senior consultant
              and vice-chairman of Medical Board (Research) from the IMH gave
              three reasons for the time lag - failure to identify the illness,
              stigma and the lack of access to help.</p>
              <p>Dr Chua Hong Choon, CEO of IMH, said: "Anyone who has a mental
              health problem or thinks he has a health problem should speak to
              someone about it."</p>
              <p>Help could come from a doctor or a psychiatrist.</p>
              <p>Said Dr Chua: "Every doctor in Singapore has basic training as a
              medical doctor to deal with mental health, but in the last few
              years, a lot more effort has been put in to increase the capability
              of our GPs (general practitioners) as part of the chronic disease
              management programme."</p>
              <p>He added that there are 50 GPs trained to manage some mental
              illnesses.</p>
              <p>Among those who had a mental illness, 22.1 per cent had
              consulted a psychiatrist.</p>
              <p>Most sought help within the community - 21.6 per cent went to a
              counsellor, 18 per cent to a GP, and 12 per cent went to a
              religious or spiritual healer.</p>
              <p>Apart from the IMH, the other three parties involved in the
              study were the Ministry of Health , the Nanyang Technological
              University (NTU) and Rand Corporation, an American non-profit
              research organisation.</p>

              <p><span>TWO strangers, worlds apart, but they both suffer
              from the same debilitating illness of depression.</span></p>
              <p>They say their struggle with depression is one that few can
              understand.</p>
              <p>And one of their biggest fears is that when their caregivers
              die, they will be alone.</p>
              <p>Janice (not her real name), 28, was diagnosed with depression
              two years ago, while Dylan (not his real name), who is in his late
              30s, was diagnosed more than 15 years ago.</p>
              <p>Both found their present jobs through the Institute of Mental
              Health's (IMH) Job Club.</p>
              <p>Janice is a receptionist and Dylan is a shop assistant.</p>
              <p>Both their employers are aware of their conditions.</p>
              <p>In Parliament on March 4, Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said the
              stigma surrounding mental illness needs to be reduced, "so that the
              patients can be more confident to come forward for treatment and
              after receiving treatment, to integrate back into the
              community".</p>
              <p>While Janice and Dylan try to integrate into the community, both
              say it remains hard for them to hold onto their jobs because it's a
              constant battle juggling their mental illness and the demands of
              work.</p>
              <p>Janice was too shy to meet with this reporter, and agreed only
              to an interview over the phone.</p>
              <p>But she had a happy, girlish voice and chuckled often during the
              interview.</p>
              <p>Ten years ago, she was an "average teenager" studying at one of
              the "top six" junior colleges here, she said.</p>
              <p>She was introverted but had friends, and even a best friend.</p>
              <p>Most of her friends, including her best friend, went on to
              polytechnics or worked after their A levels, so Janice went to
              university alone.</p>
              <p>"I was very, very lonely and I had no friends. I constantly felt
              ostracised by my peers in university too," she recalled.</p>
              <p>She admitted that at that time, she was already prone to being
              "over-sensitive".</p>
              <p>She also had problems with her mother.</p>
              <p>"She's not the affectionate type and I could never get any
              verbal affirmation from her. She never listened to how I felt," she
              said.</p>
              <p>"I decided that unless I did something drastic, she would not
              care about me. I decided to rebel."</p>
              <p><span>A few weeks into university, she dropped out.
              That decision "forced" her mother to pay more attention to
              her.</span></p>
              <p>At her mother's insistence, she found an administrative job in a
              factory.</p>
              <p>But once again, things took a turn for the worse because she
              couldn't get along with her boss.</p>
              <p>She left the job after three weeks, cooped herself up at home
              for a year and "did nothing".</p>
              <p>Her temper also went from bad to worse, she added.</p>
              <p>"I not only threw tantrums, I threw things. I knew I needed
              help, but I was in denial. I felt that going to a psychiatrist
              meant something was really wrong with me," she said.</p>
              <p>During this period, Janice also lost her best friend, who could
              not understand her mood swings.</p>
              <p>They have not spoken since.</p>
              <p>While she had consulted private psychiatrists before, at 26,
              Janice decided to go to IMH, where she was diagnosed with
              depression.</p>
              <p>Since then, she has been on medication and sees her doctor at
              IMH once every month.</p>
              <p>Although she feels better these days, she said medication does
              not make her "self-esteem issue go away".</p>
              <p>Janice has had four jobs so far, but she leaves when she cannot
              cope with the stress.</p>
              <p>She has been in her current job for the past three months, but
              hopes to find a full-time job soon.</p>
              <p>She still finds it tough adapting to changes in her workplaces,
              but said: "When I have a job, I feel I have purpose in life.
              Without one, I feel inferior, useless, and have low
              self-esteem."</p>
              <p>That sentiment is also echoed by Dylan. When he's not working,
              negative thoughts surge into his mind.</p>
              <p>"I just keep thinking, 'Why, why, why. Why am I like that?' So I
              need to keep myself occupied," he said.</p>
              <p>Dylan said he has been suffering from low self-esteem since
              young, but didn't know it was an issue as he did not have problems
              with his studies.</p>
              <p>It was only during national service that something in him
              snapped.</p>
              <p>"I don't know why, but I just could not take the stress in the
              army," he said.</p>
              <p>His mother took him to a psychiatrist and he was diagnosed with
              depression.</p>
              <p>Even though he has a business degree, Dylan says work poses a
              huge challenge for him and stress would trigger his depression.</p>
              <p><span>His condition became so bad that in 2006, he was
              warded briefly at IMH for having suicidal thoughts.</span></p>
              <p>He has since improved and sees his doctor at IMH once every two
              to three months. But he is unsure whether he will ever fully
              recover.</p>
              <p>"I don't have that much hope. I've been dealing with this for so
              long. I've never really been happy before," he said.</p>
              <p>Dylan hardly goes anywhere else apart from work, preferring to
              stay at home to watch TV.</p>
              <p>But watching drama serials sometimes triggers his condition,
              especially if the show features "useless sons".</p>
              <p>"I feel like I'm a useless son. My mother implies that about me
              too," he said.</p>
              <p>His mother, who is in her 70s, works part-time in a funeral
              procession band. They live in a terrace house in the east.</p>
              <p>Dylan's father died when Dylan was 17 years old.</p>
              <p>Said Dylan: "When she goes, I'll be alone. I might even end up
              dying without people realising until there's a bad smell in the
              house."</p>
              <p>In the meantime, he's trying to save up to buy a new computer,
              so he can set up Facebook and Twitter accounts and make more
              friends.</p>
              <p>He hopes to find a girlfriend in the future, though he lamented:
              "I've no money, who would want me?"</p>
              <p>Agrees Janice: "It's hard to find someone who will accept me.
              But it would be nice have someone love me the way I am."</p>
              <p>For now, she's content going out with her mother and
              relatives.</p>
              <p>She said: "All these years, I have not socialised with anyone
              else. I'm not in touch with people I've met at work either."</p>
              <p>Janice wants to find a stable job so she can start giving back
              to her parents.</p>
              <p>"I don't want them to worry about me anymore. I want to
              rediscover myself.</p>
              <p>"For a long time, my mind has been a blank. I'm trying now to
              learn what it means to be me," she said.</p>

              <p><span>Mon, Mar 23, 2009<br> The Straits Times</span></p>
              <p><span><strong>By Lee Hui Chieh</strong></span></p>
              <p>THE national mental health hospital is looking at how it can
              better track and care for its outpatients, especially those more
              prone to violence.</p>
              <p>The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) has set up a committee to
              study this, after a former patient allegedly torched Member of
              Parliament Seng Han Thong.</p>
              <p>Questions about how IMH's more than 30,000 outpatients are
              monitored surfaced after 70-year-old Ong Kah Chua, who has been in
              and out of the hospital with a history of paranoid delusion,
              allegedly set the MP for Yio Chu Kang on fire at a community event
              in January.</p>
              <p>Ong is now back in IMH, where he will remain until the Law
              Minister decides otherwise, based on doctors' reports.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times understands that one of the changes being
              considered by IMH involves ensuring that patients at high risk of
              hurting themselves or others, are followed up more closely if they
              miss their appointments.</p>
              <p>All patients are sent reminder letters, but those with suicidal
              tendencies, aggressive behaviour, or a history of violence, will be
              visited at home by nurses if they remain no-shows despite the
              letters.</p>
              <p>This had been done previously, but less systematically.</p>
              <p>Doctors said that community care is the way to go, rather than
              institutionalisation.</p>
              <p>Dr Lee Cheng, the chief of IMH's department of community
              psychiatry, said: 'The best indication of violence is a past
              history of it. If a patient has no past history, is it justified to
              keep him institutionalised forever?</p>
              <p>'If we admit him by force, it's too extreme. At the end of the
              day, no one would dare seek treatment because by doing so, you
              would be deemed dangerous.'</p>
              <p>To ensure chronic patients stick to treatment and prevent
              relapses, IMH already runs two home-visit programmes, similar to
              those in countries like the United States, Australia and
              Britain.</p>
              <p>Dr Joshua Kua, the chief of IMH's department of geriatric
              psychiatry who heads the seniors' home-visit programme, noted: 'The
              concept of having patients with mental illnesses going back to the
              community, leading as normal a life as possible, is in line with
              the international movement of psychiatry.'</p>
              <p>The programmes have shown good results - patients have been
              re-admitted fewer times, and have stayed for shorter periods when
              hospitalised.</p>
              <p>Retiree Amos Madina, 62, said of his father, who has dementia
              and is on the seniors' home-visit scheme: 'He's so much better now.
              He smiles at visitors, watches TV quietly, and doesn't spit and
              scream.'</p>
              <p>General practitioners (GPs) have been roped in for another
              programme that lets stable patients get treated in their own
              neighbourhoods, making it more convenient for them. It also reduces
              the stigma that some still attach to visiting IMH.</p>
              <p>The results so far show that GPs' care is 'not worse than
              specialist care', said the programme's director, Dr Nelson Lee.</p>
              <p>One GP, Dr Roy Ang, treats about 50 such patients, and has sent
              only two back to IMH since joining the scheme in 2006.</p>
              <p>'Most of them are very stable and compliant. In fact, they are
              more compliant than my other patients with high blood pressure or
              high cholesterol,' he said.</p>
              <p>A 31-year-old woman who refused to seek medical help for
              depression for five years before her mother convinced her to go,
              has been well for the last six years.</p>
              <p>She switched to seeing a GP in 2005 because she works and finds
              it more convenient to see the doctor during weekends.</p>
              <p>Her mother, who takes her to her monthly appointments, said: 'I
              also make sure she takes her medication every day, as I don't want
              her illness to come back.'</p>

              together, the sum of our collective efforts is larger than what we

              illness."</span></p>

              <p>Signs of psychological trouble</p>
              <p>WHAT are some of the signs that your child may be suffering from
              psychological problems? Psychiatrists point to some of the things
              that you could look out for:</p>
              <p>    Sleep or appetite problems</p>
              <p>    Behaviour and speech that seem out of
              character</p>
              <p>    Difficulty concentrating or a lack of
              motivation</p>
              <p>    A drop in academic performance</p>
              <p>    Becoming increasingly withdrawn from families and
              peers, preferring to keep to oneself at home</p>
              <p>    Becoming argumentative towards family and
              friends</p>
              <p>    Hallucinations, delusional beliefs, odd or
              impulsive behaviour and even suicidal tendencies.</p>
              <p>If there has been a recent crisis such as the loss of a loved
              one, a divorce or school stress, be sure to check on how the child
              is coping. Take note of how he is performing in school and how he
              is interacting with others. </p>

                          counselling services for children, adolescents, adults, and the
                          elderly.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>IMH’s tradition of care started in 1928. We were the first
                          mental hospital in Singapore, starting with some 1,000 patients.
                          Since then, many advances have been made in treatment, training,
                          and research. Our treatment integrates evidence-based therapies,
                          supported by the departments of clinical psychology, nursing,
                          occupational therapy, and medical social work, to provide holistic
                          care for our patients. IMH is equipped with modern facilities, with
                          50 wards for inpatients and seven Specialist Outpatient
                          Clinics.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>IMH was the first mental health institution in Asia to receive
                          the Joint Commission International Accreditation in 2005, a highly
                          coveted international accreditation for healthcare
                          organisations. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Over the years, IMH has gained a reputation for quality
                          research. In 2008, the Ministry of Health, Singapore, entrusted IMH
                          with a S$25 million research grant to implement translational and
                          clinical research into the causes of schizophrenia and related
                          psychotic disorders.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>IMH also plays a key role in training the next generation of
                          mental health professionals in Singapore. We train psychiatrists
                          and mental health professionals through the NHG-AHPL Residency
                          Programme for psychiatry and through collaborations with the local
                          tertiary institutions.</div>

              <h2>Helping servicemen serve</h2>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Story by Benita Teo</p>
              <p><strong>Serving in the military is certainly no mean feat. And when the 
              security of the nation is in one’s hands, mental strength is as 
              important as, if not more so than, physical fitness.</strong><br> <br> When the going gets tough, it is often helpful to talk it out with a 
              trusted family or friend. But, even with the best of intentions, not 
              everyone is able to fully comprehend the intricacies of military life.<br> <br> To help the servicemen and women of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) 
              cope with the challenges of their military roles, the counsellors of the
               SAF Counselling Centre (SCC) are always ready to lend a listening ear. 
              In fact, the team at SCC provides professional counselling services not 
              only to all members of the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and SAF, but 
              also to their families. <br> <br> <strong>Learning to live the military life</strong><br> <br> Unlike civilian counselling centres, the SCC comes under military 
              mandate, and its primary purpose is to provide mental health care to 
              ensure that servicemen are able to carry out their duties efficiently. <br> <br> Of the types of cases the SCC sees, Mrs Marlene Koh, Head of Education 
              and Prevention Services, noted that the majority were Full-time National
               Servicemen (NSFs) with adaptation issues. "Not everybody is used to 
              dealing with authority. They all came in as students who only had to 
              take care of their own studies."<br> <br> She added: "The second, smaller group would be Regulars with career or 
              family issues. A third group comprises families and soldiers affected by
               critical incidents that happened around them, for instance training 
              incidents or a death in the family."<br> <br> Servicemen in distress may seek help directly with the SCC through two 
              channels: face-to-face sessions or the 24-hour SAF Counselling Hotline. 
              On top of these, a Family Support Helpline is also available for the 
              family members of soldiers deployed overseas who are in need of 
              assistance. <br> <br> <strong>Eyes and ears on the ground</strong><br> <br> To help junior and senior commanders to identify and assist men under 
              their charge who are at risk of emotional distress, the SCC conducts 
              regular workshops. In addition to basic counselling skills, stress 
              management and suicide prevention are also taught at the workshops. <br> <br> Ms Cheryl Chia, an SCC counsellor with 14 years of experience, explained
               that equipping commanders with these skills is essential because "they 
              are the eyes and ears on the ground".<br> <br> Another set of eyes that the SCC relies on to spot at-risk servicemen 
              are the paracounsellors - Regulars who volunteer to help look after the 
              mental welfare of servicemen at the unit level. To be appointed as 
              paracounsellors, they have to go through a five-day course organised by 
              the SCC that teaches basic counselling, suicide prevention and crisis 
              management skills. <br> <br> Military Expert (ME) 3-3 Sulinder Singh, a Logistics Warrant Officer, 
              has been a paracounsellor in his unit, 201 Squadron (SQN), since 2010. 
              And being a familiar face in the unit means that servicemen know what to
               expect when they confide in him - trustworthiness. <br> <br> "I'm quite approachable, and they know that if they talk to me, it will be confidential."<br> <br> <strong>Allaying fears</strong><br> <br> Besides assuaging doubts over client confidentiality, the counsellors 
              and paracounsellors also dispelled the stigma of seeking help. <br> <br> "(For) those who are in a position of command, it may be a 'face' 
              issue," said SCC counsellor Lawrence Yap. "But so far, I've not 
              encountered any clients (Regulars) who claimed that attending 
              counselling affected their careers."<br> <br> ME3-3 Singh echoed his sentiments: "Is there a stigma attached to people
               in the unit who see paracounsellors? No, not at all. They are not 
              mentally ill, we just need to help them find the right way to organise 
              their thoughts."<br> <br> <strong>The counsellor is in</strong><br> <br> Help for a distressed soldier often begins with a visit to the Medical 
              Officer (MO) with complaints of symptoms of stress. Said Ms Chia: 
              "Usually they will say that they are unable to sleep or eat. When the 
              MOs probe deeper and realise that the problem goes beyond a medical 
              issue, they will refer them to us."<br> <br> At the SCC, the soldier will be assigned a counsellor. Through the 
              sessions, counsellor and soldier will work together to identify the 
              problems and set goals towards overcoming them. The counsellor will also
               impart skills such as stress or anger management techniques.<br> <br> When facing mental turmoil, a soldier may despair and lose his sense of 
              self. One approach a counsellor may take is to remind him of his 
              capabilities. <br> <br> "Counselling is about instilling a sense of hope," said Mr Yap, who 
              specialises in substance and drug addiction counselling. "Everyone has 
              it in them to overcome a difficult situation. We just need to help them 
              see that they are not as helpless as they think they are, and that the 
              situation is not as hopeless as they think it is."<br> <br> SCC counsellors also work with psychiatrists and psychologists from the 
              Psychological Care Centre (PCC) at the SAF Medical Corps' Military 
              Medicine Institute to provide all-round care to the soldier. PCC 
              psychiatrists prescribe medication for conditions like depression while 
              psychologists run tests to ascertain if a behavioural problem is linked 
              to a learning or intellectual disability.<br> <br> <strong>Helping others help themselves</strong><br> <br> With the ever-evolving social landscape, counsellors must stay 
              up-to-date on new behavioural problems or addictions, such as social 
              media addiction. <br> <br> Mrs Koh also pointed out that there are now more cases of servicemen 
              suffering anxieties about not performing well or meeting expectations, 
              and that many expected others to solve their problems. <br> <br> Mr Yap agreed: "To change, clients have to take personal responsibility for their actions."<br> <br> Nonetheless, the counsellors take comfort in the knowledge that they are changing lives for the better. <br> <br> Mrs Koh remembered a recruit who had attempted suicide after his 
              girlfriend of four years ended their relationship and started seeing a 
              friend of his behind his back. Mrs Koh helped him acknowledge his 
              feelings of hurt and disappointment, and taught him constructive ways of
               managing his anger. <br> <br> The recruit started to improve his relationship with his family and make
               new friends in his unit. Nine months later, he was finally able to move
               on from the break-up.<br> <br> Ms Chia also recounted a recent case: "I had a client who wanted to kill
               himself. But after working with his unit and the psychiatrist, just 
              before his ORD (Operationally Ready Date) he said, 'You gave me hope. 
              Even though life ahead will be challenging, at least I know now that 
              there are people who care, and that there is more to life than thinking 
              about hurting myself.'"<br> <br> She added: "He even baked us cupcakes as a 'thank you'. It's the little 
              things like these (that let me know I’ve made a difference)."</p>
