              <p>This is very funny.Why are some people so hung up on getting into command school??</p>
              <p>Apart from the fact that the longer reservist liability, think about the added shit atop the chevrons/chocolate bars. Getting sub 8 for 2.4 or sub 4 for SOC will not make you OCS material. Being in command means that you have to do your job well above knowing how to lead you men. You will also be surporsed on how much of the politicking betwen your men whose welfare you must take care and your car polishing superiors. be</p>
              <p>Perhaps the army is not a place for you to learn this. I, too had the same mentality like you during my NS days. Think... is soldiering your passion?? Are you able to take care of your men?? Are you one who can endure the shit from your bosses?? Being a 2LT or LTA also means that you are the kang her kia to your crabbies above. People think wear chocolate bar very got "sei".But after considering the above. it may be sucky after all.</p>
              <p>Having picked management up 6 years on after leaving NS and being a junior manager to my IT team in an US MNC, I looked back and tell myself how lucky I am to only be a storeman during my NS days. Hell, at least the whole company depend on me to provide enough batteries for their signal sets.</p>

              <p>I can only agree with the above sentiments, better grades don't always equate to a better leader.</p>
              <p>I remember not to long ago meeting visiting a family who's son was in NS at the time. The lad is about a year older than me, but despite this, those who knew him regarded him to be an arrogant and rather immature brat for his age . Needless to say it was a shock for everyone to find out that he was a 3SG in SISPEC.</p>
              <p>During the visit I witness as he childishly irritated his parents, fidgeted away; mimicking the hand-to-hand combat drills on his brother and argued otherwise with the other teens.Leader of men, diplomatic, logical? I see none of these attributes, this further compounded by the fact that he hasn't changed since I had last seen him during childhood times.</p>
              <p>Where had the selection process gone wrong? More over, had SISPEC thought him anything?</p>
              <p>At what point did pristine grades translate into emotional intelligence? I must've missed the memo.</p>
