              <p>Hi people, i am in the ptp batch for 2 months plus now, during all my exercises , i had no problem except for the recent chin ups and route marches that i do. I've experienced chest pain from these 2 activities and my body went cold after route marches.</p>
              <p>I've decided to consult the MO about this, however, i am afraid i would be mistaken as chao kenging. Also, will it do me any good to report this symptoms? or are they normal? For chin ups, sometimes, i feel really sharp pains at my chest. During my CGH checkup prior to enlistment, they diagnosed me with something called AV block stuff, i do not know if its serious or not. So should i consult the MO about this? And if i do, what should i say?</p>

              <p>It is your right to report sick when u feel unwell regardless what is your role in ur platoon.</p>
              <p>Just sound out to ur PS/sec comm that u would like to report sick when you book in and they will tell u the time to report sick.</p>
              <p>Nights are only for emergency so do not wait till at nights then go report sick.</p>

              If you know you're not playing a fool just report sick when you need to. But non urgent cases like yours are handled after 9-10am (you have to check with the COS for the actual timing). Just mention your symptoms, and if you have any notes or letters from your external doctor, it'll really help to speed up the process.
              
              What's most important is your own safety and health, cos Boone knows you better than you. There's no need to be a hero for your NSF life and end up coming out of NS worst than when you came in.

              <p>Report Sick during first parade by indicating to your section instructor. If your SI or Platoon sergeant deems it serious, they will bring you to the COS who will take you to the medical centre. Otherwise, if they think it isnt, they would most likely ask you to go for a medical review after 1330hrs.</p>
