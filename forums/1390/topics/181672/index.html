            <div class='col-md body'>true. for commanders, his ability to lead is indeed more important than his fitness level. especially true for commanders in combat units where they will stay on with the same men all the way till they ORD, maybe even during reservist. and the various trainings, exercises and missions they will go through with their men will also put their leardership skills to the test.<br><br>but for BMTC, the commanders gets new men every 2 or 3 months. leardership although still equally important but i believe this is the period the recruits buck up on their fitness level to better prepare them for the road ahead. thus instructors must be fit so as to provide a good role model.</div>
