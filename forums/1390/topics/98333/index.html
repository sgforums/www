            <div class='col-md body'>Just wanted to check if they were the same thing, cos i kept hearing the TAG team being used in exercise last time. Seems that they were linked somewhat to the RSAF. For those of u that were PF in SAF, did u have a special badge or was it just by vocation? Thanks</div>

My Bn is a Heliborne Bn, those from 6 and 3 SIR will noe Ex Pegasus right ? haahaa....for my interpreation of TAG as learnt from the ppl at HQ Guards and Commandos, the team will be inserted early by small birds like UH-1Hs together with the Bn scouts, walking to the main LZ and marking out the LZ for the main body,<br><br>i was the TAG PC in my unit, and my plt was pretty proud of it.My way of ra-raing them to go better, as we go in with the scouts and wait for the arrivial of the main body, we are by no means having a easier life as each TAG team has to lug a 900 series signal set, day and night markers, the commander of each team need to mark the LS, scout the nearby terrain for cover for main body assembly and planning the best way to for Air Head Coy to come in to secure the LZ.<br><br>And coupled by the fact, the nitewalk to the objective with ALL the equipment, extra stores like water, food and supplies has to be brought along with us.it was pretty tough...but my platoon found it interesting as they were the ones welcoming in the Bn ahaha..<br><br>feel free to comment, but thats how it worked in my Bn.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rank at that time when he was CO was Major. The one that went onto be a SO in Tradoc and then promoted LTC. The same one that reportedly suffered a HALO parachute accident near Tampines open ground. I believe he has left the service but is involved in private security services.<br></div>
