Making the spot which was last hit safest as compared to those around it?<br><br>Thanks</div></blockquote>It is not that arty fire is unable to hit the same spot twice... it's just that the probability of that happening is very low. Furthermore, the concept of arty fire is area target: 75m by 75m<br><br>But with modern technology, achieveing multiple hits for the same target is now possible.<br><br>Arty rounds travels a great distance before reaching the targets. For low charge firing, the distance is from 5 km onwards. The FH2000 has the furtherest range of up to 40 km. Unlike firing a rifle where u can see the target, arty battallions reply on FOs (Foward Observers) to tell them the coordinates of the targets. These FOs are also known as the Eyes.<br><br>As the range increases, the accuracy of the rounds will suffer. This is becos the shells are subjected to various weather conditions such as wind, density of air .... etc. Even the rotation of the earth and gravitational pull plays a part too. The weight of the shell is a factor too and often, the shells used are of different weight,. Other factors will be the accuracy of the coordinates of targets as FOs usually rely on visual spotting.<br><br>Usually for Arty, the FO will use a reference point as the initial target. He will do ranging (ie: zeroing) where he will move the rounds thru various corrections to the reference point. Once the arty guns are "zeroed", he will then have then call for fire on the "real target". This will increase the accuracy and ensure maximum devastation.<br><br>I was lucky to be in arty but was even more fortunate to be a Gunnery Spec. Unlike the Arty Specs whom are the gun commanders, GS do not learn how to operate the guns. But we learn about the science and physics of arty. Believe it or not, one of our SOP equipment is a scientific calculator.....<br><br>Hope my answer clears up some doubts which you may have!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

The point of impact of the projectile can be calculated theoretically using particle mechanics (physics). I think 'O' level physics still has mechanics and I remembered that there was  an example or question in physics textbook or ten year series to calculate the distance a cannon ball could reach if fired at a certain velocity. Therefore, knowing the weight of the projectile, the force acting on it (from the firing of the charge), the angle of elevation of the gun (or tube for mortar), it will be possible to calculate the direction vector and the possible impact point of the round. Of course, wind conditions (direction, speed) and air density (humidity) will have effect on the forces acting on the round while in flight. Thus, if everything remains constant, theoretically speaking, every single round will hit the same spot.<br><br></div>
