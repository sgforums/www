A tank round is a direct fire ammunition which other than the chemical energy (HE round tank round is converted into heated molten  jet) is used against an armored target, the kinetic energy of the round (or molten metal jet) also contributes to the penetration. If an APFSDS round is used (with a tungsten rod penetrator), then the penetration effect is due mainly to kinetic energy. For a tank round, the objective is to penetrate and destroy and is used against an armored target.<br><br>An artillery round, generally, is used to neutralize an area, targets will mainly be unprotected infantry and soft-skinned vehicles. The fragmentation effect of the round or spread of sub-munitions (bomblets) will be used for the area damage.<br><br>Since intended targets and objectives are different indirect fire artillery and direct fire tank rounds are used differently.<br><br>Of course, currently, it is possible for IR sensing bomblets of an artillery cargo round to destroy armored vehicles (from top when armor tends to be thinnest). Direct hit of a 155 mm round on the tank will also cause disastrous effect to the vehicle.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>arty fire can hit the same spot right on again again if need . that is because of new technology - which make calculation of wind, speed gun condition... the computer can compensate the changes.  Plus there is alway spotter to provide adjustment.<br><br>The question is - is there a need to hit the same spot again ? Usually no, arty will want to hit whole area , thus they would want different rounds to fall in different area of a grid so that it is well spread out to do the most damage to the whole area.<br><br>If the same spot is hit already, whatever there is already damage, so why waste another rd to hit it again when that round which is so expensive, can be use to hit a new spot .<br><br>I do not think usually people will bore to hit it again just hoping to knock out a few foot soldiers who decide to go to a already hit spot, just not worth the round. Unless we are talking about bunkers which is enforced, which the arty will keep on hitting on the same spot till it it taken out.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>how artillery bombarbment kills is by lateral spread of fragments, which means that in theory if you are in a shellscape you will be protected since the fragments will fly over you.  if you are under a fire trench, the sand covering is supposed to be able to withstand the direct impact of a 155mm round (i am convinced that is bullsh*t).<br><br>bombarbments are done after a period of time.  other than killing people directly, the other effect of arty rounds is to CONCUSS the defenders.  it is said that when you are concussed, you will be deaf and giddy and thus not able to function properly.  furthermore, the WP rounds is supposed to be rather irritating to the eyes, although it's no longer a PWP round<br><br>during movement, the FO will be with the company itself.  only in rare cases where the FO will not be with the main body and when that occurs, it's seldom that he will be deployed to overlook the objective itself.  but the rounds are supposed to be registered / zeroed onto the target before the mission itself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well I read this account of this paratrooper in WW2, when he and his friends came under arty fire they started digging foxholes in the frozen ground for cover, then another one of his friends ran over to a crater that had just impacted and started digging there, saying that it's unlikely that another round will impact there. The rest did not follow but by the time the arty had lifted that guy had dug twice as deep as the rest and was better covered.<br><br>Of course it depends on the CEP of the guns... if the CEP is small enough then several rounds are going to impact very close to each other and even possibly overlap. Going to the spot where a shell then impacted then would be suicide as the other rounds are going to arrive very near by. In this case it would be best to get out of the area as quickly as possible instead of taking cover, especially if the shells are landing near by.<br><br>If the CEP is extremely large- meaning the guns are firing at the max of their range and the rounds are impacting all over the shop... then a shell crater is probably quite safe to take cover in then being caught in the open.<br><br>But of course, no grunt wants to be caught under arty at all.</div>
