              <p>Hi guys. Currently serving in bp bmt and next week is my field camp. A month later i will be at the floating platform having my POP. The thing is I am a recoursee. I enlisted last year May and I was in enhanced. Although my ippt was silver before I came in, because I didn't control my weight after A levels before enlisting, I was OOT and thus was sent to be a driver at Paya Lebar Air Base. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I got my licence and I was sent back to Bmt last november. My grades in BMT are average I guess. I got Ippt silver and barely marksman in range. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My question is what is going to happen to me after I pop. My ORD date is next year march. I am currently not sure if I should try for command school. On one hand, I really do feel its an honour to be given a chance to go for such courses. On the other, I do fee l rather tired from all the regimentations and stuff. I enjoy the physical training but find the military aspects like range and grenade throwing a bit of a chore. The regimentation really is a culture shock expecially when you consider I was at an admin unit in the air force.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My question is is there a chance I will be posted back to my unit??  Or will I be given  a new unit since there is a driver at my position until August? Do I also stand a chance to go for command school?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many thanks to those who do reply. I am kind of feeling lost expecially when Pop suddenly seems to be drawing so close.</p>

              <p>1) By default, you will be posted back to your unit when you do not do anything. For Driver vocation, you can get to earn a FREE conversion to a civilian driving licence after clocking X,000km mileage and may get to earn a Safe and Courteous Driver badge.</p>
              <p>2) So, if you want to try out or ask to be posted to a new unit, you must voice out to the PC and OC for them to try their best to help you. For them, it is office emails here and there to ask and request. </p>

                          Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National

              <div style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm -0.05pt 10pt 0cm; text-align: justify;">As my Ministry had shared in January last year, the Singapore Armed 
                          Forces (SAF) may recommend to the Traffic Police (TP), for suitable SAF 
                          servicemen, including Full-time National Servicemen (NSFs), 
                          Operationally Ready National Servicemen (NSmen) and SAF Regulars, who 
                          hold military driving licences, to qualify for civilian driving licences
                           if they meet the prescribed conversion criteria.</div>
              <div style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;"><br></div>
              <div style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">A set of conversion criteria is necessary in view of the different 
                          requirements and operating environments faced by SAF drivers and 
                          civilian drivers. For instance, SAF’s military licensing regime trains 
                          servicemen to be competent in driving military vehicles in an 
                          operational environment, usually across off-road terrain, whereas TP’s 
                          civilian licensing regime trains drivers to meet the demands of general 
                          motoring on Singapore’s roads.</div>
              <div style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Given the different needs, servicemen who do not fulfil the conversion 
                          criteria have to be further assessed through TP’s driving tests before 
                          they can qualify for civilian licences.</div>

                          who had their military driving licences converted to civilian driving

              <div style="text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </div>
              <div style="text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The Traffic Police (TP) and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) have an 
                          arrangement whereby suitable SAF Servicemen, including Full-time 
                          National Servicemen (NSFs), Operationally Ready National Servicemen 
                          (NSMen) and SAF Regulars, who hold military driving licences are 
                          recommended by SAF to TP to be awarded qualified civilian driving 
                          licences.</div>
              <div style="text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </div>
              <div style="text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Over the last 5 years, from 2007 to 2011, an annual average of about 
                          1,000 SAF Servicemen successfully converted their military driving 
                          licences to various classes of civilian driving licences. </div>
              <div style="text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </div>
              <div style="text-justify: inter-ideograph;">TP has adopted this licence conversion framework as it is satisfied that
                           the SAF’s training and testing standards and emphasis on driving safety
                           are robust and comparable to civilian test regimes. As such, SAF 
                          Servicemen recommended by the SAF to be awarded civilian driving 
                          licences do not have to undergo TP’s competency tests to convert their 
                          driving licences. TP’s primary consideration is to ensure that the 
                          driving competency skills of SAF Servicemen holding converted driving 
                          licences are on par with other motorists who have successfully cleared 
                          TP’s competency tests.</div>

              <p><strong><span>Driving Towards Higher Proficiencies</span></strong></p>
              <p><span>Posted:  31 Dec 2009, Army News </span></p>
              <p><br><span>While driving on Singapore roads does not require a "who dares 
              wins" mindset, there are still the occasional Michael Schumacher 
              wannabes, jay-walkers and weaving motorcyclists that make defensive 
              driving skills an important part of safe driving. If some adult drivers 
              find this a challenging experience, how much more so would this be for 
              an 18-year-old National Serviceman trying to attain his military driving
               license?<br><br>"Our drivers are all very young. As a civilian driver, 
              you would need to be 21 years old to drive a Class 4 vehicle. But our 
              guys come in at 18 and are considered less mature than a 21-year-old. So
               we need to be stringent in our testing because we don't want our 
              drivers to be a road hazard," shared 2WO Chia Peng Hwee, a Driving 
              Tester from Supply Transport Centre. As an SAF driving tester, his 
              testing philosophy is simple. Our military drivers must drive safely and
               not endanger the lives of other road users. He said, "Our drivers must 
              understand the fundamentals of handling a vehicle and make safe 
              decisions that do not pose a danger on the road. Our vehicles are heavy 
              vehicles and if we were to get involved in an accident, it may damage 
              property or even endanger the lives of many people."<br><br>Driving 
              dangerously endangers not just the lives of other road users, it also 
              puts other people in the vehicle at risk. 2WO Chia added, "Our drivers 
              never drive alone. They would either have a vehicle commander or other 
              passengers. For a 5-tonner driver, he may even carry up to 30 passengers
               in his vehicle. Every life is priceless and in a split-second moment of
               carelessness, he may get himself involved in a major accident. Thus, we
               always emphasise how important safety is and this is reflected in our 
              testing standards." These testing standards were validated by 
              Headquarters Traffic Police in a workshop with our military testers on 2
               September. The SAF testing system's criteria certainly passed with 
              flying colours as the Traffic Police rated our standards and marking 
              guides as the "highest and most stringent" in Singapore. <br><br>Besides
               being stringent, the testing system is also progressive and dynamic. Mr
               Kanapathy from Supply Transport Centre shared, "We want to make sure 
              that even at the learning stage, our trainees are confident of handling 
              their vehicle at each stage before moving on. For example, we grade our 
              students' driving in the circuit first before allowing them to move on 
              the road." For heavy vehicles such as low loaders, this takes on another
               dimension as drivers would have to first learn how to couple the load 
              to the front vehicle before going onto the road. Mr Kanapathy added, "If
               we add the load attached to the vehicle, it has the potential to be 
              even more dangerous as the load may suddenly uncouple if not secured 
              tightly. This is definitely a road hazard and thus it is important that 
              our trainees master the skill of coupling it securely first before 
              moving onto the road."<br><br>Besides being progressive in nature, the 
              tests are also more dynamic to ensure that no trainee gets too familiar 
              with the road. This has added resonance when we consider that our 
              trainees often trawl familiar routes over many weeks and this may result
               in him being complacent. PTE Nur Hakim Azmi, a driver from Transport 
              Hub (West), Infantry Training Institute Node articulated, "On our test 
              day, we take a totally new test route and during our training, 
              instructors are not allowed to bring us on that test route. I think it's
               because they don't want any fluke passes because of one's familiarity 
              with the test route." His sentiments were echoed by Mr Kanapathy. He 
              said, "We want our students to act on command of the tester because we 
              don’t want him to plan his route in advance and hence pass because he 
              pre-empted all the potential dangers." <br><br>Another way to test one’s
               skill instead of one's familiarity is requiring the trainee to park 
              without the use of poles. All learner drivers remember the first time 
              they knocked down the indicator pole in their testing centre but our 
              drivers have it more difficult. During their test, they have to park 
              with and without the use of poles. Mr Kanapathy explained, "We want to 
              train up their judgement and estimation instead of using markings, which
               our students may have when a pole is behind them."<br><br>To add 
              greater dynamism, a tabletop test with scale vehicle models is conducted
               prior to the test to ensure that our trainees know their highway code. 
              This test is called the Highway Situational Problem (HSP) test, where 
              trainees describe on a scale model what they would do when such a 
              situation arises. For example, in order for his model vehicle to turn 
              right on a crowded road, the trainee would have to explain to the tester
               how he would go about doing so. REC Lee Yi Cong, a Class 3-4 driving 
              course trainee, shared, "The HSP test was good as even before we go onto
               the road, we know what to look out for, where to stop, where to give 
              way to vehicles and so on. So when I go on the road, I would pay 
              particular attention to these things."<br><br>Ultimately, all the 
              stringent, progressive and dynamic tests are aimed at achieving one 
              outcome - safe and considerate drivers on the road. REC Lee added, "I'm 
              now much more confident on the road because I know that with each I test
               I pass, the testers pass me because I am a safe driver and will not 
              endanger the lives of other road users."<br><br><em>Military drivers wishing
               to convert their Class 3 military license to a civilian Class 3 driving
               license would have to clock in 7000 kilometres on the road and commit 
              no traffic offences during their National Service. Class 4 military 
              license holders need to qualify for a Class 3 license and cover at least
               3500 kilometres. They will receive their license upon reaching 21. </em></span></p>
