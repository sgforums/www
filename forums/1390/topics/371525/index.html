              <p>But seriously this had been so much argument on this issue,
              personally I think it's alright especially if your parents are
              working and you got no maid etc. If your PC or whoever is so
              calculative, why don't you ask him, if Att C cannot eat outside,
              why not ask the COY clerk deliver meals to you lah.</p>

              <p>They will tell u tabao back home and eat :p No reason for you to eat outside and when sick you supposed to avoid mixing around with others.</p>
