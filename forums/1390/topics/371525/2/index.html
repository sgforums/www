              <p>I think it is perfectly all right. Your PC could be 1st year officer, not much experience.</p>
              <p>Anyway, 20-30mins going out for meals is perfectly ok. Anyway, your MO give you Att C, not your PC. If your MO (3 bar captain) says you require rest at home, and no exercise/ops, then your PC cannot over write, cuz if something happen to you, your PC cannot answer.</p>
              <p>However, if you going out for food, and nothing happen you could, then it is ok, unless something happen to you while you are outside, then you yourself will be entirely responsible for it, e.g. getting injured while you are outside home, or faint etc.</p>
              <p>If your PC thinks you are malingering, then he himself have to provide evidence, else he will be questioning the MO's recommendation anyway.</p>
              <p>Att C "home/bunk" is only a recommendation, i.e. let's say Att C bunk, most probably your section mate will tapao lunch/dinner for you, but what if your CSM ask you to walk to cookhouse to eat and come back?</p>
              <p>Att C bunk, let's say .... are you supposed to be 100% time in bunk? So you cannot bathe, shit, urine, wash face, brush teeth, eat?? If going to toilet to shower takes you 20min, then how? Like that means you didnt follow MO's recommendation?</p>

              <p>I remembered there was a case that a serious ATT C (bunk) NSF, high fever, died in camp because the unit went out for exercise and the COS did not know that he came back from exercise because he's sick. I would think that this is not the only case. So after this the HQ state that all ATT C must go home, this is partly because they rather you die at home than in camp, save the trouble for all the investigation an reports......</p>

              <p>When you are out, you are out. There is no way anyone can check whether you really out for dinner or you out somewhere the whole day. They will rarely call just once and charge immediately but call once
              and normally again short while later and if still no answer then they
              will have to assume you are out. As long as you are found not at home when called, it can be a chargable offence already since you already broken the 'rules'.</p>
              <p>This has nothing to do with MO or PC who bigger or more power. ATT C is strictly stay at home and not supposed to go out at all.</p>
              <p>If i was the PC, i won't really accept the reason for going out for dinner with family when the rules is strictly no going out and food can be brought back home and not eaten out.</p>

              <p>I guess it's really dependant on your relationship with your superiors, if you've been difficult, then don't expect too good an ending. But the way your PC made it sound, at most some extras/confinement only.</p>

              <p>The usual should be that, PC ask you back for an interview, find out why you at so and so day and so and so time not at home, then you can provide evidence of where you are and what you do, coupled with vouch from siblings, parents, with good evidence, your PC will let you go.</p>
              <p>Ofcourse, if you do not have proper excuse to be outside home, then you bobian, your PC after interviewing you, will give you extras, DB, charged, depending on severity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The bottom line is your PC should give you a chance to explain first, before any how whack with extras or DB etc. The is a civilized country with a civilised army, not some North Korea army loh.</p>

              <p>You never heard of something call takeaway ah? Noone to cook, you go buy back and eat at home. He told his PC he went to eat out with family. That is no longer noone at home or noone free to buy dinner for him liao but he go out with his family by choice.</p>
              <p>You don't sound like someone who been through NS since you seem to be imagining alot of things which most people who been through know not to bother. If rules are there yet everyone bends them all the time, we might as well scrap all the rules and let everyone do as they please and happy happy then charge the people you don't like.</p>

              <p>Don't think they will go through the trouble to charge you over this. But do note this is serious. If you are on Att C, you are not allow to go out for dinner. If you are fit to go out for dinner, you are fit to go back to camp for dinner at the cookhouse.</p>
              <p>Last time Att C home is only given to soldiers who are in a really jialat condition. Usually is hospitalisation case, got discharge, then can get att C home. Else, maximum is only att C bunk. Nowadays MO more lenient with soldiers, but lots of soldiers abuse this privilege.</p>
              <p>Some companies (I mean working life, corporate companies) tasked their supervisors to call their staff who are on MC to check where they are. Most supervisors don't call, but there are some who do.</p>
              <p>Having said all this, usually your superior, be it PC or ur WO wun bother to check on you. Maybe your coy is really niao, but also, could it be the way you behave when you are in camp that cause them to have a bone to pick with you? (Like want to keng, hide here hide there, etc). I'm not accusing you of anything, but people tend to close one eye with those whom they have a good relationship with, and open all possible eyes with those whom they dun like.</p>
              <p>Or perhaps, you really sway, kana a routine check.</p>

              <p>I used to live in TPY and i know the area well. 4-5 blocks won't take you 30mins to walk. I walk even longer distance than that when i go teach tuition all the time and on the way i walk past 2 coffeeshops. Are you so lazy that 4-5 blocks is a very far to you? How did you stay in infantry i wonder if such a short distance and you are complaining.</p>
              <p>ATT C says you are not allowed to leave the house and does not say you are not allowed to cook at home. Want to go read the directives again? ATT C doesn't prevent him from injuries etc, its just to let him rest at home and not spread his illness to others. Choosing to cook is your own decision and is not a matter of whether you ATT C or not.</p>

              <p>That is different. Whether you takeaway home to eat or you eat at the coffeeshop won't affect your life or cause any injury. Ddon't tell me you will be too hungry. If you hungry you can leave your house and go buy food earlier and noone ask you to wait till you are starving to go buy food.</p>
              <p>In your example u did mention TELLING the officer, now TS did it on his own without seeking permission so thats a totally different issue whether you inform and whether you don't</p>
