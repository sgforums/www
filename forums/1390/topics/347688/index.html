              <p>IN THE last 10 years, fewer than 10 Singaporean sportsmen and musicians
              have been given permission to defer their full-time national service.</p>
              <p>These deferments are often sought when the young men want to
              pursue their studies, training or represent Singapore in International
              competitions.</p>
              <p>However, rarely is approval given because it is vital to
              uphold the NS system's strength and integrity, by making it universal
              and fair to all Singaporeans, said Dr Ng Eng Hen, Second Minister for
              Defence in Parliament on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Also, the NS system provides for Singapore's national security and survival, he noted.</p>
              <p>These factors form the basis of the three principles underlying
              NS, said Dr Ng, adding that permission had been given for exceptional
              talents.</p>
              <p>He was replying to Nominated MP Eunice Olsen, who wanted the
              Defence Ministry (Mindef) to be more flexible in giving deferments.</p>
              <p>She referred to a Straits Times report last December about Mr
              Keegan Ng. The 20-year-old had won the Marion S. Gray Outstanding
              Musician Award at age 11.</p>
              <p>He wanted to study piano at the Eastman School of Music in
              New York, but was told he had to complete his NS first. He has since
              given up his plan and is now deciding whether to study accountancy or
              business administration.</p>
              <p>Said Ms Olsen, a classical pianist: 'As a musician, I know
              how vital it is to continuously hone one's skills. I think the ministry
              could be more flexible in granting deferments."</p>
              <p>In explaining the Defence Ministry position, Dr Ng underlined the three principles that underpin NS.</p>
              <p>First, he said NS ensures Singapore's national security and
              survival. This is the basis for the Enlistment Act, which mandates that
              all NS-liable males are to be enlisted at the earliest opportunity on
              turning 18.</p>
              <p>Second, universality makes NS a duty for every male, fit Singaporean to fulfil.</p>
              <p>Third, equity ensures every national serviceman is treated the same way, regardless of background or status.</p>
              <p>Also, Mindef recognises that NS involves a sacrifice from all
              individuals who have to postpone personal pursuits to serve the nation,
              he said.</p>
              <p>'This is why we must adhere to the three principles
              articulated to preserve the integrity and strength of our NS system.'</p>
              <p>However, Dr Ng also pointed out that Mindef does exercise flexibility in selected situations, he said.</p>
              <p>For example, it lets students to defer full-time NS to complete
              their studies up to A Levels, polytechnic diplomas or equivalent
              qualifications.</p>
              <p>It also defers full-time NS for exceptional talents based on
              the merits of each case. But such talents are very rare, he added.</p>
              <p>He cited several examples such as swimmer Sng Ju Wei, sailor
              Maximilian Soh, violist Lim Chun and pianist Lim Yan, and added that
              they still have to serve NS after their deferment period.</p>
