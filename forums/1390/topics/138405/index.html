            <div class='col-md body'>Mugabe, the Zimbabwean dictator, is up to his nonsense again. His latest shenanigan allegedly involves demolishing about 200,000 homes in a bid to "restore order". Note that this is done in winter.<br>(Source: <a href="http://news.google.co.uk/news?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;tab=wn&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Mugabe&amp;btnG=Search+News" rel="nofollow">Google News</a>; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4114260.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC Footage</a>)<br><br>Now that certainly does not seem plausible for anyone with an iota of sense will fail to see how making up to a million persons homeless will contribute to any sort of order. That he is certainly not doing these things to restore order is seen in the fact when some aid agencies tried to give out clothes and other items to those homeless, the military stopped the agencies and burnt the items in front of the homeless.<br><br>The african nations do not seem to be compelled to do anything to prevent, or to even oppose strongly to this man-made disaster. In fact, Mbeki, the South African leader, appears to still support Mugabe.<br><br>We know that sanctions do not work. Sanctions affect only leaders who give a shit about how the general population is doing, or whos countrymen is able to depose of the said leader. This is not so in Zimbabwe.<br><br>We also know that aid do not work well in countries with corrupt dictators because the money usually ends up in the dictators' bank accounts, and is usually used to fund the dictators' armed forces.<br><br>Since Regime Change has been deemed by the powers that be, that is the USA land of the free (HooAH!), to be a legal and accepted reason for invading a country, perhaps it is time for the 'coalition of the willing' (and that includes Singapore) to stop exercising hypocrisy and start kicking some Mugabe ass.<br><br>Who's up for some regime change? I personally would like to see Mugabe shit in his pants when we send some 5.56 flying his way!<br><br></div>

There is a clear construction and reconstruction programme.<br><br>"We pledged to revitalise our cities and towns and to deliver as many as 1.2 million housing units and residential stands by the year 2008. We also undertook to reorganise our SMEs [small and medium business enterprises] so they could grow and expand in an environment that is supportive, clean and decent."<br><br>Zimbabwe's Local Government Minister, Ignatius Chombo, said he was happy with what he described as a normal clean-up operation.<br><br>Speaking to the BBC, he denied that it had created widespread humanitarian problems, and said the demolitions had been welcomed by all patriotic Zimbabweans.<br><br>The opposition says the demolitions - codenamed Operation Restore Order - are meant to punish urban residents, who have rejected President Mugabe in recent elections.<br><br>'Irritated'<br><br>Urging the AU to take action, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice described recent events as "tragic".<br><br>But AU spokesman Desmond Orjiako told the BBC's Network Africa programme: "If the government that they elected say they are restoring order by their actions, I don't think it would be proper for us to go interfering in their internal legislation."<br><br>His comments were backed up by South Africa, Zimbabwe's giant neighbour, which some see as the key to solving Zimbabwe's problems.<br><br>Presidential spokesman Bheki Khumalo said he was "irritated" by calls from UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw to do more to end the "horrors" in Zimbabwe.<br><br>"South Africa refuses to accept the notion that because suddenly we're going to a G8 summit, we must be reminded that we must look good and appease the G8 leaders," he said.<br><br>"We will do things because we believe they are correct and right."<br><br>The G8 summit of the world's most powerful nations is due to discuss efforts to relieve poverty in Africa on 8 July in Scotland.<br><br>Many African leaders see Mr Mugabe as a hero for leading the fight against colonial rule.<br><br>South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki has questioned why the West is so concerned by Zimbabwe but makes relatively little noise about other African emergencies, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, where some three million people died in a civil war, and where armed bands kill, rape and loot with impunity in some areas.<br><br>The BBC's Elizabeth Blunt also says that many African countries have carried out similar slum clearances and so will be unwilling to criticise Zimbabwe.<br><br>Living rough<br><br>Some 46,000 people have been arrested for trading without a licence, hoarding and illegal possession of foreign currency, Zimbabwe's police chief Augustine Chihuri said.<br><br>Mr Chihuri said that burglary and car-theft had declined by 20% since the operation began four weeks ago.<br><br>The children who have died were crushed to death when their homes were knocked down during Operation Murambatsvina [Drive out rubbish].<br><br>The police have moved across Zimbabwe's urban areas, armed with bulldozers and sledge-hammers, destroying shacks and informal markets.<br><br>Often, residents have been made to demolish the structures themselves.<br><br>The UN is due to send a special envoy to Zimbabwe to investigate the demolitions.<br><br>Many people are living on the streets, while others have returned to their rural homes, encouraged by the government.<br><br>Source: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4620977.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC News</a><br></blockquote>Man, its official. Africa is led by people who are either mad, or incredibly stupid. I especially like the Zimbabwean Police Chief's response:<br><br><blockquote>Mr Chihuri said that burglary and car-theft had declined by 20% since the operation began four weeks ago.</blockquote>Yes dear, crime has fallen. And you know what? There would be NO crime after you murder everyone in the country because, well, there would be no one left.<br><br>Another gem:<br><br><blockquote><br>AU spokesman Desmond Orjiako told the BBC's Network Africa programme: "If the government that they elected say they are restoring order by their actions, I don't think it would be proper for us to go interfering in their internal legislation."</blockquote>Uh-huh. So if Zimbabwe passes internal legislation that provides for the assimilation of the whole of africa into Zimbabwe? Why are there such stupid ppl around? And why aren't they in 'special' schools?<br><br>I've totally lost faith in evolution. Such people should have been extinct long ago.<br><br>PS: I think i posted this in the wrong forum. I realize there is really nothing SAF about this...except perhaps for the fact that i hope the SAF could help cull the leaders of Africa.</div>
