For other Gov/Stat most likely u can wait, for army, I think u have to periodically check if u really want to know.<br><br>2.) If u have a determine mind to slim down, i.e. diet cum excerise.

But u definately can ask.<br><br>5.) Depends on how the RO is for that day. If relac relac, nothing to do, ur officer gives the nod, ur camp got gym. Go ahead. Note .<br><br>6.)

            <div class='col-md body'>I think this set of answers will not be what you want to hear but it'll be the honest truth.<br><br>1) You WON'T get to choose when you enlist. It is very likely they already planned in advance a certain period for you to enlist. Calling to make it earlier is useless. If it's possible to make CMPB enlist you earlier then probably thousands would call CMPB to ask for the same thing so they can enter Uni earlier or start work earlier too.<br><br>2) If you're currently dreaming about having Superman's body and not DOING something about it NOW then the Army is not going to help. BMT does not have a miracle machine to churn out six packs.<br><br>If you're serious about losing weight start now, before you enter. When in BMT, there's also lots of free time. Approach your instructors for advice on how to train up and maybe even ask for permission to jog after training on slack days. If you can't do these, then just do basic exercises like in your bunk when free.<br><br>As for vocations,<br>You can't choose your vocation. In the case of Reece trooper you have toearn it by getting IPPT Silver or Gold with a 2.4 timing below 9:45 minutes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>3) You do not meet the educational criteria to be an officer. You are also in the lower end of people eligible to be a Specialist (a.k.a Sergeant). You have to work harder than those with ITE certs just to get into SISPEC. You might even be enlisted into a mono-intake and this would mean that your chances of going SISPEC would be extremely low.<br><br>4) You won't get big pockets. NS doesn't make people rich and if you don't make it to SISPEC, your pay might not be enough for you to save money.<br><br>5) No. You use the gym when you have gym lessons in BMT. You can try asking your instructors for permission to use the gym on slack days.<br><br>6) No idea about PA so I'm not qualified to answer.</div>
