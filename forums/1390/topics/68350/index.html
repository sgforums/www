            <div class='col-md body'>GOH CHIN LIAN goes to the home of the Red Berets in this last instalment of The Straits Times series on elite forces in the military and the police<br><br><strong>THE Red Berets wouldn't exist today if not for Project Toothpick, a secret plan hatched more than 35 years ago.<br></strong><br>Spearheaded by then defence minister, Dr Goh Keng Swee, the plan was to assemble an elite unit of land and naval commandos to counter would-be saboteurs using unconventional warfare and guerilla tactics.<br><br>The first intake of 30 regulars in December 1969 has grown into an army formation made up of battalions of regulars, full-time national servicemen (NSFs) and NSmen.<br><br>Their status as an elite airborne combat unit today is signified by the winged bayonet on their crest.<br><br>They take only the best.<br><br>Said Chief Commando Officer Yeo Eidik, 44: 'We look for people who can take challenges. We don't want people who sit back.'<br><br>But superhuman fitness isn't a recruitment must.<br><br>'Nobody is born to dive, parachute or to run fast. As long as they have a few physical and mental attributes, most people can be trained,' he said.<br><br>Every six months, they try out a fresh crop of 1,000 NSF enlistees with good eyesight and health. About 250 are chosen for three months of basic military training at the Commandos' base, Hendon Camp in Changi.<br><br>Then follows two months of training to teach them how to operate boats, rappel down from heights, plus demolition and other skills.<br><strong><br>The top 30 per cent train as section leaders and the others specialise in combat medicine, signals and support weapons, for example.</strong><br><strong><br>Of that 30 per cent, the top 20 per cent go on to train as officers.<br></strong><br>Another three months of platoon and company-level training for all follows.<br><br>They also learn to parachute in full combat gear, training that only the Commandos and members of the Naval Diving Unit are put through.<br><br>They get to know one another really well, said Corporal Sim Zhi Wei, 21, who will finish his national service in May.<br><br>'We recognise each other by our footsteps, by the way someone drags his slippers, and by our silhouettes when we go out for missions by night.'<br><strong><br>After more than 10 months of training, the finale is a 72km route march that ends with them receiving their red berets.<br><br>But of the initial 1,000, only 160 will make it that far.<br></strong><br>The training does toughen you up, said warrant officer Wong, 36, a commando for 19 years. He's done more than 300 free-falls.<br><br>Once, he said, his equipment wasn't hooked up properly and came loose in mid-air. His rucksack banged about so wildly he couldn't regain control. He vomited into his oxygen mask.<br><br>'I had no time to think of the vomit. All I wanted to do was to land in the drop zone so I could stay with the team and not be a burden to them.'<br><br>He made it and completed his mission.<br><strong><br>Many Commandos go through the Ranger course, reputed to be the SAF's toughest, where they get little food and sleep for 65 days.<br></strong><br>Ranger-trained Major Goh, 29, has been in the service for nine years. 'It's the closest reality to war.'<br><br>Commandos are trained to operate behind enemy lines. Usually in <strong>teams of five, they recce and strike at key targets, </strong>unlike conventional forces that are organised in larger units to fight battles.<br><br>Champion snipers and pistol shooters, some have won international honours and one has even trekked to the South Pole.<br><br>Some of the Red Berets have even topped training courses for America's elite troops, the United States Navy Seals and the US Special Forces, from which hundreds of dropouts are commonplace.<br><br>They also learn from regular visits by foreign special forces, including those from France, Australia, the US, Thailand and Indonesia.<br><br>Their training is dynamic and an upcoming change is a switch from taekwon-do, a Korean martial art, to its Japanese cousin, jujitsu, which has a more lethal edge.<br><br>Monitoring security threats, wherever they may come from, and preparing for them, is part of the drill.<br><br>When Chechen rebels seized a theatre in Moscow and took more than 700 hostages in 2002, for example, the Commandos trained in a theatre here to deal with a similar scenario.<br><br>Col Yeo said that his men must be nimble and flexible enough to handle uncertainty, and that means 'always changing the test questions, no model examination questions, and coming up with different scenarios for training exercises'.<br><br>It is not a matter of learning to deal with what terrorists came up with in their last operation.<br><br>He said: 'Our challenge is to anticipate new tricks by terrorists, and ask, do we have an answer?'<br><br><img src="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-02-02/red1.jpg"><br>These 'silent' warriors are trained to operate behind enemy lines. Usually in teams of five, the Commandos recce and strike at key targets deep in hostile territories.<br><br>--ST<br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=68351" rel="nofollow">see related</a>[/img]</div>

ST is doing this series on our elite forces mah. so o cos theres a scoop on them. i guess they r now on sensitive and wanna put a forth a face of humility and servitude rather than portray an image of arrogance and pride in the past, after those incidents. prob to do wif the new chief too.<br><br>or mabbe jus our own misperception?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, we had some tough hombres in those parts.  I think almost everybody there would remember one chap who used to get back into camp at three after drinks, and then be out for a 10K run at five every morning.<br><br>However, if there was one key factor in the unit's philosophy, it would be preparedness rather than toughness.  Typically, we would run about 20-25 rehearsals for our exercises - each run-through would be different, with different elements taken out of the company and everybody else covering their jobs.  As much as was possible, we worked out how we could complete the job using every permutation and combination.  At the same time, every man was given a shot at the leadership role, so that in the absence of a designated leader, we could still function normally as a unit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's about high time the cdo.s got an image makeover... and it seems like they got it.<br><br>The problem with many elite outfits is that the prevalance of code redness, where they cover up for each other whenever something goes wrong, even if whatever happened was wrong. The tendency is to forget that ones loyalty belongs to one duty to uphold ones oaths and vows before ones loyalty to each other. Such an attitude if led unchecked can lead to a increasing tendency for deviant behaviour in disregard for SOP until something really bad happens.<br><br>Of course being a commando does not make one automatically guilty of this, but the atmosphere for a liberal, self-protective place where breeches of SOP can go unchecked must be eliminated, as it should in any normal unit.<br><br>In the US Marine Corps, the Gunnery Sarge holds an almost legendary status even with those who outrank him, hence the onus to inpart the proper example and ideas to those under him is extremely important.<br><br>That's why those instructors and the chief got burnt very bad in the aftermath of the drowning.<br><br>Such was the case before the incident. Now that MINDEF has snipped it in the bud, you can say that the cdo.s have been given a shot in the arm and have rebuild themselves pretty well.<br><br>Of course, the cdo.s where not the only ones who had a makeover, the entire SAF is currently going a shakedown following some unfortunate incidents.</div>
