              <p style="margin-left: 36pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Based on FY 2008 budget, MINDEF contributes only $39 mil to government revenue but defence spending is $10.8 bil. In fact, MOE contributes more than MINDEF, with $42.8 mil. This is surprising since MINDEF also owns the defence industries and should thus, contribute more to government revenue. GST contributed $6.2 bil and personal income tax contributed $5.9 bil. Hence, the government revenue from our GST and income tax has all gone towards defence spending. </span></p>

              <p style="margin-left: 36pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">I’m not sure how much of our GST and personal income tax has really gone into improving the military capability for the defence of Singapore, or has they gone into the pockets of the SAF regulars? When MINDEF propose the SAVER scheme to the SAF regulars in 1998, it promised the SAF regulars a huge sum for their retirement upon their retirement at age of 42. However, a few mths ago it raised the retirement age of SAF regulars to 50 years old. This means that more of our GST and personal income tax will go into the pockets of the SAF regulars.</span></p>

              <p>*snigger at TS nick...</p>
              <p>to TS : you know the disadvantage of being a regular?</p>
              <p>if you decide to quit being regular,  lots of company will not recognise your working experience.</p>
              <p>You are push around inside by the management like an insignificant piece in a chess game because they think you are very much dependent on this job.</p>
              <p>having to sacrifice personnel time to complete work and attend to boss request.</p>
              <p>having to protect and provide deterence for the so call 'elites' who think they can rule over you and not appreciate you.</p>
              <p>having to protect and provide deterence for the very ppl who think regulars are over paid.</p>
              <p>so you still think regulars are having good pay? the only good about being regular is stable and proper pay, without that i dun think many will want to be regular.</p>
              <p><strong>fyi</strong></p>
              <p>saver schem is base on an investment linked growth. so you still think it is all your GST and Tax contribution?</p>
              <p>military defence by nature is a high expenditure organistion to safe guard other more critical and valuable social structure. You need to spend enough on improving defence in order to tip the scale to reduce protential gain for invaders whom envy our developement.</p>
              <p>as a correction, some high ranking regulars don't deserve to draw their pay.</p>

                                                  rubbish farmers. A look at the majority of the COL and LTC in SAF will yield this sorrowful picture of rubbish. This is not the way to encourage the rest of them and
                                                  definitely goes against the principle of meritocracy. There've also

                                                  down the drain in the next 10 years, because it was they alone who have been
