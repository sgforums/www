If your case is serious they might bring you to IMH for treatment and you will get Out Of Course but after you solved your psychological problems you have to return back to BMT.<br><br>Or you can talk to your PC, OC and OO about your problem but I doubt they can, or will, do much about it.<br><br>Or you can call SAF consuelling hotline to talk to the people there The number is 1800-2780022.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm curious here.Why do you want to "keng" ? Do you really have any medical problems?If not, why not take it one step at a time and see.What I've learnt in the army is that sometimes, you can keep on pushing for your way and nothing will be successful , but if you let the path take you, you can see things clearly and your life may be much smoother than you know.BMT is getting easier, you guys get duffel bags with wheels, may even get to book out in civilian clothes next year, and might not even need to serve confinement period.One thing I would recommend you do, go for a full-body checkup.That way you will know if you are medically fit or not.Do not trust CMPB.This is to enusre your safety in the army.But please do not go and declare 302 just because you feel that it will entitle you to a PES C classification.Do you know what are the implications of declaring yourself as 302?I'm sure you have read the previous answers.So yeah, be smart and not a sad kengster.I'm just being brutally honest here.You might experience worse inside.Good luck.</div>
