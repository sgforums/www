              <p> Any1 had similar experiece kindly share with me.  Currently my back does'nt me often, only when i do long periods of strenuous standing but i can jog, exercise like normal ppl do.</p>

              <p>pes status don't affect future work life.</p>
              <p>don't push your luck. millitary will make you carry loads of equipment if you up your pes or what.. since you have genuinely injured back before, just forget about it.</p>
              <p>be content with you still being able to do normal sports. if you want to lose weight, going pes C makes no difference.. only a slight change in BMT, once you ord, without a proper mindset on diet and workout, it's no difference..</p>
              <p>don't regret it when you old and have more problems with your back, if you decide to go up your pes..</p>

              <p>You have a good mindset<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png">.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think there are much more safer alternatives to upgrading though.A <strong>balanced diet</strong> will go a long way to helping your situation in a safe manner.If you can have the determination to get upgraded,you should be able to apply it to your diet too.With your current condition,you will most probably be excused alot of things even if you get upgraded.If you can't control your diet,that little amount of exercise might not help much at all.Just make sure you stay away from slimming pills,those things might do more harm than good for a person with medical condition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for needing the extra push,hasn't the doctor start sending you for physiotherapy sessions?Those simple exercises that they teach you are designed to help strengthen you progressively while taking into consideration of your injury.Most people would say physio no effect but that is because they don't follow through with it(eg.suppose to do everyday,but only do 2 days per week).They even have special programs for patients with weight problems,try asking your doctor about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's better to be sick than dead*touch wood*.At the end of the day,they have to answer to your parents so they would definitely not take unnecessary risks.</p>

              <p><br>Call CMPB again.Ask them to tell you your full PES status(i.e EXLX),you have a right to know.By right they should send out a Summary of Medical Status letter stating what PES you are and what kind of things you are excused the moment they give you your final grading even if it is another regrade.Ask them if they have sent out the letter cause they might miss it out.I  do not think they would be able to explain to you in detail why they classify you as E but I think it might be because a senior MO went through the pes bible more thoroughly and decided that E would be more appropriate for you.</p>

              <p>I happily played blur with my PES D classification till 1 week before I enlisted,I called up CMPB to check my final PES status.The staff said to me "You are PES A<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/cry.png" alt="cry.png">.Your grading was finalized about 2 months ago.You never receive the letter?"I said no and the staff apologized and said that it will be sent out.3 days before I went in,the letter came.</p>
