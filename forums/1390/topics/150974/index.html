But it seems that, it does not means that the medical reports from any government hospitals are really acceptable by them.<br><br>For eg.<br>My elder brother, his knee Cap for problem... got into PES C2L2... where the hospital doctor says that he's not suppose to do any heavy work at all.<br><br>Then later.... he went in... knee cap got to go for 2 operations after the forcing of training... until the last day of his ORD... still got MO say he is "Chao Keng" one...<br><br>The was a Sportsman... basketball lover... now.. after NS..and the 2 operations... he can't even lead normal life now... can't stand for long... walk for long... cannot run.. cannot jump... basically.... RUINED...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Do u guys know any doctors that are really powerful enough to prove my problem and that the MO at the medical centre will understand and respect the reports the doctor says?

That's why no matter which MO it is... unless... U know what? the worse ever thing is that when he calls up the hotline... The thing actually went down to the MO and S1 (Coz he's in S1 branch that time). He is accused of being mentally impaired and sent for mental check-up every wk... *I forgot which camp he went to for the mental check-up.. but it's for all the mental problem ppl*<br><br>He was forced unofficially to drop his so call "Complain" through the hotline....<br><br>Looking for another MO is also useless.... my brother was sent to the NUS medical HQ for decision... but becoz the MO who sends his currents report has got P.S in it... it's useless.... and<br><br>the worse thing is when his specialise didn't help him... and even says that "I did my job by juz giving him MCs as requested".... BULLSHIT!!! When we asked our specialise about why he's injuries hasn't recovered after the 2nd operation, he juz say things like "It just takes time", he'll automatically give MCs!!! + he is a specialise!!! How would he have given MCs when ppl doesn't have problems!!! and does it means that anyone can get MCs on request?!!!He says all of the above when the HQ MO asked about his MCs and conditions....<br><br>While one the other hand... when he was in BMT... he's direct Platoon Segent is the one who actually made him do "extra jobs" when he has the 6 mths MC for no heavy work... and there goes the 1st time operation.... he almost lose his leg... when he reaches the hospital... the doctor says that if he were to be late for another few hours... he would have lost his leg...<br><br>If wanna say complain to MP... tried... useless... covered...<br>Complain to CO? ... worse.. made his life more miserable for him... imagine... "IMMEDIATE ACTIONS" where made where special messages press on his superior... even the ones who are nice to him will also hate him now... make them troublesome... and things likdat....<br><br>That's why i need is powerful medical report from a specialise... do anyone hav one to recommend?</div>
