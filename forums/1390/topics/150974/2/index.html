The last time iwent to a specialise in SGH is like... hmm... The 1st time is like ard $100, and he sent me for scanning which cost $500~ then when i went for a second consultation after i got the result of my scanning, he juz say "Hmm... Your back bone is pressing on ur nervous, that's why you're feeling the pain but okay lar, can be really really painful but still dun nid to go for operation lar. I intro u to phyco therapy, juz go there and the therapist will tell u the price and detail, and i give you some painkiller".<br><br>Then the whole consultation ends liao... Then i pay another 100 bucks and went to get my painkiller... which cost another 50 bucks... (IT's damnit one whole big package... like it'll cure me =.=")<br><br>Then later on i went to the psycho therapist... The price of a course is ard 1k+++!!! Well, it's alright if it cures me... (That's what my mum and i think but...) When my mum asked the therapist many question and talk to her for quite a while, she told my mum "Frankly speaking, It is not confirm that therapy can help with your son's problem, and i'm also not sure why the doctor sent you for it also. But, if you wan, you can try?".<br><br>OMG WTF!!! If i juz go for a therapy that cost 1k which MAY not even help, then why do i have to travel all the way from Woodlands to SGH weekly for a therapy?!!! And travelling is also a stress to my pain!!! GRR....<br><br>I really hope that this time ard~ i can really seek a nice consultation from these doctors u recommend me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

I was born as a handicapped while my feet can only stand on tip toe... the hospital doctor wasn't able to cure it and was likely to declare me a handicap... but later on my mum bgt me to a chinese physcian and did managed to cure me leg when i was still a baby.<br><br>Also i did consult my family doctor before, my pain from flat foot is a growing process thingy. It is common for flat footed people to feel pain as he/she grow up unless the flat foot is not complete or is minor. The doctor also says that there are no cures to flat foot. (Btw, i hav oso consult a chinese physican for this but same things are heard).<br><br>btw, SAF make insole for flat feet... wht does it actually do?</div>
