              <p>I used to think those who refuses to put in much hardwork during their NSF period are the ones who'll have much to loose. With such attitude in life, they can hardly survive in the real world.</p>
              <p>Or so I thought.</p>
              <p>Recently, it seems to become more apparent to me that those who are more hardworking and willing to put in more effort in the things they do are actually the ones who are more stupid.</p>
              <p>Take for example, in order for the battalion or the company to do well, key appointments and responsibility are inevitably given to those who are more willing to work and deemed as more capable. Meanwhile, those slackers will just be tasked to help out the others (which they'll still try to siam as much as possible), being free of much responsibilities.</p>
              <p>Whenever something goes wrong, these appointment holders will naturally be blamed for it, since they are the ones who is taking up the responsibilities. This is despite all the hardwork they've put in their job. Meanwhile, those slackers need not accept any blame since they have not done nothing, since they've done nothing in the first place!</p>
              <p>What's worse is that at the end of the day, everyone will still ORD as Coporals together and receive the same pay throughout. No extra rewards for those who gave in more, nothing taken from those who try to siam as much work as possible.</p>
              <p>I know, as soldiers, we should be contributing without expectations of rewards in the first place. But to 'punish' those who are willing to work by giving them heavier responsibilities and more work while 'rewarding' the lazy by tasking them with easier works...something is wrong here isn't it?</p>
              <p>20-years-old NSFs aren't saint. How would you feel if you've been doing so much thing in one day only to realise someone else had been enjoying a much slacker day? How would you feel if you've been doing so much things and yet still blamed for some mistakes, while the one who've been doing nothing gets to escape it all?</p>
              <p>To take things in one's stride...surely there's a limit to it? How much longer can I go on like that?</p>
              <p>Perhaps I'm just being bias thinking that those slackers are actually...well, as slack as I thought. Perhaps I'm just exegerating the situation. I don't know. But what I do know is that I've come to find it so stupid to do so much anymore.</p>

              <p>Well at the end of the day, if u have a boss who appreciates ur hardwork, all by means do ur best in everything that he assigns to u. I'm lucky that i used to have appreciative bosses back in my NS days. If u do the job he assigns to u "chop chop" and "sui sui", its easy to earn a few "OFF days".I used to have a friend in the same office, because if academic qualifications, he was always arrowed with the more important and harder stuffs to do, while me who was poorer in comparison, was only arrowed with simpler and easier stuffs to do. Of course he complains once in a while but he understands thats how SAF works and we are still good friends even till now after Service.</p>
              <p>My advice to u is to do jobs that are assigned to u slowly but surely, meaning that u do it at ur own pace but just make sure that u do a good job, that was what i did last time. take one whole day to complete an "arrow" but hey at the very least i was doing something for that one whole day. Just do whatever that u are arrowed, dont be busybody and pick arrows on the floor and stab urself, cause if u end up screwing up, the one who kena jialat jialat is you in the end.</p>

              <p><br>I can fully understand what you mean. Which is why Seldom soldiers volunteer for any task.</p>
              <p>Utimately, you have to be confident to perform the job on hand, and often, no commander will delegate to you something that you may not be able to perform. But it is also an opportunity to measure you up and see where you stand. This is the army we are talking about, not some MNC. When one screws up, it may cost lives, not just money.</p>
              <p>We may see no wars, but we must always be prepared for it. Tasks performances are a good gauge to access one's ability during the strains and stress of war, which may not happen for a thousand years or it may just happen tomorrow. A commander needs to know his men, their strengths and limitations.</p>
              <p>No soldier is a saint and neither are commanders angels. Unless you had displease your superior or fail him in some way, then you are a marked man, destined for mediocrity, never to be trusted or depended on, which you must correct, not by arguing further, but by proving actions that you deserve better.</p>
              <p>It is only by making mistakes we learn, and paying the price - punishments, for it that we can improve ourselves. It is the experience that you will gain by performing additional jobs and responsibilities that sets you apart from others, capabilities that in a time of crisis, you will be depended upon and looked up to, for lives will be in your hands.</p>

Most people are more suited for white collar jobs, not voluteering could be due to a lack of physical fitness or confidence for doing army activities.

              <p>Defence is important for Singapore as we are a small country. Unless we are not going to stay here, ie migrate somewhere and don't come back, it is crucial to contribute to military.</p>
              <p>Sure, the 2 years may seem like a waste of time for many, but that's the basic that we learn in defence. And the ongoing in-camp after ORD is to keep proficient... " but there's no war, or threat of war" one may say... So sure there's no war... but no sure about threat of war... i think there's always a threat.</p>
              <p>There'll definitely be lots of people who are "slackers", or simply don't bother too much. But try to take each task as a learning experience, ie how to get things done, where to get resource. If it's a project, learn to plan, organise, execute.

              <p>I used to think those who refuses to put in much hardwork during their NSF period are the ones who'll have much to loose. With such attitude in life, they can hardly survive in the real world.</p>
              <p>Or so I thought.</p>
              <p>Recently, it seems to become more apparent to me that those who are more hardworking and willing to put in more effort in the things they do are actually the ones who are more stupid.</p>
              <p>Take for example, in order for the battalion or the company to do well, key appointments and responsibility are inevitably given to those who are more willing to work and deemed as more capable. Meanwhile, those slackers will just be tasked to help out the others (which they'll still try to siam as much as possible), being free of much responsibilities.</p>
              <p>Whenever something goes wrong, these appointment holders will naturally be blamed for it, since they are the ones who is taking up the responsibilities. This is despite all the hardwork they've put in their job. Meanwhile, those slackers need not accept any blame since they have not done nothing, since they've done nothing in the first place!</p>
              <p>What's worse is that at the end of the day, everyone will still ORD as Coporals together and receive the same pay throughout. No extra rewards for those who gave in more, nothing taken from those who try to siam as much work as possible.</p>
              <p>I know, as soldiers, we should be contributing without expectations of rewards in the first place. But to 'punish' those who are willing to work by giving them heavier responsibilities and more work while 'rewarding' the lazy by tasking them with easier works...something is wrong here isn't it?</p>
              <p>20-years-old NSFs aren't saint. How would you feel if you've been doing so much thing in one day only to realise someone else had been enjoying a much slacker day? How would you feel if you've been doing so much things and yet still blamed for some mistakes, while the one who've been doing nothing gets to escape it all?</p>
              <p>To take things in one's stride...surely there's a limit to it? How much longer can I go on like that?</p>
              <p>Perhaps I'm just being bias thinking that those slackers are actually...well, as slack as I thought. Perhaps I'm just exegerating the situation. I don't know. But what I do know is that I've come to find it so stupid to do so much anymore.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Hello! You have to accept the fact that those slackers do have their strengths as well. Try to understand how they think and 'adopt'  some of their attitudes , you will have an easier life.</p>

              <p>Yea if you are looking at allowance, yeah of course you get the same thing.</p>
              <p>What you miss out are the relationships you can build. Trust me, if you are a slacker in NS, your name will stink faster than a piece of bread left in the air for a few days.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, you need to know that life's not only about $$$. It's about the bonds you make and the times you shared together.</p>
