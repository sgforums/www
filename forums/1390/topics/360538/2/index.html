              <p>Slacker in NSF doesn't mean slacker in real life. Most people
              are more suited for white collar jobs, not voluteering could be due
              to a lack of physical fitness or confidence for doing army
              activities. Face it, in an office you don't have to remember silly
              procedures like asking to fall out etc. The person you call a
              slacker now could be a financial guru in 10 years time.</p>

              <p>lack of physical fitness is a tenable reason, but 'lack of confidence for doing army activities' is not. there isn't anything that requires your life and limb. It's just about doing what you have to because you have a sense of responsibility that you honor on the basis of principles, above and beyond the outcome ie ORDing at the same rank of corporal as a slacker.</p>

              <p>slacking during NS will not affect one's career because say, you happen to go to job interviews only in Saudi Arabia, for instance. i don't think slacking in NS affects one's career performance, but what it really is is an indication of someone's sense of responsibility and character to begin with. It's an indication of who he was even before he entered NS. He probably already had that character when he was in JC or poly. And of course that character stays with him in the workforce.</p>

              <p>wake up sunshine. Anyone who has a sponsorship to study in any local university such as NUS, NTU or SMU is not considered a scholar in the civil service, armed forces or company.</p>
              <p>In the SAF, only SAFOS scholars are considered and recognised as scholars. This is a fact verified and uttered about in high places repeatedly by generals (BGs) and service chiefs (COA, CAF, CNV) and perm secs.

              <p>I used to think those who refuses to put in much hardwork during
              their NSF period are the ones who'll have much to loose. With such
              attitude in life, they can hardly survive in the real world.</p>
              <p>Or so I thought.</p>
              <p>Recently, it seems to become more apparent to me
              that those who are more hardworking and willing to put in
              more effort in the things they do are actually the ones who are
              more stupid.</p>
              <p>Take for example, in order for the battalion or the company to
              do well, key appointments and responsibility are inevitably
              given to those who are more willing to work and deemed as more
              capable. Meanwhile, those slackers will just be tasked to help out
              the others (which they'll still try to siam as much as
              possible), being free of much responsibilities.</p>
              <p>Whenever something goes wrong, these appointment holders will
              naturally be blamed for it, since they are the ones who is taking
              up the responsibilities. This is despite all the hardwork they've
              put in their job. Meanwhile, those slackers need not
              accept any blame since they have not done nothing, since they've
              done nothing in the first place!</p>
              <p>What's worse is that at the end of the day, everyone will still
              ORD as Coporals together and receive the same pay throughout. No
              extra rewards for those who gave in more, nothing taken from those
              who try to siam as much work as possible.</p>
              <p>I know, as soldiers, we should be contributing without
              expectations of rewards in the first place. But to 'punish' those
              who are willing to work by giving them heavier responsibilities and
              more work while 'rewarding' the lazy by tasking them with easier
              works...something is wrong here isn't it?</p>
              <p>20-years-old NSFs aren't saint. How would you feel if you've
              been doing so much thing in one day only to realise someone else
              had been enjoying a much slacker day? How would you feel if <span style="font-weight: bold;">you've
              been doing so much things and yet still blamed for some mistakes,
              while the one who've been doing nothing gets to escape it all?</span></p>
              <p>To take things in one's stride...surely there's a limit to it?
              How much longer can I go on like that?</p>
              <p>Perhaps I'm just being bias thinking that those slackers are
              actually...well, as slack as I thought. Perhaps I'm just
              exegerating the situation. I don't know. But what I do know is that
              I've come to find it so stupid to do so much anymore.</p>

              <p>TS i strongly agree with you. i have frens who are regular in
                                          not just saf but oso spf and scdf.</p>
              <p>they are all facing this prob. people who dun work just stay low
                                          profile. every 2 years they promote. but those who work very hard
                                          they make a mistake and kena condemn or they work hard but oso kena
                                          promote on the same year of those slacker.</p>
              <p>sad to said sometime working hard alone is nt enought to
                                          survive. sometime have to wayang......</p>
              <p>this is also the reason why out gov section is oso not efficient
                                          cause not all good worker is recognize. those slackers , wayang
                                          king and queens end up promoting to higher rank and good workers
                                          resign because their work not recognize.</p>
              <p>gov section seldom have talent..... due to this culture. most
                                          talent would rather stay their own bussinese or go private
                                          sector.</p>

              <p>There's no way wayang farmers anywhere from armed forces, ministries or anywhere in the public sector get promoted once in 2 yrs. The only people who move up a rank once in 2 yrs in the SAF are scholars.</p>
              <p>What is well known as facts since time immemorial by academics (which means professors), the government themselves, its critics and NUS farmer bloggers..is:</p>
              <p>The cream of the cohort is creamed off at the top with PSC scholarships <span style="text-decoration: underline;">overseas </span>to work in the government sector, the rest who are farmers go to the private sector eg teraexa.</p>
              <p>The farmers in the public sector (NUS/NTU/SMU graduates in the uniformed services, ministries and stat boards) are no worse or no better performers than the farmers of the private sector. So don't be so quick to flame your compatriots in the public sector.</p>
              <p>No one in the public sector (armed forces, ministries, stat boards) with local degrees are considered scholars by the public sector except a very small number of PS of the past.</p>

              <p>Your experience isn't limited to NSF.</p>
              <p>During ATEC, if you are the CO, and planning your mission, which OC would you assign the toughest mission and which OC would you assign the easiest?</p>
              <p>Obviously you assign the crappiest OC with the simplest non-mission, and the most capable and intelligent OC with the toughest one. So that you enjoy the highest probability of your own plan and the result of your unit at ATEC becoming a success lah. This is simple logic. It makes sense and it follows through with rationality of the world. And isn't limited to NSF.</p>
              <p>Its also the same in the private sector. The boss will give the important jobs to the subordinate that he perceives to have the most liao. of cos the subordinate with the worst ranking and image in the boss's eyes, will get the most boliao jobs and tasks.</p>
              <p>So that the boss himself can rest assured. It is called trust. And it is what you are experiencing now. Its not a bad thing. And it speaks volume of your inherent character.</p>
