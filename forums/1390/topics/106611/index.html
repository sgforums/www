Cos I have some personal reasons but I considering whether to sound off or not.</div></blockquote>whether one is required to stay-in depends on the requirements of his vocation - whether there is training / ops daily, whether there are certain considerations for one to stay out, etc. hence e.g. clerks are not required to stay in, while an infantry soldier will normally have to due to daily trg or ops functions. i am not sure what a dental assistant does, although it certainly doesnt sound like a cheong sua type of vocation to me, and i also think that since the medical centre has a closing hour it may not be necessary for all the medics and dental assistants to be around all the time. i may be wrong though. if you have good reasons you may wish to speak to your immediate superior. that would be the best move.</div>
