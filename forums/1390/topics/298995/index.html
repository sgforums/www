As others mentioned, you'll be there for your entire NS life, everyone have to depend on each other for the next 2 yrs and for the next 10 reservist cycles.<br><br>If you really can't fit in with the general population, try to find a few people who are more similar to you and start from there.

            <div class='col-md body'>hey bro. i think you should not disappoint your sarge. do everything you can to make sure that you do a good job on being a platoon IC. it is time to wake up your idea. you're gonna meet all kinds of people in the future and if you don't take this chance to speak up and expand your social circle, i think your situation will be much worse after you ORD and enter the working world. right now, don't care about what others think of you, their opinions about you don't matter; what matters is how you look at yourself as a person. do your best in your role as IC, get the commands right and project your voice. if you need help with commands, ask your sarge, i'm sure he'll be there to help you.<br><br>this is your chance to show them what you got.</div>
