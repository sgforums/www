              <p>Guys I have a question. I have a friend who was born in Australia. Apparently his parents, both Singaporeans, both ran there because there was some disagreements between the 2 families about them getting married. So anyway, when he was around 3 he came to Singapore and apparently got S'pore citizenship. (He has a pink IC now.)</p>
              <p>So what I'm asking is this. He is 17 now, and is going to MDIS after screwing his Os. After MDIS,(which is about a year), is he liable for NS or can he just ciao to Aussieland?(that's what he keeps telling me). OH and btw, he has had to defer for NS and stuff like that, judging by the letters he received. So.....? Thanks guys.</p>

              <p>As Rednano pointed out, once you have been issued with the pink IC, you are liable for NS. You cannot choose to renounce your citizenship until you completed your NS obligation. I know that's a stupid policy but that's Singapore for you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Short Ninja, I suppose your son has been living in Japan all his life. If this is the case, then yes, he can renounce Singapore citizenship. Not sure whether he can choose to retain PR or has to apply for PR.</p>

              <p>On the PR thingy, If you are planning to bring the whole family back here to stay for a longer period then also avoid the SG PR. Get a student pass for your kid, etc. 2nd Generation PR needs to serve also. (If you take PR, ur kid auto become 2nd Gen PR)</p>
              <p>It is not that I am recommending ppl to avoid NS, it is just that if a kid grows up elsewhere and not in sg. He wil have a hard time adjusting to the local culture or even the NS culture, let alone understanding the need to fight for sg. I mean even for locals can't even believe how a good military system can get so FUBAR in sg.</p>

              <p>On the PR thingy, If you are planning to bring the whole family back here to stay for a longer period then also avoid the SG PR. Get a student pass for your kid, etc. 2nd Generation PR needs to serve also. (If you take PR, ur kid auto become 2nd Gen PR)</p>
              <p>It is not that I am recommending ppl to avoid NS, it is just that if a kid grows up elsewhere and not in sg. He wil have a hard time adjusting to the local culture or even the NS culture, let alone understanding the need to fight for sg. I mean even for locals can't even believe how a good military system can get so FUBAR in sg.</p>

              <p>your friend should serve:</p>
              <p>1) he can't come back if he leaves, he'll be arrested for desertation, if im correct you need to serve NS if you have been here since at least 11.</p>

              <p>Short Ninja, your son should be eligible for renounciation of citizenship without having to serve NS, as he has never enjoyed "benefits and privileges of citizenship", and has stayed for less than 10 years prior to enlistment age.</p>

              <p>Guys I have a question. I have a friend who was born in
              Australia. Apparently his parents, both Singaporeans, both ran
              there because there was some disagreements between the 2 families
              about them getting married. So anyway, when he was around 3 he came
              to Singapore and apparently got S'pore citizenship. (He has a pink
              IC now.)</p>
              <p>So what I'm asking is this. He is 17 now, and is going to MDIS
              after screwing his Os. After MDIS,(which is about a year), is he
              liable for NS or can he just ciao to Aussieland?(that's what he
              keeps telling me). OH and btw, he has had to defer for NS and stuff
              like that, judging by the letters he received. So.....? Thanks
              guys.</p>

              <p>If your friend has stayed in Singapore since he was 3, and is a NRIC holder, he has to serve before he can give up his citizenship.</p>
              <p>He can leave for Australia, but he might be arrested upon return as a deserter.</p>
