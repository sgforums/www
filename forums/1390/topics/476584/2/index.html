              <h3><strong>National Service - a critical need, a solemn duty and a shared responsibility</strong></h3>
              <p> </p>
              <p>National Service (NS) is the cornerstone of Singapore's defence. Our 
              National Servicemen are the backbone of Singapore's defence.  With our 
              small population, NS is the only way for Singapore to maintain a strong 
              and credible defence force to protect our independence and sovereignty.</p>
              <p>NS is a rite of passage, a national effort and a shared 
              responsibility. The commitment of our National Servicemen to defence is 
              not possible without the strong support from their families, friends and
               <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/nsmatters/employers/support_for_employers.html"><strong>employers</strong></a>.</p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>The NS Journey</strong></p>
              <p>Our National Servicemen serve in a variety of operational roles in 
              the SAF, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the Singapore Civil 
              Defence Force (SCDF).</p>
              <p>The NS journey comprises 2 years of full-time NS and 10 years of 
              Operationally Ready NS (ORNS). This is the time needed to train our 
              Servicemen so that they are proficient in military skills and are 
              operationally ready, both as individuals and as part of a cohesive 
              fighting unit.</p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Understanding our National Servicemen</strong></p>
              <p>As far as possible, we try to help our Servicemen balance their 
              personal plans and persuits - in education, career and family, with 
              their NS commitments, without compromising training and operational 
              readiness.     </p>
              <p>For example, with improvements to technology and training methods, 
              the SAF has been able to reduce the duration of full-time NS from 2 1/2 
              years to 2 years (2004) without sacrificing training standards. 
               Similarly, in 2006, we reduced the duration of Operationally Ready NS 
              (ORNS) from 13 years to 10 years.</p>
              <p>For In-Camp Trainings (ICTs), while we cannot accede to every request
               for deferment, commanders do try to exercise flexibility to help NSmen 
              meet their civilian obligations without sacrificing the training of the 
              unit.</p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Going beyond the call of duty</strong></p>
              <p>Many National Servicemen have gone beyond the call of duty because of
               their strong belief and commitment to National Defence and their fellow
               National Servicemen.  For example, a number have volunteered under the 
              Voluntary Extension of Service (VES) scheme to extend their full-time NS
               to serve their unit beyond the 2 years.  Under the Reservist On 
              Voluntary Extended Reserve Service (ROVERS) scheme, NSmen have 
              volunteered for ICTs beyond their 10-year training cycle.</p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Recognising our National Servicemen</strong></p>
              <p>What our National Serviceman does is vital to the peace and 
              prosperity we enjoy as Singaporeans. A price cannot be put to their 
              contributions. </p>
              <p>But to show our appreciation, we have instituted several measures to 
              let them know that we recognise the personal sacrifices they have made 
              for all of us.</p>

              <p>Though Singapore only gained her current version of armed forces
              in 1967, the history of her defence started long before then. Under
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/the_early_years/v01n02b_history.html"> colonial rule that started in 1819</a>, Singapore relied on British
              forces to protect her from all threats. A turning point occurred in
              1854 with the creation of the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/the_early_years/v11n07_history.html"> Singapore Volunteer Rifle Corps (SVRC)</a>, a volunteer
              organisation to maintain internal security.</p>
              <p>In 1888, the SVRC became the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/the_early_years/v09n02_history.html"> Singapore Volunteer Artillery (SVA)</a>, and its success prompted
              formation of other volunteer corps.  In 1901, these were all
              consolidated into the Singapore Volunteer Corps (SVC). In 1922, the
              SVC was renamed the Straits Settlements Volunteer Force (SSVF) to
              include volunteer forces from Malacca and Penang.</p>
              <p>In December 1941, the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v01n12_history.html"> Japanese campaign into South East Asia</a> had begun. The British
              commanders had thought that Singapore was an "impregnable
              fortress", but troops stationed here were inexperienced compared to
              the Japanese forces.. On 10 Dec 1941, disaster struck when two
              British battleships, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v08n12_history.html"> Repulse and Prince of Wales</a>, were sunk by <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v10n12_history.html"> Japanese planes</a>. On 8 February, the Japanese crossed the narrow
              Straits of Johore into Kranji and Sarimbun, beginning their
              invasion of Singapore. For the next seven days, the British put up
              stiff resistance but were no match for the Japanese. Volunteer
              forces also fought alongside regular forces in the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v02n02_history.html"> Battles of Bukit Timah and Pasir Panjang</a> to fend off the
              Japanese. Despite all their efforts, on 15th February 1942, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v01n02a_history.html"> Singapore was surrendered</a>.</p>
              <p>During the Japanese occupation, the Straits Settlements
              Volunteer Force (SSVF) and local forces were indispensable to the
              war effort. SSVF corpswoman <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v07n10_history.html"> Elizabeth Choy</a> was detained and interrogated by the Kempeitai
              alongside other locals following the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v03n10_history.html"> Double Tenth Massacre</a>. Men and women such as <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v02n06_history.html"> Lim Bo Seng</a> joined special operations forces, gathered
              intelligence and fought where they could. The Chinese in
              Singapore's volunteer armies were targeted during the Sook Ching
              Massacre, or sent with other prisoners of war to build the Death
              Railway.</p>
              <p>In May 1945, the war in Europe ended with <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v09n05_history.html"> Germany's surrender</a>. Soon after, the bombing of Hiroshima and
              Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August 1945 respectively signalled the end of
              Japan's war efforts. On 15 August 1945, the Japanese invaders in
              Singapore <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v09n05_history.html"> laid down their arms</a> and the Japanese occupation was over.</p>
              <div>
              <p>The perceived failure of the British to defend Singapore against
              the Japanese during WWII caused Singaporeans to desire greater
              autonomy from the British and precipitated the formation of the
              Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). The Straits Settlements Volunteer
              Force (SSVF), which had been dissolved, was reinstated in 1949 as
              the SVC to keep peace domestically.</p>
              <p>The year 1957 saw the establishment of the first battalion of
              regular soldiers, the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v02n11_history.html"> First Singapore Infantry Regiment</a> (1 SIR). <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v03n04_history.html"> 2 SIR</a> joined 1 SIR in 1962. Their first real test came in 1963
              in the form of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v03n04_history.html"> Konfrantasi</a>. 1 SIR, 2 SIR, the Singapore Volunteer Corps (SVC)
              and the Vigilante Corps (VC) were all deployed to protect
              strategically important sites. The VC found incredible support from
              citizens, with 91.4% of eligible men volunteering.</p>
              <p>On 9 August 1965, after more than 100 years of British colonial
              rule and two tumultuous years under the Malaysian Federation,
              Singapore was declared a sovereign and independent nation. It was a
              time of great uncertainty as the leaders were faced with the
              enormous task of charting the path of our national destiny.
              Nevertheless, Singapore was determined to not only survive on its
              own but to succeed.</p>
              <p>An urgent priority after independence was to build up
              Singapore's own defence capability. Singapore then had only two
              infantry battalions of 50 officers and some 1,000 men and two
              ships. There was no airforce. Singapore's armed forces had to be
              created virtually from scratch.</p>
              <p>In August 1965, the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v07n11_history.html"> Ministry of the Interior and Defence</a> (MID) was established with
              Dr. Goh Keng Swee as its first Minister. The key priority then was
              to build up the Army into a credible force as soon as possible.
              With its small population and the need to channel resources to
              economic development, it was decided that Singapore's defence would
              be based on citizen armed forces. However, there was no military
              tradition in Singapore. The bulk of the population had
              traditionally held military service in low esteem. An intense
              educational effort was required to overcome such attitudes.
              Ministers, Members of Parliament, senior civil servants and
              community leaders volunteered to serve in the People's Defence
              Force. In this way, they set an example and drove home the message
              that it was the responsibility of every citizen to defend their
              nation.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v06n02_history.html"> National Service</a> started two years later in 1967. The NS
              (Amendment) Bill, 1967 was first read in Parliament on 27 Feb 1967.
              After a spirited debate in Parliament, the Act was finally passed
              on 14 Mar 1967.</p>
              <p>The passing of the NS (Amendment) Act in mid-Mar 1967 was a
              turning point in the lives of Singaporean males. Between 28 Mar and
              18 Apr 1967, registration began in earnest at the Central Manpower
              Base (CMPB) and its district offices in Katong, Serangoon and Bukit
              Panjang. Pink reminder cards were sent by post to the first batch
              of citizens who were born between 1 Jan 1949 and 30 Jun 1949 - some
              9,000 of them. This marked the beginning of the citizen army and
              also the start of NS as a way of life for the male citizens of
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v13n07_history.html"> Republic of Singapore Navy</a> (RSN) began as the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v10n01_history.html"> Singapore Naval Volunteer Force</a> (SNVF) in 1966 with just three
              ships, RSS Panglima, RSS Bedok and RSS Singapura. RSS Singapura,
              moored at Telok Ayer Basin, served as the SNVF's first
              headquarters. Thus, the newly formed naval force had only two
              seaworthy ships to form its sea defences.</p>
              <p>What the SNVF lacked in resources was made up for in
              determination and hard work. Though a small force to begin with,
              the SNVF underwent a period of rapid growth and development. It had
              started off with former members of the Royal Malaysian Navy, who
              were mobilised to form the nucleus of the fledgling force. The
              following year saw the SNVF boost its numbers to 89 mobilised
              personnel and 278 volunteer officers and men. Some were women from
              the Singapore Women's Auxiliary Naval Service (or SWANS), which had
              been formed in 1957. On 5 May 1967, the Singapore Naval White
              Ensign was hoisted with pride, signalling that Singapore finally
              had a navy to call its own. There was no looking back from then on,
              as it embarked on a gradual upgrading of its equipment, personnel
              and facilities. From the two ships in 1966, it subsequently grew
              into a modern force, and officially was renamed the “Republic of
              Singapore Navy” in April 1975.</p>
              <p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v02n09_history.html"> Republic of Singapore Air Force</a> also has very modest
              beginnings. In 1968, the Singapore Air Defence Command (SADC) was
              formed. It started with eight <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v08n05_history.html"> Cessna 172-H</a> aircraft to train its pilots, and by 1970 <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v12n12_history.html"> Hawker Hunter</a> fighter aircraft had been added to the fleet.
              When the British forces were withdrawn in 1971, Tengah, Seletar,
              Sembawang and Changi airbases were entrusted to the SADC. SADC
              became the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) in 1975.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of the Interior and Defence (MID) initially oversaw
              both internal and external defence, but as the defence structure
              grew and the work became more defined, it separated into two
              specialised ministries. Thus, the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and
              the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mha.gov.sg">Ministry of Home
              Affairs</a> (MHA) were formed in 1970.</p>
              <p>When the SAF first started in the 1960s, the most urgent focus
              for what we now call the 1st Generation SAF was to provide for
              Singapore's basic defence. The 2nd Generation SAF, from the early
              80s to late 90s, saw the upgrading and modernising of our Army,
              Navy and Air Force. Post-9/11, there was a shift in the security
              landscape, which widened to include non-conventional threats such
              as terrorism and piracy.</p>
              <p>Resource constraints and the emergence of advanced warfighting
              technologies also drove the SAF to rethink our development
              trajectory. To meet new security challenges effectively, the SAF
              embarked on a 3rd Generation transformation journey in 2004 and
              continues today to upgrade its capabilities into an advanced
              networked force.</p>

              <div>Today, the SAF is respected as a strong and professional armed
              forces. The SAF has developed leading-edge capabilities, networked
              together as an integrated fighting system.</div>

              <p>As DEFENCE policymakers here consider roping in more female volunteers, 
                                Singapore is looking at its European counterparts to learn how they get 
                                women to do their part for defence.<br> <br> Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen is leading a delegation on a visit to Finland and Switzerland to study their conscription system.<br> <br> On the team are senior Defence Ministry officials and members of the 
                                high-level Committee to Strengthen National Service (CSNS), including 
                                Minister of State for Defence Mohamad Maliki Osman and MP for Nee Soon 
                                GRC Lim Wee Kiak.<br> <br> On his visit to Finland which began on Wednesday, Dr Ng called on his 
                                counterpart, Mr Carl Haglund and other top-level defence officials, 
                                including the Commander of the Finnish Defence Forces General Ari 
                                Puheloinen.<br> <br> Mindef said in a statement yesterday that the delegation was briefed on 
                                Finland's defence policy and conscription system, including the Finnish 
                                voluntary military service for women.</p>
              <p>Since the volunteer scheme started in 1995, about 400 Finnish women are drafted each year. A 2012 survey showed more than 70 per cent of Finns support compulsory national service. During its visit to the Finnish Armoured Brigade, the delegation saw how
                                 soldiers were trained and was briefed on how the military matched their
                                 aptitudes and preferences to their vocations.<br> <br> The visit is part of efforts by the CSNS to canvass feedback on its area
                                 of concern. Proposals will be submitted to the Government early next 
                                year.<br> <br> Dr Ng said it was useful to learn from Finland's experience, as it, like
                                 Singapore, "guards its independence and sovereignty fiercely, having 
                                been colonised and occupied in its past". "Even after nearly a century, 
                                it has still kept its commitment to conscription for this primary 
                                purpose."</p>

              <p>We want to engage Singaporeans on NS and many Singaporeans have already been thinking about ways to strengthen NS.</p>
