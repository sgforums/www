              <p>As DEFENCE policymakers here consider roping in more female
                                volunteers, Singapore is looking at its European counterparts to
                                learn how they get women to do their part for defence.<br> <br> Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen is leading a delegation on a visit to
                                Finland and Switzerland to study their conscription system.<br> <br> On the team are senior Defence Ministry officials and members of
                                the high-level Committee to Strengthen National Service (CSNS),
                                including Minister of State for Defence Mohamad Maliki Osman and MP
                                for Nee Soon GRC Lim Wee Kiak.<br> <br> On his visit to Finland which began on Wednesday, Dr Ng called on
                                his counterpart, Mr Carl Haglund and other top-level defence
                                officials, including the Commander of the Finnish Defence Forces
                                General Ari Puheloinen.<br> <br> Mindef said in a statement yesterday that the delegation was
                                briefed on Finland's defence policy and conscription system,
                                including the Finnish voluntary military service for women.</p>
              <p>Since the volunteer scheme started in 1995, about 400 Finnish
                                women are drafted each year. A 2012 survey showed more than 70 per
                                cent of Finns support compulsory national service. During its visit
                                to the Finnish Armoured Brigade, the delegation saw how soldiers
                                were trained and was briefed on how the military matched their
                                aptitudes and preferences to their vocations.<br> <br> The visit is part of efforts by the CSNS to canvass feedback on its
                                area of concern. Proposals will be submitted to the Government
                                early next year.<br> <br> Dr Ng said it was useful to learn from Finland's experience, as it,
                                like Singapore, "guards its independence and sovereignty fiercely,
                                having been colonised and occupied in its past". "Even after nearly
                                a century, it has still kept its commitment to conscription for
                                this primary purpose."</p>

              <p>Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen led a delegation comprising
              members from the Committee to Strengthen National Service (CSNS) on
              a visit to Finland from 16 to 17 October 2013 to study its
              conscription system. The delegation included Minister of State for
              Defence Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman and Chairman of the Government
              Parliamentary Committee for Defence and Foreign Affairs Dr Lim Wee
              Kiak.</p>
              <p>During the visit, Dr Ng met with Finnish Minister of Defence
              Carl Haglund, State Secretary to the Minister of Defence Marcus
              Rantala, Permanent Secretary of Defence Lieutenant General Arto
              Räty, Commander of the Finnish Defence Forces General Ari
              Puheloinen, and Chairman of the Finnish Parliament's Defence
              Committee Jussi Niinistö. Dr Ng's visit underscores the friendly
              defence relations between Singapore and Finland.</p>
              <p>The delegation was briefed on Finland's security and defence
              policy, and its conscription system. The delegation noted that
              public support for conscription in Finland is high. In a survey
              conducted in 2012, more than 70% of the public supported the
              conscription system. The delegation also learnt more about the
              voluntary military service available to women since 1995. Each
              year, about 400 Finnish women are accepted as volunteer military
              conscripts.</p>
              <p>The delegation visited the Finnish Armoured Brigade in
              Parolannummi to learn more about basic, vocational and leadership
              training for military conscripts. The delegation was also briefed
              on how conscripts' aptitudes and preferences are taken into
              consideration for deployment. During the visit, the delegation had
              the opportunity to interact with conscripts and witnessed their
              rigorous training.</p>
              <p>At the end of the visit, Dr Ng highlighted that "even though
              Singapore's security and domestic landscape is different from
              Finland, it is useful to study the conscription system of Finland
              and learn from their experiences. Like Singapore, Finland guards
              its independence and sovereignty fiercely, having been colonised
              and occupied in its past. Even after nearly a century, it has still
              kept its commitment to conscription for this primary purpose. It
              has been a meaningful trip for the CSNS delegation as we consider
              how to build on the strong public support for National Service in
              Singapore by expanding opportunities for the broader community to
              contribute to national defence, and optimise the contributions of
              national servicemen."</p>
              <p>The visit is part of the CSNS' effort to study best practices in
              other countries as it examines measures to strengthen NS in
              Singapore. The delegation is currently in Switzerland studying its
              conscription system.</p>

              <p>Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen, who led a CSNS delegation to
              study conscription systems, was in Finland from 16 to 17 October
              2013 and in Switzerland from 17 to 18 October 2013. The delegation
              included Minister of State for Defence Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman
              and Chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Defence
              and Foreign Affairs Dr Lim Wee Kiak.</p>
              <p>While in Switzerland, Dr Ng was hosted by and met President of
              the Swiss Confederation and Head of the Federal Department of
              Defence, Civil Protection and Sport Ueli Maurer. He also met Chief
              of the Swiss Armed Forces Lieutenant General (LG) André Blattmann
              and Commander of the Swiss Air Force LG Aldo Schellenberg. The
              visit underscores the friendly defence relations between Singapore
              and Switzerland.</p>
              <p>The delegation was briefed on the Swiss conscription system. It
              was noted that Switzerland has enjoyed peace for more than two
              hundred years and there continues to be strong public support for
              conscription. The delegation also learnt how the Swiss Armed Forces
              strengthens employers' support for conscription through various
              engagement activities, which allow the employers to better
              appreciate how military training develops the individual and brings
              value to their companies.</p>
              <p>The delegation visited Payerne Air Base and was briefed on how
              conscripts support the operations of the air base. The delegation
              also interacted with Swiss reservists on their annual refresher
              training and learnt how they maintained their military skills and
              technical competencies.</p>
              <p>Speaking at the end of the trip, Dr Ng said, "The Swiss take
              great pride in their conscription system which has maintained their
              neutrality and independence and receives strong support through the
              generations. The Swiss Armed Forces has an efficient conscript
              training system which takes into consideration conscripts'
              abilities, motivation and aptitude during the assignment of
              military vocations. Women can also volunteer for conscription. The
              CSNS will review the lessons learnt and consider ways to optimise
              the contributions of our servicemen."</p>
              The third phase of public consultation by the CSNS will involve
              discussion of proposals in more detail. Members of the public who

              <p>Though Singapore only gained her current version of armed forces
              in 1967, the history of her defence started long before then. Under
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/the_early_years/v01n02b_history.html"> colonial rule that started in 1819</a>, Singapore relied on British
              forces to protect her from all threats. A turning point occurred in
              1854 with the creation of the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/the_early_years/v11n07_history.html"> Singapore Volunteer Rifle Corps (SVRC)</a>, a volunteer
              organisation to maintain internal security.</p>
              <p>In 1888, the SVRC became the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/the_early_years/v09n02_history.html"> Singapore Volunteer Artillery (SVA)</a>, and its success prompted
              formation of other volunteer corps.  In 1901, these were all
              consolidated into the Singapore Volunteer Corps (SVC). In 1922, the
              SVC was renamed the Straits Settlements Volunteer Force (SSVF) to
              include volunteer forces from Malacca and Penang.</p>
              <p>In December 1941, the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v01n12_history.html"> Japanese campaign into South East Asia</a> had begun. The British
              commanders had thought that Singapore was an "impregnable
              fortress", but troops stationed here were inexperienced compared to
              the Japanese forces.. On 10 Dec 1941, disaster struck when two
              British battleships, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v08n12_history.html"> Repulse and Prince of Wales</a>, were sunk by <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v10n12_history.html"> Japanese planes</a>. On 8 February, the Japanese crossed the narrow
              Straits of Johore into Kranji and Sarimbun, beginning their
              invasion of Singapore. For the next seven days, the British put up
              stiff resistance but were no match for the Japanese. Volunteer
              forces also fought alongside regular forces in the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v02n02_history.html"> Battles of Bukit Timah and Pasir Panjang</a> to fend off the
              Japanese. Despite all their efforts, on 15th February 1942, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v01n02a_history.html"> Singapore was surrendered</a>.</p>
              <p>During the Japanese occupation, the Straits Settlements
              Volunteer Force (SSVF) and local forces were indispensable to the
              war effort. SSVF corpswoman <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v07n10_history.html"> Elizabeth Choy</a> was detained and interrogated by the Kempeitai
              alongside other locals following the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v03n10_history.html"> Double Tenth Massacre</a>. Men and women such as <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v02n06_history.html"> Lim Bo Seng</a> joined special operations forces, gathered
              intelligence and fought where they could. The Chinese in
              Singapore's volunteer armies were targeted during the Sook Ching
              Massacre, or sent with other prisoners of war to build the Death
              Railway.</p>
              <p>In May 1945, the war in Europe ended with <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v09n05_history.html"> Germany's surrender</a>. Soon after, the bombing of Hiroshima and
              Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August 1945 respectively signalled the end of
              Japan's war efforts. On 15 August 1945, the Japanese invaders in
              Singapore <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/world_war2/v09n05_history.html"> laid down their arms</a> and the Japanese occupation was over.</p>
              <div>
              <p>The perceived failure of the British to defend Singapore against
              the Japanese during WWII caused Singaporeans to desire greater
              autonomy from the British and precipitated the formation of the
              Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). The Straits Settlements Volunteer
              Force (SSVF), which had been dissolved, was reinstated in 1949 as
              the SVC to keep peace domestically.</p>
              <p>The year 1957 saw the establishment of the first battalion of
              regular soldiers, the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v02n11_history.html"> First Singapore Infantry Regiment</a> (1 SIR). <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v03n04_history.html"> 2 SIR</a> joined 1 SIR in 1962. Their first real test came in 1963
              in the form of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v03n04_history.html"> Konfrantasi</a>. 1 SIR, 2 SIR, the Singapore Volunteer Corps (SVC)
              and the Vigilante Corps (VC) were all deployed to protect
              strategically important sites. The VC found incredible support from
              citizens, with 91.4% of eligible men volunteering.</p>
              <p>On 9 August 1965, after more than 100 years of British colonial
              rule and two tumultuous years under the Malaysian Federation,
              Singapore was declared a sovereign and independent nation. It was a
              time of great uncertainty as the leaders were faced with the
              enormous task of charting the path of our national destiny.
              Nevertheless, Singapore was determined to not only survive on its
              own but to succeed.</p>
              <p>An urgent priority after independence was to build up
              Singapore's own defence capability. Singapore then had only two
              infantry battalions of 50 officers and some 1,000 men and two
              ships. There was no airforce. Singapore's armed forces had to be
              created virtually from scratch.</p>
              <p>In August 1965, the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v07n11_history.html"> Ministry of the Interior and Defence</a> (MID) was established with
              Dr. Goh Keng Swee as its first Minister. The key priority then was
              to build up the Army into a credible force as soon as possible.
              With its small population and the need to channel resources to
              economic development, it was decided that Singapore's defence would
              be based on citizen armed forces. However, there was no military
              tradition in Singapore. The bulk of the population had
              traditionally held military service in low esteem. An intense
              educational effort was required to overcome such attitudes.
              Ministers, Members of Parliament, senior civil servants and
              community leaders volunteered to serve in the People's Defence
              Force. In this way, they set an example and drove home the message
              that it was the responsibility of every citizen to defend their
              nation.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v06n02_history.html"> National Service</a> started two years later in 1967. The NS
              (Amendment) Bill, 1967 was first read in Parliament on 27 Feb 1967.
              After a spirited debate in Parliament, the Act was finally passed
              on 14 Mar 1967.</p>
              <p>The passing of the NS (Amendment) Act in mid-Mar 1967 was a
              turning point in the lives of Singaporean males. Between 28 Mar and
              18 Apr 1967, registration began in earnest at the Central Manpower
              Base (CMPB) and its district offices in Katong, Serangoon and Bukit
              Panjang. Pink reminder cards were sent by post to the first batch
              of citizens who were born between 1 Jan 1949 and 30 Jun 1949 - some
              9,000 of them. This marked the beginning of the citizen army and
              also the start of NS as a way of life for the male citizens of
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v13n07_history.html"> Republic of Singapore Navy</a> (RSN) began as the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v10n01_history.html"> Singapore Naval Volunteer Force</a> (SNVF) in 1966 with just three
              ships, RSS Panglima, RSS Bedok and RSS Singapura. RSS Singapura,
              moored at Telok Ayer Basin, served as the SNVF's first
              headquarters. Thus, the newly formed naval force had only two
              seaworthy ships to form its sea defences.</p>
              <p>What the SNVF lacked in resources was made up for in
              determination and hard work. Though a small force to begin with,
              the SNVF underwent a period of rapid growth and development. It had
              started off with former members of the Royal Malaysian Navy, who
              were mobilised to form the nucleus of the fledgling force. The
              following year saw the SNVF boost its numbers to 89 mobilised
              personnel and 278 volunteer officers and men. Some were women from
              the Singapore Women's Auxiliary Naval Service (or SWANS), which had
              been formed in 1957. On 5 May 1967, the Singapore Naval White
              Ensign was hoisted with pride, signalling that Singapore finally
              had a navy to call its own. There was no looking back from then on,
              as it embarked on a gradual upgrading of its equipment, personnel
              and facilities. From the two ships in 1966, it subsequently grew
              into a modern force, and officially was renamed the “Republic of
              Singapore Navy” in April 1975.</p>
              <p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v02n09_history.html"> Republic of Singapore Air Force</a> also has very modest
              beginnings. In 1968, the Singapore Air Defence Command (SADC) was
              formed. It started with eight <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v08n05_history.html"> Cessna 172-H</a> aircraft to train its pilots, and by 1970 <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/birth_of_saf/v12n12_history.html"> Hawker Hunter</a> fighter aircraft had been added to the fleet.
              When the British forces were withdrawn in 1971, Tengah, Seletar,
              Sembawang and Changi airbases were entrusted to the SADC. SADC
              became the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) in 1975.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of the Interior and Defence (MID) initially oversaw
              both internal and external defence, but as the defence structure
              grew and the work became more defined, it separated into two
              specialised ministries. Thus, the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and
              the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mha.gov.sg">Ministry of Home
              Affairs</a> (MHA) were formed in 1970.</p>
              <p>When the SAF first started in the 1960s, the most urgent focus
              for what we now call the 1st Generation SAF was to provide for
              Singapore's basic defence. The 2nd Generation SAF, from the early
              80s to late 90s, saw the upgrading and modernising of our Army,
              Navy and Air Force. Post-9/11, there was a shift in the security
              landscape, which widened to include non-conventional threats such
              as terrorism and piracy.</p>
              <p>Resource constraints and the emergence of advanced warfighting
              technologies also drove the SAF to rethink our development
              trajectory. To meet new security challenges effectively, the SAF
              embarked on a 3rd Generation transformation journey in 2004 and
              continues today to upgrade its capabilities into an advanced
              networked force.</p>
              Today, the SAF is respected as a strong and professional armed
              forces. The SAF has developed leading-edge capabilities, networked
              together as an integrated fighting system.</div>

              <p>Back in 1967, former prime 
              minister Lee Kuan Yew's pitch to the nation for conscription was: "It 
              will take many years - perhaps five, perhaps seven, perhaps 10 years - 
              before we can get the whole machine into gear. But in the end, every boy

              or she must be prepared to fight and defend. Otherwise, it will be 
              lost."</p>
              <p>It seems that the country's first defence minister, Dr Goh Keng Swee,
               was prescient when, in asking Parliament to pass the National Service 
              Bill in 1967, he said: "Nothing creates loyalty and national

              <p><strong>Total Defence</strong> (or <strong>TD</strong>) is the
              name of <strong><a title="Singapore" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a>'s comprehensive
              defence strategy, adapted from countries like <a title="Denmark" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a title="Sweden" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden">Sweden</a>, <a title="Switzerland" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland">Switzerland</a> and <a title="Austria" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria">Austria</a>.</strong></p>
              <p><em><strong>It is based on the understanding that besides
              military action, aggressors can also defeat the country by wrecking
              its <a title="Economy" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy">economic systems</a>, tearing its <a title="Social fabric" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_fabric">social fabric</a> apart, targeting Singaporeans'
              beliefs and commitment to defence, and its ability to recover from
              disasters, both natural and man-made.</strong></em></p>
              <p>The Total Defence concept encompasses five key aspects –
              military, civil, economic, social and psychological defence – and
              focuses on the need for each Singaporean to play his or her part to
              defend the nation. These five aspects are very similar to the "4
              Defences" of the Austrian "Comprehensive National Defense"
              (<a title="de:Umfassende Landesverteidigung" rel="nofollow" href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umfassende_Landesverteidigung">Umfassende
              Landesverteidigung</a>) strategy of 1975.</p>
              <h2><span>The Five Aspects</span></h2>
              <p>"<strong>Military Defence</strong>" consists of the Singapore
              Armed Forces (SAF), including its citizen soldiers.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Defence_%28Singapore%29#cite_note-totaldefence-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Their
              mission is to "enhance Singapore's peace and security through
              deterrence and diplomacy, and should these fail, to secure a swift
              and decisive victory over the aggressor". As part of the mission,
              the SAF strives to maintain a high state of operational readiness
              24/7.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Civil Defence</strong>" is about ensuring Singaporeans
              know what to do in times of an emergency. The Singapore Civil
              Defence Force (SCDF) supports this aspect of Total Defence.
              However, if Singapore encounters a nation-wide emergency (e.g.:
              terrorism act or war), the SCDF will not be able to cope with the
              demands of the situation. Hence, it is crucial to rope in
              Singaporeans to help their fellow Singaporeans. To facilitate this,
              the SCDF recruits and trains civil defence volunteers in first aid,
              rescue and evacuation procedures, and shelter management.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Economic Defence</strong>" is defined as maintaining
              the economy of the country and its ability to compete in the world,
              as well as environmental protection.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Defence_%28Singapore%29#cite_note-totaldefence-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> It also
              involves helping Singapore (and Singaporeans) stay relevant in the
              global economy and putting in place economic systems to ensure that
              the Singapore economy does not collapse in times of crisis.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Social Defence</strong>" is about keeping the social
              fabric strong and ensuring that Singaporeans live in harmony
              regardless of race or religion.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Defence_%28Singapore%29#cite_note-totaldefence-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> This is
              especially important because Singapore is a multi-racial and
              multi-religious society.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Psychological Defence</strong>" is about loyalty,
              commitment to Singapore, and having the will power and resilience
              to overcome challenges.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Defence_%28Singapore%29#cite_note-totaldefence-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> This is the
              component that would determine if Singaporeans will stay to fight
              or abandon the country when it is in trouble.</p>

              <div><span><strong>Protecting our way of life</strong><br> <br> Introduced in 1984, the concept of Total Defence (TD) was adapted
                                from the experiences of countries like Switzerland and Sweden. As a
                                young nation with a small population and a conscript armed forces,
                                we needed to draw on the different strengths and abilities of our
                                community to augment our defence capability.<br> <br> Conflicts between countries are no longer just military in nature.
                                Potential aggressors and threats can appear in less obvious and
                                non-conventional ways (e.g., destroying social cohesion by
                                exploiting differences in race, language, religion, culture, social
                                or economic class; weakening national resilience by using
                                psychological warfare to play on the people’s fears and
                                apprehensions; or waging economic warfare through economic
                                boycotts, trade sanctions or acts of sabotage to bring down the
                                economy). Total Defence provides the framework for a comprehensive
                                and integrated response to deal with all kinds of threats and
                                challenges. Whether it is a security threat such as global
                                terrorism, or a national crisis like SARS, Total Defence brings
                                together all relevant government agencies, private sector
                                organisations and all Singaporeans in a coordinated effort to deal
                                effectively with these threats and challenges. When Singaporeans
                                take personal responsibility for and get involved in the defence of
                                Singapore, they are playing their part to help keep Singapore safe
                                and secure.<br> <br> Total Defence has five aspects - Military Defence, Civil Defence,
                                Economic Defence, Social Defence and Psychological Defence. These
                                five aspects represent the key sectors of society. They also help
                                Singaporeans understand how they can be involved. When we take
                                National Service seriously, volunteer in civil defence exercises,
                                help build a strong economy, strengthen community ties with one
                                another regardless of race and religion, and stay committed to
                                defend the country, we are doing something in every sector of our
                                society to strengthen Singapore's resilience as a
                                nation.</span></div>

              <h2>Why NS?</h2>
              <p>NS was introduced in 1967, just 2 years after Singapore’s
                                independence to ensure the peace and stability of our nation.</p>
              <strong>We are a 'little red dot'.</strong>
              <p>With a population of 4.4 million and a land of 699 square km,
                                Singapore is amongst the 20 smallest countries in the world.
                                Singapore is too small to change the world. Instead, we must adapt
                                as the world changes around us.</p>
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/asiamap.jpg"><img src="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/asiamap.jpg" alt="Storming the hideout" width="288" height="216"></a>
              <h3>Importance of NS</h3>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">We must be able to defend
                                Singapore ourselves. No one else is responsible for our security
                                and we cannot depend on others to come to our
                                defence.</span></strong></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #008000;">Our defence is predicated on
                                deterrence. That is why we invest heavily and consistently in
                                building up a strong defence force to provide that
                                deterrence.</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">At the same time, we seek to be
                                friends with as many countries as possible in the region and
                                beyond. By having friends who can help us in our times of need, we
                                enhance our security.</span></p>
              <h3>Need for NS</h3>
              <p>NS is our only viable option to building up a credible defence
                                force to ensure our survival. A conscription force by law which
                                obliges all eligible people to enlist would create a sizeable
                                standing force ready to guarantee our security.</p>
              <p>The <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr> maintains
                                itself in a high state of operational readiness at all times so
                                that it is able to react swiftly to any threat.</p>
              <p>To meet the defence challenges in the 21st century, the
                                <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr> is upgrading and
                                transforming itself into a highly sophisticated, well-integrated
                                fighting force.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/storming.jpg"><img src="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/storming.jpg" alt="Third Generation SAF" width="288" height="216"></a></p>
              <p>The Third Generation <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr> will be a network-centric
                                organisation. Our forces will be interconnected, equipped with
                                electronic information systems, and be able to fight cooperatively,
                                and in an integrated manner, on land, in the air and on the
                                sea.</p>
              <p>Within the nation itself, the <abbr title="Singapore Police Force">SPF</abbr> upholds the law and maintains
                                order, keeping the streets safe for family and friends.</p>
              <p>And in case of any crisis or emergency, such as a major accident
                                or a terrorist attack, the <abbr title="Singapore Civil Defence Force">SCDF</abbr> will be there to rescue
                                and save the lives of fellow citizens.</p>
              <p>All together, the <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr>, <abbr title="Singapore Police Force">SPF</abbr> and <abbr title="Singapore Civil Defence Force">SCDF</abbr> play a key role in
                                Singapore’s Total Defence—Military Defence, Civil Defence, Economic
                                Defence, Social Defence and Psychological Defence.</p>

Note that Bosnia, Croatia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Albania, Macednoia all abolished conscription and their population is similar to ours. Some of the countries are also located in the Middle East, where conflict is still occuring. If the government take steps to make a military career interesting as opposed to making it mandatory for all males, not only will more people be interested in their jobs, but when people are happy with their job, they tend to serve better too.</p></div>

Most countries have retired conscription due to the peace that we have currently. To prevent misunderstandings, I was referring to peacetime defences for conscription, should war break out again, conscription can be enforced again. Most countries globally follow this procedure nowadays and rely on volunteer armies during peacetime.</p></div>

              <p>Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen led a delegation comprising
               members from the Committee to Strengthen National Service (CSNS) on a 
              visit to Finland from 16 to 17 October 2013 to study its conscription 
              system. The delegation included Minister of State for Defence Dr Mohamad
               Maliki Bin Osman and Chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee
               for Defence and Foreign Affairs Dr Lim Wee Kiak.</p>
              <p>During the visit, Dr Ng met with Finnish Minister of Defence Carl 
              Haglund, State Secretary to the Minister of Defence Marcus Rantala, 
              Permanent Secretary of Defence Lieutenant General Arto Räty, Commander 
              of the Finnish Defence Forces General Ari Puheloinen, and Chairman of 
              the Finnish Parliament's Defence Committee Jussi Niinistö. Dr Ng's visit
               underscores the friendly defence relations between Singapore and 
              Finland.</p>
              <p>The delegation was briefed on Finland's security and defence policy, 
              and its conscription system. The delegation noted that public support 
              for conscription in Finland is high. In a survey conducted in 2012, more
               than 70% of the public supported the conscription system. The 
              delegation also learnt more about the voluntary military service 
              available to women since 1995. Each year, about 400 Finnish women are 
              accepted as volunteer military conscripts.</p>
              <p>The delegation visited the Finnish Armoured Brigade in Parolannummi 
              to learn more about basic, vocational and leadership training for 
              military conscripts. The delegation was also briefed on how conscripts' 
              aptitudes and preferences are taken into consideration for deployment. 
              During the visit, the delegation had the opportunity to interact with 
              conscripts and witnessed their rigorous training.</p>
              <p>At the end of the visit, Dr Ng highlighted that "even though 
              Singapore's security and domestic landscape is different from Finland, 
              it is useful to study the conscription system of Finland and learn from 
              their experiences. Like Singapore, Finland guards its independence and 
              sovereignty fiercely, having been colonised and occupied in its past. 
              Even after nearly a century, it has still kept its commitment to 
              conscription for this primary purpose. It has been a meaningful trip for
               the CSNS delegation as we consider how to build on the strong public 
              support for National Service in Singapore by expanding opportunities for
               the broader community to contribute to national defence, and optimise 
              the contributions of national servicemen."</p>
              <p>The visit is part of the CSNS' effort to study best practices in 
              other countries as it examines measures to strengthen NS in Singapore. 
              The delegation is currently in Switzerland studying its conscription 
              system.</p>

              <p>Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen, who led a CSNS delegation to 
              study conscription systems, was in Finland from 16 to 17 October 2013 
              and in Switzerland from 17 to 18 October 2013. The delegation included 
              Minister of State for Defence Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman and Chairman 
              of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Defence and Foreign 
              Affairs Dr Lim Wee Kiak.</p>
              <p>While in Switzerland, Dr Ng was hosted by and met President of the 
              Swiss Confederation and Head of the Federal Department of Defence, Civil
               Protection and Sport Ueli Maurer. He also met Chief of the Swiss Armed 
              Forces Lieutenant General (LG) André Blattmann and Commander of the 
              Swiss Air Force LG Aldo Schellenberg. The visit underscores the friendly
               defence relations between Singapore and Switzerland.</p>
              <p>The delegation was briefed on the Swiss conscription system. It was 
              noted that Switzerland has enjoyed peace for more than two hundred years
               and there continues to be strong public support for conscription. The 
              delegation also learnt how the Swiss Armed Forces strengthens employers'
               support for conscription through various engagement activities, which 
              allow the employers to better appreciate how military training develops 
              the individual and brings value to their companies.</p>
              <p>The delegation visited Payerne Air Base and was briefed on how 
              conscripts support the operations of the air base. The delegation also 
              interacted with Swiss reservists on their annual refresher training and 
              learnt how they maintained their military skills and technical 
              competencies.</p>
              <p>Speaking at the end of the trip, Dr Ng said, "The Swiss take great 
              pride in their conscription system which has maintained their neutrality
               and independence and receives strong support through the generations. 
              The Swiss Armed Forces has an efficient conscript training system which 
              takes into consideration conscripts' abilities, motivation and aptitude 
              during the assignment of military vocations. Women can also volunteer 
              for conscription. The CSNS will review the lessons learnt and consider 
              ways to optimise the contributions of our servicemen."</p>
              The third phase of public consultation by the CSNS will involve 
              discussion of proposals in more detail. Members of the public who wish 
              to participate can find out more at <a href="http://www.strengthenNS.sg">www.strengthenNS.sg</a>.</div>

              <p>As DEFENCE policymakers here consider roping in more female volunteers, 
                                Singapore is looking at its European counterparts to learn how they get 
                                women to do their part for defence.<br> <br> Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen is leading a delegation on a visit to Finland and Switzerland to study their conscription system.<br> <br> On the team are senior Defence Ministry officials and members of the 
                                high-level Committee to Strengthen National Service (CSNS), including 
                                Minister of State for Defence Mohamad Maliki Osman and MP for Nee Soon 
                                GRC Lim Wee Kiak.<br> <br> On his visit to Finland which began on Wednesday, Dr Ng called on his 
                                counterpart, Mr Carl Haglund and other top-level defence officials, 
                                including the Commander of the Finnish Defence Forces General Ari 
                                Puheloinen.<br> <br> Mindef said in a statement yesterday that the delegation was briefed on 
                                Finland's defence policy and conscription system, including the Finnish 
                                voluntary military service for women.</p>
              <p>Since the volunteer scheme started in 1995, about 400 Finnish women are 
              drafted each year. A 2012 survey showed more than 70 per cent of Finns 
              support compulsory national service. During its visit to the Finnish 
              Armoured Brigade, the delegation saw how
                                 soldiers were trained and was briefed on how the 
              military matched their
                                 aptitudes and preferences to their vocations.<br> <br> The visit is part of efforts by the CSNS to canvass feedback on its area
                                 of concern. Proposals will be submitted to the Government early next 
                                year.<br> <br> Dr Ng said it was useful to learn from Finland's experience, as it, like
                                 Singapore, "guards its independence and sovereignty fiercely, having 
                                been colonised and occupied in its past". "Even after nearly a century, 
                                it has still kept its commitment to conscription for this primary 
                                purpose."</p>

              <p>Yes definitely, but the main thing that I'm not too happy with
              is the fact that it has become mandatory with no way to opt out
              whatsoever. I understand that if MINDEF were to provide such an
              option, there may be an issue of majority of the population not
              wanting to serve, but like you said if the military was interesting
              maybe more people will be willing to serve without the 'compulsory'
              labelling? And as part of human rights, I feel that during

              <p>Sorry if im making a comparision to a european country again, but in this case i feel that it is a valid response.</p>
              <p>(Note that this is for peacetime):</p>
              <p>The UK has a 410 180 strong army, where 205 330 are professional soldiers (the 'stronger' soldiers), while 181 720 are reserved soldiers (the 'older' soldiers, or are able to mobilise when necessary). In Singapore, we have a 522 800 strong army, where 72 500 are professionals (half of which are the conscripted people), 356 500 are reserved and 93 800 are parliamentary (armed units not considered part of military forces).</p>
              <p>Since this is peacetime, we can consider having a 400 000 strong army, where 60 000 are professionals (no conscription), 250 000 are reserves, and 90 000 are parilamentary. The 100 000 from the reserves can go to the salaries of the extra 30 000 professionals. This would firstly reduce the number of people required as soldiers(more technology to help compared to the past), and secondly since many citizens are engineers and computer programmers, can work as those in the army, developing the military tech for the nation. These less physically demanding jobs can be offered to the slightly more mature males, or females. I'll send this first so I can hear your opinion.</p>

              <p>After over 40 years, National Service is now woven tightly into the 
              fabric of our nation. As we look to the future, to maintain if not 
              strengthen this commitment to NS, we asked Singaporeans for their views 
              and ideas.</p>
              <p>From May to August 2013, over 10,000 participants responded with 
              their feedback and suggestions on NS to the website 
              (www.strengthenNS.sg), through emails or attended focus group 
              discussions. They came from different walks of life and included 
              operationally-ready national servicemen, full-time national servicemen, 
              regular servicemen, parents, women, grassroots volunteers, employers, 
              students and members of the public.</p>
              <p>In this section, we sum up their conversations which affirm that NS 
              is necessary and critical to Singapore’s security and prosperity. We 
              want to thank all participants for the many lively discussions on their 
              NS experience, the practical suggestions on what could be improved, and 
              good ideas on what should be strengthened so that NS remains meaningful 
              for the future generation.</p>
              <p>Four broad themes covering a range of insights and perspectives have emerged:</p>

              <div class="richedit2 fontResizable">
              <div>
              <p>“NS is a common language amongst Singaporeans. It fosters 
              national identity and pride. Regardless of background or social group, 
              it brings people together. It is a social glue.”</p>
              <p><br> “NS is one of the key reasons why Singaporeans enjoy peace and 
              prosperity today. Forgetting this is dangerous and could undermine our 
              future.”</p>
              <p><br> NS strengthens national identity and social cohesion. The shared 
              experiences and friendships forged during NS have become an integral 
              part of our personal ties that form communities and unite us as a 
              people. Reinforcing the purpose of NS will inspire national servicemen 
              to give of their best when performing their duties. There were also 
              suggestions to encourage more people in the community, including women 
              and new citizens to play a part in national defence.</p>
              <p><br> “Everyone must see the significance of NS and cultivate a natural inclination to preserve what we have as a nation.”</p>
              <p>“There are women and new citizens who may want to volunteer for 
              national defence. This will enable them to better empathize with our 
              NSmen and develop a stronger sense of national identity.”</p>

              <p>“NS was tough but it has made me more resilient, mature and 
              responsible. The experience has taught me to cope with challenging 
              situations and value teamwork.”</p>
              <p><br> “I would like to contribute more during NS. There could be avenues for 
              us to express our preference of vocations, based on our skills and 
              abilities.”</p>
              <p><br> NS builds up personal character and resilience. National servicemen 
              value the opportunities for personal growth and the life skills 
              developed during NS. Many would like to take on bigger roles in NS to 
              contribute more to safeguard our defence and security. While NS is a 
              national duty, more can be done to help national servicemen manage their
               other commitments to family, education and work.</p>
              <p><br> “I believe in the importance of NS. However, I feel that I may lag behind in studies and employment after serving NS.”</p>
              <p><br> “During in-camp training, while my wife has to work extra hard to look 
              after our home and family, she understands that what I do keeps them 
              safe.”</p>

              country.”</p>
              <p><br> “There should be better societal perception of NS. I have witnessed in 
              other countries how they respect their soldiers. It makes a difference.”</p>
              <p><br> While national servicemen carry out their duties without expecting 
              something in return, greater community support and societal appreciation
               will motivate them to serve with honour and pride. We should consider 
              more ways to recognise their contributions but not erode the 
              significance of NS as a national duty.</p>
              <p><br> “NS is a duty that we perform proudly without expecting anything in 
              return. I am confident that the next generation will serve with pride 
              and conviction.”</p>
              <p><br> “The current recognition measures for NSmen are good, and more can be

              measures to ensure that risks are minimised during training.”</p>
              <p><br> We can always find better ways to make NS more efficient and effective. 
              We need to use technology that can multiply our efforts in view of

              <p>In
               the last few months, we held a first phase of Focus Group Discussions 
              (FGDs) where different people came together to share their experiences 
              with NS, the strengths of NS and areas to be strengthened, as well as 
              their aspirations for NS. We thank our participants for taking the time 
              to share their ideas and experiences.</p>
              <p>For Phase 2 of the FGDs, more specific discussions were carried out on these following topics.</p>

              <p>The contributions of our National Servicemen ensure the peace 
              and stability which Singapore has enjoyed. We have heard calls for 
              greater recognition, and more importantly, appreciation and respect for 
              our National Servicemen from the community. What else can we do for our 
              NSFs and NSmen? In this topic, let’s come together to discuss what are 
              the ways different segments of the broader community, such as our family
               members, employers, the government, and members of the public can 
              better recognise and show their appreciation for the contributions of

              <p>NS is a national institution based on critical need, and our 
              National Servicemen play an important part in national defence by 
              serving NS. Beyond our National Servicemen, can the broader community, 
              such as women, play their part in contributing to defence? How can they 
              offer their expertise, knowledge and skills? Should volunteering in the

              <p>Every National Serviceman has an important role to play in 
              Singapore’s defence and wants to have a meaningful NS experience. Some 
              servicemen want to do more and increase their contributions to NS. How

              <p>Sorry if im making a comparision to a european country again,
              but in this case i feel that it is a valid response.</p>
              <p>(Note that this is for peacetime):</p>
              <p>The UK has a 410 180 strong army, where 205 330 are professional
              soldiers (the 'stronger' soldiers), while 181 720 are reserved
              soldiers (the 'older' soldiers, or are able to mobilise when
              necessary). In Singapore, we have a 522 800 strong army, where 72
              500 are professionals (half of which are the conscripted people),
              356 500 are reserved and 93 800 are parliamentary (armed units not
              considered part of military forces).</p>
              <p>Since this is peacetime, we can consider having a 400 000 strong
              army, where 60 000 are professionals (no conscription), 250 000 are
              reserves, and 90 000 are parilamentary. The 100 000 from the
              reserves can go to the salaries of the extra 30 000 professionals.
              This would firstly reduce the number of people required as
              soldiers(more technology to help compared to the past), and
              secondly since many citizens are engineers and computer
              programmers, can work as those in the army, developing the military
              tech for the nation. These less physically demanding jobs can be
              offered to the slightly more mature males, or females. I'll send
              this first so I can hear your opinion.</p>

              <p>Back in 1967, former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew's pitch to the
              nation for conscription was: "It will take many years - perhaps
              five, perhaps seven, perhaps 10 years - before we can get the whole
              machine into gear. But in the end, every boy and girl here will
              understand that what he or she has in Singapore, he or she must be
              prepared to fight and defend. Otherwise, it will be lost."</p>
              <p>It seems that the country's first defence minister, Dr Goh Keng
              Swee, was prescient when, in asking Parliament to pass the National
              Service Bill in 1967, he said: "Nothing creates loyalty and
              national consciousness more speedily and more thoroughly than
              participation in defence and membership of the armed forces."</p>
