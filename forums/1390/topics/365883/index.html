            <div class='col-md body'><p>I'm currently a medic trainee in BMC at nee soon camp. I have some serious financial and family issues as I'm the only breadwinner of my family due to my dad's death last year. I could support my family in the past by giving tuition but now, as my course requires me to stay-in, I cannot find the time to take care of my family and now has to survive on $450 a month, which is nigh impossible considering I still have 2 more younger siblings. I've already talked to one of the commanders there but he said that it was impossible for him to OOC me or help me to revocate to a stay-out vocation. Can anyone advise me on who I should go to for help? Currently I'm surviving because my relatives have been helping me but for how long can they offer this help? If there's really no way around this, how is my family going to survive for the next 1yr 7mths?</p></div>

              I have seen this problem can be helped in 2 ways from my experience.
              
              1. Apply for SAF hardship grant.  Need to check with your trainer or your unit S1, OC etc.  
              
              2. Discuss with your trainer or officer to see if you can switch vocation to 8-5 such as Service Medic etc.  You can then take part time job outside to supplement your income. 
              
              I think you need to tell your trainers or whoever that you are suffering from family financial problem and it is impossible to concentrate on the course while your family is in lurch.  I dun see why your officer will ignore the problem as they are trained to helped in such situtation.

              <p>Generally it is illegal to work outside, but it is also mainly dependent on TS's direct superiors; whether they are willing to bend the rules a bit for him.</p>
              <p>Of course, if they are willing to help the TS out, it will be wise for the TS to keep his mouth zipped over such things.</p>
              <p>TS should take 8800's suggestion into consideration. Of course, he will have to give up all future aspirations which he might have, but here is when he will have to weigh his future and his family, and decide which is more important. </p>

              <p>You are not allowed to take any job legally but tuition jobs are not exactly really considered proper jobs since there is no proper record, no CPF etc so it isn't exactly easy to catch and charge some1 for teaching tuition.</p>
              <p>I've known quite a number of friends who teach tuition while in NS and 1 of them even manage to earn over 1.5k a month just on tuition alone but he has 3-4 students all JC level and its tough having to rush for tuition after camp and have your weekends burn teaching etc.</p>

              <p>well there is nothing your commander can do to shift your vocation to another unit. Why dont you sign on?? you get a lump sum of money up front and your pay will be around 2k per month. You can then go for further studies using the army scholarship.. then I think you can sign for 5 years or wat, no necessary your whole life. That way you will have money to help ya family.</p>
              <p>Signing on in the army is $$$. If you need $$$, sign on with the army. Easily can get few thous per month.</p>
