I mean balls to them, so what if you know how to use the M16S1? Thats just one of the weapons, I have personally seen cadet specialists who act like they know it all and try to strip the buffer spring of the weapon, end up don't know how to put back. For what? Just to show off the ego to the younger cadets. Anyway...thing here is that frankly speaking, those who know little are those who are smart alecks and act like know it alls.<br><br>Franky,as a CLT, I see CLTs who demand standard, but do not know what is the standard and they do not reflect it themselve.So whats the point?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup...after reading and analyzing...I came to this conclusion that many NCC Cadets act like know it alls. I mean hell...just because you shoot like a total of 18 rounds or so throughout your entire student life, mebbe slightly more if you're a bobo or competition shooter, you think you can shoot at a competitive level with NSFs/NSMen and Regulars? Balls...you don't even know how to bloody do proper zeroing...you just aim off!!! When the first round flies over your heads, you think its like CS? Where by after a day of shooting a few rounds, we can all go back to our lives and live it as it is?<br><br>HELL NO!!! There will be bleeding and dying, maiming,killing and raping! Its about time that some people come and wake the disillusioned that NCC is the premier uniform group,just because you don the same uniform as the SAF, does not mean that you are one of them! I mean hell...as a CLT, I choose to book out from camp in civi. most of the times as I've been embarrassed by the actions of cadets in MRTs or in public and being afraid that I might do something which is not going to reflect good on my UG, might as well be myself and be in civi, not that I like NCC any less...</div>
