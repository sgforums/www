            <div class='col-md body'>Well, yes I do have a passion for the military and hope to be granted the opportunity to have the military as a professional career, however we live in a society that is overly academic based and if you're not a scholar, you do not belong with the big boys. So yes, I guess I will probably sign for a couple of years and use the money as seed to start my own business with a couple of friends. The military is my passion, but perhaps may be its a blessing in disguise that I'm born in a country which has enjoyed politcal stability and peace and there's hadly crisis which has to utilise the military extensively.<br><br>But don't get me wrong, my loyalty to my land will always be there.<br></div>

Frankly, my friend once asked me if given the ability to turn back time, would I have joined NCC. I told him yes..because I enjoy the bond there. I mean there are factions,the bums, the enthus, the apple polishers, but the bond is there.Its something which is difficult to see in other UGs. We train for 4/5 yrs as a team,thus the bond is strong.</div>

I mean this is not ancient times where the enemies are armed with shields and spears and you an assault rifle. Tactics, strategies, C3 all come to play. I don't mean to downplay the performance of your friends who went to OCS and doubtless that they are good soldiers, but what I'm saying here is that, many of my fellow CLTs and Cadets have the perception that what they learn in NCC, is equavalient to a life time of lessons that supercede that of NSFs,which is a total misconception.</div>

So yes, I guess I will probably sign for a couple of years and use the money as seed to start my own business with a couple of friends. The military is my passion, but perhaps may be its a blessing in disguise that I'm born in a country which has enjoyed politcal stability and peace and there's hadly crisis which has to utilise the military extensively.<br><br>But don't get me wrong, my loyalty to my land will always be there.<br></div></blockquote>Do you intend to sign on as a spec or officer?<br><br>I'm not sure if this is right, but some of my friends chose to sign on as a spec because the overall $$ is higher over a period of 10 years.<br><br>They are mostly diploma holders. Please verify that independantly.</div>
