Kena sent back to old unit.  After old unit ROD, kena post to new unit, so don't worry your turn will come.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>As for not being called up even though not student.  Met this fellow who didn't get his call up even though he called a few times to check.  Eventually got his call up for ICT...<br><br>....7 years later!  Darn sway.  Almost everyone in reservist unit younger than him.<br><br>Oh, and as for the guy that said you don't need to carry anything with you to your reservist training on the first day...  Follow his advice at your own risk.<br><br>If you go combat unit, no such thing as book out 1st night.  Well, at least not before being tekan and most likely charged by RSM.<br><br>Try to find out from your unit lah. Besides your online SAF100, if your unit on the ball, they should probably send you reminder letter along with what to bring and at least one contact number to call.  Check there.<br><br>However if you combat unit going for high key ICT, my advice is, just bring your FBO.  Odds are you're gonna need it.  Good luck!</div>

During my first few years of ICT, we find that all our incamps fall during U holidays, so those in U have no excuse to defer. Cus our CO then was a staff in one of the local U! He knows the schedule, can't smoke him out!!  Hahaha!!!! Now, most of those in U have graduated, so ICT can be anytime.</div>

You just have to make yourself find the time and of course get started.  Once you do, just keep at it regularly.  And do push yourself lah.  If you find the exercises too easy, odds are it's not to the level of passing IPPT - unless you darn fit lah.<br><br>In terms of deferement.  You need to write into your brigade and also your Battalion.  You should also talk to your PC/OC if possible.  When to do it?  As soon as possible.  Forget it if it's a week before and all you are doing is taking a vacation.</div>
