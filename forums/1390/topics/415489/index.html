              <p>I've just received my enlistment date, which is on the 9 December 2010. That's like 3 weeks away. Things is, I have not had the time to take my NAPFA (private school, so no in-school NAPFA), so I'm going in for PTP.</p>
              <p>My questions are:</p>
              <p>1) I'll be going to Toa Payoh Stadium for NAPFA. From those who have experience taking their test there, are the instructors strict or do they sometimes close-1-eye?</p>
              <p>2) I'm aiming for a Silver. I'm not exactly fit &amp; haven't been exercising for a period of time. I do swim now &amp; then. I have 7 days to get ready. Is Silver actually, easy or really difficult to achieve?</p>
              <p>3) If I DO get silver, my NS enlistment would be pushed back till 9 February 2011, correct? Would I receive another enlistment letter... or?</p>
              <p>4) For the pull-up station, do they have to be palms-in or palms-out, or anyway you like?</p>
              <p>5) On the website, it states that the NAPFA should be done 2 weeks prior to enlistment date. I am 3 weeks aways, &amp; technically my upcoming NAPFA next week is the ONLY attempt I can make. If i fail, &amp; I retake the following week, would they still allow the results to be used?</p>
              <p>6) Any useful tips I could have?</p>

              <p>Seriously unless you can pass NAPFA or else I won't ask you to skip PTP, or else you'll definitely suffer in BMT. As for the chin-up, it does not matter, palm in or out.</p>

              <p>1) It depends on who you get, as well as how far you are from the silver standard. If you need 1 more pull-up, and you can pull half-way up or more, they can open-close one eye.  </p>
              <p>2) Silver is easy to get.....my foot, if you are those who never train all the while and don't do sports. Swimming once a month isn't going to save you.</p>
              <p>3) Not sure. No guarantee.</p>
              <p>4) anything goes. 1 hand in 1 hand out also can.</p>
              <p>5) You can try calling CMPB up and beg them to push your enlistment backwards. They are not oblige to do anything though.</p>
              <p>6) Start training. And praying.</p>

              <p>Thats why you should've went to a JC :P most of us have no problems achieving NAPFA Silver, and no, our teachers dont 'close one eye' lol.</p>
              <p>Anyways contrary to what the others have been saying, its actually really easy to clear IPPT if you train intensively within the next 7 days. I dont mean swimming daily- that wont do you any good. And of course you have to be in a decent physical shape at least (ie not obese or severely overweight).</p>
              <p>If you really wanna succeed, I would recommend that within the next 7 days, you gym every alternate day- just spam pull-ups and squats etc to get your strength and muscle explosiveness for the shuttle run and SBJ stations. </p>
              <p>Right after the gym session, go for a 4km run. It will definately be tiring and all but well; its really all in the mind. Just dont stop...</p>
              <p>If you arent a slipshod person who slacks his behind off, you should do just fine. I guided my friend who couldnt pass his NAPFA and got him up to par within a week as well... there's no reason why you shouldnt be able to.</p>

              <p>Rather than saying taking 2 months from the beginning, an easier way to look at it will be this.</p>
              <p>If you do not have silver/gold, you need to go through 2 months extra physical training FIRST, before you actually go for your basic military training (BMT).</p>
              <p>If you have silver/gold, you will go straight for BMT, and skip the 1st 2 months of extra physical training.</p>

              <p>Hi Shadez, i took 4 times there to get a silver.</p>
              <p>1. If I rmb correctly, there will be 1 person at the pull up station  and the instructor will be counting for you. SBJ -  got 2 tries, the instructor will be beside you. Sit and reach - should be the same as SBJ, Sit up - 10 person doing in a row and the one helping you will count for you while the instructor will take the timing. 2.4 run is after all the exercise, you will run together as a group and the instructor will take each individual timing. I don't know if they'll close an eye but I been there 4 times and i think they don't. </p>
              <p>2. You can try to aim for Silver. Do bear in mind that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">once you fail any station its consider a fail</span>. And hope it does't rain and don't be late.</p>
              <p>3. I'm not sure if your enlistment will be push back 2 months later, but I'm sure you will get the 2 months reduction. Anyway they don't take your 2 months from the beginning. You get Silver and you don't have to attend 8 weeks of PTP that's why. When I pass my NAPFA, my enlistment date eventually postpone a month later. But i suggest that once you get silver, check with the instructors down there to see if you will get another enlistment letter. Yes i received another enlistment letter.</p>
              <p>4. Both ways, I rmb I did palm in then palm out.</p>
              <p>5. I doubt so but you can check with the instructors over there to be safe, when I pass my NAPFA I had exactly 2 more week to my June enlistment.</p>
              <p>6. Train all the stations that you are weak in and most importantly your 2.4. It will be under the hot sun and running around the stadium 6 times is sure tiring.</p>
              <p> I'm not sure whether all this has changed over this 2 years. I hope it helps. Good luck.</p>

              <p>Thats why you should've went to a JC :P most of us have no
              problems achieving NAPFA Silver, and no, our teachers dont 'close
              one eye' lol.</p>
              <p>Anyways contrary to what the others have been saying, its
              actually really easy to clear IPPT if you train intensively within
              the next 7 days. I dont mean swimming daily- that wont do you any
              good. And of course you have to be in a decent physical shape at
              least (ie not obese or severely overweight).</p>
              <p>If you really wanna succeed, I would recommend that within the
              next 7 days, you gym every alternate day- just spam pull-ups and
              squats etc to get your strength and muscle explosiveness for the
              shuttle run and SBJ stations. </p>
              <p>Right after the gym session, go for a 4km run. It will
              definately be tiring and all but well; its really all in the mind.
              Just dont stop...</p>
              <p>If you arent a slipshod person who slacks his behind off, you
              should do just fine. I guided my friend who couldnt pass his NAPFA
              and got him up to par within a week as well... there's no reason
              why you shouldnt be able to.</p>

              <p><br>How is your breathing like? From the first 1-5.5 rounds, you can try breathing in and out with your nose. Then the last 0.5 rounds ie 200m you will be chionging right? When you chiong you can try breathing with your mouth. It has something to do with keep the oxygen in your body to delay exhaustion.</p>

              <p>Yups breathing is definately dang important. If your breathing rhythm is inconsistent what will happen is that you will be fatigued easily and your running pace will be detrimentally affected. Moreover there is a possibility of having a higher lactic acid buildup (the ache/soreness you feel when running).</p>
              <p>Anyways I would recommend you breathe through your nose for the first 4-5 laps and exhale through your nose/mouth (i personally prefer the former) and for the last lap switch to total mouth inhalation and exhalation as you ramp up your speed and widen your strides.</p>
              <p>Its definately easier said than done as controlling your breathing (ie using a nasal inhalation for the first 4 rounds) is difficult if your cardiovascular endurance is miserable. So thats why you should do daily runs for the next few days. Or alternate between daily 4k runs and sprints like I suggested earlier for cardiovascular endurance and strength respectively.</p>
              <p>If you choose to follow my advice then all the best (you shouldnt have a problem clearing 2.4 if you stick to it and give it your 200%). If you give it a half-hearted effort you will see negligible results. Peace out :)</p>
