No extension of disruption will be granted for Postgraduate Diploma or PhD courses.<br><br>* Pursuance of Professional Courses<br>Extension of disruption to pursue essential professional courses may be granted if NSFs on disruption from full-time NS need to wait for more than 6 months after their ORD for the next intake, in the event that they are not granted the extension of disruption, to commence such courses.<br><br>* Switch of Course/Institution<br>Extension of disruption arising from a switch of course or institution may be granted up till the maximum duration of 5 years (inclusive of the original disruption period) if the original disruption period is 5 years or less.<br><br>* Personal Administration (e.g. to attend convocation, to make flight arrangements to return home from overseas)<br>Extension of disruption of up to 3 months may also be allowed for personal administration (e.g. to attend convocation and to arrange for flights home if the NSF on disruption was overseas).<br><br>PSC Scholars on disruption are to seek approval from PSC directly for extension of disruption for studies.<br><br><br><br>You can apply for an extension of disruption by sending your request to HRSC:<br><br>Personnel Management Centre (PMC) for NSFs on disruption from full-time NS<br>MINDEF/SAF Human Resource Services Centre (HRSC)<br>3, Depot Road #03-03<br>SINGAPORE 109681<br>Tel: 63731315/63731525<br>Email: hrsccns@starnet.gov.sg<br><br>Alternatively, you may also apply for an extension of disruption through eTransaction.<br><br>Operating Hours:<br>Mon-Friday: 0800 - 1730 hrs<br><br>Important Note - All applications for the above are subject to approval and is only applicable at the point the serviceman submits his application, as policy may be changed from time to time.<br><br> <br><br><br>Q1. How do I apply for an extension of my disruption period?<br><br>You can send your request through mail or fax to Human Resource Services Centre (HRSC), stating the reason for your request eg; repeat of studies etc and the required end date, together with the relevant supporting documents. Alternatively, you may also apply for extension of disruption online via www.ns.sg and send the supporting document to us by mail, fax or email at hrsccns@starnet.gov.sg. Supporting document sent via email must be saved in word document or PDF format. Application for extension of disruption is to reach HRSC at least 3 weeks before the expiry of your disruption period.<br><br>Q2a. Can I apply for an extension to pursue my Honours/Masters degree after I have completed my Basic degree?<br><br>Q2b. My disruption period as well as my exit permit is expiring soon but I intend to do my Honours/Masters. However, the outcome of my application for my Honours/Masters course will only be announced at a later date. What should I do?<br><br>Extension of disruption for Honours/Masters degree may be allowed only if it can be obtained within 5 years (inclusive of the disruption period granted for the Basic degree). No extension for Honours/Masters degree will be granted if the original disruption period exceeds 5 years.<br><br>You may apply to extend your disruption for up to a maximum period of 3 months while waiting for confirmation of acceptance by the University. Your exit permit will also be extended upon extension of your disruption. No re-disruption for Honours/Masters will be allowed after resumption of service.<br><br>Q3. How do I know if my online application for an extension has been successful?<br><br>You can choose how you wish to be notified (ie email or postal service) of the outcome of your application under Preferred Means of correspondence.<br><br>Q4. What will happen if I fail to resume service after my disruption period has expired?<br><br>NSFs on disruption must return immediately to serve out the balance of their Full-time NS as recalled, or upon discontinuation/completion of their studies. Disciplinary action will be taken against those who fail to do so. NSFs disrupted for overseas studies will have their exit permit withdrawn by the Central Manpower Base (CMPB) and be classified as exit permit defaulters.<br><br>Q5. Can I switch to a different course of study?<br><br>You are not allowed to switch courses or institution without the prior approval of the Human Resource Services Centre (HRSC). You are required to inform Human Resource Services Centre (HRSC) on the switch of study with documentary proof of the details of the new course. Approval may be granted if the switch does not lead to an extension of the maximum 5 years duration or the original disruption period. The switch must also be to a course that is at least equivalent to that of the original course.<br><br>===============================================================<br><br><br><br><br><br>After Completion of Studies<br><br>Resumption NS Service Balance Days<br><br>Q1. What should I do if I am not available for the medical check-up that has been scheduled for me?<br><br>Human Resource Services Centre (HRSC) will contact you regarding your medical check-up at the Medical Classification Centre (MCC) located at the Central Manpower Base (CMPB). If you are not available for the medical check-up that has been scheduled for you, you are to inform HRSC so that another appointment can be arranged for you.<br><br>Q2. Can I go for my medical check-up before I complete my studies?<br><br>You may go for your check-up at MCC/CMPB before you complete your studies. However, as the PES status accorded by MCC is only valid for a year, we advised that you contact HRSC to arrange for a medical appointment during your final year of study. This arrangement will facilitate your resumption of service immediately upon the completion of your studies.<br><br>Q3. Can I request for a medical review before I resume my Full-time NS?<br><br>Yes. HRSC will arrange for you to have a medical check-up at MCC/CMPB to ascertain your medical fitness once your application to resume full-time NS is received. Alternatively, you may also request for a medical review through your unit's manpower officer after you have resumed service.<br><br>Q4. Can I choose to see my own Specialist or family doctor instead of going to the medical check-up at MCC/CMPB?<br><br>No. The medical check-up at the MCC/CMPB is required to facilitate Medical Officers to review your medical conditions and to assign a medical PES status to you based on the current criteria outlined in the Medical Classification System. It is thus not possible for you to see your own Specialist or family doctor for this purpose. Nonetheless, you may ask your Specialist or family doctor for a medical report on your condition and to forward it to the Medical Officers who will then consider it in the assessment of your medical PES status.<br><br>Q5. What are the documents that I have to bring along for the medical check-up at MCC/CMPB?<br><br>You need to bring along your NRIC with any medical reports or supporting documents that will assist the Medical Officers in reviewing your medical condition and medical PES status.<br><br>Q6. When will I complete my full-time NS if I apply to resume my service now?<br><br>It depends on the balance of your full-time NS and your annual leave. You may contact Human Resource Services Centre (HRSC) to find out the balance of your full-time NS.<br><br>Q7. Where would I be posted to upon my resumption of service?<br><br>Usually for servicemen who have been trained in a specific vocation and who have only a short balance of full-time NS remaining, they would most likely be posted to their former units. However, there may be occasions where servicemen are re-deployed to other units due to organisational requirements.<br><br>Q8. Will my tertiary qualifications or individual preferences be taken into consideration for deployment?<br><br>The SAF's primary role is to build a fighting force that can defend Singapore and secure our peace. Therefore, this is the main consideration in deploying national servicemen to various vocations. Where necessary, we do take into consideration the national serviceman's education qualifications. But, the SAF will train every national serviceman to be effective in their respective vocations. Every vocation has a critical role to play in Singapore's security and defence.<br><br>Q9. Can I request for a change in posting unit?<br><br>You can forward your request to HRSC. However, please note that while MINDEF would like to take your posting preferences into account, any request will have to be considered vis-vis the organisational requirements.<br><br>Q10. My uniform cannot fit me. Can I report for service in civilian attire?<br><br>You can report in civilian attire if your uniform no longer fits you. However, please check with your unit's Chief Administrative Supervisor on the day of your reporting to arrange for a new set of uniform. Those reporting for Medical Officer Cadet course (MOCC) are required to put on white shirt and black pants.<br><br>Q11. Can I serve out my balance of full-time NS over more than one vacation period?<br><br>No. It is the policy of MINDEF that servicemen who wish to serve out the balance of their full-time NS during their school vacation must do so in one continuous period. Therefore, your vacation must be long enough for you to serve the balance of your full-time NS. No re-disruption will be allowed.<br><br>Q12. Do I have to inform Human Resource Services Centre (HRSC) of my intention to pursue my Honours or Masters course upon completion of my basic degree?<br><br>Yes. You will have to keep HRSC informed of your intention. Otherwise, you will be recalled to serve out the balance of your full-time NS when your current disruption period expires.<br><br>Q13. When will I know the outcome of my application to resume service?<br><br>Under normal processing, you will received a Notice to Render Full-time National Service (NOR) sent to your local mailing address within 6 weeks from the date of your application to resume service. If you do not receive a reply after 6 weeks, your application may have been forwarded to a higher authority and would therefore require a longer processing time.<br><br>Q14. If I have not completed my combat course prior to disruption, will I be sent for the same course on re-enlistment?<br><br>If you are medically fit for combat vocations, you may be sent for the same combat course upon your resumption.<br><br>Q15. I wish to resume my service during my vacation break. Is this possible?<br><br>Yes. You should apply for the resumption of service at least 6 weeks in advance if you wish to serve the balance of service during your vacation break. However upon resumption, you must serve the balance of your full-time NS in one continuous period. You are not allowed to serve your balance of full-time NS over 2 (or more) vacation periods. Once service is resumed, you will not be granted re-disruption. It is important therefore, that you ensure your vacation period can accommodate your balance of full-time NS.<br><br>Q16. What should I do if I want to serve out the balance of my full-time NS before my disruption expires?<br><br>You will need to notify Human Resource Services Centre (HRSC) of your intention to resume service at least 6 weeks in advance.<br><br>Q17. I was given a few days of medical leave by a private clinic before the effective date for me to report to unit to serve out the balance of my full-time NS. Will the few days of medical leave be counted towards the balance of my full-time NS?<br><br>No. If you are not able to report to your unit because of a medical leave not granted by an SAF doctor, the date of your resumption will be postponed until you are medically fit to report to your unit for service.<br><br>Q18. How can I check my leave balance?<br><br>Your previous unit maintains your leave records. You can check your leave balance with them before your disruption from full-time NS.<br><br>Q19. Can I use my annual leave to request for an early ORD to enable me to start work earlier/return and complete my study?<br><br>No, you are not allowed to use your annual leave or Off to request for an early ORD.</p>

              <p>Generally i am not against the idea of army and NS. Yes once inside its like a 'private' institution. but the traings you go through really will throw your physics to the limit.</p>
              <p>i dont have your problem like affecting studies. last time when i know its time to go NS i just go serve. after that ORD then i work and go study upgrade.</p>
              <p>when working sometimes have to disrupt and go what lah non-ICT IPPT what ICT lah. so i just folow their schedule and go, never keng or intentionally absent myself. of course if you never complete a trainign or fail phsyical test they have to re-scehdule so that on paper you completed. inconveneint then.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but if you just go follow schedule serve, it will be over sooner than you know.</p>
              <p>you are pes A, so physical traings will be no problem for you. if you want a slightly better life in amry, just tone down a little on your phsyical test stations results. like chin updont do maximum, contro your strenght with board jumping, control your 2.4 km end time etc. i am not telling you to lax on your physical abilities. if during your own personal traingin for IPPT, you can still push for your limmit and know your limit. only during test tone down a little.</p>

              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Being in
              a uniformed organisation, you’ll have to obey orders from your

              what you want and you may find yourself having difficulties
              accepting authority initially.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Regimentation and

              <p> </p>
              <p>but if he is academically inclied, good study results, sure will have another chance to get into studies after his NS ORD.</p>
              <p>he is phsycially fit for PES A NS, so that solves a big part of the pproblem to be up at the dsired results of physical training demands in the army - a problem with most soldiers. that why i suggets hom to tone down  on results to PES B. so it wont be too tough for him should he be sposted to those eltie soldier type of vocation trainign after BMT.</p>

              disruption is to reach HRSC at least 3 weeks before the expiry of
              your disruption period.<br> <br> Q2a. Can I apply for an extension to pursue my Honours/Masters
              degree after I have completed my Basic degree?<br> <br> Q2b. My disruption period as well as my exit permit is expiring
              soon but I intend to do my Honours/Masters. However, the outcome of
              my application for my Honours/Masters course will only be announced
              at a later date. What should I do?<br> <br> Extension of disruption for Honours/Masters degree may be allowed
              only if it can be obtained within 5 years (inclusive of the
              disruption period granted for the Basic degree). No extension for

              of 3 months while waiting for confirmation of acceptance by the
              University. Your exit permit will also be extended upon extension
              of your disruption. No re-disruption for Honours/Masters will be
              allowed after resumption of service.<br> <br> Q3. How do I know if my online application for an extension has
              been successful?<br> <br> You can choose how you wish to be notified (ie email or postal
              service) of the outcome of your application under Preferred Means
              of correspondence.<br> <br> Q4. What will happen if I fail to resume service after my
              disruption period has expired?<br> <br> NSFs on disruption must return immediately to serve out the balance
              of their Full-time NS as recalled, or upon
              discontinuation/completion of their studies. Disciplinary action
              will be taken against those who fail to do so. NSFs disrupted for
              overseas studies will have their exit permit withdrawn by the
              Central Manpower Base (CMPB) and be classified as exit permit
              defaulters.<br> <br> Q5. Can I switch to a different course of study?<br> <br> You are not allowed to switch courses or institution without the
              prior approval of the Human Resource Services Centre (HRSC). You
              are required to inform Human Resource Services Centre (HRSC) on the
              switch of study with documentary proof of the details of the new
              course. Approval may be granted if the switch does not lead to an
              extension of the maximum 5 years duration or the original
              disruption period. The switch must also be to a course that is at
              least equivalent to that of the original course.<br> <br> ===============================================================<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> After Completion of Studies<br> <br> Resumption NS Service Balance Days<br> <br> Q1. What should I do if I am not available for the medical check-up
              that has been scheduled for me?<br> <br> Human Resource Services Centre (HRSC) will contact you regarding
              your medical check-up at the Medical Classification Centre (MCC)
              located at the Central Manpower Base (CMPB). If you are not
              available for the medical check-up that has been scheduled for you,
              you are to inform HRSC so that another appointment can be arranged
              for you.<br> <br> Q2. Can I go for my medical check-up before I complete my
              studies?<br> <br> You may go for your check-up at MCC/CMPB before you complete your
              studies. However, as the PES status accorded by MCC is only valid
              for a year, we advised that you contact HRSC to arrange for a
              medical appointment during your final year of study. This
              arrangement will facilitate your resumption of service immediately
              upon the completion of your studies.<br> <br> Q3. Can I request for a medical review before I resume my Full-time
              NS?<br> <br> Yes. HRSC will arrange for you to have a medical check-up at
              MCC/CMPB to ascertain your medical fitness once your application to
              resume full-time NS is received. Alternatively, you may also
              request for a medical review through your unit's manpower officer
              after you have resumed service.<br> <br> Q4. Can I choose to see my own Specialist or family doctor instead
              of going to the medical check-up at MCC/CMPB?<br> <br> No. The medical check-up at the MCC/CMPB is required to facilitate
              Medical Officers to review your medical conditions and to assign a
              medical PES status to you based on the current criteria outlined in
              the Medical Classification System. It is thus not possible for you
              to see your own Specialist or family doctor for this purpose.
              Nonetheless, you may ask your Specialist or family doctor for a
              medical report on your condition and to forward it to the Medical
              Officers who will then consider it in the assessment of your
              medical PES status.<br> <br> Q5. What are the documents that I have to bring along for the
              medical check-up at MCC/CMPB?<br> <br> You need to bring along your NRIC with any medical reports or
              supporting documents that will assist the Medical Officers in
              reviewing your medical condition and medical PES status.<br> <br> Q6. When will I complete my full-time NS if I apply to resume my
              service now?<br> <br> It depends on the balance of your full-time NS and your annual
              leave. You may contact Human Resource Services Centre (HRSC) to
              find out the balance of your full-time NS.<br> <br> Q7. Where would I be posted to upon my resumption of service?<br> <br> Usually for servicemen who have been trained in a specific vocation
              and who have only a short balance of full-time NS remaining, they
              would most likely be posted to their former units. However, there
              may be occasions where servicemen are re-deployed to other units
              due to organisational requirements.<br> <br> Q8. Will my tertiary qualifications or individual preferences be
              taken into consideration for deployment?<br> <br> The SAF's primary role is to build a fighting force that can defend
              Singapore and secure our peace. Therefore, this is the main
              consideration in deploying national servicemen to various
              vocations. Where necessary, we do take into consideration the
              national serviceman's education qualifications. But, the SAF will
              train every national serviceman to be effective in their respective
              vocations. Every vocation has a critical role to play in
              Singapore's security and defence.<br> <br> Q9. Can I request for a change in posting unit?<br> <br> You can forward your request to HRSC. However, please note that
              while MINDEF would like to take your posting preferences into
              account, any request will have to be considered vis-vis the
              organisational requirements.<br> <br> Q10. My uniform cannot fit me. Can I report for service in civilian
              attire?<br> <br> You can report in civilian attire if your uniform no longer fits
              you. However, please check with your unit's Chief Administrative
              Supervisor on the day of your reporting to arrange for a new set of
              uniform. Those reporting for Medical Officer Cadet course (MOCC)
              are required to put on white shirt and black pants.<br> <br> Q11. Can I serve out my balance of full-time NS over more than one
              vacation period?<br> <br> No. It is the policy of MINDEF that servicemen who wish to serve
              out the balance of their full-time NS during their school vacation
              must do so in one continuous period. Therefore, your vacation must
              be long enough for you to serve the balance of your full-time NS.
              No re-disruption will be allowed.<br> <br> Q12. Do I have to inform Human Resource Services Centre (HRSC) of
              my intention to pursue my Honours or Masters course upon completion
              of my basic degree?<br> <br> Yes. You will have to keep HRSC informed of your intention.
              Otherwise, you will be recalled to serve out the balance of your
              full-time NS when your current disruption period expires.<br> <br> Q13. When will I know the outcome of my application to resume
              service?<br> <br> Under normal processing, you will received a Notice to Render
              Full-time National Service (NOR) sent to your local mailing address
              within 6 weeks from the date of your application to resume service.
              If you do not receive a reply after 6 weeks, your application may
              have been forwarded to a higher authority and would therefore
              require a longer processing time.<br> <br> Q14. If I have not completed my combat course prior to disruption,
              will I be sent for the same course on re-enlistment?<br> <br> If you are medically fit for combat vocations, you may be sent for
              the same combat course upon your resumption.<br> <br> Q15. I wish to resume my service during my vacation break. Is this
              possible?<br> <br> Yes. You should apply for the resumption of service at least 6
              weeks in advance if you wish to serve the balance of service during
              your vacation break. However upon resumption, you must serve the
              balance of your full-time NS in one continuous period. You are not
              allowed to serve your balance of full-time NS over 2 (or more)
              vacation periods. Once service is resumed, you will not be granted
              re-disruption. It is important therefore, that you ensure your
              vacation period can accommodate your balance of full-time NS.<br> <br> Q16. What should I do if I want to serve out the balance of my
              full-time NS before my disruption expires?<br> <br> You will need to notify Human Resource Services Centre (HRSC) of
              your intention to resume service at least 6 weeks in advance.<br> <br> Q17. I was given a few days of medical leave by a private clinic
              before the effective date for me to report to unit to serve out the
              balance of my full-time NS. Will the few days of medical leave be
              counted towards the balance of my full-time NS?<br> <br> No. If you are not able to report to your unit because of a medical
              leave not granted by an SAF doctor, the date of your resumption
              will be postponed until you are medically fit to report to your
              unit for service.<br> <br> Q18. How can I check my leave balance?<br> <br> Your previous unit maintains your leave records. You can check your
              leave balance with them before your disruption from full-time
              NS.<br> <br> Q19. Can I use my annual leave to request for an early ORD to
              enable me to start work earlier/return and complete my study?<br> <br> No, you are not allowed to use your annual leave or Off to request
              for an early ORD.</p>
