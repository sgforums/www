              <p>Hi, I'm currently Pes C9L3, storeman(GE), pending overseas posting to thailand/taiwan.</p>
              <p>I downgraded my pes status from pes B1L1 due to degenerate disc disease L5S1 with annular tear and no nerve stenosis.</p>
              <p>I got posted to Kranji Camp 2, HQ supply, and was unfortunately allocated into EOP pending overseas posting.</p>
              <p>Currently I am attached to MINDEF as a storeman tentatively to the end of december.</p>
              <p>Previously I was in tekong, and specialist wrote a letter to recommend me for downgrading of pes status, thus became pes C9L3 after POP.</p>
              <p>Got posted to Kranji camp HQ supply then I dunno the system there.</p>
              <p>Recently just got a letter from my specialist during routine review saying exactly the following:</p>
              <p>"To: SAF MO I/C</p>
              <p>Re: My identification.</p>
              <p>Dear colleague,</p>
              <p>"My Name" has a degenerate L5S1 disc with annualar tear diagnosed on MRI scan.</p>
              <p>In view of his condition, he should be excused from heavy lifting/carrying loads to avoid worsening progression of his condition. Please take this into consideration especially with regards to his pending assignment for overseas duties.</p>
              <p>Regards,</p>
              <p>Sign off"</p>
              <p>Previously, before I got attached out, I've been to the SAF MO with my previous letter and he said "Now you've down pes, so now what? You're a storeman and thats the end of the story.. I'll just give you 1 day MC to stay home and rest with some medication."</p>
              <p>So now my question is that will I definitely fail the overseas FFI and not be posted overseas?</p>
              <p>Secondly, I want to ask if through this new letter I'll be able to be considered for a perm/temp downgrade to probably Pes E1L9 to truly protect my back. To like maybe stay in HQ supply permanently to assist on admin work.</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>Definitely fail: No.</p>
              <p>Definitely down pes to E: No.</p>
              <p>If your MO does not help push things up to medical board for review, and is going to say the same things to you again, your PES is going to stay there.</p>
              <p>Look on the bright side, Taiwan in particular is a very fun place. If you get posted to Thailand, try to avoid some of the night-life activities ~~ use a condom if you get involved in those stuffs, you know what I am talking about.</p>
              <p>You will have a pay around twice or more of your current pay, so feel free to spend during the weekend.</p>
              <p>Touchwood, lets say you really get posted overseas with your current PES, then you must learn to protect yourself and get others to help you out do your stuff.  </p>

              <p>Rather than saying that you will fail the FFI, it is likely that you cannot complete the FFI due to all these appointments and checkouts, so you will not be able to go overseas. Which is a good thing I guess.</p>
