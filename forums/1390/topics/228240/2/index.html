            <div class='col-md body'>from the New Paper. note the 2 points under the title.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>(pls do not quote entire article in reply)<br><br><span class="large"><strong>100kg of jet fuel additive STOLEN</strong></span><br><br><span class="small">Theft took place despite...<br>[*] Armed guards<br>[*] Anti-vehicle barriers<br><br>By Andre Yeo and Crystal Chan, 30 December 2006</span><br><br>HOW did this happen?<br>That is the question on the minds of security experts after the theft of a jet fuel additive on the heavily-guarded Jurong Island.<br><br>Thieves had made off with 100kg of Stadis 450, a jet fuel additive. Jurong Island is home to 88 leading petrochemical companies like DuPont and Shell.<br><br>The New Paper understands the additive was left in six sealed pails which later went missing. The Philippine Daily Inquirer reported the additive as belonging to OilTanking Singapore.<br><br>The company couldn't be contacted at press time.<br><br>The pails had been left in an open storage area on 29 Nov and were discovered missing by workers of the company on 4 Dec.<br><br>The stolen fuel additive is worth $6,800, said a Singapore police spokesman in a statement issued last night.<br><br>Police received a report on 6 Dec.<br><br>Police investigations into the theft are in progress.<br><br>Stadis 450 is added to jet fuel to enhance electrical conductivity. It is classified as a flammable liquid and hazardous material.<br><br>The incident was serious enough for Singapore authorities to alert a bomb data centre in the Philippines, reported the Philippine Daily Inquirer.<br><br>Since the 11 Sep terrorist attacks in the US, security on Jurong Island has been stepped up and it has also been gazetted a Protected Area. Armed soldiers and police officers are involved in its security.<br><br>In November 2003, the chemical hub opened a new security checkpoint featuring x-ray scanners to detect explosives and weapons, as well as three-tier vehicle barriers to bar intrusions.<br><br>Visitors must also exchange their identity cards for a pass and all incoming vehicles are searched before being allowed entry.<br><br>The Singapore Armed Forces works closely with the Police Coast Guard, JTC Corporation and the resident commercial companies to protect Jurong Island.<br><br>Given these layers of security, the fuel theft was perplexing to ex-cop and private investigator Lionel De Souza.<br><br>He asked: 'Is it a chink in the security or possible collaboration on the part of some dishonest worker on the island?'<br><br>Mr Joe Moreira, a security and explosives consultant, told The New Paper that whoever stole the additive probably did it for the money.<br><br>But he doubts the fuel additive will be a threat.<br><br>He said: 'Jet fuel burns very quickly in the air and you can't sustain it for long. You need diesel to sustain the fire. So, you'll be wasting jet fuel on a bomb.'<br><br>But he felt the incident raised security questions. Said Mr Moreira: 'How can someone can go in past all the access controls, and come out with stolen goods?'<br><br>But who would buy jet fuel additive from unauthorised sources?<br><br>A source in the aviation industry said that if a syndicate is involved, it would have ready buyers.<br><br>Said the source: 'Those who own private jets are potential customers, especially when jet fuel prices have risen recently.<br><br>'Big airlines wouldn't buy from the black market. They don't want to ruin their reputations by getting involved in shady deals.'<br><br>The source said jet fuel additives can be used in any machine running on jet engines, such as jet skis and jetboats.<br><br>When contacted, a JTC Corporation spokesman would only say: 'We understand that a police report has been filed and the police are investigating the matter.'</div>
