Am I right to say Singapore is in danger of a terrorist attack?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br><a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=40463" rel="nofollow">http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=40463</a><br><br>May be used for explosives, they say<br>By Nancy C. Carvajal<br>Inquirer<br>Last updated 09:39pm (Mla time) 12/27/2006<br><br>MANILA--The Singapore police force recently alerted local authorities on the disappearance of close to a hundred kilos of jet fuel from an oil storage depot in their city state, which they said could be used as a component for explosives, an alert bulletin obtained by Inquirer showed.<br><br>In the bulletin sent by the Singapore's Criminal Investigation Department Bomb Data Centre to the Philippine National Police Bomb Data Center, the stolen product was identified as Stadis 450.<br><br>It said six sealed blue containers containing jet fuel were discovered missing, on Dec. 4, from the Oil Tanking Singapore Limited, located at Seraya Avenue, Jurong Island.<br><br>They were classified as flammable liquid and hazardous material. "Being flammable, the additive can be used as fuel oil together with an improvised explosive device for incendiary effect," the bulletin stated.<br><br>The six containers weighed 15.9 kilograms each, measured about 50 cm or four feet and two inches in length, and 38 cm or three feet and two inches in diameter.<br><br>The bulletin stated that the stolen fuel was composed of polymeric nitrogen and toluene and was class three hazardous.<br><br>Supt. Rafael Santiago, chief of the Northern Police District Investigation and Intelligence, said the sending of the bulletin was a common practice among intelligence groups particularly if it concerned potential terorrist activities.<br><br>"The theft raises security concerns because it could be terrorist-related,'' Santiago said when asked why Singapore police would alert police units in other countries over a theft that took place in their city state.<br><br>He explained that jet fuels were not sold openly in the market and carriers had their own suppliers.<br><br>"Besides, legitimate carriers would not likely engage in illegal trade which could endanger their own airlines,'' Santiago said.<br><br>He added that dissemination of information with other agencies and police force was a precaution.<br><br>"They're following their procedures. We are also going to follow all precautions to make sure all local authorities are notified," he said.<br><br>He also clarified that although the Metro Manila Police has been placed on full alert in the approach to the Rizal Day LRT bombing anniversary, "we have not received any information about plots to bomb metro Manila.''<br><br>Singapore has been in the forefront of the fight against terrorism and is known to share available intelligence about terrorist cells and their activities with other countries.<br><br>In 2003, 13 members of the terrorist group Jemaah Islamiya were arrested by the Singapore police for allegedly plotting to bomb US allies in support of Osama bin Laden.<br><br>Singapore had also shared information with Indonesian police that JI leader Bashir was living in central Java and another suspected leader of the terrorist cell identified only as Hambali, was also in Indonesia.<br></div>

That's a very reasonable estimate, considering that one smaller jerrycan can hold 25 litres of water. 100kg of fuel has a volume of slightly more than 100 litres (say, 110 litres).<br><br>So all it takes is two nondescript barrels stored in the back of an unremarkable pickup truck (for example). I don't suppose anyone is going to view two barrels in the back of a vehicle coming out of Jurong Island with more than a passing glance.</div>
