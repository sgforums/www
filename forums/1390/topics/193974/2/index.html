            <div class='col-md body'>1st of all, thanks Kyoy for sharing this story. quite a interesting case study, hopefully we'll get some interesting discussion and point of views.<br><br>in my opinion, there's a fine line between garang and stupidity. from your description, yup i agree he's garang in wanting to go for confidence course and taking on higher responsibility.<br><br>but even if he is granted his wish, is he capable of doing those thing? surely he understand the physical and mental aspect of going through those courses right? some people always like to say they want to go this and that, then after being into it a while, gave up easily because they cannot take it.<br><br>quite sad seeing he being sentenced to DB just because over-confidence got the better of him, his desire to impress.<br><br>can't help but feel that actually he might not be a bad person, and all this might not have happened if he was properly educated by his superiors, to tell him his ideas won't work and to bring him back to reality.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually the officers shold have send him for counselling or should have brief him regarding his role in the SAF when he was a trainee driver. He may be having mental stress even before the sentence into Dentention Barracks. In most cases, mental stress may be from their family source, or having low self esteem and thereby trying ways of proving himself.<br>In whatever sense this soldier to me sound mentally unfit to be holding arms and it is better to advise the higher authority to send him for psychological assessment before he cause harm to anyone.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh - another person gets posted to the wrong vocation. He should have been an infantry man. I think he would do very well there.<br><br>But on another note, why does it appear that the driver vocation gets more than its fair share of co-cks? Is it because discipline is usually slacker? I was once on a tonner driven by this driver drove through camp as if he was in the grand prix. When scolded by another person, this arse-h0le actually talked back!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Uncle_MooMoo:</div><div class="quote_body">So what happened after he got recommended to the psychiatrist?</div></blockquote>At that point, i already ORDed. Last i heard, he was under the charge of a Psychiatrist officer named Major John Chong or something. Although i won't say he is crazy but it does appear that he suffer from some mental problems AFTER the DB incident.<br><br>Some of you pinpointed that it is the fault of us specialists and the MTOfficers that he ended up that way. Is that true? Of course it is.<br><br>This is partly why i penned down this "story". Definitely at this point, there is an element of guilt here. I remember myself laughing with all the specialist and even other drivers at his eccentric behaviour. It is very hard to take him seriously when he was reciting poems like "I am a bird trapped in a cage"  in your face.<br><br>Now, despite already ORDing for a few months, i find myself faced with the guilt issue about whether i could have done more or done better.<br><br>But there are a few factors to consider.<br><br>1. We are only NSFs not social workers. In my opinion, the REGULARS and my encik should have been the one counselling him but they chose to laugh at him along with us. That does not lessen our guilt in any way though<br><br>2. And the more important point. The reason why nobody attempted to counsel him was because he was very dislikeable too ! He was very condescending and arrogant. He believed that he single handely could change the world and that he was smarter than everybody put together. It was hard to maintain an even temper when talking to him on a 1 to 1 basis. In a sense, this put off superiors from taking time to have a "counselling session" with him.<br><br>Again, point number 2 still won't lessen my (our MTline's?) guilt of turning an .... enthusiastic? soldier into a person with mental problems and a prison record. But what to do? I have already ORDed and have no more contact with this person. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think in the case of the army, discipline and listening to commands/orders is very important. Even though being a driver seems to be pretty mediocre, it still have an important role in the SAF. If every driver wishes to be a ranger, who will be around to drive the 3 tonnes ? If every soldier is not discipline and do not listen to orders, who will be around to charge through the frontline ? He may be garang, but he may become a hazard in times of war by disobeying military strategy and drive through to the frontline instead of to support supplies to impress his supervisor.<br><br>If he really wanna be in the army, he should have sign on in the first place.</div>

He wants to be different and thinks he can do it.<br><br>But the problem with NS is the system in there does not suit his youthful optimism and adventurous can-do spirit. NS has 1000 rules to follow. 999 recruits probably went in to "conform" to the rules but this malay guy sure's a non-conformist and apparently, the system doesn't know how to deal with such kind of people - the system only knows how to apply punishment when a rule is broken.<br><br>I don't think the punishment will change him for the better.

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sorry but I have to disagree with most of u.<br><br>He did the wrong thing when he disabled the SWD and went above the speed limit set for Mindef/Army vehicles under normal operations.<br><br>There is a time for "garangness" and there is a time for "discipline" and compliance to orders.  The soldier demonstrated a disregard for the rules and regulations, and needed to be corrected.<br><br>While his enthusiasm can be encouraged, eg his diligence in carrying out first parade tasks, it does not make up, nor cover up his lack of discipline and disregard for chain of command.<br><br>If he really wanted to do something more exciting than just being a driver, I really felt he should have contacted his unit's manpower officer to sign on.  Still, his lack of discipline must be dealt with.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>moral of the story, that's a limit to garangness. cross that line and it turns to stupidity. do what is expected from u, carry out your job professionally and stay out of trouble. we all want to finish our 2 years peacefully and get on with our lives. don't let one moment of foolishness ruin it.</div>
