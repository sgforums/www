            <div class='col-md body'><p>hi, i just 'pop' from bmtc on the 10th of june. Posting are to be out on the 20th of june. However i just received a letter from rsaf indicating that i do not make the cut for pilot vocation. I made a call and they told me i didn't make it for ocs(13th june). i did pass my compass test and supposingly awaiting for an interview. It all ends here now? I would really wish to fly for rsaf since young. Does it all ends here? i can't even get an interview all whatsoever. I can't do anything now? Could someone give me an advice. I'm really disappointed at how things work</p></div>

              Well if you failed to get the relevant assistance and help you would wanted through the phone, the best advice for you will be that you make a trip to the recruitment centre to sort it out. 
              
              After all, it has been said many times that the staff at the recruitment centre will be able to provide you with much more accurate information than this forum mates could probably provide with.
              
              I guess its pretty known fact that OCS is a requirement for one to become a pilot. For those who applied for the post prior to enlistment, and who have been subjected to the relevant tests e.g. the compass, interview, and aeromedical, will be told that "okay now the next thing you need to make sure is that you qualify for OCS."
              
              However during BMT, NSmen are also given to option to sign on, apply for stuffs etc etc, and there are some dudes, who applied for pilot during then, that did not go to OCS, but sispec instead. Maybe they didn't op for command school? Quite a couple of different scenarios.
              
              It is still that you check out with AFRC.

              <p>Eh quah dun be too sad man. Shit happens. All the frigging time. If you cant get into the air force, dun be too sad. Cos thousands of other people have applied, and quite a number are also unable to make it through.</p>
              <p>U can consider other vocations in the rsaf, such as the AEO. Its not a bad vocation, u might want to think about it. But if u sincerely want to fly as a career, then u can consider SIA. I wont consider it at this point of time, but if I fail my interview also, then this might be my only option.</p>
              <p>Anyway, just get on with life. Shit always happens. Dun be too disappointed. When I was 'kicked out' of syfc last year after my solo flight, I thought that it was the end of the world. But now I realise that behind every shit, there's always a silver lining. Now that I'm no more in syfc, I have much more time with my friends. Back then, I was at the syfc compound 5 or 6 days a week, spending hours and hours in there. I had no time for myself and my schoolwork, let alone going out with friends. But now that I'm out, I realise that although its sad I couldnt carry on, but then life does get a little better.</p>
              <p>I say this much just so u can reconsider ur choices and not be too disgruntled over it. I understand how u feel, and the best advice I can give is to just let it go, and let time heal everything. Dont bother bugging the people there to give u another chance, cos even if in the rare event they let u go in, u wouldnt be happy cos u noe that u didnt make the cut.</p>

              <p>Hey.. your case sounds just like mine. Couldn't help replying to your thread..
              I was in the exact same shoes as you. had a background with syfc, got my wings. Did quite well for my compass test (according to an insider), thought of signing on as pilot.</p>
              <p>But BMT was quite a disappointment. i saw how political and corrupted the system was, the wayang-ness and how they graded the recruits. Wasn't what i'd imagine it to be.. Anyway, i didn't qualify for ocs, went to sispec instead. And, got the same rejection letter.</p>
              <p>Appealed and they granted me an interview, which i eventually didn't make it past. was really  dejected and disappointed then.. but now after 2yrs in the army. That was the best God-damned thing that ever happened.</p>
              <p>now, im on my way to further my studies overseas. I have my freedom, and choice to do whatever I want. Not to be sourgrapes or anything, I still love flying and i plan to renew and un-restrict my PPL overseas. But some things, when it's not meant for you, just let it go.</p>
              <p>There's a higher calling for you in future. forget about the wayang rsaf commercials. life inside is nothing like what you see on TV.</p>

I always thought that if I did go all the way in syfc and get my PPL, I'd be a happy man. But then I realise now that if I really had gone in through appeal, I wouldnt be feeling good cos I'm simply not up to the mark. I'm not forcing any options on u, but then if u truly feel that being a rsaf pilot is ur calling in life (like me), then u can try to go all the way. I'm just telling u the bigger picture.</p></div>

              <p>i was in your shoes 3 months ago. passed my compass test last nov and was called up for interview on 19th march this year and unfortunately, i failed it. i was asked about leadership stuff and i guess the panel thinks that i'm not being very honest with them about my syfc records. the recruitment officer (a major) asked mi to make it into ocs and reapply again may be to show them that i hav leadership qualities n stuff. another bad thing happened again, posted to commandos on 11th july and the recruitment officer ask mi to make it into commando OCS,i'm like wateva...hahaz...another worse scenario happened, i downgraded from pes A to C2L2 for temporary 3 months. they sent mi a new enlistment letter for pes c bmt on 24th oct but i'm only downgraded for 3 months, how the hell i'm gonna make it into oct batch unless the MO further extend my downgrade period. basically my life is pretty screwed up now,100 times more screwed up than TS. i got an advice for you TS: ALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE! join SIA if you really wana fly...   </p>

              <p>Well, same case here for me as bro WeetWeet. I did not make it to OCS. I could not 'tahan' the wayangness within the platoon and I did not see the need to out-wayang my platoon mates just to get into OCS. Anyway, BMT was just 2 months and if the SAF thinks it could pick quality talent from just 2 months worth of evaluation then good luck to them. However, during my last few weeks in SISPEC BSLC, they decided to call me down for an interview. I am not too sure why the last minute decision though.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I went for the interview and was rejected. I was asked by a COL many questions on why I was not selected for OCS. He particularly arrowed me a lot of questions on my BMT and SISPEC performance. I was also asked, "Do you know that to become a pilot, you need to make it to OCS and become an officer?" I could sense the 'inferiority' that he was trying to put across to me just because I did not make it to OCS. I pitied the MSG who was also among the judges on the interview panel.</p>
              <p>It might be a blessing in disguise for not being selected like one of the bros have mentioned here. Aim for SIA. I believe they have better employee remuneration as compared to RSAF. If not, get a PPL in Malaysia or go overseas and self-sponsor your ATPL.</p>
              <p>Good luck to your aviation dream.</p>

              hmm... seems like quite a few of u r similar to me.
              my advice to TS n the rest, dun give up yet.
              
              i applied for pilot b4 i enlisted n went for the COMPASS test b4 i enlisted.
              AFRC didnt get back to me until my BMT was finishing n they told me i had passed, next up will be the interview.
              
              i didnt make it to OCS n was posted to SISPEC. i rem it was in BSLC that they called me up for interview. i went to CPMB in my no 4 as a PTE for the interview. the interview panel had 4 pple, 1x COL, 1x MAJ, 1x CPT n 1x female DXO. the DXO had all my particulars, right up from pri sch n even minor details of me which i'm rather surprised.
              
              i was bombarded wif several qns by all 4 of them n had my integrity tested by the DXO which i wont reveal wat they asked. n yeah, the COL asked me "how come u r not in OCS n in BSLC now?"
              
              not sure whether i answered correctly, i replied "guess my instructors didnt tink i was outstanding enuff, that's y i didnt make it."
              they then went on to probe abt my CCA n sad to say, my CCA records were very poor. they commented that i'm quite low profile in my sch yrs n i said yeah.
              
              then they asked me abt how i am coping wif army life n if i didnt make it pass this interview, would i consider signing on for WSO. i told them straight in the face that it's only pilot for me, nothing else.
              
              my interview stretched quite long, abt 1/2hr n at when i walked out of the room, i tot i confirm fail the interview as i wasnt outstanding enuff. but surprisingly within mins, i was told that i passed the interview. next up will be the medical checkup which i waited 4 mths for it. 
              
              i proceeded on to ASLC n went for the medical checkup. took them quite a long while to get back to me. AFRC called me when i was in taiwan for training but luckily it was during R&amp;R n i was abt to pass out from ASLC n they told me that i'm cleared to join air force n i have to wait for the next available batch of trainees.
              
              i subsequently passed out as a 3SG from SISPEC n went over to air force sch. the 1st day there was quite memorable, i rem the culture shock i had. nobody wore headgears n the RSM told me to remove my 3SG rank n put on the OCT rank asap. it was quite a pain as the 3SG wasnt achieved easily n i had to remove them less than 2 weeks after putting them on.
              
              sorry for the long post, juz wanna encourage those who have passion n desire to join air force as a pilot. i am 1 example of a SISPEC trainee who made it to Air Force Sch as a pilot trainee. dun give up guys!

              <p>Hi guys. I passed my interview about 2 weeks ago and am heading on to the medical. I do not meet the eyesight requirement for the RSAF, yet they still pass me for interview? The colonel even mentioned to me that he knew my eyesight was past the limit but said I was eloquent enough in the interview and should be suited for pilot training.</p>
              <p>I don't understand as wouldn't I be unable to pass the aeromedical with my poor eyesight?</p>
              <p>L-375 Astig : 100<br>R-525 Astig : 100</p>
              <p>Would I be able to get a waiver to pass aeromedical? I also have quite a large scar on my forearm due to a bad fall but it's mainly cosmetic and doesn't affect my physical performance, as I managed to obtain a Gold for NAPFA.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any help guys? Thanks in advance!</p>

              <p>RSAF has first say to having the best pilots. that is why SIA's pilot age requirement is higher than RSAF</p>
              <p>that in no way means the people who join as pilots for SIA later are lousier than RSAF. because there are no challengers to pilot requirements to RSAF during that age, RSAF can do whatever they want.</p>

              <p>It costs nearly 100k to actually get your ATPL in Malaysia. And that's only frozen as you need 1500 hours total time and 500 PIC time for conversion to the full one. That isn't easy to get too. Also, type ratings are very expensive, and usually are requirements for airlines.</p>
              <p>When you graduate from the flying academies, you would probably have only 250 hours, and that isn't sufficient to get a job as a First Officer in almost all Asian airlines, as they start to take in FOs at about 1000TT.</p>
              <p>It's pretty expensive and risky if you don't get picked up by SIA! But don't let that stop your dreams as there are some who managed to make it and fly for the low-cost carriers like AirAsia or Tiger Airways.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>@bloodsucker : Thanks for the re-affirmation. I'm not sure how stringent they are regarding the eyesight requirement, as JAA first class medical states that below -6.00D would be fine for issuance. UK CAA 1st class medical would be slightly harder to get at -5.00D as the limit but I heard that from -5.00 to -6.00 they do give a waiver? For the RSAF, I think that almost all above 175 degrees get sent for PRK, and that 25 degrees wouldn't make much of a difference as everyone equals out to 6/6 or near 6/6 vision with surgery?</p>
