Apparently I passed both the compass test and later the interview... All I had to do was to pass the medical(Somehow I think you guys are all talking about the same major who interviewed you lol)... Anyway... Just cheer up yeah? Shit really happens... I underwent a MRI scan the next day after the interview which showed a torn meniscus which required surgery so I'm already downpes-ed permanently without hope of becoming a pilot lol... Otherwise I'd have been like my friend who crossed over to OCS from BSLC to be a pilot... Just enjoy your NS life man:D cheers!</p></div>

              <p>Hey.. your case sounds just like mine. Couldn't help replying to your thread.. I was in the exact same shoes as you. had a background with syfc, got my wings. Did quite well for my compass test (according to an insider), thought of signing on as pilot.</p>
              <p>But BMT was quite a disappointment. i saw how political and corrupted the system was, the wayang-ness and how they graded the recruits. Wasn't what i'd imagine it to be.. Anyway, i didn't qualify for ocs, went to sispec instead. And, got the same rejection letter.</p>
              <p>Appealed and they granted me an interview, which i eventually didn't make it past. was really dejected and disappointed then.. but now after 2yrs in the army. That was the best God-damned thing that ever happened.</p>
              <p>now, im on my way to further my studies overseas. I have my freedom, and choice to do whatever I want. Not to be sourgrapes or anything, I still love flying and i plan to renew and un-restrict my PPL overseas. But some things, when it's not meant for you, just let it go.</p>
              <p>There's a higher calling for you in future. forget about the wayang rsaf commercials. life inside is nothing like what you see on TV.</p>

              <p>i'm in that same shit too. i applied for pilot before enlistment, passed everything before enlistment. and i was told to work hard and get into OCS. however, i didn't qualify and i received a phone call and sms. no letter though. i really wanna be an rsaf pilot. weetweet...how to maneuver my way to get another chance? wad can i do?? pls help me, anyone? i was told by recruitment to hope i get into sispec and be the top few and crossover...like WTF. i noe its freaking almost impossible to crossover. were u one of the top few people in bslc?</p>

              <p>so i'm really confused now. who is right?! sighs. like hello, u dun judge a person based on SOLDIERING. am i right? like how many successful people out there were once just "man". and if u put an officer in the working world...u think they will excel? army and cv world super different. in cv world, u nid wits only and not physical. wad i lack is physical. as in i'm not the strong kind who can run here and there and still feel like i haf breathe. the reason why i screwed up field camp cuz i was constantly trying to catch my breathe. HOW TO WAYANG like that?! by the time i'm done running about...i'm so shag, i just sit 1 corner with my friends. </p>

              <p>Even if you don't become a fighter pilot,it does not make you
              any worse off than those who do.As you pointed out,there is a great
              difference between cv and army,not all of us are cut out to be
              soldiers,I'm definitely not one of them(I'm obese).Vice versa,not
              all soldiers even if they are officers are cut out to be CEOs or
              unfallible leaders.</p>
