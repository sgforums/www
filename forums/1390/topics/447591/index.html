              <p>COMPLETELY unfounded assumptions. if, based on ur notion tht the mindef would mobilise the SIngapore army over an israeli attack, Singapore would have done so similarly in the Lebanon War as well as the War of Yom Kippur, The war of Attrition and the Suez war, no? In every case up till 2000, never once has our dear neighbours Malaysia or indonesia even given a damn about these wars despite the fact each was as horrid, if not more severe than what could happen in the near future, AND that singapore practically endeared herself to Israel throughout this time. THERE IS a difference between LOCAL, regional politics and INTERNATIONAL politics, my friend. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You misunderstand that middle-east politics is similar, in fact directly linked to SE politics. it is not. in fact, Indonesia nor Malaysia aren't even part of the Arab Union, no? If you're saying Indo and Malaysia would 'retaliate' merely because a very distant ally is attacked by Singapore's ally, you are very, very mistaken, my dear friend. </p>
