              <p>sounds interesting. so what have you found out? Why is the red one "unstable"? How was it "unstable" and what chemical did you add to it to make it "unstable"?</p>
              <p>How was it different from the green, yellow and blue one in terms of chemical composition?</p>
              <p>What is your conclusion so far after 2 months of study? How can they be made?</p>
              <p>Oh. By the way, you said that you found that the chemical in red is unstable. that means the other colours are ok and they are in your camp? Then its easy. Show them your test results and evidence of test being conducted.... you know, those empty cartriges of lightsticks, your bunkmate must have seen you do the experiment etc etc</p>

              Humm, I don't think it is a issue for light stick. The MP will just shoot the email to your boss. If your boss is so free to entertain the MP. He might just reply "Sure would take note" . If he is more on, may be he would just "talk to you". Unless he hate you so something else.  WHAT is the issue with bringing light stick into SAF camp anyway? They are just household items.

              <p>bo bian... MP is like that de... I am MP.. you are doom for sure..</p>
              <p>But let me teach ya a trick. Tell your OC first. Let your OC punish you first. Sign some extras first. Once you have been punished once, you cannot be punished the second time. If you wait and wait, the MP take action, you kanna charged, then go for the wat trial (i forgotten the name), and worst is 7 days DB. Trust me, act fast and you would be fine, explain to your OC, PS, PC, CSM.</p>
              <p>DB is not nice lor, its several of you in a small cell, well I shall not explain how DB is, since you most probably would not be going there.</p>

              <p>untill I have a satisfactory answer to these questions from TS, I have my reserve... although he does have my sympathy. You know the solgan. "You can do anything, but don't get caught."</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>My advice. Come clean. If you had stolen them, tell your PC you have done it and you are sorry.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>At most it will be SOL. Stealing will never be a DB case, but stealing and refusing to cooperate in investigation is a case that is much more serious.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>If you are really clean, then prepare a letter, stating very clearly, when you bought them, where you bought them, why you bought them and the various tests that you have conducted so far with all your findings, data, records, notes, research materials, equipment and resourcesÂ used. If you have all these ready, and the experiment that you conducted is not against any SOP then you should be fine. Again, if you cant produce a good answer to the questions stated above, then you better own up. People are paid huge salaries to become prosecutors. Their questions are tougher than mine. Unless its a fact, sooner or later you'll have to confess.</p>

              <p>if u did not steal it, go explain to your csm first andÂ go to the stall that u bought to getÂ  evidence, like a receipt</p>

              <p>I sincerely thank you all for ur concern and advice. My csm already know about this and he told me he will qns me. I shall just briefly tell u wat happen from the time i bought the lightstick to the time i got caught.</p>
              <p>1. searched the net for info on where i can buy the cheapest lightstick (curious about lightsticks)</p>
              <p>2. bought lightstick from beach road at 70cents each (transaction with no receipt &amp; couldnt remember which store since the place is so messy- like a maze)</p>
              <p>3. brought in to camp the following week (at that time i thought saf thingsÂ that can be bought outside, can be brought in/out of camp)</p>
              <p>4. i thought it would be wiseÂ to some online research on the safety of experimenting &amp; the basic properties of the chemicals in the lightstick</p>
              <p>5. got some info on the unstability of red lightstick, so i decided to discard all red lightsticks from my experiment</p>
              <p>6. Â started my experimentÂ out ofÂ curiousity on the other 3 colours (not any professional researches with test tubes or scientific equipment in place)</p>
              <p>7. gave up the experimentÂ bcos of too little findingsÂ and futile efforts and found that it is capital intensive to keep buying lightstick and just experiment on them (thought of importance to save up for university education)</p>
              <p>8. brought the remaining red lightsticks home. and that was how &amp; when i got caught.</p>

              <p>if you were an MP, you stopped someone and intercepted a bunch of light sticks ....</p>

              <p>I think it's best to go and find out which shop they were bought from.</p>
              <p>At least you could give the shop number... And if the NSN number was really from ex-SAF stock they sourced elsewhere, the blame could be shifted away from you... And if the number is not from ex-SAF stock, nothing will happen.</p>
              <p>Can't really blame the MP though; he was just doing his job.</p>
