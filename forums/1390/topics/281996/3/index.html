            <div class='col-md body'>Can MINDEF explain how a car can provide a "commanding" presence to the men in line with the chain of command of a military organization? Its like saying if a 3SG drives to camp in his father's Merc or BMW, his men will see him and respect his commanding presence because he drive a Merc or BMW. So to say...if a 3SG whom rides a Kawasaki bike to camp...will be lacking in such a "commanding" presence unless he rides a Harley Davidson. This simply doesn't make any sense for me man. Well...perhaps its not supposed to make sense for me. If a car can really command respect from the men...the rank insignia of officers, WOs, Specs and enlisted should all change to reflect the logos of cars and motorcycles. CDF should have the Bentley or Rolls Royce logo, Service Chiefs BMWs, Formation Chiefs Mercs, LTC and Colonels Audis or Volvos, Majors Lexus, Captains Toyotas, LTAs Hyundai and 2LTs Chery and so on.</div>
