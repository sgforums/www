              <p>hi all,</p>
              <p>i went for my medical review and the doctor told me i am suffering from this "autonomic nervous dysfunction" which explains my faintings. He came to this conclusion based on the findings of the "tilt test"</p>
              <p>i am devestated by this news cause the doctor told me i am unfit for combat.</p>
              <p>i wanna ask what pes will i mostly likely fall into ?</p>
              <p>and can i appeal for a higher pes ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>EDIT.</p>
              <p>i have received my medical summary and i am pes E9L9.</p>
              <p> i seriously don't know what is Autonomic Nervous Dysfunction , why is it like so serious ?</p>
              <p>i have NAFA silver, so i am quite puzzle as to my pes and that dysfunction.</p>
              <p>can someone/MO kindly explain to me ?</p>

              <p>One of the hallmarks of maturity is to be responsible.</p>
              <p>Don't hide your condition to the CMPB MO. Your safety, and the safety of your future unit/mates are at stake if you choose to hide your condition and you suffer an attack while in training.</p>

              <p>Sigh.... another Counterstrike fanboy who thinks that garangness == honour and glory.... I've hammered quite a few of these chaps over the years....</p>
              <p>Believe me, kid, going home to your mother in one piece is also just as honourable and glorious as being a chiong sua Rambo wannabe.</p>
              <p>If anything, think about it.... if you're going to faint in the middle of a firefight, you will be a worthless piece of meat. If you faint during an artillery bombardment, you will be a dead piece of meat. Is there any honour and glory in being a liability to your comrades?</p>
              <p>Don't even talk about actual war.... do you really want to have a fainting episode at the top of the Jacob's Ladder during SOC training?</p>
              <p>Now, be a good soldier and give the specialist's letter to the CMPB medical officer. You will most likely be classified PES C9L9 or PES E.</p>

              <p>Disappointed? Why? Because you cannot serve your country as a chiong sua warrior?</p>
              <p>Like I said, there are many paths to honour and glory. If you cannot be in the front line, then be a good rear echelon personnel. Be a conscientious and hardworking service medic/clerk/storeman/driver.That is also a true path to glory.</p>
              <p>I know of many people in such vocations who are actually very fit but are there because of some bad knee/back/ligament/whatever. So, really, what's the shame?</p>

              <p>i went for my medical review and the doctor told me i am suffering from this "autonomic nervous dysfunction" which explains my faintings. He came to this conclusion based on the findings of the "tilt test"</p>
              <p>i am devestated by this news cause the doctor told me i am unfit for combat.</p>
              <p>i wanna ask what pes will i mostly likely fall into ?</p>
              <p>and can i appeal for a higher pes ?</p>

              <p>i have received my medical summary and i am pes E9L9.</p>
              <p> i seriously don't know what is Autonomic Nervous Dysfunction , why is it like so serious ?</p>
              <p>i have NAFA silver, so i am quite puzzle as to my pes and that dysfunction.</p>
