              <p>well hey guys. i know there have been a few threads previously regarding
                  LBVs etc that our servicemen get, but they all seem to be dead. I thought it'd
                  be nice for everyone to discuss the equipment that they have receieved over the
                  years. Hopefully, MSD won't touch this as everything is widely available at
                  beach road, and thus 'open source'. As this is my first picture post (and as
                  i'm a noob), please be nice and tell me if you don't like it, or you want me to
                  move it somewhere else.</p>
              <p>Just a brief introduction. I served my time in an infantry bn and just
                  recently ORD-ed. my LBV might seem a little different from everyone else's, as
                  there were leftovers from the trials given to the previous mono in the bn, and
                  i took a sample. The quality's alot better than the current one that all the
                  recruits in BMT recieved. I also zhnged it many times extra for personal
                  comfort; namely to accomodate my bunsen cooker, cookies, 100plus, sweets,
                  chocolates etc.</p>
              <p>I'd try and get everyone a close up of the new ILBV (integrated load bearing
                  vest- digitised and armoured) from some open sources for comparison. This would
                  probably be re-manufactured and issued.. 3-4 years down the road?thanks and
                  have a good one! please add on to this thread if you can. i'm sure those
                  nostalgic ex-nsfs overseas would love to see what we have now. i'd post more
                  pictures in the coming days, once i get the hang of how to use my camera and
                  photoshop.</p>

              <p>That trial design had supposedly way too big shoulder straps,
              which some comments were too big making them uncomfy and hindering
              movements. But yet, its hydration pack compartment is way better
              than the current ones,  plus of course, durability ...</p>

              <p>I totally agree about the way too big shoulder straps. they made it smaller in the BMT version.</p>
              <p>The good thing about the removable hydration pack is that it leaves a nice cooling mesh behind when you take it off. the current one is one big flap, which traps heat. not to mention it makes it very uncomfortable to sleep with LBV on. haha.</p>
