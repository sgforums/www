            <div class='col-md body'>It depends on whether there r big shots in ur camp. If there r, e food will be usually nicer. Cse I heard that they will send e good cooks to these camps n e lousy ones to other camps. That explains y sme SFI food in tis camp taste good while another camp which oso uses SFI taste bad.  SFI is nt like McDonalds where e food in all their outlets taste e same. They dun hve e same standard in cooking.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
