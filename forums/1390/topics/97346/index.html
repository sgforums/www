            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/armynews/image/issuePic/1_166.jpg"><br><br>Our soldiers now no longer have their outfield meals packed in squat styrofoam boxes in styrofoam containers. HQ Supply &amp; Transport (HQ S&amp;T) has been phasing in new paper meal boxes and meal box carrier bags, with all camps SAF-wide now using the new items.<br><br>In terms of both design and material, the new meal boxes and carrier bags offer significant improvements. The Â“cover-over-baseÂ” design and the material of the box are able to retain heat better and help to prevent contamination of the food. The box is also stronger with the 3-ply reinforced corner, and being made out of recycled, biodegradable foodgrade paper, is also more environmentally-friendly.<br><br>The carrier bag is lined with five layers of insulating material like aluminium foil and foam to provide the same benefits, and has two carrying slings for convenient movement. Overall, handling and transportation is now much improved. Both the box and bag are also lighter.<br><br>Head Materials Branch, HQ S&amp;T, LTC Sebastian Tan said, Â“Training areas can be quite far from the cookhouse. It may take one or two hours to deliver the food to the soldiers. As part of our effort to provide good food for our servicemen, we are proud to introduce the new paper meal boxes, which can keep food warmer for a significantly longer period of time.Â”<br><br>Soldiers gave their thumbs-up to the new meal boxes. CPL Wilson Tan said, Â“The new meal box is definitely more sturdy, and the food comes to us warm and fresh. IÂ’m glad the SAF is implementing such improvements for our welfare.Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys,<br>when you have been away from Singapore these many years like me, even the picture of the food at the start of this thread looks yummy.
