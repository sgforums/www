              <p>Hi all..</p>
              <p>I am pes C9L2 and excuse heavy load due to back problem. Just want to ask if excuse heavy load is assumed to also be excused from carrying FBO? When I was in my NSF unit, I was told by camp MO that I will not have to carry FBO under my excuse as it might further injure my back. However, recently I have been called up for my reservist mob manning which is in another unit and the csm said that I have to report in FBO as excuse heavy load does not mean that I am excused FBO. Also, I understand that I am deployable outfield but if excuse heavy load = excuse FBO, how to deploy outfield? Thanks for reading and appreciate if someone can clarify on this.</p>

              <p>gnhc,  under MO's instruction, you are excused from carrying heavy loads. However, when reporting, you do need to have your FBO with you.  You just don't have to carry it.</p>
              <p>Inform the CSM that he will need arrange some manpower to help you bring it in, since you cannot carry it yourself.  If DHL, ask if the courier fees can be charged to SAF instead.</p>

              <p>For heaven sake, ask for <strong>revocation</strong> at CMPB. Even if you are a clerk now, carrying a stack of paper is consisted as heavy load, dont even talk about rifles, SBO, or FBO.  </p>
