            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, it's me again. Is about the same questions I asked the last time.<br><br>Refer to here:<br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=266085" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=266085</a><br><br>That thread expired already.<br><br>I have been successfully deferred earlier this year for my education at Republic Polytechnic(RP).<br><br>So now, I have intent of changing to another institution(Polytechnic). I am now 18, and will be 19 on Feb this year.<br><br>I just read from the Website:<br>http://www.ns.sg/publish/NSPORTAL/public/mindef_services/index/register_for_ns/general_info/mindef_services__.html<br><br>And under the section for "Polytechnic Diploma Studies", it wrote:<br><br><blockquote><br>NS liable persons will be granted deferment for Polytechnic Diploma studies (and its equivalent) if they are able to commence the course before 19 years old (for Secondary 4 Express Stream students) or 20 years old (for Secondary 5 Normal Stream and Institute of Technical Education students) as at 1st January of the course commencement year.<br><br>Equivalent diploma courses would include those offered by the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA), the La Salle-SIA College of the Arts and the Singapore Hotel and Tourism Education Centre (SHATEC).<br></blockquote><strong>For your information, previously I was a Sec 5 student.</strong><br><br>Under the section "Application for Deferment", I saw this wrote:<br><br><blockquote><br>Those who subsequently wish to pursue or switch to a new course or institution must seek prior approval from CMPB.<br></blockquote>Meaning that if I want to transfer school and change course, I must seek approval from CMPB first right?<br><br>I'll be 19 this coming Feb, which means to say I'm still younger than 20 year old..<br><br><strong>Questions regarding the CMPB</strong><br>Q1) From the previous thread, <span style="font-style: italic;">ispyyy</span> said that it's 100% approval. Perhaps someone can give me more opinion on this?<br><br>Q2) From the previous thread, <span style="font-style: italic;">blitzonic</span> said "No problem, just paper work. Be ready to submit documentary proof that you're continuing to attend local full-time Diploma studies."<br>Perhaps someone can give me more opinion on this?<br><br><strong>Question regarding the NS</strong><br>Q1) Based on the quote saying that I'm still younger than 20 year-old, so I'll be granted deferment and continue at my new school???<br><br>Q2) If my poly transfer is successful, but MINDEF wants me to serve first before continuing. Will this scenario happened? This is my greatest concern.<br><br>Really appreciate your comment and opinion on this.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I take it you're already completed a semester or two at RP. Yeah, should have no problem then, transferring &amp; still retaining your deferment status. Just obtain CMPB's permission first; in fact I think your Student Liaison Office at the new Poly may need this approval before enrolling you.<br><br>A possible complication would be, say, you're starting a new course completely from scratch. In which case, I reckon CMPB shall evaluate you on a one-on-one case basis, i.e. whether to extend your deferment by further years. The NS system is to enlist as early as possible, upon turning 18.</div>
