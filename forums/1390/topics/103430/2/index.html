What's that, is it a government or military branch? As for attainable cert or not, yes it's possible to get a cert out of it but it's probably gonna take longer than the time for me to be enlisted. Unless I go abroad but from what I read, seems like I'd need a huge bond to do that. So I guess I kindda fall under PSLE then and would be taken into Mono-Intake?

Thks for the command list, helps a bunch.<br><br>Kudos for taking the time to help.</div></blockquote>The reservist cycle is 13 years and it applies to all except those PES E personnel doing clerical work, which might be different.<br><br>NSPC stands for National Servicemen Personnel Centre or something. After ORD, they will hold your particulars, details, postings, but I'm not sure what its function before ORD. I know as I received my reservist posting as 'NSPC Holding List' and I am still waiting for my unit posting.<br><br>During NSF period, CPC (Central Personnel Centre or something) will hold your details, inform units on promotion, ORD. Anyone who knows more can contribute.<br><br>Majority are enlisted at around age 18 as they would need to finish during A Levels and Polytechnic education. Those who enlist at 16 volunteer to do so after their O Levels.</div>

Speaking of which, there's no reservist MP's or PTI's either; they all revert back to infantry after ORD.

            <div class='col-md body'>AFAIK, the posting of personnel is done on by a computer system. It's kind of like a lucky draw. The system will know where they is a high shortfall (due to people ORDing soon) in a particular unit/vocation and then post people there automatically. So a lot of one batch of recruits may be posted to say infantry and another batch to medics. There's not much control here.<br><br>I know the system uses your medical status, educational qualifications and other factors when deciding your posting.<br><br>There have been rumours that your posting is already pre-selected for you upon enlistment unless u go out-of-course or someone intervenes and pulls u out (eg band, MDC, etc)<br><br>Anthony</div>

Guess the low priority is still the same after all these years. Note for non-swimmers: this is one of the times a conscript learns it's best he helps himself, cuz there's only something like 4-6 lessons during BMT with sometimes non-personalized instruction. Then it's a dry-run (ooh, bad pun) before taking the test.<br><br>The circuit training I witnessed involved 20-25 minutes of push-ups, sit-ups, duck-walks, etc. from station to station.

So my colleagues were ordered to bring our No. 4's along, to either swim in them or to tow them along. No more hazing like BMT, but the circuit trainings continued.<br><br><blockquote>about my friend.. he finishes his a levels in JUNE 'o5(cause he's not doing it in singapore)... technically he's not due to enlist in the beginning of 'o6 right but he wants to go to the armed forces badly, so since he's finished with his studies, can he enlist early? and if so, can he choose to go into army, or does point #1 still apply?</blockquote><a href="http://www.google.com.sg/search?q=cache:gY4q3z6kcUQJ:content.miw.com.sg/Mindef/Static/NSRegistration/Pdf/VEES.pdf+enlist+early&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com.sg/search?q=cache:gY4q3z6kcUQJ:content.miw.com.sg/Mindef/Static/NSRegistration/Pdf/VEES.pdf+enlist+early&amp;hl=en</a></div>
