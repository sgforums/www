              <p>Hello everyone :)</p>
              <p>I am sort of confused regarding something.</p>
              <p>I am currently 19(going to turn 20 in Feb 2014) and i have been 
              accepted here in Singapore at a local university  in a bachelors program
               which is due to start in April 2014.Currently I am on a dependants pass
               on my fathers employment pass.My parents, However are thinking of 
              getting a PR for the whole of the family.My questions is that will i 
              have to go through national service if i am granted PR at this 
              moment?.Im asking because i am beyond the basic age of 18 at which 
              everyone else is required to start NS and i also am enrolled into a 
              university.So despite all of this would i still be eligible for NS?.</p>

              <h2 class="pageTitle">NS facts</h2>
              <p>National Service (NS) was introduced in 1967, shortly after 
                  Singapore’s independence, to defend our nation. Since then, 700 000 sons
                   of Singapore have served their NS.</p>
              <p>Every son is important to Singapore. NS will transform our boys 
                  into men, a path trodden by many sons of Singapore and more to come. 
                  Your son is no different. Your son’s potential will be put to test in a 
                  challenging environment that will strengthen his mental and physical 
                  abilities. Living together with peers from different ethnicity and 
                  backgrounds, he will also appreciate the importance of teamwork and 
                  unity.</p>
              <p>NS, is the responsibility of every male Singapore citizen and 
                  permanent resident (PR) when they reach the age of 18. This is 
                  compulsory, governed under the Enlistment Act.</p>
              <p>If your son is a male Singapore citizen or a PR, he is liable 
                  for NS when he reaches 16½ years old. He is to enlist at the first 
                  opportunity upon reaching 18 years old.</p>
              <p>Your son will serve in one of the 3 Uniformed Services:</p>
              <ol>
              <li><a title="SAF (Singapore Armed Forces)" href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/army/home.html">SAF (Singapore Armed Forces)</a> </li>

              </ol>
              <p>NS requires 2 years in active service as a Full-Time National 
                  Serviceman (NSF). After the 2 years of NS, your son will serve as an 
                  Operationally Ready National Serviceman (NSman) up to the age of 40. 
                  Officers or those with special skills may serve until the age of 50.</p>

              <h2 class="pageTitle">Benefits of NS</h2>
              <p>NS isn’t just about serving the nation—NS benefits you as well.</p>
              <p>Firstly and obviously, your <strong>physical fitness will improve</strong>. You will be <strong>stronger and tougher</strong>. You may even <strong>look better</strong>!</p>
              <p>NS training doesn’t just toughen up your body; it <strong>toughens your mind too</strong>. You will become <strong>more confident and capable.</strong></p>
              <p>NS brings together people from all walks of life—different 
              races, different religions, some rich, some poor, some educated, and 
              some not so educated—you will also learn to live and work closely with 
              those <strong>who are different from you</strong>.</p>
              <p>At the end of it all, you will notice changes in you. You will become <strong>more mature and independent</strong>—no longer the boy you once were.</p>
              <p><strong>You will become a man.</strong></p>

              <h2 class="pageTitle">Why NS?</h2>
              <p>NS was introduced in 1967, just 2 years after Singapore’s independence to ensure the peace and stability of our nation.</p>
              <strong>We are a 'little red dot'.</strong>
              <p>With a population of 4.4 million and a land of 699 square km, 
              Singapore is amongst the 20 smallest countries in the world. Singapore 
              is too small to change the world. Instead, we must adapt as the world 
              changes around us.</p>
              <img src="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/asiamap.jpg" alt="Storming the hideout" width="400" height="300">
              <h3>Importance of NS</h3>
              <p>We must be able to defend Singapore ourselves. No one else is 
              responsible for our security and we cannot depend on others to come to 
              our defence.</p>
              <p>Our defence is predicated on deterrence. That is why we invest 
              heavily and consistently in building up a strong defence force to 
              provide that deterrence.</p>
              <p>At the same time, we seek to be friends with as many countries 
              as possible in the region and beyond. By having friends who can help us 
              in our times of need, we enhance our security.</p>
              <h3>Need for NS</h3>
              <p>NS is our only viable option to building up a credible defence 
              force to ensure our survival. A conscription force by law which obliges 
              all eligible people to enlist would create a sizeable standing force 
              ready to guarantee our security.</p>
              <p>The <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr> maintains itself in a high state of operational readiness at all times so that it is able to react swiftly to any threat.</p>
              <p>To meet the defence challenges in the 21st century, the <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr> is upgrading and transforming itself into a highly sophisticated, well-integrated fighting force.</p>
              <p><img src="http://iprep.ns.sg/img/storming.jpg" alt="Third Generation SAF" width="400" height="300"></p>
              <p>The Third Generation <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr> will be a network-centric organisation. Our forces will be 
              interconnected, equipped with electronic information systems, and be 
              able to fight cooperatively, and in an integrated manner, on land, in 
              the air and on the sea.</p>
              <p>Within the nation itself, the <abbr title="Singapore Police Force">SPF</abbr> upholds the law and maintains order, keeping the streets safe for family and friends.</p>
              <p>And in case of any crisis or emergency, such as a major accident or a terrorist attack, the <abbr title="Singapore Civil Defence Force">SCDF</abbr> will be there to rescue and save the lives of fellow citizens.</p>
              <p>All together, the <abbr title="Singapore Armed Forces">SAF</abbr>, <abbr title="Singapore Police Force">SPF</abbr> and <abbr title="Singapore Civil Defence Force">SCDF</abbr> play a key role in Singapore’s Total Defence—Military Defence, Civil 
              Defence, Economic Defence, Social Defence and Psychological Defence.</p>

              <h2 class="pageTitle"><br></h2>
              <h2 class="pageTitle">Supporting your son</h2>
              <p>NS is a crucial phase in your son’s life. He will be 
                  moving from a cosy home environment to one that requires him to be 
                  independent, disciplined and fit.</p>
              <p>These are big changes for your son and you can do your 
                  part by supporting him during NS.  The support and encouragement that 
                  you provide will help make his transition from a boy to man an easy and 
                  enjoyable one.</p>
              <p>Here are a few simple things you can do as a parent:</p>
              <dl class="table-display"><dt>Before NS</dt><dd><strong>Prepare</strong>: a sure way to help your son 
                  is to prepare him for NS life. This can be as simple as encouraging him 
                  be independent and fit. The earlier he learns these traits the better he
                   will be able to cope with NS life. You can also encourage him to talk 
                  to friends or family members who have been through NS to learn from 
                  their NS experiences. So start early with this.</dd><dt>The first days</dt><dd><strong>Observe</strong>: The first few days or 
                  initial weeks of NS are the most crucial. This is the time where your 
                  son will most likely feel the impact of the change. Talking to him 
                  during this period will give him encouragement to take the change in his
                   stride. </dd><dt>Regular weekends</dt><dd><strong>Converse</strong>: NS has much to offer in 
                  terms of rich experiences—new people, new practices, new words and new 
                  friends. Be a part of your son’s NS life by having a conversation about 
                  his NS experiences. This is a good opportunity for you to bond with your
                   son.</dd></dl></div>

                       serve up to 40 days of Operationally Ready National Service (ORNS) per 
                      year for the duration of their ORNS training cycle till the age of 50 
                      years (for officers) or 40 years (for other ranks).<br> <br> Male children who are granted

              <p>Defence Minister Ng Eng 
                  Hen said one of the biggest challenges facing the future of the SAF 
                  concerns the demography of the country. He said National Service 
                  enlistment is expected to dip to about 19,500 in 2025.<br><br>Last year, there were about 26,000 Singaporeans and PRs serving NS.<br><br>Dr Ng said even with the reduction in enlistment, the Singapore Armed Forces will still be credible. <br><br>In
                   an interview ahead of SAF Day on Sunday, Dr Ng notes that after 45 
                  years of National Service, the public has consistently affirmed that NS 
                  is necessary. <br><br>Hari Krishnan migrated to Singapore from India 15 
                  years ago. The 23-year-old is now a Singapore citizen and is currently 
                  doing National Service.<br><br>"Having entered NS, I've met different 
                  people, I've learnt to work as a team to help each other. I now treat 
                  this as the place I want to be, the place where I want to have my kids 
                  and get married," he said.<br><br>Since 1967, successive generations of NSmen, over 900,000 thus far, have served their duties. <br><br>Dr Ng pointed out that National Service is key to Singapore's security.<br><br>He also said that Singaporeans will stand up and fight to defend their way of life and protect the country's sovereignty.<br><br>Dr Ng said Singapore's fertility rate has come down and the SAF has been preparing for this demographic change.<br><br>"So,
                   moving forward we have to continue to find ways to optimise the 
                  contributions of each NSman. It's not only in terms of the skills and 
                  capabilities which we have to enhance our systems, to be able to train 
                  them, it's also about how the SAF functions," he said.<br><br>The SAF is
                   moving from a hierarchical to a flatter command and control structure. 
                  Rank and file soldiers will be able to make important decisions quickly.
                   <br><br>The SAF is also not dependent on the inflow of new 
                  citizens nor permanent residents to grow the number of enlistees. New 
                  citizens and second generation PRs must serve National Service.<br><strong><br>Dr Ng also commented on the issue of permanent residents and National Service.<br><br>"Better
                   don't take up the PR if your children are not going to do NS. It's as 
                  simple as that. In our system if you don't fulfil your NS liabilities, 
                  even if you choose to give up your PR, there are harsh penalties," said 
                  Dr Ng. <br><br>"I have received many letters from families that are separated and they cannot come back to Singapore," he added.</strong></p>
