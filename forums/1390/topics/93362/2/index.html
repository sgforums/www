            <div class='col-md body'>Gordonator is correct.<br><br>The 1st phase of promotion comes via a leadership course:<br>- pass out from OCS (9 month course) = 2LT.<br>- pass out from SISPEC (3 month course) = 3SG.<br><br>The Other Rank's get "promoted"... from REC to PTE, siah.<br><br>Other Ranks can then advance to PFC &amp; LCP with good performances. If they're serving 2.5 years, they will climb to CPL. It's step by step; you don't get double-promoted unless it's for an extraordinary/heroic act.<br><br>2LT's become full LTA's just before ORD. Not sure about NCOs - I belong to the old rank system - but it's logical to think certain 3SG's will become 2SG's if they're a KAH (Key Appointment Holder).<br><br>In reservist, it's all based on combat appointments, esp. KAHs. Accordingly, such-empowered LTA's are promoted to CPT's, &amp; 3SG/2SG's advance to as high as 1SG. MAJ's &amp; SSG/MSG's must attend SCSC &amp; SAFWOS courses respectively before becoming reservist CO's &amp; RSM's.<br><br>As for "White Horse" labelling, it's mentioned in Parliament that the system was discontinued in 2000. In any case, it has nothing to do with promotions. Supposedly, it's only for medical classification &amp; combat/non-combat vocation assignment. Briefly, a tagged White Horse enlistee must be personally certified by the top medical CO before he could be graded PES C or delegated a non-combat position. MINDEF acknowledged, however, that the policy could've been corrupted in actual practice by certain "bootlickers".<br><br>To moderator: IMO Sibeisuaykia needs his own sticky thread ....<br><br></div>

What is the technical and practical or feasability of the 3G army?</blockquote>Address some other time, this one have to write essay one.<br><br><blockquote>3. Can the BX be equipped with armour-piercing shells to<br>pierce through a modern's tank armour?</blockquote>The current Bushmaster or the 40/50 are armed to a certain extent with armour piercing munition of their class, however if you are talking about armour shells, you got to change the turret and perhaps some modification. Rumour have that they are toying with the BX to try out different capabilities now, i dunno the results.<br><br><blockquote>4. If we put the toughest armour tank vs the toughest apache<br>who will win?</blockquote>The toughest armour tank will lose without air defense again the Apache.<br><br><blockquote>5. Is our stealth boat really stealth or fake 1?<br>is the size of it really a fishing boat?</blockquote>Read the papers, they will probably tell you exactly what the papers say.<br><br><blockquote>6. Are we going to purchase another Challenger-Class or sjoormen 2nd<br>hand class?</blockquote>You want to buy also dun have liao.<br><br><blockquote>7. Is it possible since that after we developed the local BX,<br>can we develope our own MBT? since BX and MBT looks abit same</blockquote>Look the same? Look again.<br><br><blockquote>9. Is it possible for us to acquire Predator UAVs?<br>How many G-force can a predator UAV handle?</blockquote>It is possible for us to acquire the predator UAV but it is whether do we want anot. The predator is designed to fly without the requirement of a high G-force. It is a UAV not a dog fighter. I think it can handle about at most 2 G.<br><br><blockquote>10. If our Apaches were to encounter say MIG-29 in air-air combat<br>too suay liao..with a aim-9x with it..will it able to achieve a same<br>kill rate as a fighter jet?</blockquote>It wont.<br><br><blockquote> [quote]is the longbow radar also able to track ground<br>cars? or can it specially detect tanks only? </blockquote>It have to match the radar signature detected to the radar signature library within the computer. Considering that our Apaches may be fighting in deadly urban warfare, they might include the signature in the library or best it is already in the library.<br><br><blockquote>The apache can detect 256 targets and the enemy modified the enemy tank as cars..then when there is a sudden war..more den 256 cars on the road..<br>will it be able to achieve target hitting priority..objectively?</blockquote>As i say, it is all about intelligence. If we can include all the radar signature of our neighbours armour vehicle within the library, we can classify them during war. Most of the armour vehicle's signature is in the library, we just have to update it. If intelligence will to detect possible uses of Proton Wira as armoured vehicles, then jolly well get the signature.</div>
