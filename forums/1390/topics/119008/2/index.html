Berets are specific to each formation whereas jungle hats are the same across the entire SAF.

            <div class='col-md body'>my csm and rsm told me that jungle hats were supposed to be worn by recce trained personnel only, not even for JCC trained people like me.<br><br>anyway not sure if you all are refering to the SAF issued jungle hat (the so-called condom hat) or the one that recce personnel wears (the nicer, more shape one).<br><br>i guess its up to the unit and how strict it is with such things. not sure if there is written regulations with regard to jungle hats - my guess is no. but anyway i still wont usually wear it, out of respect for the recce trained.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
