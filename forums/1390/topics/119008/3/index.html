I seen so many ppl wearing CDO, OCS ,Ranger and even the JCC Polo t shirts being used as those couple shirt thing where both bf and gf wear the same black JCC polo tshirt.<br><br>If your wearing back to camp its fine with me, infact i would encourage people to wear their Unit shirts back to camp, as it helps them to be identified and be identifable and i noe quite a number of people will not agree on this issue. And i do get jelous of the CDO people that wore their Polo Ts to book-in.dame ..the mark of an elite warrior ...can i do my NS again to be a CDO  ?<br><br>but sashaying down Orchard Rd in tat...like what my ex OC puts it .."Si mi LJ !!!!!

            <div class='col-md body'>A little off topic -<br>but during NS, I remembered we were not allowed to wear any material that identified us as belonging to a SAF unit, outside of camp. I recalled on one occasion, we were actually checked head to toe to ensure that we were in total civvy. And when questioned by anyone outside - just act blur or say that we are recruits from BMT school!.<br><br>Now in reserves - we have to book out in smart 4 when going home.<br><br>Another thing - I've actually heard stories of guys who failed to pass the Guards course and were posted out - but were caught in Orchard Road, wearing smart 4 with Guards beret and tag.<br><br>My own experience is with this one guy, and it was 4 years after we finished our NS. I happened to join this local company and bump this guy, "Ran" who seemed to look familar. He had been going around telling people in the office that he was a Guardsman, and so on. One fine day, I confronted "Ran" by asking the battalion, batch and company he came from - and his replies were the exact battalion, batch and company I served in. I told him about it - and he started to panic. Apparently, "Ran" did his BMT in the same Guards unit but was posted out before the Guards course.<br>Didn't earn his beret and tag and he admitted this fact to me - when I tried talking about the exercises and missions we went on. I didn't have to say a single word after that.<br>So wide spread were his stories, that I bump into another colleage serving in a signals unit supporting our brigade in reserves, he asked about "Ran" (of course no where to be seen) during our ICTs, and I had to explain the truth to him.<br>My point here - why the need to lie about something he never experienced, years after completing NS? Its been 13 years since NS, i wouldn't be surprise if "Ran" is still at it.</div>
