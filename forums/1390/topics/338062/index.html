              <p><strong>Eligibility</strong></p>
              <p>E-PREP is a MINDEF initiative to recognise our full-time National Servicemen's (NSF) contribution to Singapore's defence and continued stability. It offers online preparatory and refresher courses to NSFs to help them transit from full-time NS to either join the workforce or further their studies.</p>
              <p>All NSFs are eligible to participate in e-PREP during their last 12 months of service till 1 year after their ORD. They will be notified by post individually when they are eligible.</p>
              <p><strong>Details Of E-Prep</strong></p>
              <p>Every NSF will be allocated $350 worth of credits to help subsidise the course that he subscribes. As a guideline, MINDEF will subsidise up to 90% of the course fee, subject to the maximum subsidy given or the credit balance of the NSF, whichever is higher. The balance of the course fee will be borne by the NSF. For example, for a $100 course, the NSF will pay $10 and MINDEF $90. Subsidies that are not consumed within 1 year after the NSF’s ORD will be forfeited.</p>
              <p><strong>Category Of Courses</strong><br>There are now 12 participating training providers, including local Institutes of Higher Learning, and e-learning vendors. Together, they offer more than 1,500 course titles in three broad categories, namely:</p>
              <p>Academic Courses. These courses aim to help the NSFs refresh and update their academic knowledge from previous learning or bridge their knowledge gaps for further studies. Such courses are typically provided by Institutions of Higher Learning. Completion of selected courses would gain the NSFs advanced standing thus helping them to get a head start in their educational pursuits after fulltime NS.</p>
              <p><br>Professional Certification and Technical Courses. Professional Certification courses are predominantly technical in nature e.g. Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer. These courses together with other IT non-certification courses will help to enhance the NSFs' employability.</p>
              <p><br>Enabling Skills ("Soft Skills") Courses. These courses aim to provide the NSFs with generic knowledge, skills and attitudes to succeed in the workplace or further studies.</p>
              <p><strong>Participation</strong></p>
              <p>There are no restrictions on the number of courses that each NSF can sign up as long as they have available credits. The NSFs will have to bear the full cost when their credits are used up. All e-PREP courses are priced at an affordable rate and significantly lower than market prices.</p>
              <p>Participation in the scheme is voluntary. As all e-PREP courses are published on the internet, NSFs can e-learn from their homes or in their camps where internet facilities are available. Notwithstanding, military training and duties will take precedence over participation in this scheme.</p>
              <p>The NSFs can obtain more information on the scheme from the NS portal. They are also able to view their credit allocation and balance, records of their past courses attended and the range of courses available. Application for courses can be done online. Once an NSF has made the 10% co-payment to the course provider, he will be granted access to the course materials.</p>

              I'm kinda dragging a dead thread kicking and screaming from the grave, but being semi-involved in the e-Prep scheme (or rather, an extension of it - the e-Prep career fairs), I just thought I'll throw my two cents worth.
              
              It's true, there are quite a lot of useless courses offered in e-Prep (though useless is relative), however there are also a number of useful ones. Obviously don't sign up for courses that you can simply search up the web for. Courses like some soft skills, for example; A quick search on the web will turn up a plethora of resources for interview skills, time-management, stress management etc.
              
              On the other hand, there are useful courses that actually teach you something useful, like perhaps a course in finance or a new programming language. Now, you could just borrow a book from the library and learn the language without needing to pay a cent (even if it's just a couple of dollars after the 90% cut), but depending on the course (call up to confirm and query) there'll be video presentations which does make it easier to understand the content. Plus you get a certificate after you've completed the course. It isn't much, but it's certainly better than nothing.
              
              Going a step further, courses like some that NTU provides, also comes with a textbook. So you'll pay roughly $35 or so for a textbook, even if you don't intend to complete the course. Not too shabby, and if you're genuinely interested in the subject or simply want to expand your scope of knowledge... or if you're like me and will be working straight out of army, you'll have something to show your employer that you didn't just waste your 2 years, rotting away without improving yourself. 
              
              (Word of caution though, the presentation or the so called "online lecture" materials a certain NTU course provides are just powerpoint slides, though the textbook kind of makes up for that deficit. But if you're one of those who can't stand reading a book and require lectures to understand a concept, then I suggest you check with the person listed under the course details as to how the course is presented.)
              
              In the end, e-Prep is what you make of it, and is an excellent opportunity to try new things at a heavily subsidised fee - just choose your course wisely.
