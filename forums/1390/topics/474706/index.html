            <div class='col-md body'>Just wanted to ask a quick question. Are there any directives or GOMs that dictates the awarding of off days for NSFs as a compensation for overtime work done? If so, anything regarding how off days are calculated? Would working till 8pm and 11pm have any difference; what if one has to work through the morning till about 4am?</div>

              consecutive hours without a break. However, if the nature of work is 
              such that it must be carried on continuously, an employee may be 
              required to work eight hours continuously. In such an instance, a break 
              or breaks must be given so that the employee can have his/her meal(s).</p>
              <p>The duration of the break(s) should be no less than 45 minutes.</p>
              <a title="contractual" name="contractual"></a>
              <h4 class="special">Contractual hours of work</h4>
              <p>An employee covered by Part IV of the Employment Act is not required 
              under his/her contract of service to work more than eight hours in a day
               or 44 hours in a week.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>The limit of eight hours per day may be exceeded when an 
              employee is not required to work more than five days a week. However, 
              he/she is not required to work for more than nine hours per day or 44 
              hours in a week. </li>

              is subject to a maximum of 48 hours in one week or 88 hours in any 
              continuous two week period. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>A shift worker is allowed to work up to 12 hours a day, provided that
               the average working hours each week do not exceed 44 over a continuous 
              three week period.</p>
              <p>If the employee's rest day falls on a day other than a Sunday, the 
              employer is required to prepare a monthly roster and inform him of his 
              rest days for the month at the beginning of each month.</p>
              <a title="overtime" name="overtime"></a>
              <h4 class="special">Overtime allowance</h4>
              <p>Overtime allowance is payable if the employee is required by the 
              employer to work above the limit of working hours specified above.</p>
              <p>All work in excess of the normal hours of work (excluding break time)
               is considered as overtime work. An employee must be paid no less than 
              1.5 times his/her hourly basic rate of pay for overtime. Payment for 
              overtime work must be made within 14 days after the last day of the 
              salary period.</p>
              <p>For a monthly-rated employee. His hourly basic rate of pay is computed as follows:</p>
              <table style="width: 100%; border: medium none -moz-use-text-color;" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10">

              <br>
              <p>For a daily-rated employee, his hourly basic rate of pay is computed as follows:</p>
              <table style="width: 100%; border: medium none -moz-use-text-color;" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10">

              </table>
              <br>
              <p>Based on the hourly basic rate of pay, the overtime pay for the 3 categories of employees is to be calculated as follows:</p>
              <p><strong>Hourly basic rate of pay x 1.5 x Number of hours of overtime worked</strong></p>
              <p>Under Part IV of the Employment Act, it is mandatory to make overtime
               payment to an employee if his basic salary is $2,000 or less a month, 
              or to a workman if his basic salary is $4,500 or less a month. 
              Generally, a workman is an employee whose work involves manual labour. 
              Some examples of workman are lorry drivers, construction workers, 
              kitchen helpers, machine operators. The minimum rate for overtime pay is
               1.5 times the hourly rate of pay. For other categories of employees, 
              overtime pay will depend on the terms stated in their employment 
              contract.</p>
              <p><strong>Maximum hours of overtime</strong></p>
              <p>An employee is permitted to work up to a limit of 72 hours of 
              overtime in a month. However, this limit may be exceeded if the Ministry
               of Manpower has granted an exemption under section 38 of the Employment
               Act.</p>
              <p>Employers that require their employees to work more than 72 hours of 
              overtime in a month are required under section 38 of the Employment Act,
               to apply for overtime exemption from the Ministry of Manpower. 
              (Download the <a title="application form for overtime exemption for work more than 72 hours of overtime in a month" href="http://www.mom.gov.sg/Documents/services-forms/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20Overtime%20Exemption%20Form%20_72%20hours__13Oct08.pdf"><img class="ms-asset-icon" style="border: medium none -moz-use-text-color;" src="http://www.mom.gov.sg/_layouts/IMAGES/icpdf.gif" alt="pdf">application form for overtime exemption for work more than 72 hours of overtime in a month</a>).</p>
              <p>For work done on rest days or public holidays it is not included in 
              the 72 hours' limit for overtime. However, if an employee works beyond 
              his normal daily working hours on his rest day or public holiday, the 
              extra hours of work done would be included in the 72 hours' limit for 
              overtime work.</p>
              <p>The rate of payment for an employee who works overtime on his rest 
              day and public holiday should be paid at not less than one and a half 
              times his hourly basic rate of pay for the overtime work (as in the case
               of overtime work on any other day), in addition to his rest day or 
              public holiday pay.</p>
              <a title="restdays" name="restdays"></a>
              <h4 class="special">Rest days</h4>
              <p>An employee covered by Part IV of the Employment Act is entitled to a
               rest day comprising one whole day (midnight to midnight) every week.</p>
              <p>The rest day can be on a Sunday or any other day. The employer should
               determine the rest day and inform the employee before the beginning of 
              each month. It is not a paid day.</p>
              <p>Employer cannot compel employees to work on rest day unless under very exceptional circumstances.</p>
              <p>The longest allowable interval between two rest days is 12 days. This
               can occur where in one week, the rest day is given on Monday, which is 
              at the beginning of the working week. In the following week, the rest 
              day is on Sunday, which is at the end of next working week. This will 
              enable an employee to take two rest days at a stretch and allow an 
              employer greater flexibility in the rostering of rest days.</p>
              <p>For a shift worker, the rest day can be a continuous period of 30 
              hours. A 30-hour rest period that commences before 6pm on a Sunday will 
              be considered as one rest day within the week, even though the 30-hour 
              period will extend into the next week, i.e. on Monday.</p>
              <p><strong>Payment for work done on a rest day</strong></p>
              <p>Payment for work done on a rest day should be calculated as such:</p>
              <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha outside none;">
              <li>Work done at employer's request:
                  
              <ul>
              <li>One day's salary when the employee works up to half the normal daily working hours; or </li>
              <li>Two days' salary when the employee works more than half the normal daily working hours. </li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Work done at employee's request:
                  
              <ul>
              <li>Half day's salary when the employee works up to half the normal daily working hours; or </li>
              <li>One day's salary when the employee works more than half the normal daily working hours. </li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              </ol>
              <p>If an employee works beyond the normal daily working hours on a rest 
              day, he/she should be paid at least 1.5 times the hourly basic rate of 
              pay.</p>

              <h1>WorkRight</h1>
              <p>The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Central Provident Fund (CPF)
              Board are stepping up our efforts to bring about compliance with
              the CPF Act and Employment Act (EA), so that employees,
              particularly more vulnerable groups like low-wage workers, enjoy
              their basic employment rights under the law. Areas of focus include
              payment of CPF contributions, on-time payment of salary, overtime
              payment, provision of paid annual and sick leave, and adherence to
              working-hour requirements, amongst others.</p>
              <p>We will do this through a two-prong WorkRight initiative
              covering enforcement and education. Besides ramping up enforcement,
              we will be reaching out to the public through a publicity campaign
              which aims to educate workers on their employment rights under the
              CPF Act and the EA, as well as to educate employers about their
              legal obligations. </p>
              <p>Everyone has a part to play, even if you are not an employer or
              even an employee. If you know of employers that are non-compliant,
              you can report by calling this hotline: 1800-221-9922, or email
              <a title="workright@mom.gov.sg" rel="nofollow" href="mailto:workright@mom.gov.sg">workright@mom.gov.sg</a>. The identity of
              the caller will be kept strictly confidential.</p>

                              <p>Just wanted to ask a quick question. Are there any directives or
              GOMs that dictates the awarding of off days for NSFs as a
              compensation for overtime work done? If so, anything regarding how
              off days are calculated? Would working till 8pm and 11pm have any
              difference; what if one has to work through the morning till about
              4am?</p>
