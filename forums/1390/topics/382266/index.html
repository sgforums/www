              I heard of this guy who changed from navy to army also don't know what did he do. 
              
              The only reason you would want to change is maybe cause you don't like your current service lor.

              <p>huh where got people sign on before OCS one?</p>
              <p>you're supposed to make it to OCS on your own merit first, and then from there, they select who gets shortlisted.</p>
              <p>that's how all my friends who are regulars came to be. you mean you can automatically be put in OCS even though you're initially in SISPEC just because you say you want to sign on as officer? no wonder so many of the regulars are trash! Making it into OCS on his own is about the very least of the very minimum I'd expect!</p>
              <p>And that's not even scratching the surface. You need to go through a whole long list of criteria before you select the best, who must pass through the gruelling selection to be all-rounders. And you guys have the shame to gripe about the elites?! ridiculous.</p>

              There has been talk about people wjo sign on as officers during their bmt and automatically makes it into ocs. I don't know how true that is

              <p>no doubt still own merit... but usually for those who expressed interest to sign on and performance [say, be able to qualify for sispec in a competitive PTP/enhanced coy]/physical [again for the scenario, silver/gold; but dunno why some who just pass still go on to air/mids wing] makes the mark, their PC who interviewed them may write some recommendation, and from there refer to the OC?</p>
              <p>as for the criteria, depending on the vocation, each one may have various tests and selection interview[s] to determine the suitable candidates.. usually for those who are cleared, their offer would only be valid if they qualify for ocs. and thus this goes back to my 1st para. usually those who want to aim a certain vocation do so mostly before/during bmt before pop.. [Xelement's reply on top] as NSF posting is quite random. so if a NSF did not apply for any positions before/during his BMT before passing out, CMPB would post him randomly, and he may end up doing something he doesnt like. and it may be very hard for him to get out of it, even if he wants another vocation in the same service.</p>
              <p>indeed there are still people who do choose to sign on before ocs, but whether they can pass the stage and make the contract valid, good luck to them.</p>
