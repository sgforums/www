            <div class='col-md body'>I rmbr last time they have this thing called WITS program where everybody every month have to contribute an idea to either save money or improve operational efficiency in the SAF. Apparently it was very good and saved SAF 10-15 million every year.<br><br>But I rmbr sometime really I have no idea just anyhow humtam also get $2  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>One of my section mates came up with a new kind of broom to do area cleaning dunno how it work lah but got $8 for it.<br><br>One of the best ideas someone in my unit came up with was to put an old rag into the monkey ram to "tactically" muffle out the sound liddat kanna $30.<br><br>Another was to use rags or wrap inner tube from old tyre on to the chin-up bar for better grip also instant big winner.<br><br>Some are so simple like stuff flantalite into pistol grip of M16 also kanna few dollar.<br><br>But the most hair brain idea was to rear chickens and ducks and use camp leftovers rice to feed them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But the one that made the biggest impact was to first light a joss stick or mosquito coil, break and pour cylume luminous chemical into a small cup, then cut up transparent drinking straws and fluffy wire thingy(use to clean M16 bolt carrier) into small 1-2cm pieces then, put fluffy into straw and dip inside chemical and burn both end of straw. This was secured to helmet rubberband for night movement in bash through areas where it was very dark to avoid "break contact".... it became the SOP item for all units.<br><br>Pls discuss what idea you ever came up with.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I came up with a proposal to scrap the entire WITS program.  I theorised that productivity and efficiency would increase by 8.5% because ppl would be back at work instead of taking official work hours to call meetings to think of hair brained ideas for WITs.<br><br>I got $0 for it and was threatened with 3 extras.  My eventual idea was painting the common red pail green cos it would be more tactical when used in the field. *shrugs*</div>
