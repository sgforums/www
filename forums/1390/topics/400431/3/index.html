              <p>Peasant faggot. The ONLY tax ALL Singaporeans pay is the fucking goods and services tax lah. fuck you how much is it? Its nothing to me, which is why I dun even bother to bring it up, its a fucking joke in the perspective of this conversation. I didn't know that to you, it's so blardy high value hahaha.</p>
              <p>So don't come and talk cock about your income tax. You know you're useless and dumb and earning peanuts, have to bring in your "family's" income tax to booster the conversation. what a fucking scumeating bottom-dweller.</p>
              <p>What the fuck GST Hahaha.. what a pathetic joke. The typical GST contribution of the proverbial idiot like you with pathetic spending power is not even the toe jam of the income tax of high income earners.Anyway GST is predicated on consumer expenditure, which once again, is predicated on INCOME, you peasant fucktard.</p>
              <p>Your income tax very high? How high is high? $1000? $500? I see you no up, I don't think you're even making $50k per annum. High income tax.. try $12k EVERY YEAR of income tax to the government coffers before the age of 30. Which is what some people I know are paying. Some of my friends' income tax might even be 30% to 50% of your annual income. Which is a joke really on you, since income tax is supposed to be a percentage point.</p>
              <p>And forget about property tax lah. You peasant and loser talk about property?</p>
              <p>The fact is that property tax, COE, road tax and GST are tied to consumer expenditure and controlled by income level. What this means is the bulk of all taxes are paid by high income earners.</p>
              <p>The fact is that losers like you and your type pay far far less tax than any of the Singaporeans who have the freaking brains, qualifications, genetic capability and capacity to decide what is classified and what is not. And yet you are the same undeserving lot who kao peh in forums and trumpet pompously like a freaking naked king without clothes that "Oh-oh-my-peasant-pansy-ass-from-NUS-or-NTU-and-other-loser-background" know better than you what threatens national interest. What a fucking tragic joke.</p>
              <p>You are just a piece of peasant shit who doesn't realise you are punching above your weight and can't tell your arsehole from your face.</p>
              <p>P/s: Peasant faggot, is freaking penny GST what you peasants and losers in onlinecitizen and wayangparty have in mind when you crap about your "taxpayers' $"? I didn't know it before and now I know! Its such a joke. HAHAHAHAHAAHAHA!</p>

              <p>At the scene, <span style="color: #ff0000;">there are personnels with live rounds</span>, but it is
                  good that he did not fire back as this might provoke the villagers.
                  It is their ground in the first place.  </p>
              <p>SAF has been training in this area for many years, and both
                  parties are aware of each other presence. It is just an unfortunate
                  accident. </p>
              <p>My advice for sign on or current NSF is to do their field craft
                  properly. If he dont like getting wet, being muddy, running round
                  in the middle of night, dont sign on. And for officer who are so
                  smart to put their men in the jungle filled with tigers, hope they
                  have nightmare every night. </p>
              <p>The SAF does not actually want to report this to the public as
                  this is just another incident that has happened. There is nothing
                  much to it. And it is also hard to explain the details. </p>

              <p>Where did you get this information?  Are you sure you know what are you talking about?</p>
              <p>This incident, based on the units of the people involved, my educated guess is was ATEC evaluation exercise in Thailand. The PTE shot is anATEC OPFOR trooper, the CDO 1SG was probably acting as umpire attached to ATEC OPFOR.</p>
              <p>FYI, live rounds are not carried at all during overseas training unless there is a live firing exercise. Soldiers don't just mount up with ammo running around in small groups independently overseas. During ATEC, we are only issued with blanks plus TES harnesses (or MILES gear for the old guys) plus mission load out. In ATEC live firing its done in very controlled manner with safety officer present.</p>
              <p>Unless you are privy to some top secret shit which i doubt you are, please cease to make comments on the incident.</p>

              <p>Peasant faggot. The ONLY tax ALL Singaporeans pay is the fucking
              goods and services tax lah. fuck you how much is it? Its nothing to
              me, which is why I dun even bother to bring it up, its a fucking
              joke in the perspective of this conversation. I didn't know that to
              you, it's so blardy high value hahaha.</p>
              <p>So don't come and talk cock about your income tax. You know
              you're useless and dumb and earning peanuts, have to bring in your
              "family's" income tax to booster the conversation. what a fucking
              scumeating bottom-dweller.</p>
              <p>What the fuck GST Hahaha.. what a pathetic joke. The typical GST
              contribution of the proverbial idiot like you with pathetic
              spending power is not even the toe jam of the income tax of high
              income earners.Anyway GST is predicated on consumer expenditure,
              which once again, is predicated on INCOME, you peasant
              fucktard.</p>
              <p>Your income tax very high? How high is high? $1000? $500? I see
              you no up, I don't think you're even making $50k per annum. High
              income tax.. try $12k EVERY YEAR of income tax to the government
              coffers before the age of 30. Which is what some people I know are
              paying. Some of my friends' income tax might even be 30% to 50% of
              your annual income. Which is a joke really on you, since income tax
              is supposed to be a percentage point.</p>
              <p>And forget about property tax lah. You peasant and loser talk
              about property?</p>
              <p>The fact is that property tax, COE, road tax and GST are tied to
              consumer expenditure and controlled by income level. What this
              means is the bulk of all taxes are paid by high income earners.</p>
              <p>The fact is that losers like you and your type pay far far less
              tax than any of the Singaporeans who have the freaking brains,
              qualifications, genetic capability and capacity to decide what is
              classified and what is not. And yet you are the same undeserving
              lot who kao peh in forums and trumpet pompously like a freaking
              naked king without clothes that
              "Oh-oh-my-peasant-pansy-ass-from-NUS-or-NTU-and-other-loser-background"
              know better than you what threatens national interest. What a
              fucking tragic joke.</p>
              <p>You are just a piece of peasant shit who doesn't realise you are
              punching above your weight and can't tell your arsehole from your
              face.</p>
              <p>P/s: Peasant faggot, is freaking penny GST what you peasants and
              losers in onlinecitizen and wayangparty have in mind when you crap
              about your "taxpayers' $"? I didn't know it before and now I know!
              Its such a joke. HAHAHAHAHAAHAHA!</p>

              <p>It is stupid fuckers like you who base your arguments on assumption lol. The cockpit's my office, what do you think? I'm sorry you had to type all that bullshit. As for economics on tax, it's alright. You are stubborn and you are entitled to your views :)</p>

              <p>I suggest that you all keep your mouth shut up and stop talking arguing about this incident. This incident is a disgrace to the commandos, and insult to the Singapore's defense and more.</p>
              <p>The injured personnel has lost his master eye and loses his whole career, he is compensated very little for what has happened. And he still have to serve his contract ( I AM NOT SURE if SAF is willing to let him go, up to now) And the compensation from his own pioneer policy that he buy previously.
              The NSF is also compensated very little for what has happened by the SAF. 
              And…  SAF expect his regulars to die for the country.</p>
              <p>I am not sure about this part, but the whole team may be reprimanded for what happened. As this incident is something that it should not have happened in the first place.</p>
              <p>What has really happened, it is already dammed shameful. There is no point, poking fingers on who is wrong as things has already happened. But it is a reality check on the unit on how good they are.</p>
              <p>Gedanken, the more you talk the more I laugh. While I thought "clerk" are personnel who gossip and does not know how to do things properly; the “elites/fit” ones are the best, personnel who know how to scold vulgarities, accuse people, insult, and does not know how to do things properly and get injured or kill. The officers are no better. But I admit myself, I would not know how to handle a bloody wounded casualty in front of me also, in reality, although I am supposed  to be highly trained in this field.</p>
              <p>I say again. My advice is correct. That is for “sign on or current NSF is to do their field craft properly. If he dont like getting wet, being muddy, running round in the middle of night, dont sign on. And for officers who are so smart to put their men in the jungle filled with tigers, hope they have nightmare every night.”</p>
