              <p>for all u know, it could have been some hostility between the

              <p>That's probably not far off the truth.  A while back, some village kid took out an APC commander's eye with a slingshot.  Being good hosts, the Thai soldiers went into the village and kicked seven shades of shit out of the kid.  It turns out that the kid's father was the village chief, so everybody got their shotguns out and started raising a kerfuffle.  During that period, the village and its surrounding area were blacked out on out maps with the effective message being "don't go anywhere near there".</p>
              <p>Given that it the shooting took place in Kanchanaburi at night, there's no reason to believe 
              that it was anything other than an accident.</p>
              <p>All of the armchair Rambos need to wake up their bloody ideas.  The fact is that while the Thai (or any other government) may agree to let the SAF in to train, it's ultimately Joe Public's territory we're training on - garang champions who are too stupid to remember who the guests are only serve to deprive the SAF of training areas.</p>

              <p> injured commando will have to wear a black patch like that Valkyrie colonel guy.his rice bowl is there as his eye and angry looks still count for something.</p>
              <p>however being injured with a 20 gauge as appeared from their injuries would not stop me one from even throwing a bayonet at intruder.and what about the other commandoes.....didnt they catch that guy??how bout skinning him above the tree tops and bbqing him for dinner??nothing???if the commando unit ate that guy...no one would discover his body even.</p>
              <p>in that case,i have mistaken that spore infantry unit for being in any way affiliated to any commando unit.....maybe they were mess boys and clerks instead of macho warriors!</p>

The villagers only shoot at soldiers randomly because of their foolish belief that their crops or safety is threatened. The offence was not carried out by the Thai government or Thai army, but by some ignorant barbarian villager, and most definitely not motivated by malice. <br><br>When Mindef does not publicise classified information, its because it's classified and there is a reason why CIA, FBI and so on have classified information that it doesn't share with the public for the preservation of national interest and national security. I cannot for the life of me, till today, understand how there are so many stupid Singaporeans.<br><br>ST and its employee, Jermyn Chow have undermined the national security and national interests of the country. Mindef should hang both ST and the reporter from the ceiling and give them a good spanking. The reporter, whom I was told to be a faggot, would sure love a good violent ass-fuck.<br><br>I love it when peasant stupid little uneducated reporters think they can 'act hero'. Mindef and the people at its top are among the most powerful in government. <br><br>I already know several younger officers who will rise to the pinnacle of the Government and who have their eyes fixed on him for a story that he had done to hurt the reputation of one of their most respected peers, using underhanded methods. Good luck to him. Is all I can say to his gay ass.</p></div>

              <p>Sometimes it is not good to know the ugly truth. It is hard to accept . And I think ST has done his best job to camouflage the truth to make the story look good.</p>
              <p>It is an accident, there is nothing much to it. The Thai villagers went hunting with their shotgun every night in the jungle for food and shot an animal. But in this case, it is a human who happen to be a SAF soldier.</p>
              <p>At the scene, there are personnels with live rounds, but it is good that he did not fire back as this might provoke the villagers. It is their ground in the first place.  </p>
              <p>SAF has been training in this area for many years, and both parties are aware of each other presence. It is just an unfortunate accident. </p>
              <p>My advice for sign on or current NSF is to do their field craft properly. If he dont like getting wet, being muddy, running round in the middle of night, dont sign on. And for officer who are so smart to put their men in the jungle filled with tigers, hope they have nightmare every night. </p>

              <p>Wow reeeeally? you are such a big fuck who should know
              EVERYTHING cos you pay "taxes", wow your contribution to the "tax
              coffers" is such a big ass fuck. May I know how much income tax you
              fucking pay??</p>
              <p>Less than 20% of Singapore citizens pay any income tax. And
              judging from the complete stupidity you displayed in your posts,
              you don't even pay 10% of the income tax of people I know my age.
              Sorry that I look down on you but seriously, just look at what you
              are made of.</p>
              <p>What a bottom dwelling retarded moron on the lowest rung of the
              food chain.</p>
              <p>What is amazing is to me is that you are not joking, and that
              you truly believe with all the highest level of retarded sincerity,
              that you are big enough to know what is detrimental to national
              interests and national security at that level, and know what goes
              on behind closed doors that you're not privy to or know for sure
              how the Thais feel or the damage it has done and the fire fighting
              to be done to contain the severity. You are so blind to how small
              you really are, it's amazing. Stupid bottom scum-feeder.</p>

              <p>Sometimes it is not good to know the ugly truth. It is hard to
              accept . And I think ST has done his best job to camouflage the
              truth to make the story look good.</p>
              <p>It is an accident, there is nothing much to it. The Thai
              villagers went hunting with their shotgun every night in the jungle
              for food and shot an animal. But in this case, it is a human who
              happen to be a SAF soldier.</p>
              <p>At the scene, there are personnels with live rounds, but it is
              good that he did not fire back as this might provoke the villagers.
              It is their ground in the first place.  </p>
              <p>SAF has been training in this area for many years, and both
              parties are aware of each other presence. It is just an unfortunate
              accident. </p>
              <p>My advice for sign on or current NSF is to do their field craft
              properly. If he dont like getting wet, being muddy, running round
              in the middle of night, dont sign on. And for officer who are so
              smart to put their men in the jungle filled with tigers, hope they
              have nightmare every night. </p>

              <p>No. If I go to Crescendo, and go hunting with the Thais, I might also shoot one of the green guys. Who ask them to go running around in the middle of the night?</p>
              <p>The Thai people are nice people, it is their practice to go hunting for wild boars or other animal for food. They hunt and pick fruits from trees.</p>
