              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Not just one, but two Singapore Armed Forces personnel were injured in Thailand two months ago by a villager who was out hunting.</span></strong></p>
              <p>MediaCorp understands that a full—time National Serviceman was one of two who were accidentally hit by gun pellets — believed to be the first time SAF soldiers have been shot by a civilian — during a proficiency test conducted by the Army Training Evaluation Centre.</p>
              <p>The other victim reported on Tuesday in the media was 25—year—old First Sergeant Woo Teng Hai, a regular from the 1st Commando Battalion, and was said to be still on medical leave.</p>
              <p>MediaCorp understands that the second victim has completed his medical leave and should be returning to his duties soon.</p>
              <p>The incident occurred in a designated training area within Kanchanaburi province, some 130 kilometres west from Bangkok, during a routine training exercise on the night of March 13.</p>
              <p>Since then, the SAF has received full assistance from the Royal Thai Army for the investigations into the incident.</p>
              <p>Preliminary findings have found that the shooting was an accident.</p>
              <p>The two militaries are continuing to work closely to inform villagers about the training areas which can also be used by Thai armed forces. — CNA/vm</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>MINDEF did not disclose that a second soldier, a full-time national serviceman, was also shot in the same incident. The news of the second shooting only surfaced when a relative of Private J. Pritheery Raj contacted The Straits Times.<br><br>In the first report on May 24, a Thai farmer had fired his shotgun at 1st Sgt Woo Teng Hai while the latter was out on a night exercise in Thailand. The regular commando is said to have been blinded in his right eye. <br><br>The Defence Ministry only admitted yesterday (May 25) that <strong>Private Raj had also been hurt in the same incident. The NSF still has two shotgun pellets lodged in his cheekbones and right shoulder. He has been on medical leave for the last two months.<br></strong><br>In the STOMPer's email:<br><br>"I read the news about the second soldier shot in the news today with surprise. <br><br>"Why didn't MINDEF give full disclosure about the second soldier who was also hurt?<br><br><strong>"Is it because he is 'just' a NSF Private?</strong><br><br>"Apparently the relative of the poor Private had to contact the media directly after reading the report about the commando being shot by the Thai farmer."</p>

              <p>Well, the villager in this case was out hunting, and the shooting was accidental.</p>
              <p>I would say that the villagers are a peaceful lot so long as you are respectful and don't make a fool of yourself. I'm sure that the other guys here who have done Crescendo before might have come across shotgun-armed villagers as well.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I was out with my company's 84mm/Coy HQ section.... there were fourteen of us, and I don't think those two shotgun-armed villagers we met would want to mess around with us even if they wanted to...</p>

              <p>Since they were outfield for exercise, they should have been equipped with at least 1 smoke grenade, and loaded blanks.

              <p>I was one unfortunate chap who kenna trip flare and ambushed while out on topo. First thing I did was shout, and throw smoke, and returned fire. I had a hard time explaining why I had to use those items when I RTUed, even served one confinement for it.</p>
              <p>So from then on, I didn't really put any effort into exercises anymore, coz look what it brought me.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I also had a comical mexican standoff with a farmer too during a topo exercise in Crescendo. Apparently some do not like SAF soldiers to walk around or near their crops or homes. Luckily it was defused quickly somehow or 4 of our asses will get peppered with shotgun shells.</p>
              <p>They also like to burn down their crops and blame SAF for it. Not surprisingly we were not allowed to light tripflares and smoke grenades near or in their areas. i also once heard a story about an arty unit killing a cow in life firing, not sure true or not.</p>

              <p>for all u know, it could have been some hostility between the villagers and soldiers for trampling on their crops, walking into their territory etc. such issues should be debated in parliament as it concerns our troops there. Many are also children of parents here.</p>
              <p>Now it's dismissed as a one off accident. So only god knows. So many accidents and deaths in SAF every year, how many are reported. Some reporting in the papers does not reflect the actual no. of incidents every year.</p>
              <p>I remember my time in armour, there was a capt who died while in ex wallaby. He was in the Bionix commander's position, head out of tank and he crashed into a tree branch. Died on the spott. Was not reported in the papers at all.</p>

              <p>Not just MINDEF, lots of govt stat boards also can dismiss things as one time off.</p>

              <p><br>actually training and real time battle is totally different</p>
              <p>remind me of the m16 range training</p>
              <p>i mean why will an enemy wait for u for few secs</p>
              <p>waiting for u to aim and shoot at him</p>
              <p>pretty stupid right</p>
              <p>In wartime just upload ur m16 and begin to shoot to protect</p>
              <p>for ur own life , where got time to apply for those fundamentals</p>
