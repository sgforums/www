I noticed a lot of 50-55km/h... when I was in there the speed limit was 50km/h but it really depends on the actual vehicle you drive mah... I got drive before a recce the speed go 48km/h then the SWD(speed warning device) BEEP BEEP BEEP... kao make me damn scared... but I also drive before rover go to 68km/h never BEEP one... then got command jeep can go 70km/h haven beep... Just do anything but dont get caught... see MP motocycle in your side mirror then must faster slow down...<br><br>50km/h is really slow... especially when driving on expressway... all the cars zoom past you... hahaha<br>I heard they got change speed limit leh to 60km/h??... but not too sure</span></div></blockquote>i did shoot a complain to mindef regarding this issue... and they gave me a very f**k up reply. Something like this.<br><br>"<br>I refer to your suggestion to increase the speed limit of our SAF vehicles.<br><br>The relevant authority would like to inform you that the speed<br>limit of 50 kmh was derived after extensive deliberation of the<br>attributes of our transport entity. Factors such as the age-group<br>and proficiency of our SAF drivers and profiles of our vehicles<br>including size, age and operational attributes have significant<br>impact as to why this speed limit has yet to change even though LTA<br>has increased its corresponding speed limits.<br><br>Given the operational constraints that we face, we seek your<br>understanding that our vehicles will currently have to maintain the<br>speed limit of 50 kmh on our roads. However, the SAF will<br>constantly remind our drivers to be mindful of other public<br>commuters and take measures to ensure that where possible, they<br>will not serve as obstructions to traffic flow.<br><br>Nevertheless, please be informed that the SAF will continue to<br>monitor the situation and make the necessary adjustments so that<br>our drivers and public commuters work together to ensure a safe and<br>smooth journey on our roads.<br>"<br><br>"<br>We understand and accept your point of view with regards to the<br>possible risks involved in travelling at 50KMH.  Rest assured that<br>the relevant authority will monitor the situation closely to ensure<br>that the safety of our roads are not compromised.  We seek your kind<br>understanding for the interim.<br>"<br><br>The issue is not whether the drivers are mindful or not... it is the vehicle itself! They will always be an obstruction to the traffic flow loh to other road users esp on single lane roads.<br><br>I think its hopeless lah... no matter how u complain u suggest u explain.. they will just "copy and paste" this standard reply from some file and email back to u with some modifications... seriously no body wana commit and increase the speed limit in SAF... including the CSTO himself. Cos they wil foresee an increase in accident( which may not be true) if the speed limit increase by just 10 km. Den the person who decide to increase will have to ans.<br><br>Generally i think SAF drivers most of them are pretty low in morale... they dun really potray a good vehicle operator image... over used minbuses...poorly maintained vehicles... no air con no radio no comfort...who will wana be a driver...<br><br>haiz... disappointed .... talking abt saf in terms of their vehicles just make some pple fume <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

I think there a point in the reply leh... but maybe should increase abit also...<br><br>First thing is age-group and proficiency...<br>Normally new drivers will be about 18-19 years old, quite young leh...<br><br>then the proficiency part...<br>I got my class 4 licence(first time pass) in less than 2 months leh!!!<br>Wah!! actually quite dangerous since not much experience... but got Vcom to share blame... hahaha<br><br>Then the size part... a 3 ton hit civilian car i think the car can scrap liao... then the 3 ton only scratch abit...<br><br>age part... I drive many different types of military vehicles before... then if not wrong most may be more than 10 years old, only recently they got the new air conditioned 5 ton...<br>I drive one command jeep(manual) onto public road then while the car is moving, the engine went dead!! You may say engine die very normal wat... but hor... where got engine die when on the car is moving one???<br><br>So having speed limit is good, but maybe they abit too prudent here...<br></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, our 90km/hr speed limit is already pharking slow compared to overseas. Fair enuff, singapore smaller, more cars.  But letting SAF vehicles go at 80km/h, a good 10 km/hr under the norm is not a very big risk wad.<br><br>80km/h is a very controllable speeds for most vehicles.  5 tonners inclusive. Its a hell lot faster that 50km/h and drivers wont fall asleep halfway driving long distances. I would think its a win win situation.<br><br></div>

When I was at my unit, i hate going out as veh comm.   Our journeys can easily take 1 and a half hour travelling across Singapore.  Why?  Cos our bloody vehicles are limited to 50-55km/h.<br><br>Why are there accidents?  Because ppl fall asleep driving for so long.  Why is the journey so long? Cos our bloody vehicles are limited to 50-55km/h.   As a Veh Comm, I admit I've fallen asleep b4.  Its terrible cos I'm supposed to make sure the driver doesn't fall asleep.  But how? Journey really too long...  cannot stop for coffee break along the way somemore.<br><br>In short, there will never be a shortage of accidents whether minor or major. Why?<br>Cos our bloody vehicles are limited to 50-55km/h.<br><br>No one will dare admit they fall asleep while driving.  Not SAF drivers anyway, but the fact is, quite a lot of them do accidentally nod off sometimes.  Esp concluding long exercises.  What to do? SAF don't rest their drivers well, and make them go on long trips.  Long Cos our bloody vehicles are limited to 50-55km/h.   .</div></blockquote>I agree in part. This appleis even to non drivers who operate SAF vehicles. Altough there are supposed to be rules governing how much rest a driver/rider must have before driving (via the mech of the RAM form), it does not always work in practice.<br><br>I remember riding from the west to the east on SAF bikes before. That was after 3 days in the field. I actually drifted off whilst riding and when i came to i had switched lanes on the express way!<br><br></div>

I am not a driver but i can imagine the stopping distance of a 5 tonner would be very huge. Also the consequences of an accident is so serious that i think the benefits of increasing the speed limit must the overwhelming before any changes is made.</div>

Actually the main reason as in why he committed suicide was not only due to the accident case which his DB punishment was on pending. He was already quite well-prepared for the DB actually 'cause he knew what to do before taking order charge.
