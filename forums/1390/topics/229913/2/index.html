No more liao loh... But before I ORDed, he still staying at Boat. I muz say he's one veri clever regular, in a good way. Since he got posted out of Boat, his official post is RSM PA cos' they can't find anything fer him to do LOL!<br><br>Then the clever part, is when RSM ask him do saikang, he say he need to help Boat in certain matters. If Boat OC asks him to do saikang, he says he has RSM saikang. LOL! Then he use his Chevrolet car to siam both parties hahaha! He going to ORD this Jul and study uni. Definitely the best regular fren I can ever relate to. All the best to him man!<br><br>Thomas is one big time muthafucka la lol. He always 'la sai' esp. the COS pen thinggy that someone mentioned. Some small things kick a fuss then throw extra. That's his pattern la. He's No. 1 Target written all over him in 35 SCE. Abt 2-3 months before I ORD, when I was doing COS security check, I saw a letter of promotion for the fat fart. I think he's going to be SSG soon. Ewww.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, being a boatman at 35 also not bad wad.  U learn how to drive a boat... but still need to take PPCDL if u ever want to do some private boating.<br><br>This license doesnt recognise the boating training given by SAF if I recall correctly.  You can parallel park a missile corvette and u still need to take a basic license for powered pleasure craft.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yep... It's fun but the bad thing is it's not recognised outside of SAF... I'm a Boat Spec... Had loads of fun driving the assault boat... My swimming sucks so I dun frequent pools nad beaches... But being a part of Boat Coy gave me a broader perspective... Nth really beats the sense of freedom out in the sea commanding ur own boat... If only SG sun not that scorching... Haha... But I'm not intending to take powerboat license cos it isn't practical unless u're some rich dude who can afford such an expensive hobby... Rather spend the $ on car license...</div>
