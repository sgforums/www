Then my buddy sibei chiong sua only get into SCS. Another one, not so garang, but got good attitude, hardly chao keng posted to RP.</p>
              <p>I used to ask my OC who will choose where we go to, he said not him, not CSM, not the PCs or PSs, some people from the manpower side will choose. Is that true? Somebody that has never seen the soliders before decide our fate?</p>

              <p>From my experience in bmt, recruits who are able to get gold for their ippt will have higher chance to enter ocs than others who only get silver or a pass.</p>
              <p>U say that guy chao keng, attend c, did not complete 24km march...all these wont affect anything. His ippt gold is already a major factor.</p>
              <p>When i was at SISPEC, my WO gathered us after the ippt result is out. He identified the guy who got gold and ask him "Do u wan to go OCS?" He said "yes".</p>

              <p>Medic in guards not bad what, at least not guardsmen. So even if you get the slackest of all vocations/job, you still chao keng?</p>

              <p>For the latest batch of postings, how on earth do they choose you to go here go there?

              <p>there must be some features in a particular vocation that shows why you are posted there. eg, Artillery, good in maths and angles/elevation. Signals, good in IT.</p>

              <p>This is why I hammer people who think that NS is not a good way to prepare you for the working world. Let's face it: the workplace is never fair, and less-capable people can be promoted ahead of more-capable people solely through their ability to angkat bola. There will be chao kengsters who get ahead because of one single unique attribute, and there will be hardworking people who will be left behind just because they lack that attribute.</p>
              <p>That fact is true for NS, and so it goes for the working world.</p>
              <p>That said, let me just say this: there will be <strong>NO</strong> discussion on how to chao keng. Any discussion of that will lead to the flexing of moderator muscle.</p>

              <p>I have a coy mate who most of the time chao keng, see MO, attend
              C, did not complete 24km route march, BUT cleared IPPT with gold,
              attend IFC &amp; BTP and cleared SOC and got into OCS. Then my
              buddy sibei chiong sua only get into SCS. Another one, not so
              garang, but got good attitude, hardly chao keng posted to RP.</p>
              <p>I used to ask my OC who will choose where we go to, he said not
              him, not CSM, not the PCs or PSs, some people from the manpower
              side will choose. Is that true? Somebody that has never seen the
              soliders before decide our fate?</p>

              <p>Let you give you an example. </p>
              <p>In your secondary school days, some boys play truant, skip school or late for school with poor conduct but never do anything seriously wrong. Near the O level, he start to get serious, score 10 points and get into JC. Compare to another, who study everyday, do homework, never late, but score 15 points for O level. This guy cannot go JC. </p>
              <p>It is not the process that counts. It is the results (reflected on the paper) that counts.</p>
              <p>The person who do  the posting and recommendation only look at the test results.   </p>

              <p>haha your OC is lying in your face. It is your sc, ps, pc, oc
              who decide your fate.</p>
              <p>How i know? Because there is this grp of fucking gangstas in my
              coy always create trouble. Before POP long time, my PS tell us they
              hong kan go guards, cos OC's orders.</p>
              <p>After POP, they posted to medic vocation to train, I thought
              what the fuck bullshit, but after medic training they posted to
              guards then i lol.</p>
              <p>OC in BMT rarely communicate with individuals so is your sc, ps
              who report up de.</p>

              <p>its half true cuz the BMT commanders can write to CMPB to reccommend your posting but it certainly isnt them who decide. its just a matter of whether or not CMPB choose to take those letters into consideration cuz there r just too many. my bmt PC wrote to CMPB for me to reccommend an 8-5 vocation since im retaking my A levels but knn i kena rifleman.</p>
              <p>i wouldn't mind OCS guards or commando cuz although got chiongsua but also got pride. i wouldnt mind MP cuz relak plus dun need chiongsua (except ATEC). I wouldn't mind PTI cuz at least can have healthy lifestyle. but suay suay i kena rifleman i tulan cuz</p>
              <p>1) must chiongsua</p>
              <p>2) no pride</p>
              <p>3) not 8-5</p>
              <p>4) no time to workout cuz more than half the time must do saikang. saikang finish left no more energy to go gym</p>
