            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with some replies to this thread, that even though we may be a conscript army, an army made of not-so-willing 'volunteers', but we are still essentially an armed force. A organisation that has to bear arms and fight if the need arises.<br><br>Sucky as it may seem, but i'm telling you at this current state I don't even know how long our people can hold out in an armed conflict, we have all the hardware and software, but as cliche as it may seem... we're really lacking in the heartware.<br><br>People who are willing to push themselves to see to it that out future is secure. Tough training? take it like a soldier. Soldiers die everyday, it's an accepted fact due to the inherent risk of being in green.<br><br>The SAF has done alot to ensure safety and sometimes it gets painfully annoying, but this delicate balance of tough and realistic trg vs keeping our soldiers alive is very diffcult to balance.<br><br>SO far the SAF has err to the side of caution i.e. very safe training. Let's air our views, yes, but also reflect on what is the army meant to do.<br><br></div>
