            <div class='col-md body'>AhJun, I believe you've admitted that you have yet to even enlist. Yet here you are ranting on and on about ill treatment in the armed forces like you were a victim of it yourself. You aren't doing justice to the thousands and thousands who have gone through two years of full time national service, sucking it up when things got tough and taking it like a man. How many recruits have you heard of who are driving past their limit and taking their own lives? On what grounds are you making your accusations of the SAF?<br><br>Tough training is good training in the military. War is not a game, and we don't want to ever be caught under prepared.<br><br>To be honest, I'm glad there aren't many like you, complaining about the tough life of the military even before experiencing it. I cannot imagine having to rely on cowardly and useless people like you to defend out sovereignty.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey TS. From your replys, I can sense a deep sense of injustice and whether or not u are enlisted, thats not a good sign. Regarding not being able to fall out, I can understand you as it is a guideline to allow soldiers to receive necessary medical care esp if they are unwell. But rules are always there as a guide and often things are done under the commanders' discretion.<br><br>Things often go wrong as afew " bad apples" may cause the superiors to have a negative look on the whole bunch thus the unfair treatment. Its saddening to say this but life is never plain sailing and its the same in the outside world. You say u r sick and see a doc; your boss thinks u r faking it and we see a same end result.<br><br>So its often the people administering the system rather then the system that is at fault. The dunking incident as u have quoted are extreme cases and isolated where power is abused. I dont think we would see this kind of accidents every other day.<br><br>To TS, I'm neither a regular or a pro-saf person that is advertising for em.<br>its just my personal point of view and hope that u can feel abit more positive.<br><br>Like i always say, tough training is good training. But if the line tough is blurred, stop and seek help immed. Im absolutely sure that there is someone who is willing to listen to u and do something abt it.<br><br>Cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah Jun,<br><br>Firstly, I believe you have not served a day of NS. Let me know if I'm wrong.<br><br>Secondly, if there is something serious going-on, have you reported it to the relevant people? They can help you instead of your constant flaming. Please post in a considerate and neat manner so that people can understand what you are saying.<br><br>If they have replied, please do not continue to repeat your initial point. Your behavior would have gotten you banned in other military forums or suspended for infractions. We are all not here 24/7, so post wisely and take the time to read what others have to say.<br><br></div>
