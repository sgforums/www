Deaths are unexplained and common in the army after all your body can just be buried easily in the jungle (after your sergeants torture you first)<br><br>Now seriously, you have not served a day of national service. Why are you so determined to be a negative nancy? Why do you assume the system is unjust? Why are you so sure your sergeants will kick and torture you? Go in. Serve first before making your judgements here ..... provided you make it out alive of course. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  *... dun dun dun dun .... *</div>
