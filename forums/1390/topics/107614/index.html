For accountability, it'll likely be a rigorously doctor-prescribed meal plan, but all it takes is to tell the kitchen (if not catered) to hold off the sugar &amp; salt, plus moderate intake of starchy &amp; fatty foods. My relative's illiterate maid could prepare that for her; it was considerably more difficulty sticking to the injection/pill-taking schedule.<br><br>Very bland makan, but what to expect in prison?<br><br><blockquote>Anyways u try getting a type 2 diabetic to do star jumps after he's taken his medicine and see if he faints on you or not.</blockquote>Type 2 that serious meh? Gosh, imagine him climbing a flight of stairs or chasing a bus on the outside ~lol~ In any case, I understand the DB is heavy on rehabilitation/counseling. Only the 1st-timers get physically tekanned daily, but never kena "extra training" (compared to the civilian Prison or even the SAF) - the last thing they want is to negatively harden the inmates.
