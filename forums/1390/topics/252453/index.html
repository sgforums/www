            <div class='col-md body'>Glad u didnt react my friend. He could have got u into serious trouble even if he was in the wrong. But this is the army and u gotta show respect to him even if u didnt like it. No point arguing with him but if u feel that those vulgarities have been too much..Feedback to ur superiors and seek advice. Most likely it would go covered but at least let ur superiors know of this situation. But through the correct protocol of course.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can understand why you were pissed with him... he had, after all, overstepped his authority and that he should have just followed the standard medical center SOP unless if it's an emergency. Just remember that it's sometimes pointless to point out mistakes to some higher-ups... just be sure that you have your senior medic covering your ass and backing you up.<br><br>However, I would ask you to take his race out of your rants.</div>

And he is a in hurry since it is their ops. So he keep asking us to release the ammo, but i keep on refusing. IN the end, he say want to speak to my OC, but my OC (2 LT only) were not around. So my 2IC (2WO only), come and speak to him and he LL have to go back and get the signature done..</div></blockquote>In this instance, you can refuse to issue ammo to him. No matter what he says.
