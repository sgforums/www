            <div class='col-md body'>Not Spectra, cuz that one has its own patented fabric for armour material (different from Kevlar). Also, I was issued my helmet (plus the then-new SBO) during my first or 2nd ICT, which make it 1989 or 1990. Definately wore it for the Military Tattoo parade in 1992. The Spectra helmet was introduced &amp; refined by the French during those years, according to Internet notes.<br><br>Guess the answer is Pasgt but, if so, not in the way you would perceive it. Firstly, Dupont is the inventor &amp; owner of Kevlar &amp; it issues licences to worldwide manufacturers to make them accordingly (the fabric, not the helmet).
