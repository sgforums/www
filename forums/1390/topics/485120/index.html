              <p><strong>Source: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.strengthenns.sg">www.StrengthenNS.sg</a></em></span></strong></p>
              <p>Sweeping changes are afoot to give national servicemen more
                  leeway when serving National service, while at the same time,
                  saluting those who have done, or want to do, their part for the
                  country’s defence.<br> <br> <strong>One key proposal to ease the stress on servicemen is to stop the
                  current standard practice of notifying the Defence Ministry or the
                  Home Team when they leave the country for more than 24 hours.
                  Instead, only those who will be away for more than two weeks will
                  need to inform the authorities.</strong> If approved, only one in 10
                  overseas trips will require official notification.<br> <br> <strong>Another key change: giving servicemen up to 24 months to pass, or
                  work out to scrape through, their annual Individual Physical
                  Proficiency Test (IPPT).</strong><br> <br> <strong>These are among 30 proposed changes, announced on Thursday by the
                  Committee to Strengthen National Service (CSNS) after a year-long
                  review, that are aimed at fixing the shortfalls in NS training that
                  many servicemen have complained about.</strong> The panel, led by Defence
                  Minister Ng Eng Hen, canvassed for feedback and views from more
                  than 40,000 participants in focus group discussions and townhall
                  meetings.<br> <br> To boost buy-in for NS among servicemen and the community, the
                  CSNS, among other things, also want to:<br> <br> <strong>- Give and redistribute more monetary rewards and benefits for
                  those who have served their NS obligations or have done well during
                  their stints;<br> - Shorten the waiting time for half of Singapore’s NS-bound young
                  men so they do not wait more than four months before they begin
                  their full-time stints;<br> - Set up the new Singapore Armed Forces Volunteer Corps targeted at
                  women, first-generation permanent residents and new citizens who
                  choose to pitch in for the country’s defence.<br> </strong><br> The recommendations will be tabled in Parliament next week, with
                  MPs debating on them. The proposals are expected to be approved
                  next month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Every able-bodied man and woman, who is exempt from National
                  Service, can choose to do their part to defend the country when the
                  first-ever Singapore Armed Forces Volunteer Corps is set up in the
                  middle of next year. Women, first-generation permanent residents
                  and new citizens, between 18 and 45, will be the target of the new
                  military corps.</strong><br> <br> For a start, defence planners are hoping to see about 100 to 150
                  step forward to form the first batch of volunteers. They can choose
                  to serve in two tracks:<br> - Operations: guarding the Republic’s key installations like Jurong
                  Island and crowd control during SAF-related events<br> - Specialist: applying their expertise in the legal, medical,
                  psychological and maritime fields, among others.<br> <br> After signing up, they will have to wear military fatigues and
                  undergo a four-week course to familiarise themselves with the
                  military’s modus operandi. "They will have to understand the
                  culture and know-how to behave in a military environment which is
                  very different from the civilian world,” said Colonel Goh Si
                  Hou.<br> <br> Like every Operationally-Ready National Servicemen (NSmen),
                  volunteers are liable to be called up to serve for up to two weeks
                  every year, for at least three years. Employers will be required to
                  let them go and the volunteers will be given an allowance during
                  their in-camp stints. The Enlistment Act will have to be amended,
                  which The Straits Times understands, will make it mandatory for
                  employers to release volunteers for their stints.<br> <br> The topic of women and first-generation PRs volunteering attracted
                  intense discussion in recent focus groups led by the Committee to
                  Strengthen National Service.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To increase support for and commitment to National Service, a
                  high-level panel has come up with 30 suggestions to help motivate
                  people, so they can better defend the country. The Straits Times
                  highlights the top five changes most likely to affect you:<br> <strong><br> 1. No need for NSmen to notify the Defence Ministry when going
                  abroad, unless it is for more than 14 days</strong><br> <br> Currently, travel abroad past 24 hours requires notification.<br> <br><strong> 2. Given up to two years to train for or pass your Individual
                  Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT)</strong><br> <br> NSmen will have a year to clear their IPPT, and another year to
                  complete remedial training. Currently, they have nine months to
                  pass their IPPT, and three months for remedial training.<br> <br><strong> 3. NSmen will get $3,000 at each of three milestones</strong><br> <br> The milestones are: the completion of their full-time NS, the
                  mid-point and end of their 10-year NS training cycle.<br> <br> Two-thirds of the $9,000 will be credited into their Ordinary
                  accounts and can be used for housing. The other one-third will go
                  into the serviceman’s education account. <strong>An additional $6,000 will
                  be credited into their Medisave accounts </strong>over the NS training
                  cycle.<br> <br> <strong>IPPT incentives have also been bumped up by $100. </strong>A Gold achiever,
                  for example, will get $500, while a silver award winner will get
                  $300.<br> <br><strong> 4. New SAF Volunteer Corps</strong><br> <br> Women and first-generaton Permanent Residents and new citizens can
                  soon serve alongside regulars and citizen soldiers, as the SAF sets
                  up its first Volunteer Corps. Those who sign up will undergo a
                  four-week basic training course, and will be called back to serve
                  for up to two weeks annually, for at least three years.<br> <br><strong> 5. More efficiency in training</strong><br> <br> The SAF will hire a cadre of 1,100 career soldiers to train NSFs,
                  and widen its pool of commanders (specialists and officers) by 10
                  per cent. It will also accredit skills picked up in NS like driving
                  and leadership to support post-NS transition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Women and new citizens could soon be serving alongside National
                  Servicemen in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), if a recommendation
                  to establish a Volunteer Corps by the Committee to Strengthen
                  National Service is accepted. The Straits Times sums up the key
                  mechanics of the scheme:<br> <br> <strong>1. Volunteers will enlist under the SAF Act, and serve four weeks
                  of training to gain basic military skills and values, and be
                  orientated to their roles.<br> <br> 2. Thereafter, they are called back to serve one to two weeks every
                  year, and commit for a minimum of three years.<br> <br> 3. Volunteers can opt for either track: Operations or
                  Specialist.<br> <br> 4. Those in Operations can be trained and deployed in tasks like
                  protecting key installations like Jurong Island and Changi Airport,
                  and access control during events such as the National Day
                  Parade.<br> <br> 5. Specialists can contribute their expertise in the legal,
                  psychology, information, medical, engineering and maritime
                  domains</strong></p>

              <p><strong>National Servicemen could receive S$6,000 more in NS HOME Awards as 
              well as higher IPPT financial incentives should new proposals be 
              accepted.</strong></p>
              <div>
              <p>SINGAPORE: National Servicemen could receive more 
              monetary rewards as part of a new NS HOME (Housing, Medical and 
              Education) Awards, should proposals raised by the Committee to 
              Strengthen National Service be accepted by the Government.</p>
              <p>The 
              Committee to Strengthen National Service (CSNS) recommended disbursing 
              S$2,000 extra, in Medisave grants, at each of the three “milestones” an 
              NSmen reaches, under the proposed NS HOME Awards, which will replace the
               existing National Service Recognition Award (NSRA).</p>
              <p>Currently, 
              the NSRA pays S$3,000 each, when one completes fulltime NS, is at the 
              mid-point of the Operationally-Ready NS Training Cycle, and upon 
              completion of his NS obligations. With the exception of the first 
              payout, which goes into an NSman’s Post-Secondary Education Account, the
               other two disbursements are split among the Ordinary, Medisave and 
              Special accounts.</p>
              <p>Under the proposed new award, the first tranche 
              of S$3,000 will still go into an NSman's Post-Secondary Education 
              Account. The S$3,000 at the second and third milestones will go only 
              into the Ordinary Account, while the extra S$2,000 for each milestone 
              will go into the Medisave Account.</p>
              <p>This is one of a raft of 
              recommendations the CSNS has submitted for the Government’s 
              consideration on Thursday. The timeline for the various proposed changes
               to kick in depends on when they get accepted by the Government.</p>
              <p>The
               recommendations were made after an extensive public consultation 
              exercise lasting about a year. It engaged more than 40,000 people who 
              are stakeholders of National Service (NS). Apart from NSmen, employers, 
              new citizens, women and pre-enlistees were also consulted.</p>
              <p>Providing
               an overview of the recommendations at a press conference, Defence 
              Minister Ng Eng Hen, the chairman of the Committee, noted: "The benefits
               must never become a monetary transaction for services rendered."</p>
              <p><strong>IPPT AND RT</strong></p>
              <p>Among
               the other proposals, NSmen who fail their Individual Physical 
              Proficiency Test (IPPT) will have a longer period to complete their 20 
              remedial training (RT) sessions – increased from the current three 
              months to one year.</p>
              <p>The Committee also proposed increasing the 
              incentives by S$100 for achieving an IPPT pass with incentive, silver or
               gold to S$200, S$300 and S$500 respectively.</p>
              <p>Another 
              recommendation was to scrap the rule that requires NSmen to notify 
              Mindef on overseas trips unless they are more than two weeks in 
              duration. NSmen will still have to inform the ministry if the overseas 
              trip is more than six months. The current rules state that any NSman out
               of the country for 24 hours or more has to notify the ministry.</p>
              <p><strong>MORE REGULARS</strong></p>
              <p>Separately,
               the committee proposed the hiring of 1,100 more regulars for the 
              Singapore Armed Forces and 230 for the Singapore Police Force 
              and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), with an aim to improve 
              training and inculcate values more effectively.</p>
              <p>Raising the 
              proportion of officers and specialists from 30 to 40 per cent was 
              also recommended to increase leadership opportunities for full-time 
              National Servicemen (NSFs). Skills picked up by full-time National 
              Servicemen (NSFs) could also be accredited to highlight their 
              competencies and skills gained during NS, the CSNS said.</p>
              <p><strong>VOLUNTEER CORPS</strong></p>
              <p>The
               CSNS’ recommendations also revealed more details of the proposed SAF 
              Volunteer Corps. In their proposal, women, new citizens and 
              first-generation Permanent Residents (PRs) who volunteer in the 
              Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) could be given a four-week training course,
               followed by one to two weeks of annual commitment for a minimum of 
              three years.</p>
              <p>Said Minister for Social and Family Development Chan 
              Chun Sing, who chaired the working group on support for NS: "They are 
              doing it because they want to... It's an added statement on the 
              commitment of our people beyond the NS pool we have." </p>
              <p><strong>SHORTER GAP BETWEEN SCHOOL, NS</strong></p>
              <p>The
               enlistment wait-time for pre-enlistees could also be shortened to four 
              to six months after completion of post-secondary education, said the 
              Committee, which suggests that 90 per cent of pre-enlistees should be 
              enlisted within four months after post-secondary studies, up from 45 per
               cent now. The authorities are also looking to work with tertiary 
              institutions to reduce transition time after NS.</p>
              <p>The Committee, comprising several ministers, top military brass, is chaired by Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen.</p>
              <p>The
               recommendations are meant at create more opportunities for NSmen to 
              contribute to national defence, establish a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF)
               Volunteer Corps, and strengthen recognition and benefits for NSmen.</p>
              <p>It
               also strives to expand community support for servicemen, and create a 
              positive NS experience through the easing of administrative 
              restrictions, and strengthen the NS training system.</p>
