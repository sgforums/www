              <p>SINGAPORE: A 20-year-old national serviceman died in hospital, nearly two hours after he fainted during training on Pulau Tekong on Tuesday morning.</p>
              <p>Recruit Andrew Cheah Wei Siong from the Basic Military Training Centre <strong>fainted at 8.35am while he was taking part in a <span style="color: #ff6600;">2km walk training activity</span></strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"> on the island</span>.</p>
              <p>He was <strong>rushed to the medical centre and arrived within five minutes.</strong> He was given immediate medical attention by the doctors.</p>
              <p><strong>At 9.24am,</strong> Mr Cheah was <strong>evacuated by helicopter to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH).</strong></p>
              <p>The medical team from the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) continued to resuscitate him en route. But, they failed to revive him and he was <strong>pronounced dead at 10.50am</strong> at SGH.</p>
              <p>MINDEF and the SAF extend their deepest condolences to his family. MINDEF says it will help the family in their time of grief and is investigating the incident.</p>
              <p>Mr Cheah is the second national serviceman to die suddenly this year. In January, 41-year-old Major Tan Yit Guan collapsed and died after a run with colleagues.</p>
              <p>Before those two cases, 25-year-old Captain Ho Si Qiu died after completing the 21km Singapore Bay Run in August last year.</p>
              <p>Heart specialist Michael Lim says there are two leading causes of sudden death in young adults.</p>
              <p>The first is an inherited condition that leads to thickening of the heart muscle which affects the heart's ability to pump blood.</p>
              <p>The second is myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle caused by an infection.</p>
              <p>Dr Lim says these conditions can be detected easily with an electrocardiogram or ECG.</p>
              <p>MINDEF says ECGs are carried out on all servicemen during the medical screening before they are enlisted. <strong>Although Andrew Cheah was slightly obese and had had asthma as a child, MINDEF says he passed the medical screening and was given a clean bill of health.</strong> - CNA</p>

              <p>You've answered your own question in the parts in bold.</p>
              <p>All that 'extra stuff' is training. When you go into battle in highly-inaccessible places, you may well have to bring extra ammo, extra rations, river crossing equipment, heli-signalling equipment.... the list goes on. All of it on your back.</p>
              <p>Besides, people like MG/84/ATGM/Signaller/Medic would have to carry heavy equipment.</p>
              <p>In any case, my condolences to the REC's parents. This is a piece of news that no parent would ever want to hear.</p>
