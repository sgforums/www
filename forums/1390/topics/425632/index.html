              <p><br>there's a thing in British law system of a precedent case. Tat means tis ruling would have implication in future.</p>
              <p>It could shake the logistics sector as a whole operating in Singapore.</p>
              <p>It's like either way.. 'look, e prev ruling in SAF court states it's not considered theft' or theft is theft period.</p>

              <p>Phorum Noob, I think you did not read the report carefully, the 3SG was a regular. No one can force you to sign on as a regular. It's a career you chose yourself.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Woops, ok my bad. :)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">But how to "forget" when my reservice period isn't over yet?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Yeh I just felt the need to vent my immense displeasure of the currently situation where people who are born as males are disadvantaged, especially seeing how most of my friends here overseas graduates from their degrees at the age of 22 while I graduated at the age of 26 (as I had to serve 2.5 years + the waiting periods). I would have already completed my PhD 2 years ago if not for NS.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">But venting aside, I believe the issues that I've raised over at the other thread are valid points that SHOULD indeed be adressed and not be overlooks just because almost every guys has to do it (and female-persons aren't that crazy to fight against this inquality to their own disadvantage anyway).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I do honestly hope to see a change in this unfairness and a fair compensations be made not only to those currently serving, but those who had already done their time (especially those who had to do 2.5-3 years where NS used to be a lot more siong, abusive and psychotic). The great disadvantage in our career (to compete with females-people and foreign-talents; and the loss in productivity and comission for some) of having to do reservice should be rectified, and the rules impinging on our freedom as civilians (such as having to cut our hair short again everytime we return) be relaxed, etc.</p>
