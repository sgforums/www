              <p>good aspirations boy! </p>
              <p>but something u need to know...if u r looking at just rank and heroic glamour...then i m sorry to say its not the quality of true leadership and u may not get it...</p>
              <p>guards and commandos are the most idolized by most boys and gals...no doubt....hmmm...look larger...and u will see every logistic and support units are critically important towards the overall mission... </p>
              <p>a true army leader is one who possesses the holistic view (all parts of the mission - not just guards and commandos but also down to the minutest details of support and logistical support) and yet suffers with his men towards the "heroic" goal...to call it MISSION ACCOMPLISHED</p>

              <p>What glam TS toking about?</p>
              <p>Once you sign on for a career in the military, promotion is based very highly on one's educational level. Even if one is very good at one's vocation, super fighting- fit and all, there's only a ceiling one can rise up to..........</p>
              <p>Without a degree, one can probably rise up to the rank of an NCO but no further.........</p>
              <p>And once you hit a certain age (45.....?), you are turned to the pasture................</p>
              <p>one will then have no other job experience to find alternative employment thereafter but to squat at one corner and watch the world go by.........</p>

              <p>If you really want to sign on, let it be for the right reason, that is: you truly like life in the armed forces, and you have a true passion for what you're doing.</p>
              <p>I always tell people to go for BMT first before making a decision to sign on. The reason for this is simple: your perceptions can change overnight once you've had a taste of military life. I know of previously-bochup people who got turned on after BMT, and previously-gungho people who got jaded and disillusioned during BMT. You simply cannot tell whether or not you have the passion until you have a taste of it.</p>
              <p>Money? That should be the last reason for signing on. I know of regulars who got seduced by the money only to regret later on.</p>
              <p>Glam? Signing on for the glamour is just as bad a reason. Sure, it's nice to have a few chocolate bars on your shoulders, or a red beret on your head, but the weight of responsibilities is far more massive.</p>
              <p>For now, I would say to enjoy your youth, for your time to serve will come soon enough.</p>

              <p>If you have join NCC and NPCC, you should know roughly what is it like? </p>
              <p>Have you played command and conquer, call for duty, civilization, counterstrike?  Startcraft II is out at the end of this month. </p>
              <p>It always good to be the hero, but thinking that if you are only of the expendable footman is a different thing. In counterstrike, it is good to give head shot to others but not getting a heat shot by others. </p>

              <p>As I said before, keep an open mind, and reserve your judgement of life in the armed forces for BMT. You can read all about it and ask everyone else about it, but you'll only know what it really is like for sure once you've experienced it firsthand.</p>
              <p>NCC is nothing like the army. Really.</p>
