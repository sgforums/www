              <p>Yep, the finale of my ns life is finally coming ! So i was just wondering besides bringing my own stuffs and all the SOP items , what else should i bring and what i CANNOT bring ? Can some of the lao peng in here who had been to EX WALLABY pls advice me on this?</p>
              <p>Got some info from my commanders saying everyone will be slping on safari beds in a uber big tentage, so i assume bringing HP / PSP chargers would be pointless? Initially i thought of bringing some Gatorade there (powder form in bottle sold in local supermarkets) ,unlike india, i heard the aussie in the airport sibei geygao. whatever drinks / food in packet or sachets they also don't allow.</p>

              <p>see sporean overseas topic.....dont bring any food or drink items into oz.u will get fined if not declared.$200 fine.</p>
              <p>there are plenty of drinks at local supermarket woolsworth or coles.see if anyone in yer unit is organising grocery orders.................  im sure there is.</p>
              <p>you could buy some "corned" beef at local supermarket which is fresh beef marinated in salt....that can last a day without refrigeration.it tastes alot lot pastrami when cooked.its $5.50/kg on offer at times.their meat prices changes every week.one week it might be $7/kg...the next week it might be $5.50/kg.</p>
              <p>if you want energy drink............you can buy "Mother" energy drink.its even more potent than red bull and comes in a can 1.5 times the size of a coca cola can.giant size for $2.50.some place cheaper.</p>
              <p>dont mix with schoolkids........they are violent and even the 5 year old kids use fuck words ....if u need to talk to someone...then talk to much older aussies(around 50years old)who arent violent anymore.thats for a happy memory of oz if u communicate with aussies in shopping malls.</p>
              <p>and take note that there will be around 1000 odd south koreans who have also just finished their national service in korean units such as in the korean marines unit,korean army etc etc.they may look like any sporean but they areactually  work holiday tourist for 1 year stay in oz.and very often they bring along with them their shapely south korean girlfriends to oz as well....so dont go around poking some south korean girl without knowing the full story.</p>

              <p>hi again, thanks for all the replies!  With regards to the packing list, yes i do know what are the SOP items to and not to bring. purpose of this thread is to find out what else can i bring there for the 3wks long exercise for my own personal comfort / entertainment.</p>
              <p>Back to the topic again, for the RnR , i heard there's nothing much other than the usual heritage tours ?? So i was thinking of bringing probably A$200 and bring along master/visa card. Is it enough? coz im not those shopping whores. ( btw my RnR will be at rockhampton)</p>

              <p>to walsy,</p>
              <p>rockhampton???i was there last week when i went to central queensland campus.</p>
              <p>they have just completed rebuilding their shopping centre 1 month ago.</p>
              <p>its called SHOPPING FAIR.it has big department stores  like Big w,woolsworth,coles,k-mart etc all in one shopping mall.</p>
              <p>in the past before they rebuilt the shopping fair ...it looked more like a simple loop with shops...now after rebuilding it looks abit like suntec city minus all the other shopping levels.</p>
              <p>A$200??it depends on your platoon or unit ......if they want everyone to pay for this group transport and that group excursion...maybe u might not have enough cash left after that.but there are lots of mastercard ATM machines everywhere in shopping areas in case you need cash for emergency.but they normally deduct $5 commision for all deductions of any amount. whether u withdraw $20 or $100 the transaction amount is always $5 commision transactions.</p>

              <p>theres nothing interesting in rockhampton.goto brisbane if u need to look at old colonial buildings at anzec square...looks like city hall area in spore back in 70s.then goto chinatown and eat cheap duckrice or char siew rice at the vietnamese chinese family restaurant.</p>
              <p>actually theres nothing exciting to look at in rockhampton.they have an old gold mine thats about to start production once again for gold  this  or next year at mount morgan which is 15 mins away from rockhampton.</p>
              <p>theres really nothing there that u cant get to see from the internet.</p>
              <p>only exciting place to be would be in-camp. get a portable dvd player or go read an exciting book.</p>
              <p>theres the  central queensland university but they are very strict on people stepping onto their university grounds.you can drive around it but walking around there isnt wise as their security guards are very strict on non-students.</p>
              <p>theres their Pubs or discos but normally all fights and drugs always happen in there every night. ..there was one case in oz where they had a steel chair leg embedded into a guys head.i dont know if they had a saw to cut it off but best not to go in there.the doctors i think theres a shortage as well as hospital beds.so if you get injured...probably have to bring you back to camp first or something.</p>
              <p>normally when the americans come into oz they would bash the oz and the oz would bash them back another day .the us soldier might be on holiday leave from the iraq war and still be bashed into a coma in sydney by gangs.and us soldier would bash t oz soldier into coma just because oz soldier insists on taxi ride with us soldier to a place..so bashing people up seeriously is common especially if they know you belong to some army and they wanna see if they are as strong as you are.</p>
              <p>and black aborigines might approach you for money even though they are getting $500/week as unemployment benefits.try not to scold or rob them as you are polite civilised guests.</p>
              <p>nope.........i have never come across blonde babes in oz asking me for  sex and cash  but there are plenty of magazines with girls in birthday suit.</p>
              <p>best thing to do thats cheap is to read books and eat microwaved meatpies in oz army grounds.</p>

              <p>So many advices on RnR, let me give you some tips on surviving the outfield,</p>
              <p>1. a good pair of googles is a must very dusty</p>
              <p>2. camo scarf or mask... same thing very dusty and to minimise choking on your own 'black' gold</p>
              <p>3. carbon-activated hand warmers...it gets very cold at night</p>
              <p>4. wet tissue &amp; lip balm...very dry weather, your lips will crack like nobody's business.. i've seen bloodied mouths before</p>
              <p>5. Gatorade is ok, juz throw inside your check-in bag</p>
              <p>6. insect repellant( non-aerosol type)...alot of giant houseflies, some can give you a nasty bite so bring</p>
              <p>7. if you can use a jungle hat, use it...</p>
              <p>8. bring sun Block lotion of the highest spf not sun TAN lotion...terrible UV</p>
              <p>Some items above might have be mentioned in your briefing,  you might think it's common sense, but those things are what i believe will make your outfield less torturous and more enjoyable</p>

              <p>dont saf issue troops with sand goggles like those standard issued us army goggles???</p>
              <p>no need for hand warmers,,,its only like at worse 10C.ive actually walked and slept at those temperature with shorts n t-shirts spore style.hpowever it would be 16C for ex wallaby.</p>
              <p>shouldnt gatorade or similar be standard saf issued items???im rather surprised!!!insect repellant i believe is saf issued too!</p>
              <p>i believe the units would brief their men on what to bring...........if not...........i believe many heads will roll in service structure.</p>
              <p>and how come u need to buy gatorade???that should be standard issued and given to all of u when you reach the camp in oz!!!</p>

              <p>Depending on which vocation you belong to, my ns unit doesn't issue the googles so we have to buy it. Hand warmer is not a necessity but it helps in the cold night especially if you encounter a rare rainy night ( i did and all my things were soaking wet).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Insect repellant lotion is saf issued but i'm talking abt the spray on kind.</p>
              <p>Gatorade is juz an added supplement, because of the hot weather you will be losing alot of sweat and electroytes, 2 packs of pokari sweat is hardly enough in a 24hr meal pack...</p>

              <p>if u do get attacked unluckily...........please call your unit officer only!do not call or give info to local papers or report to police unless u are badly injured and need hospitalisation.</p>
