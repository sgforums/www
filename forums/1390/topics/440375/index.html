              <p>As per topic, I searched around the forum but the answers were replied pretty long ago, I dunno whether is it accurate, or not.</p>
              <p>Moreover, Im curious whether is it easy to OOC from navy wing, what's the chances or rate of being dropped out from the BNT and/or STT</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks in adv</p>

              <p>OCS(Navy) is very very shiong mentally. They grill your mind like mad. BUT if you can withstand the training and commission, you will definitely become stronger mentally.</p>
              <p>The current batch of instructors are very inspiring officers, who are extremely dedicated to your training in OCS. They differ from one another in many ways, but there's a lot from them that you can learn from. </p>
              <p>In navy, officer cadet is called midshipman, as with all other navies around the world. Basically it's 5 and half day week, you book in on sunday night, and book out sat noon.</p>
              <p>In OCS(Navy), you have a lot of independence as compared to the army and airforce wings. You have a committee made up of your own people, who will handle areas of sports, safety, security, logistics, discipline and education (I believe there are still more but I cant remember). Basically you have to do the preparation yourself. For e.g sports IC will tie up with logistics IC to ensure that the equipment are ready, medic informed. </p>
              <p>The whole midshipman course is split into 3 terms, basic naval term (BNT), sea training term (STT) and advanced naval term (ANT).</p>
              <p>BNT is where all the foundation comes in. Day to night you will be confined to classroom for lessons. I mean it, from 8am - 7.30pm, sometimes later. Seamanship, navigation, communication, weapons, Rules of the road and many other stuff I can't remember. May sound interesting, but they aren't when you are forced to learn. You will have many tests on them. Passing these tests is a factor in OOC, but few OOC due to poor grades.</p>
              <p>Also, there is COMEX - an exercise where there will be 2 teams pitted against each other, with a mission to accomplish, and you will go out one night at Pulau Ubin area where each team has a number of boats, and you will aim for mission success. The tough part comes in the planning phase, where you have to make use of the science of war (taking into account your weaponry, number of units, area of operations, deciding how best the enemy can thwart your mission) to come out with a plan. At various stages, you are required to present your plan for approval, and if the officers are not happy with your logic, you are required to redo it. During this planning phase, you are NOT given time for it - meaning you still have to go through normal lessons, and only plan during your leisure time. This usually means no sleep for a few days.</p>
              <p>STT is the most memorable term, where you sail for 6 weeks, going to different countries. However, it is even more mentally stressful than BNT as you are given a number of projects, and you STILL have to go through lessons, and put into use practically what you have learned in BNT. Your team will get to take control of the ship for training of navigation. It is actually quite safe, as you're out in open sea with few ships in immediate vicinity, and the actual team is still around to take over if any issues crop up. Most people show their true colours in this term, be it selfishness, laziness etc.</p>
              <p>ANT is the time when you are really drilled in navigation (still, not as much as when you become an actual officer). Not much to say during this term XD</p>
              <p>Most people OOC because they realise this is not what they expected for life to be (people generally think that navy is good life). The next greatest number of OOC comes from lack of leadership competency. The officers are always observing your actions, especially in STT. Lastly are those who lack the academic competency, but very very few people OOC because of this.</p>
              <p>Oh yeah, SAF takes a very very strict stand on integrity issues. The slightest mess with integrity (the lack of), and you'll be out immediately.</p>
              <p>While you do not go outfield like army cadets do, training in OCS (Navy) is as tough, if not tougher than that of army's. However, dont use life in ocs as a gauge of how life will be like when you really join the navy as an officer, as it is very very different. </p>
              <p>Lastly, scrutinize what the recruitment officer tells you. Life is not as rosy as you may think ^^</p>
