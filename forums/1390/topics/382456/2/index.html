              <p>even poly sign on will retire as MAJ.</p>
              <p>Anyway a more likely explanation is that the 'former regular' did not leave the service at retirement, and instead left in his late 20s or early 30s. poster didn't say the CPT left the service at retirement.</p>

              <p>ok now you changed your statement to say its just with the regulars you met.*whistle* I mean everyone of us here knows exactly what you were driving at. there's no need to suddenly change statement and beat a retreat. the fact is you said that</p>
              <p>i) you cannot befriend any regular, both specialist and officer</p>
              <p>ii) you put forth a number of illogical 'reasons' that are poorly conceived and totally unsubstantiated eg claiming that they are all anti social, throw rank even after ORD, disconnected outside SAF, unaffected by recession and hence you can't talk to them and other dumb nonsense that I debunked with less than 0.05% of my IQ</p>
              <p>iii) when hellraiza pointed out that you have an EQ problem and this thread belongs in aunt agony for you to tell your sob story, you rebutted and claimed that it's all regulars who are anti-social, not you hence they're the problem and not you.</p>
              <p>basically, there is nothing great about civilians like you. i've spoken to the like of you many times in unfortunate (for me) social settings. you think you're all that, and think you're better than groups of people that you're not superior to. it could be a remnant of bitter past in NS that you're still struggling with or just plain unhappiness with your life.</p>
              <p>The fact is, majority (majority just means 50% and above) of the regular officer corp nowadays have a degree, a farmer degree yes, but a degree still. And they showed sufficient leadership qualities in their NS days to be selected for OCS (which you could not). Moving on, majority of the WOSE have O, A level or diploma, with many going for a degree later in life.I highly doubt you are much better or more educated than the farmer regular officers/WOSE, or came from a superior background or attended Yale or Princeton or Cambridge, which many Singaporeans do attend you know?  I mean gimme a break. You probably don't even have a proper degree done in a proper full time university and you started a thread that shouts "I-am-better-than-an-entire-group-of-people" which includes the COA and CDF (LOL), and of this group, I bet by logical odds you haven't known 99.9999% personally?</p>
              <p>When i look at the ordinary regulars, though I'm not impressed with most of them, (being impressed is not the same as just liking people as friends and as regular joes, which I do most of them),I think they are no less, and many times better than folks like you. I mean what do you have to offer to start a condescending thread like this to deride an entire group of people? Who do you think you are? A president's scholar? You're a perm sec? Nobel laureate? Maybe I should start a thread about ordinary joes who think they're better than others when they're not?</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, they're just like you - coming from the same educational and family backgrounds, (I doubt you're born into old money), and the only difference is that they did well enough in their NS days for them to consider a military career. Unlike you, who could only be a LCP. And chances are most of them are physically fitter than you, on top of having the same qualifications if not better.</p>
              <p>I mean, i hate to be so frank about it but I just got to put people like you in your place.</p>

              <p>It has been almost 7 years since I ORD. BMT is just a childhood memory, why do I bother much?</p>
              <p>My guess is SAF regular are military soldiers. Since they are soldiers (especially the specs)  they behave like one. Hence, varies siginficantly from professionals and executives.  </p>

                                                                                                    other things, in actual fact I dont <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>like</strong></span> to run
                                                                                                    with him. I can run with all my other friends but NOT a regular
                                                                                                    officer."</p>
              <p>I mean seriously, the nerve you have. I feel sorry for your friend. he's just an everyday joe, who didn't do any harm to you and probably invited you to run with him in all earnesty and sincerity (or maybe cos he felt sorry for you cos you're such a retard) and you secretly harboured such vile contempt (totally unjustified) for that nice dude.</p>
              <p>Do you think you're some big shot? Based on odds and also from my analysis of your posts and what you have presented of yourself and in what manner, i'm very sure that you're a nobody who has achieved less than half of the typical regular. Not to mention how you're a total nobody compared to actual 'somebodies' I know who are regulars like SAFOS. So I found your nerve shocking as much it was amusing (in a shameless way). And now you're changing your statements like a coward.. ridiculous.</p>
              <p>Like I mentioned earlier, you are no different, if not worse than the typical farmer regular, based on how I've profiled the typical regular, except that you performed much worse in NS (was an LCP), have less to none leadership qualities, generally have been a deadbeat all your life and chances are, are less fit than them!!!!</p>
              <p><a href="/users/81529">Hellraiza</a>, please go ahead and tell those idiots in HWZ what I've said. You can even paste what I said and say that it's from me. What a bunch of fuckwits with zero sense of self awareness and self measurement.</p>
              <p>To weird freak who befriends men in gym: if you were in the right circle u'd know that there are A LOT of guys who said no to OCS and were assigned to go. Let me tell you, when SAF sees leadership, she recognises it immediately.<br><br>One of my ex classmates declared no to command school of any kind in BMT, because he thought he wanted to be a scientist, so he never considered a military career so just wanted to be an LCP like this deluded twit here. But even in BMT, they could tell he was cut out for leadership. When he disagreed with an order, he'd tell the SGT why and of course, they ignored him. They made him go to OCS where he later discovered his passion in leadership and soldiering. Guess what he eventually became the SAFOS and president's scholar of our year. <br><br>So please lah. When someone has it, he has it, even without trying. When dun have, die trying also cannot! So no need to say what you dun want thats why you can even recourse BMT. When a normal person hears of BMT recourse, all they can react is to gasp in horror cos BMT is so easy can? Having this kind of attitude towards your NS liability speaks more of your sense of responsibility and self-worth than anyone else's anyway. Dun be too quick to wear it like a badge of honour. The one being laughed at behind others' backs is you.</p>

              <p>It is kind of strange..<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>. After so many years I
              ORD</strong></span>, I realise I dont really like to mix with SAF
              regular in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>civilian
              life</strong></span>. For example,</p>
              <p>yesterday I met a new guy in the gym, who is an airforce
              specialist. When he announced that he was a SAF regular,
              I was immediately turn off (I just dont like regular). I felt that
              they were another form of species or a different type of people.
              They were just different and I refused to click with them.</p>
              <p>Any1 have this similarities?</p>
