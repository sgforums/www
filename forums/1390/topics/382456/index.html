              <p>It is a fact. People work by rank, is difficult to work outside as a normal person. A CPT pushes his rank round in the army, how can he do sales outside? It is just hard.</p>

              <p>It might be something in ur mind only thats causing such a problem. I often have lunch or tea breaks with people lower or higher rank than me and i will just join them if i'm free without thinking about it.</p>
              <p>To me, an order is something that must be done and can't be disobeyed, going for meals etc with people more senior than me is always a choice. Neither do i treat meals with my juniors as a favour to them since we normally treat each other equally and not care about our ranks.</p>

              Thats why I say it is different. Someway they talk, and behave, put off a person. 
              
              A "known" colleague is ok but a friend who you can share joy and sadness with = NO

Those regular already left the service got a weirdo thinking as they cannot get used to the life outside the service. Some after decided to come back to join the service after cannot getting used to the life outside. I kena told by a former regualr got some companies refused to grant interview to former regular after a former CPT applying for a sales position wanted an expected salary of three thousand despite the fact that he got no experience in the sales line.</p>

              <p>I suppose the CPT must have been forced to retire by age 45 which is why he have to give up his 3k job a month?</p>

              <p>It might be something in ur mind only thats causing such a
                  problem. I often have lunch or tea breaks with people lower or
                  higher rank than me and i will just join them if i'm free without
                  thinking about it.</p>
              <p>To me, an order is something that must be done and can't be
                  disobeyed, going for meals etc with people more senior than me is
                  always a choice. Neither do i treat meals with my juniors as a
                  favour to them since we normally treat each other equally and not
                  care about our ranks.</p>

              <p><br> Of course it is a mindset problem</p>
              <p>Another example,</p>
              <p>one of a known friend who is a regular officer, ask me if I am interested to run with him. Although, I replied I am occupied with other things, in actual fact I dont <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>like </strong></span>to run with him. I can run with all my other friends but NOT a regular officer.</p>

              <p>It is kind of strange... After so many years I ORD, I realise I dont really like to mix with SAF regular. For example,</p>
              <p>yesterday I met a new guy in the gym, who is an airforce specialist. When he announced that he was a SAF regular, I was immediately turn off (I just dont like regular). I felt that they were another form of species or a different type of people. They were just different and I refused to click with them.</p>

              <p>No. Many of people here has agreed that regulars are anti-social and regular officers are bossy even after they ORD. </p>

              <p>Its because TS and the scanty few idiots who concur with him were LCP in their NS days and suffered from anti-commander syndrome. If he had been or could be even a 3SG or 2LT it would have been different for him. But not every LCP suffer from this syndrome, as you can see from this thread many don't have any confidence issues (inferiority complex) and do not care.</p>
