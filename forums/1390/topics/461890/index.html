              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Military Justice System in the
                      SAF</span></span></strong><br> <br> 1. Overview<br> The military justice system in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is
                      expected to treat every service personnel fairly and equally,
                      regardless of race, rank or vocation.</p>
              <p> <br> 2. Multi-levelled Approach</p>
              <p>The military justice system is based on the SAF Act, which was
                      implemented in 1972. All servicemen are subjected to the SAF Act,
                      SAF Regulations, and orders of whatever form issued pursuant to
                      them.</p>
              <p>While discipline is paramount in the military, not all offences
                      committed by SAF servicemen are dealt with by formal investigations
                      and charges. Essentially, offenders can be dealt with either by way
                      of informal or formal punishment systems.</p>
              <p> <br> 3. Informal Punishment System<br> Commanders are empowered to mete out informal punishments like
                      push-ups and weekend confinement to servicemen who have committed
                      disciplinary breaches, like being late, sluggish, or improperly
                      dressed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Formal Punishment System<br> If the offence that a serviceman committed is of a more serious
                      nature, he may be formally dealt with by his disciplinary officer
                      by way of a summary trial, or brought before a subordinate military
                      court (more commonly known as the General Court Martial or
                      GCM).</p>
              <p>(a) Summary Trial</p>
              <p>The offences that can be dealt with by summary trial are
                      essentially military offences, such as absence without leave
                      (AWOL), non-compliance with lawful orders or insubordination.</p>
              <p>Depending on the rank of the serviceman in question, and the
                      type of the disciplinary body hearing the case, the possible
                      sentences that may be imposed can vary, and these can include fines
                      or detention.</p>
              <p>The summary trial is carried out in accordance with relevant SAF
                      regulations, and the records of the summary trial are sent to the
                      office of the Director, Legal Services of the SAF.</p>
              <p>(b) General Court Martial</p>
              <p>The General Court Martial exists as a separate forum from that
                      of the summary trial. Unlike the summary trial, the GCM can deal
                      with a wider range of offences, and can impose a wider range of
                      punishments including imprisonment and discharge, on top of
                      sentences like detention and fines. The GCM is also a more public
                      and open forum, and its proceedings are conducted using similar
                      legal rules and procedures as those used in a civil criminal
                      court.</p>
              <p>Generally, only serious offences investigated by the Military
                      Police Command, and which are referred to the office of the
                      Director of Legal Services, will result in the accused serviceman
                      being charged in a GCM. In such a case, a military prosecutor will
                      draw up a formal charge sheet and present it before the GCM.</p>
              <p>General Courts Martial can be further sub-divided into two
                      categories, namely the Panel Courts Martial - consisting of a
                      President and usually two other members, and Judge Courts Martial -
                      consisting of a single President only.</p>
              <p>Currently, the practice is for military offences to be heard by
                      Panel Courts Martial, while civil offences like misuse of drugs and
                      penal code offences may be dealt with by a Judge Court Martial.</p>
              <p><br> The current policy is also for an NSman, who is or was a District
                      Judge in the Subordinate Courts, to preside in a GCM. There are
                      currently 10 NSmen who have been appointed by the Armed Forces
                      Council to perform duty as President of a court martial. They are
                      rostered by the Registrar of the Subordinate Military Court to hear
                      cases during their in-camp training. In the case of a Panel Court
                      Martial, the other two members are rostered from among some 155
                      military officers appointed by the Chief of Defence Force.</p>
              <p> <br> 5. Ways to Seek Redress</p>
              <p>There are numerous safeguards and avenues set out in the
                      military justice system for an SAF serviceman to seek redress if he
                      is unhappy about the punishment imposed on him.</p>
              <p>Generally, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with an informal
                      punishment meted out to him may request a higher level commander to
                      review the punishment, or request for formal disciplinary
                      dealing.</p>
              <p>In the case of a summary trial, a serviceman brought before the
                      disciplinary officer may elect instead to be tried by a court
                      martial. Alternatively, an aggrieved serviceman may request that
                      his conviction or punishment imposed at the summary trial be
                      reviewed by MINDEF's Director Manpower (a delegated authority of
                      the Armed Forces Council).</p>
              <p>In the case of a GCM, a serviceman may choose to be represented
                      by a lawyer or an SAF defending officer if his case will be heard
                      by a court martial. The SAF has about 200 trained defending
                      officers. While an SAF defending officer comes free to the
                      serviceman, he has to bear the cost of engaging a lawyer. At the
                      end of the trial, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with the
                      decision of the court martial may petition the Reviewing Authority
                      (the AFC or a committee of its members) for a review of his case.
                      The serviceman can also appeal to the Military Court of Appeal
                      (MCA) for a reconsideration of his conviction, or his sentence, or
                      both.</p>
              <p>The MCA, when convened to hear an appeal, sits as a panel of
                      five members. Heading the MCA is a President, who is appointed by
                      the Chief Justice. By law, he must be a person qualified to be a
                      Judge of the Supreme Court. The current President of the MCA is
                      Justice Choo Han Teck. Four other members - two civilian members
                      who are qualified legal practitioners with at least five years
                      experience each, and two senior military officers - make up the
                      rest of the MCA. The MCA is the highest court in the military
                      justice system.</p>
              <p> <br> 6. Impartial Hearings<br> It is important to recognise that the GCM and the MCA are tribunals
                      headed by presidents who are outside the SAF chain of command.</p>
              <p>Being an "outsider", the president of these forums will hear the
                      case impartially like any other civil criminal case. The
                      proceedings in the GCM and the MCA are also heard in a public
                      forum, and these military courts adopt many of the same legal
                      procedures and safeguards as that used in the civil criminal
                      courts. All servicemen formally charged with an offence can bring
                      their case to these forums.</p>

They will however be subjected to harsher penalties should they continue to breach of the Enlistment Act after age 16.5. <br> <br>Males above 16.5 years who travel and remain overseas without applying for an exit permit would have committed an offence under the Enlistment Act.

Hence it is not necessary to apply to your respective Personnel Management Centre/NSSC/ NS units for disruption for National Service. <br> <br><em>* A NSman who is granted disruption may not be posted back to his previous unit upon expiry of his disruption. <br>* A NSman who is granted disruption will complete his training cycle later than his cohort. <br>* A NSman who is an appointment holder will not receive his National Service Command Allowance or Key Appointment Holder Allowance during the period of disruption. </em><br> <br><strong>I am going overseas to look for a job. I do not have a documentary proof now. What should I do? </strong><br> <br>You may leave without an exit permit by informing NS Call Centre* of your overseas trip at 1800-3676767 first. However, you are required to apply for an exit permit through Internet, within 6 months from date of departure. <br> <br>No documentary proof is required for application of exit permit by NSmen. Random verification of proof is only for selected applications. <br> <br>* If you have not completed your ORNS Training Cycle and have yet to be posted to MINDEF Reserve (MR) / SPF or SCDF Reserve, you will need to inform the MINDEF Notification Centre (MNC) if your trip exceed 24 hours via Overseas Notification. <br> <strong><br>When do I need to reapply for a new exit permit? </strong><br> <br>You will need to apply for a new exit permit via the Internet at www.ns.sg if: <br> <br>i) Your exit permit is expiring and you are not able to come back upon expiry of your current exit permit. <br>ii) There is a change of your departure date <br>iii) There is a change of the country of visit, purpose of visit, place of employment and course and place of study. <br> <br><strong>I have changed my course of Study/ University. My Exit Permit is still valid. Do I need to re-apply for a new Exit Permit again? </strong><br> <br>If you have changed your course or University, you are required to re-apply for a new Exit Permit through internet. <br> <strong><br>What is the maximum duration of Exit Permit that I can apply for? </strong><br> <br>An exit permit is normally granted on a yearly basis for overseas employment, permanent residence or training. An exit permit of a maximum of 3 years may be granted for overseas employment or training. If you are studying overseas, an exit permit can be granted for the full duration of your course.</p>

              <p><strong>Singapore Armed Forces Military Police Command</strong> <br>(SAFMPC/ æ–°åŠ å�¡æ­¦è£…éƒ¨é˜Ÿå®ªå…µå�¸ä»¤éƒ¨)</p>
              <p>The formation is headed by the Command Headquarters which oversees 
                          its daily operations, and supported by four units specialising in the 
                          various specific operational responsibilities of the SAF MPC.</p>
              <p>The four units are:</p>
              <p><strong>Military Police Enforcement Unit (MPEU):</strong> The unit consists of 
                          the Law Enforcement and Ceremonial Company (LECC), the Security 
                          Operation Unit (SOU) and the Special Security and Protection (SSP) 
                          Branch. It is the active wing of the SAF MPC and executes most of the 
                          operational and ceremonial duties and roles carried out by the SAF MPC.</p>
              <p>The LECC was formed by combining the former Active Provost Company 
                          (APC) and the former Zone Provost Company (ZPC). Its duties include most
                           of the important ceremonial duties required within the SAF as 
                          previously handled by the APC, and a traffic platoon which ensures the 
                          compliance of traffic regulations by military personnel on the road as 
                          well as performing escort duties. It also performs regular raids for 
                          contraband and/or miscreants on various camps of the SAF as was 
                          conducted by the ZPC. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Enforcement Platoon (also known as Platoon 2) 
                          performs regular operations in residential areas, workplaces, and many 
                          public places such as shopping centres, clubs and eating outlets to 
                          apprehend <a class="mw-redirect" title="Deserter" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deserter">deserters</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="AWOL" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWOL">AWOL</a> offenders, drug addicts and other military criminals. </span>They work closely
                           with the Singapore Police Force and are often in very dangerous 
                          situations and are extremely well trained for handling the varied 
                          scenarios that they find themselves in. This is also the platoon that 
                          enforces the public image of the SAF by booking offenders who smoke in 
                          uniform and commit other offences in uniform while in the eye of the 
                          public. </em></span>It is worth noting that they perform undercover security 
                          operations for high-key events like the National Day Parade and the 
                          Youth Olympic Games. The security of Mowbray Station is overseen by a 
                          platoon who is also in charge of registering and detaining suspects and 
                          offenders of military crimes in holding cells. The station is similar to
                           a civilian police station and it is usually the first stop for 
                          detainees before their transfer to the detention barracks after 
                          conviction in military courts, or a temporary holding cell for 
                          servicemen placed under Closed Arrest. The investigative branch for the 
                          SAF, the Special Investigation Branch (SIB) investigates higher-order 
                          military crimes that requires specialised handling. Since 31 December 8,
                           MPEU has heralded the inclusion of a new branch within its ranks. The 
                          Security Support and Protection (SSP) Branch is involved in sensitive 
                          operations so no further information is available.</p>
              <p><strong>SAF Detention Barracks (SAFDB):</strong> Headed by a commandant, DB 
                          consists of MPs in charge of supervision of detainees of the SAF who 
                          have been convicted in military courts.</p>
              <p><strong>Military Police Training School (MPTS):</strong> Formerly known as the 
                          School of Provost, MPTS is in charge of equipping trainees with 
                          necessary and fundamental military policing skills as well as instilling
                           in them a high standard of discipline through the vocational courses 
                          and specialised courses such as the Silent Precision Drill Courses. MPTS
                           also legislation courses for senior commanders all over the SAF. In 
                          addition, the SAF Military Working Dog Unit is a wing under MPTS and it 
                          is in charge of all dog training and doctrine matters of the SAF.</p>
              <p><strong>SAF MP Command Head Quarters (HQ):</strong> The Head Quarters of the 
                          Command comprises various branches, namely the Human Resource (HR), 
                          Intelligences and Security Branch (ISB), General Staff Branch (GS), the 
                          Special Investigation Branch (SIB) and Logistic Branch. Each branch is 
                          headed by a branch head who serves concurrently as the Command's 
                          Manpower, Intelligence, Ops and Training and Logistics Officer.</p>

              <p>I guess if you delayed because of flight Mindef side can understand but if you booked your returned flight after your enlistment date, then I think you need to explain to them why?</p>
