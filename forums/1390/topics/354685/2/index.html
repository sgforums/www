              <p>cos previously those sadistic platoon sgts were still in the unit, but now no longer here already.. heh. what i mean by enjoy is to make friends and enjoy the fun u will have with ur platoon..</p>
              <p>there's a high chance you'll be an armour infantry, which basically functions almost the same as a normal infantry, except that for most missions, you'll be sitting in an armoured vehicle (it's called a BX) while infantry ppl have to do their route marches for missions..</p>
              <p>don't be mistaken though, sometimes you also have to do route marches or what we call them in 41, LONG WALKS.</p>
              <p>after an outfield exercise, you'll have to come back and help wash the vehicle which will be full of mud and sand..</p>
              <p>if you wanna be a BX driver, u can voice out to ur commanders and after ur BMT, they'll send u for BX driver training..</p>

              <p>Challenges? Oh yes, lots. The vehicle is under you and your commander's name, so if ANYTHING goes wrong with the vehicle it's you and your commander's fault. And a lot of things can go wrong, trust me.</p>
              <p>Otherwise outfield is comparatively slack compared to your troopers, get to sit in vehicle and drive around when your troopers dismount and bash around. But return to camp and get ready to stay up through the night washing the vehicle if you're unlucky. And it can get really dirty and jia lat, mind you.</p>

              <p>BX drivers do have a better life than the troopers when it come to outfield, because troopers have to dismount and bash in the jungle whereas drivers just drive the BX, and after that just rest in their driver compartment. Of if u wanna become both trooper and driver also can.. u tell ur superior u wanna cross-train as other vocations within armour infantry lor.. heh.</p>
              <p>yea i ord on 15th this month, which means i'll be in time to see u guys come in and surrender your pink ics.. LOL! yup and thanks! got married already. heh.</p>

              <p><br>if something went wrong with ur vehicle, but it's not ur fault, den u don't have to pay anything of course.. cos most of the vehicles are damn old already, so sure got problems one.. the technicians will repair the vehicles for you so no worries.</p>
              <p>washing vehicles is compulsory one.. usually it's washed by the vehicle commander and the driver, but if you all in a rush for time, the platoon will help to wash the vehicles.. for each armour infantry platoon, there will be 3 vehicles.. one for each section.</p>
              <p>of cos it's super dull and sian, but no choice mah.. after my BMT in tekong, posted here so just suck thumb lor </p>
