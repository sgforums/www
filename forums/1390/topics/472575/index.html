              <br>I have completed my Combat BMT in April 2013, but did not received any invitations?!<br><br>Appreciate the help.<br><br><br><br><br>Other info:<br>I don't wish my 2 younger brothers who are locally born and raised to experience the similar situation that I have went through.<br>They are born and raised locally yet they are classified as SPR as both of my parents are SPR, and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">that's the ISSUE</span></span></strong>.<br>They will have to go through the same path as me, going through NS in order to get Singapore Citizenship, even though they were born and raised locally.<br><br>I don't want that to happen. <br>Here's why:<br>1) Awkward moment when you're locally born and raised but holds a Blue IC.<br>2) Not eligible to the benefit of citizen (refer to point 3), they are not allowed to apply for Citizen till they undergo NS (but they're born and raised locally? And Singapore is their HOME).<br>3) Example of benefits for citizen,<br>- <span style="color: #ff0000;">Edusave</span>, they will have to pay every single cents for their education just like me. No big deal, that's what you might said. Do you know the unbearable feeling of being left out during primary school days just because you didn't have enough money to attend the P5 Camp while others paid by Edusave. Same happens to secondary school camp and overseas programs, I didn't attend any of them as I came from a poor family background. Upon Tertiary education, school fees acted as a heavy burden to my family as SPR doesn't have neither Edusave nor PSEA; I have to work part time to top it off.<br>- <span style="color: #ff0000;">Scholarship</span>, not eligible because I'm SPR. Although my GPA is 3.89 but still not accepted for government scholarships.<br>- <span style="color: #ff0000;">Housing</span>, rent a 4-room flat from a local family, and sublet the 3 rooms out in order to square off the high rent cost. So where do we lived? A family of 5 lived in living room. Cramp living area, no air-con, no TV, no fancy decorations, sleeps on mattresses. Something similar to construction workers' hostels but slightly better, and that's where I have been living for the past 14 years.</div>

              <div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);   -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">- <span style="color: #ff0000;">National Service</span>, being SPR whose parents are also SPR you can't enter high security clearance vocation such as SCS nor OCS due to CAT2A security clearance required, so most likely ended up as drivers or storeman (low security clearance vocations). So what's the point of getting IPPT Gold and undergo 6 days fieldcamp SIT test. You can't even be a clerk as that requires an ISAC card!</div>

              <p>Second Generation Permanent Residents are required to go through 
                      compulsory full-time national service as well as reservist duties after 
                      they have completed their full-time national service and turns 
                      operationally-ready (ORD).</p>
              <p>Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen stated in Parliament that between 
                      2006 to 2011, about 8,800 males who had become permanent residents under
                       the sponsorship of their parents were enlisted for and served National 
                      Service (NS). On the other hand, 4,200 males who had become permanent 
                      residents under the sponsorship of their parents renounced their PR 
                      status prior to serving national service.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_service_in_Singapore#cite_note-19"></a></sup> Their failure to serve NS will be taken into account to have adverse 
                      impact when they subsequently apply to study/ work/ visit/ travel in 
                      Singapore. These ex-PRs were sternly warned about the dire consequences 
                      of their actions at the point of renunciation.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_service_in_Singapore#cite_note-20"></a></sup></p>
              <p><strong>After completing full-time national service, they are eligible to 
                      apply for Singapore citizenship. However, citizenship is not guaranteed 
                      for all applicants, as there are certain criteria that must be met such 
                      as educational qualification, income qualification and NS work 
                      performance/ conduct appraisal in the NS Certificate of Service upon 
                      ORD. <em>From 2006 to 2010, about 2% of 3,000 Second Generation Permanent 
                      Residents who completed full-time national service and applied for 
                      Singapore citizenship were rejected.</em></strong><sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_service_in_Singapore#cite_note-21"></a></sup></p>
              <p>If the person does not hold Singapore citizenship but still holds 
                      Singapore permanent residency, he is still required to serve the service
                       requirement, i.e. reservist duties after he turns operationally-ready.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_service_in_Singapore#cite_note-22"></a></sup></p>
              <p>Singapore Permanent Residents who served national service but did not
                       acquire Singapore citizenship will be treated equally to those 
                      permanent residents without service obligation; they would not have

              <p><span class="bodytext"> </span></p>
              <p>Deputy Prime Minister in his 
                          written reply in Parliament in 2012 wrote that every application for Singapore citizenship is evaluated on a range 
                          of criteria, including economic contributions, qualifications, age, 
                          family profile and length of stay in Singapore, to assess applicants' 
                          ability to contribute and integrate into our society, and commitment to 
                          sinking roots. For those with family ties to Singapore citizens, we also
                           consider the local sponsor's ability to support the family. As 
                          applications are evaluated holistically, there may be a number of 
                          reasons, taken together, for rejecting an application.</p>
              <p>Members of Parliament questioned whether the government has a discerning criteria in citizenship approval.</p>
              <p>To which Ms Fu replied criteria is not based on a single but a whole set of criteria used to evaluate citizenship applications.</p>
              <p>She said this set of criteria is reviewed from time to time, in ensuring the set meets the country's immigration needs. </p>

              that must be met such as educational qualification, income
              qualification and NS work performance/ conduct appraisal in the NS
              Certificate of Service upon ORD.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> <em>From 2006 to 2010, about 2% of

              <p>Hellfire poty, no need to worry.</p>
              <p>I also converted from PR to SG citizen during my ns period through Accelerated Citizenship scheme. I still remembered that I POP from BMT in April, then posted to MMI for medic training then finally posted to a unit. I had waited quite a few months after my BMT before they passed me my "Accelerated Citizenship scheme" form.</p>
              <p>That's why I tell you not to worry. Because SAF will inform ALL PR nsf on the scheme at the auditorium and pass you the application form with YOUR NAME on it. It is then up to your decison if you would want to apply or not. Maybe you are still under training now??  SAF will eventually pass you the application form after your unit has been finalised.</p>
              <p>I would suggest you to wait till December, if by then you still never receive the application form then you could approach your HQ admin clerk for the form. SAF will not mail the form to you, it will be passed to you personally.</p>
              <p>Please be patient. Don't apply on your own thru ICA, why? When you apply thru accelerated scheme, you get the priority and it is free and 100% successful rate. The application form is also easy to fill up as SAF has already helped you to void out all the unnecessary colunms that you don't need to fill up. I have never heard of anybody got rejected before.</p>
              <p>The only $ that paid is for the passport and nric.</p>
