Why do they do everything by the book? I don't know why I am helping you cos your questions seem so juvenile, but here goes...<br><br>PT attire is needed because it aids in the medical examination, ie. removal of clothes. They are not going to make you do PT. And even if they are, a little PT won't kill.<br><br>The educational documents are just proof of your qualifications. If you don't have them chances are that you won't be an officer or a specialist. Well unless, your records are all in the computer.<br><br>Bring whatever medical certs you have, whatever you don't have, it's ok. If you don't have any mental or physical disability you don't have to bring anything. Just go in and declare that you are a fit and healthy young man.<br><br>You are enlisting really soon, and they will shave you bald in the camp. So it's only a matter of time before you have to go bald. And they are asking you to cut a trim and neat haircut, not to go bald. Who said that musicians cannot keep their hair short? If you are a talented enough musician, why do you need a persona to carry you? Do you really need shoulder length hair to hold on to your job???<br><br>You need to go through eyesight and colour blindness checks, therefore you need to have a pair of glasses.<br><br>Piercings should be ok, but they may ask you to remove them before you go for x-rays or medical examinations.<br><br>I enlisted 10 years ago, but I never had to ask such questions. I hope I answered your queries.</div>
