              <p>I am just wondering losing just a small firing pin will end up go 7 years DB. I am having compulsive checking disorders and I have already ORDd many months ago but until now I am freaking out and having convulsions whether I have lost any small bolts or pins over my ns life as I have used so many weapons and cleaned them. I understandng losing the whole weapon is a big problem but how about just a small firing pin which may suddenly cause 7 Years Db and ruin my career and youth?????? But I guess the unit has already checked and I think its obvious when a pin goes mising but I am just parnoid what are the odds??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ANd with the account that you have ORDd what if suddenly SAF calls you up and say Come to court. We are holding you accountable for losing this pin. then after one day i find myself in DB for 7 years. LLOL sounds ridiculous but I am having mental disorders over just a small little pin and its affecing and taking over my mental state. of mind. I did not lose any pins or anything but  am just wondering</p>

              55-year-old shop owner pleaded guilty on Monday to selling a rifle 
              firing pin and having another firing pin in her store.<br><br>The rifle firing pin is a weapon component and requires a license for its sale.<br><br>Loh
               Boon Cheng, who owns Lay Hwa Store on the second floor of the Golden 
              Mile Food Centre at Beach Road, admitted that she sold the firing pin 
              for M16 automatic rifle to a media intern on March 5.<br><br>The 
              twenty-four-year-old intern went to her shop, located in what is 
              commonly known as the Army Market at around 3pm that day and bought it 
              for S$70.<br><br>One of the intern's colleagues then lodged a police report about the incident a week later.<br><br>The
               firing pin was seized and a report from the Logistics Department of the
               Singapore Police Force stated that it was in a good condition.<br><br>On
               March 18, a team of Police officers as well as personnel from the 
              Singapore Armed Forces Special Investigation Branch raided Loh's shop, 
              where they seized another firing pin from the premises.<br><br>Loh told the authorities that she had bought the M16 firing pins from an unknown seller and had intended to re-sell them.<br><br>The plump, fair-complexioned woman will be sentenced on Thursday.<br><br>For selling the firing pin, Loh can be jailed up to three years and fined S$10,000.<br><br>And for having the component without a license, she can be jailed up to three years and fined a maximum of S$5,000.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>

Thats why I wanted to change the topic title (which I did not put) and exclude the part where it says "Outside buy to replace". I am just wondering that it is a bit funny that losing a little pin will land you into 3 years jail after all the time you work hard (2 years) and especially for reservice and all where you are bound to lose such stuff. 2 years is already a sacrifice and imagine spending 3 years in prison just for a bloody pin???</p></div>
