              <p>Your friend will wear the no.3 AF uniform. He may even be allowed to wear civilian clothes while at HQ RSAF until he is permanently posted. Most likely he will be a clerk. He will either stay at HQ RSAF permanently, or be a document/registry clerk at an airbase HQ or be a CO's Personal Assistant at a flying squadron. Those are the main kinds of AF clerk positions. I believe (they say so anyway) that they will try to post you to an airbase that is not too inconvenient for you. However it depends on other factors too, especially the manning situation at the various bases. For example if one of the squadron PAs is ORDing, there is usually only one or two of them at each squadron so "die die must replace" even if it's a long way from your home. Especially if you are well-educated and are able to handle all the clerk duties by yourself. Alternatively if there are few urgent openings but many new clerks, maybe they will let you sit at HQ and do nothing for a few weeks.</p>
              <p>HQ RSAF (if it is still the same as 5 years ago) is really slack for people "in transition" i.e. who are waiting postings to other units. They don't give you work and just make you sit in the corner and be quiet and read books or whatever. 8-5 stay out of course. Basically they want to pretend that you're not there, so just be quiet, greet officers, don't do anything that makes them waste their time on you.</p>

              <p>I would say just wear something nice for your first day and see what others are wearing. Short sleeved shirt, dark coloured slacks. Something like what no. 3 looks like. Also no need to be botak. Just basically look how you would look for work at an office job - neat hair, clean and proper clothes, shaved. If everyone else is more relaxed, well you only have to be that way until 5, then you can wear something else the next day.</p>
              <p>That's one thing about AF, compared to other services and vocations you will be surrounded by a lot more regulars. So the atmosphere tends to be more like a workplace. Also if you are a clerk in that environment, remember that you are dealing with people's careers, don't go and give your CO the wrong meeting file and then he looks like a cock in front of all the other COs!</p>

              <p>If your friend is posted to HQ RSAF permanently, they used to have buses that go to most parts of Singapore, like school buses. The monthly fee is quite cheap. I also remember that they were trying to encourage car-pooling and other things like that. Otherwise, hope he gets posted to Sembawang Air Base, that is probably the closest one for him.</p>
              <p>And meeting minutes are easy, the worst one I remember was writing the Squadron RO because my CO was the very "on" kind who wanted to pretend that it was a real magazine. Always made me search the Intranet for interesting stories and notices to make the thing like 10 pages long.</p>

              <p>If your friend is posted to HQ RSAF permanently, they used to
              have buses that go to most parts of Singapore, like school buses.
              The monthly fee is quite cheap. I also remember that they were
              trying to encourage car-pooling and other things like that.
              Otherwise, hope he gets posted to Sembawang Air Base, that is
              probably the closest one for him.</p>
              <p>And meeting minutes are easy, the worst one I remember was
              writing the Squadron RO because my CO was the very "on" kind who
              wanted to pretend that it was a real magazine. Always made me
              search the Intranet for interesting stories and notices to make the
              thing like 10 pages long.</p>

              <p>Your friend will wear the no.3 AF uniform. He may even be allowed to wear civilian clothes while at HQ RSAF until he is permanently posted. Most likely he will be a clerk. He will either stay at HQ RSAF permanently, or be a document/registry clerk at an airbase HQ or be a CO's Personal Assistant at a flying squadron. Those are the main kinds of AF clerk positions. I believe (they say so anyway) that they will try to post you to an airbase that is not too inconvenient for you. However it depends on other factors too, especially the manning situation at the various bases. For example if one of the squadron PAs is ORDing, there is usually only one or two of them at each squadron so "die die must replace" even if it's a long way from your home. Especially if you are well-educated and are able to handle all the clerk duties by yourself. Alternatively if there are few urgent openings but many new clerks, maybe they will let you sit at HQ and do nothing for a few weeks.</p>
              <p>HQ RSAF (if it is still the same as 5 years ago) is really slack for people "in transition" i.e. who are waiting postings to other units. They don't give you work and just make you sit in the corner and be quiet and read books or whatever. 8-5 stay out of course. Basically they want to pretend that you're not there, so just be quiet, greet officers, don't do anything that makes them waste their time on you.</p>

              <p>Will - yes it is possible, but you have to go for a certain course that very few will get selected for. During my time, maybe 1 out of 50 NSF clerks at my base would ever become 3SG.</p>
