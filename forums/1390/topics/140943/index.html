            <div class='col-md body'>I took this from <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com" rel="nofollow">www.talkingcock.com</a> forum, someone actually posted it in a local forum!!!!  Kip... here's your letter.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Dear CAF (Chief Of Air Force) MG LIM KC,<br><br>I am part of the Air Force marching contigent for NDP 2005 and have been burning numerous saturday to be DRILLED TO PERFECTION. I am very proud to be arrowed for this once a year event celebrating our Nation Independence although I was most unwilling in the beginning because I have to spend an entire Saturday morning to afternoon dedicated to the event. However, my base RSM have assured me that we will all feel very proud when we march at the Padang on the 9th of August. RSM say the feeling on the actual day is like having an Orgasm....<br><br>However, sir, it have never failed me to realise how damn "Buay Song" I am with the Rehearsal organizing committee! I have been to Nee Soon camp for don't know how many bloody saturday when we were told to get there early and ending up having to wait and wait and wait. Whats the bloody point of telling us to reach Paya Lebar Air Base at 10.30am to have a god damn early lunch, draw our SAR21 drill rifle at 11.00, take a private bus to Nee Soon camp and end up having to sit till our butt grow pimple before the actual parade rehearsal starts at 1.30 ~ 2pm? Everyone reach there at 12.30 leh...... so "Efficient". Rush to wait and wait to rush attitude again?<br><br>Sir, actually can make the timing "zun zun" so that the moment we reach Nee Soon camp, we can immediately get DRILLED after 5min of rest. SAF must be a Efficient fighting force mah, simple thing like the timing should get it correct what? Otherwise we sit there lobo 1 hr not only waste our bloody weekend time but also tax payer money leh! I love to be DRILLED but I hate to wait man!<br><br>Than hor, sir I want to highlight this very very big issue that is affecting the morale of the Air Force supporting contigent. We use to have comfortable private bus to fetch us from Paya Lebar Air Base to Nee Soon camp and vice versa. I remember on one of the rehearsal the Parade commander say that Singapore economy this year "Eat Grass" and NDP will have to cut budget but quality will be still there, I thought this is not my problem. Bloody Hell, the next few parade rehearsal we end up having old SBS bus picking us up! Sir, you never take public transport before (and never will) you never know how inadequte is the leg space on SBS Bus is. Our knees are literally pressing on the back of the seat in front of us, not to mention the SAR21 rifle taking away some of the leg space too. I think only Frodo or Yoda will find the seat comfortable. Man.... this not only affect morale but also affect out knee cap leh. Sir, I know you seldom or maybe have never been DRILLED in life but you must know our knee cap very precious one leh! Wait cannot march how? Somemore normal days still have to do Aircraft work leh. I think SAF should give the private bus company a chance lah.... nowadays government almost monopolise the transport market till private bus company "Pai Tan Jia", we should just give private bus a go. Win win situation mah, help them earn money and boost the economy and also help to boost our morale!<br><br>Lastly ah Sir, I want to complain one last thing. After going through 2-3 round of parade rehearsal at Nee Soon camp, its time to go home. Ka ni na, we all very good soldier....report for parade sharply but when its time to go home keep on dragging and dragging....the bus keep on coming late...sometime have to wait Bloody 2 hrs long! Where got such thing one SIR? Its like lending money right? I lend you money, you return me promptly than next time I will be willing to lend you again mah..... Don't keep us back too late next time ok?<br><br>Thank you sir for reading my letter. Hope you don't feel offended by the way I write cause I only diploma engineering and only a 2nd Sar-Germ. If I knew earlier on huh, I would have study very very very hard, go university, get an SAF scholarship and end up working with you up there with gold bar, gold crab and gold star. Maybe can even be Chief of Air force leh...mai xiao xiao hor.... ha ha. All the best to your work<br><br>Your sincere,<br>2SG XXXXXX<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Comments by a forumites there :<br><br>"Outstanding soldier... You really can make it.<br>Kudos for being the thinking soldier that we want all our people to be."<br><br>"THIS MESSAGE HAVE REACHED THE EARS OF AIR FORCE CHIEF WARRENT OFFICER AND CAUSE QUITE A STIR IN THE AIRFORCE"<br><br>"Dear Chief of Armed Force,<br><br>There has been an e-mail that was forwarded to MIW.com that causes a huge stir in the air force community and eventually it also reach the ears of our marching contingent. I would not like to emphasis on that particular e-mail cause I am sure you have read it numerous times and hopefully laugh about that idiot.<br><br>I too have my grudges against the NDP organizing community. I too did not volunteer for this once in a year event celebrity our national birthday/independence. I am loyal to my country and of course love everything Singapore about it FOOD, PEOPLE, LIFESTYLE blar blar blar.<br><br>Now I just like to highlight an issue during the NDP parade practice at Nee Soon camp that have left me and others pretty furious about such lack of Professionalism and Care for soldier attitude display by the Parade community.<br><br>It was the last rehearsal for the day and my marching contingent was all ready to put in their best before going home for a well deserved rest. We were all form up at the FUP point ready to march into the parade square when it starts to drizzle. Ok, it was light rain and spirits among the man were still high I guess the parade will still go on. Next the drizzle transform into light rain, and everyone was expecting the parade rehearsal to be cancelled. Light rain becomes normal rain and it shows no sign of subsiding. Our guys are all getting wet in their uniform and the SAR21 rifle was getting a bit slippery, itÂ’s a sure sign that the parade cannot carry on. I beckon to my officer, a captain, shouldnÂ’t we all head for the shelter now? The captain just gave me a Â“Bo PianÂ” or Â“Nothing can be doneÂ” expression.<br><br>The march in carried on upon the first command shouts by the parade RSM, everything goes well despite the rain hitting upon us and drenching our uniform. Next came in the guard of honor in their number 1 uniform, the first time they march in with number 1 uniform after so many rehearsals. Eventually the whole parade was form up, with no incident fortunately. At this moment and rain seems to have subsided. The next thing that happen really really turn me off! I caught a glimpse of one of the parade organizing member sitting up there at the table speaking into the walkie talkie and before speaking into the mike, Â“CAT 1, Parade is cancelled, all trainers please take overÂ”.<br><br>WHAT???!!!! After surviving through the rain, getting our clothes wet, risking our SAR21 rifle of corrosion, enduring a few lightning strike and thunder claps earlier on in the open, now than they tell us all parade is cancelled? IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CANCELLED EARLIER ON when its already raining! I can only come to the conclusion that the organizing members are just too eager to look at the whole parade form up in Full uniform for the first time, especially the Guard Of Honor. Are they planning to take a NICE picture of the parade form up? Do the officers up there need to go by SOP and wait for an Official CAT 1 announcement to be made before they cancel the parade? Where is the judgment? Even my Captain knows that the parade should not have carried on earlier on but he is real powerless at that moment. This incident seriously affects the moral of our guys that day and it again display to us, specialists WOSE, the lack of professionalism for some of the Officers (YES I AM PARTICULARLY REFERING TO THE ONES SITTING UP THERE AND WATCHING THE SHOW). Luckily the lightning did not strike the flag party who was dangerously holding on to a tall object that was pointed at one endÂ…<br><br>Cpl Chin Buay Song"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i know how they feel. i was there on one saturday operating the gate letting the buses in. the reason for waiting so long for the parade rehearsal to start is because not all the contingents comes at the same time. me and my men also waited a long time for the buses to come. someimes, waited 1 hour just for 1, 2 buses to come.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>army GOH, air force and navy people are always the first to arrive. the people that always make us wait are usually the civilians.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
