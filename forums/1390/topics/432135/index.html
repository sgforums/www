              </p><p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; background: white;"><span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">Hi Forum members</span></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><br> <br> <span>I have a question here and I hope someone could
              provide me with an answer, thanks in advance.</span><br> <br> <span>I received some information, but don't know how
              true is it that a highly post employee in my company actually altered the rank
              status in his NS certificate from Corporal to Captain when he first came for
              interview 10 years back in order to add stakes to his resume and secure himself
              the job. Actually sounds possible if you use the correct tools to alter the
              short form of Corporal CPL to the short form of Captain CPT. he just need to
              delete away the horizontal part of the capital L and input a horizontal line on
              top to make it a T, there you go, from CPL, he became a CPT. And he always proudly
              announced in the meeting that he was an EX Captain in SCDF, but I always wonder
              why an EX SCDF Captain speaks such poor Singlish and acted unprofessionally as
              if he's only Primary 6 educated, I'm sorry, I should say even a Primary 6
              educated person could speaks or handle things better than him, trust me.</span><br> <br> <span>This highly post employee is a nightmare to all my
              fellow colleagues in the company. He always eliminate people who doesn't know
              or practices the art of apple polishing (carry balls or po lan pa) by finding
              fault with them and terminate their service whenever possible. I myself is a
              victim.</span><br> <br> <span>If I can proved that he's really only a Corporal
              in SCDF, I will then have the power and evidence to expose his shameful act to
              the top management as well as the authority. He will not only losses his job,
              he will also be facing jail terms for altering government documents.</span><br> <br> <span>This could save many innocent people in my company
              who doesn't know or practices apple polishing from being eliminated by this
              shameful idiot.</span><br> <br> <span>So friends, after reading the above, spread the
              news around and help me to find a way to confirm the actual rank of this idiot
              in SCDF and I believe, you have done a good deed by doing so. Saving many
              people from losing their job.</span><br> <br> <span>If you find it inconvenient to post a reply here,
              you may also send me an email to my yahoo mail</span><span> </span><span><a href="mailto:justicetaker@yahoo.com"><span style="color: #003399;">justicetaker@yahoo.com</span></a></span><br> <br> <span>Hope to receive some positive replies. </span><br> <br> <span>Yours Sincerely</span><br> <br> </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">Justice

              <p>That completion cert is one of the most useless pieces of merit you could ever receive, coz its just proof you finished NS(active).</p>
              <p>Ask around how many active nsfs get promoted all the way to CPT first, don't even mention SCDF, police, or saf. Maybe when you ROD, and get one more cert, I might be inclined to believe.</p>
