Just because the poor guy got depression during ns (maybe his parents passed away or something) he'll be stigmatised for life? Then the employer must be damn unreasonable... </blockquote>Why unreasonable? Treatable &amp; curable are 2 separate things. The likelihood is that the person would've displayed unpredictable behavior even before he got enlisted (withdrawal, truancy, anti-social, unmotivated, etc.), to the extent of regularly seeing a shrink on the side too.<br><br>As a illness, you don't "suddenly" get depressive, nor is it "suddenly" curable. It's not certifiable (or downgradable) based on hearsay either; there must be persuasive evidence that it's led to prior abnormal behavior that renders him ineffective to serve NS. &amp; it's gonna be a lifelong condition too, affecting future employment prospects cuz the distressed person can't consistently cope well with daily activities.<br><br>Depression is basically a "mental illness" but not Woodbridge-psychotic like schizophrenia. Rather, it shares the uncontrollable feelings afflicting those suffering from anxiety/eating disorders or obsessive compulsive disorder. No doubt, a coward can keng all he want, except it's self-defeatingly delusional to leave medical notes on record &amp; then try to persuade future employers that they're all false.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know NS life is no joke.... I remember when I was in BMT a small part of me was continually hoping for a service injury that would allow me to downgrade honourably.<br><br>Eventually I decided not to be a fool who sits down and hopes for a 'million-dollar wound' that was light enough to not debillitate me too seriously yet serious enough to allow me to downgrade. Since I was already in NS, doing all this sh*t which I don't want to do if I had a choice, I might as well try to make the best out of it. As the Tekong specs would say, face it like a man and knock it down.<br><br>I'm not trying to preach, and I'm not trying to aggrandize myself. What I'm trying to say is that there is little honour in trying to chao keng and escape all this difficulty and hardship.<br><br>If you really have to downgrade due to some debillitating injury/ condition/ illness, so be it. If that's the case, then it can't be helped. At least that's an honourable way to downgrade.<br><br>But finding a way to downgrade when you're fit and healthy.... there's no honour in that at all.<br><br>My two cents' worth to this issue...
