Doesn't mean you have to draw weopons or fire one right?  You can be the guy in charge of delivering food, tents, tables and other stuff.<br><br>And if you say during war time how?  Then I will tell you this, if war time come, and you have to wear a uniform, I think for your own sake better draw a weopon anyway, excused or otherwise.  Besides, when war breaks out, I think the PES system and such all gets thrown out the window unless you seriously pai ka, pai chew.<br><br>No need to get all worked up.</div>

I was just pointing out that being excused firing a weopon doesn't stop one from being able to draw a weopon and ammo.  So your context for your comment?
