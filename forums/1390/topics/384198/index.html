              <p>There is still a low chance of tekong leadership batch intake.</p>
              <p>Mono-intake refers to directly posting to a combat vocation and stuck there for 2 full years with very low chance of getting into command school when most who go tekong has a high chance of command school.</p>

              <p>Hi shadez,</p>
              <p>I believe that dkcx give such an advice so that you will avoid entering the mono-intake batches. Some Poly/JC dropouts believe that they will be fine in mono-intake units, only to receive a "culture shock" after they have entered them. </p>

              <p>I believe the others have mentioned most of what i want to say and lastly, if you would like to be a commander like a sgt or officer, poly dip or A's cert gives you a much better chance of being sent to tekong leadership BMT.</p>

              <p>I think you make a mistake thinking that enlistment to the start of BMT is a swift and quick process. However, typically it ,may take up to 6 ~ 8  months before you are shaved your hair. So you will be wasting more time waiting for enlistment, then later on waste another period for re-entry to poly. So I encourage to do part-time and deferred NS. </p>

              <p>haha i think there're lots of people here so confused they're on the verge of being clinically schizophrenic.<br><br>I always read here the jealous grumbles and whines of low ranking people, and how they bitch about officers giving work while not doing the work and these low ranking ppl would glorify and uplift themselves as some sort of diligent and self sacrificing heroes that do all the work there is to do in SAF.</p>
              <p>And then other times, you will see the same group of people saying it's THEY who get to relax and enjoy life, from NS to reservist, while it's the commanders who don't.<br><br>Schizo? or just plain convenient? make up your mind on your story already.<br><br>you pretend to be something and conveniently switch accordingly depending on the agenda of your complaints against the establishment.</p>

              <p>btw your reasoning is totally illogical. it's fine and dandy to experience good and bad times, that's the case for most things - a mixture of good and bad. It's not logically possible for the same group of sample, to take on opposing positions. It defies logic. You can't be yellow and not yellow at the same time. The only explanation is just that you're shifting.</p>
