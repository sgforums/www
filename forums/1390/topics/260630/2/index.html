On and off you see something flashing on you're tv, that's the code words for each unit/company/camp.If you're still servcing NS, you are required to report to your camp within an hr. For NS mens, have to report within 8 hrs. If lucky, sign and go, if not, stay in camp and wait for instructions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;&gt;On and off you see something flashing on you're tv, that's the code words for each unit/company/camp&lt;&lt;<br><br>That's mobilisation manning, or mob manning.<br><br>"Standby" refers to standby forces. Every active unit, once everybody has been posted in, will train together to be ops-ready. Gradually from COY to BN level, in the form of field exercises &amp; then formal proficiency tests. The latter results will dictate REDCON (Readiness Condition) status -- REDCON ONE being the highest grade -- &amp; the unit becomes ops-ready as a result. It will re-train for the same tests during the second year of NS, &amp; also during every in-camp during reservist.<br><br>Every ops-ready unit will rotate to do standby, usually contributing a COY (or equivalent) &amp; on a weekly basis (before passing the turn to another unit COY). During this particular week, the COY shall be literally ready for war. Everything from fullpacks to stores to tools to ammo is loaded up, &amp; the vehicles parked for immediate moveout (but otherwise surrounded by barb wire &amp; guarded by sentries when in camp). Standby troops have to be in uniform, even when sleeping. The overall mood tends to be quite jumpy throughout because commanders, both internal &amp; external, like to test for reactions by occasionally ("suddenly") activating the men. Once such commands come down, there'll be lots of shouting as everyone rushes to the armskote &amp; then down to the standby park to start up the vehicles!<br><br>Weekends are burnt; ditto holidays if they fall during that week. My whole unit kena standby during CNY in 1987, in fact. Charlie BTY was the standby force for the whole week, but my CO didn't want them to miss all the festivities. So Alpha BTY replaced Charlie on CNY eve (&amp; thus missed out on reunion dinners at home). Bravo then booked in on CNY first day to take over (&amp; missed out visiting relatives). Charlie returned on CNY second day after getting the 2 days off, &amp; continued standing by (inc. the weekend later in the week).<br><br>Reservists also do standby (same preparations), but together with field training (which is 90% of the time during ICT). I suppose Mob Manning (both active &amp; reservist) is also part of standby, but those who're recalled are more like the second-tier of standby forces.<br><br>I can remember one episode when the standby forces were activated for real, but not for battle. It happened during the Hotel New World collapse, when one of the NSF Combat Engineers units was first to arrive on the scene. Goes to show that standby personnel are ready for anything.</div>
