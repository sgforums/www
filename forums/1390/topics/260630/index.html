You will need to adapt to the sudden changes from a typical comfortable environment to a very disciplined environment. You will only have restricted times where to can get to do your own things (Eg: admin time) which there will be around 1-2 hours daily depends on your company wellfare. Most of the us including myself will not be able to sleep for the first few nights because of the "culture shock". But you will not be alone. Get along well with your bunkmates/platoon mates you will forsure enjoy life in BMT.</span><br><br>i also not very sure how long NS will last and how's the food ar?<br><span style="color: red;"><br>Food is good. But not that good as compare to Safti <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></span><br><br>i am also abit scared and my father is like very worried about me going true NS because alot of cases on army like drowning and so on.<br><br><span style="color: red;">No worries, cases like this are rare. Your OC, PR, and PS will make sure that all trainings are conducted safely. There are more and more safety precaution these days. If you not feeling well, just report sick. But dun do it too often, or you might be "mark" by your PS or PC and they will make your life miserable if they think that you are trying to "Keng" (means to escape training by pretending to be sick often)</span><br><br>but no choice i will still be going but 1st year what will we be doing? i only know BMT is the toughest i think?<br><br><span style="color: red;"><br><br>BMT = NAFA TEST, PULL UPS in Between Meals, Physcial Training, IMT, RANGE, ROAD MARCHES, ENDURANCE RUN, SWIMMING, STAND BY BED/BUNK/UNIVERSE,<br>AREA CLEANING, 5 BX, FIELD CAMPS, SIT TEST, GRENADE THROW, STANDARD OBSTICLE COURSE (SOC), RIFLE DRILLS, BCCT, SIGN EXTRAS, GUARD DUTY, MARCHING, SINGING, and last of all all the recruits look forward to end of week is BOOKING OUT.<br><br>BMT is not the toughest, infact it Depends on the unit and vocation you are posted to. Unless its clerical work. Most of the units outside BMT are alot tougher. Example SISPEC: its just BMT + alot of advance leadership course + physical demanding test. All I can say is BMT is the period where you can use it to get use to the army culture and be prepared for the SIONGness in your future unit. OCS is very siong for as for me to say. </span><br></div></blockquote>I hope all these clear your doubts alittle bit.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

For ur benefit:-<br><br>First day = Admin day AKA get ur army stuff, bunk arrangements, hair cut, etc. Ususally, perceived as a stress day but in fact it is one of the the most "zhuo bo" day during BMT<br><br>First month = U getting used to army life AKA regementation. Also where u learned to know things like "do it yourself". Ok, to those who haben served may think "aiyah, no problem one". But all I can say "BE PREPARED" (especially for those who have maids and those who like to be spoonfed).<br><br>NS tour now 2 years. After u complete, u have to go back now and then for training also known as reservist/ICT.<br><br>Food generally ok, menu is rotated everyday served by outsourced company.<br><br>Training wise, generally quite ok unless you or your superiors ignored the safety aspect then any training is potentially dangerous. Same as everyday life, just like you don't walk in the middle of the expressway when you know there is pedestrian path.<br><br>Generally, after BMT around 3 mths, u will be posted to your vocation in your new unit. Where your training will continue. The only difference  is training in your new unit is usually more focus on your vocation AKA what kind of soldier are you (such as combat engineers, medics, infantry, etc). In which u will served for the rest of the 2 years.<br><br>The only thing I can advise you is to dropped the spoon fed mentality that the current schools have cultivated. Also begin to realised that everything in this world unfair and you deserved to get unfair treatment as well.<br><br>Because SAF isn't a place where you are going to get fair treatment . You must take things with a pinch of salt/close one eye/etc. If you go in with a mindset of how SAF should operates and found out everything isn't, I can guarantee plus chop, you are going to be sad and miserable during your NS.<br><br></div>
