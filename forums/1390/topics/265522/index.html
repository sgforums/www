But look at the result with US army Jessica Lynn, Her convoy was  lost an attack her companion were killed in shootout.  As for her rifle were jam and she did not fire. I am sure there are a lot more FUBAR than the stories.<br><br>So for SAF keep having this idea that support is only for the sick n weak will have serious consequences both for the men n operation.<br><br></div>
