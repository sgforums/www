              <p>Hi, this is the situation which I am pretty puzzled about.</p>
              <p>I am currently vocationally trained as a GE storeman and I have L5S1 Degenerated Disc Diease and I have been downgraded since Sept last year.</p>
              <p>Lately, during a Overseas FFI, which I have failed, the MO who failed me mentioned that my condition is serious and wonders why am I a storeman when I have a diploma.</p>
              <p>I am under a tyrant RQ. He wrote an Excused Heavy Loads MC for 3 months for me to pass it to my QM then highlighted to me that if I am still being forced to carry loads of more than 5kg at any one time I am to feedback to him that my QM is not obeying orders.</p>
              <p>As for my QM, he still puts me on jobs that requires moving of heavy objects like SAF cupboards and drawers, and simply just tell me to watch my back without re-allocating me to do jobs that are free of physical loads.</p>
              <p>I then feedback to the MO about this and he told me that actually for my condition I should be "C9L3 Permanently Excused Heavy Loads" permanently rather than just C9L3 because C9L3 still consist of other conditions not limiting to the spine. He then said to me that there might have been a mistake over at Tekong medical centre when the MOIC downgraded me and forgotten to add in a permanent status.</p>
              <p>He then told me to get a stronger-worded memo from my specialist the next round and told me to put the word permanently into the memo so that he can answer to his MOIC.</p>
              <p>Also, he told me that with this he can help me to be revoked to be a clerk.</p>
              <p>How true is this? It really happened, and I got the letter already but I am constantly wondering has God sent an angel to SAF?</p>

              <p>It maybe true, because, with the new letter, the MB can advice for you to be revocated also include the excuse heavy load. As for is it the MOIC fault not to add in the excuse heavy load maybe yes maybe no, because MOs had no power where you'll be revocate. So even with the added excuse heavy load and revocate, you maybe revocated but as a clerk? No one can be sure.</p>
