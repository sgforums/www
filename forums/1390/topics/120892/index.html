Salary wise (sorry it is a stipend), you will have rank pay + vocational allowance.  It will most likely be 8 to 5 bue depnedent on unit requirements. As to which camp, it is kind of like a luck thing.<br><br>Your colleagues will be most likely a mix of people. so learn to work with everyone.<br><br>Yes you can be upgraded if your PES status is temp. you will be put up for medical board.<br><br>Some ppl will look down on PES E people by your attitude should be be proud of the whole thing... dun be discouraged.</div>
