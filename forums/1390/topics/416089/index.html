              <p>You do not need to be super muscular or fit to get Pes A.</p>
              <p>You just need to be of a healthy weight and have no health problems.</p>
              <p>Some of the common reasons for Pes B are:</p>
              <p>1) Having a crooked back (Even slightly crooked counts)</p>
              <p>2) Wearing specs and having more than 250 degrees</p>
              <p>3) Previous injuries (Arm dislocated, leg dislocated...) </p>
              <p>4) Health issues (Asthma, skin problem...)</p>
