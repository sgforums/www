              <p>(my 1st post here,so do correct me for any etiquette not followed ^^)</p>
              <p>Do bear with me cos it's gonna be a rather long n complex story..</p>
              <p>I'm a private A'lvl student who's gonna sit for the A's in the coming month &amp; enlist thereafter (date still not confirmed).</p>
              <p>I quit my JC at the start of this yr to come to my current private skl,cos of some personal probs.I took PW last yr &amp; did get an A,so at least the 1 yr in my JC wasn't in vain.But I had to defer under my new skl's name in January,which MINDEF rejected,so for a while back in February or so,I was liable for enlistment any moment :/</p>
              <p>Went for check up at CMPB in March,got Temporary PES A.after which I asked the counter staff when I would be enlisted.she said approximately 6-8 months from now.I was like wtf???like that then might as well complete my A's &amp; not rot at home till enlistment..</p>
              <p>So I went back to my private skl to resume my A's prep course.I'm still here &amp; now it is without a doubt that I would be able to sit for all my papers.my enlistment might have been further delayed due to me getting PES D in around June for some heart probs?Had to make another trip to CMPB &amp; the med officer said the left side of my heart is straight (yes sir..and my right side is gay =.=) So yea,I got referred to a private hospital which I went &amp; the doctor said there's nothing wrong with my heart (another =.=)</p>
              <p>That trip to the hospital was way back in early Sept,&amp; I haven't heard from MINDEF at all about my definitive PES status or whatsoever.which is why I said earlier that I'm confident that I would be able to take all my A'level papers.</p>
              <p>But the part that worries me is during my 1st trip to CMPB the lady who facilitated my registration put my education status as 'dropout',since I sort of withdrew temporarily from my private skl as I thought I could get enlisted any moment &amp; it was just apt that I physically prepared myself beforehand.</p>
              <p>But thing is,I want to get into OCS.Even if my physical fitness is not up to standard yet,I still do wanna give it a go since I've taken leadership roles back in my skl days &amp; thoroughly enjoy those experiences.</p>
              <p>So,how would all these affect me?Would they put me in a bmt batch with some other 'dropouts' &amp; such?apparently to get into ocs/sispec u have to go through SIT Test which is only applicable for those JC/poly batch?to be honest I would very much like to be enlisted in one of the JC batches since I would sit for A'levels just like them &amp; get the cert.</p>
              <p>&amp; what if I enlist way earlier before I get my cert next March?say Dec or Jan?how would I convince them that I have indeed sat for the A'levels &amp; am therefore eligible for command skl?</p>
              <p>I know I shouldn't be fretting too much now but after the A's this issue would become so very real.&amp; I dun want to be left out for a shot at becoming a commissioned officer just because of some misunderstanding that the highest education level I have is the O'lvl cert..</p>
              <p>Appreciate if u took ur time to read through all this cos right now,I'm feeling like crap just thinking about it.</p>

              You are right at what you are thinking. 
              
              You will be considered as a O level holder and immediately be ready for enlisted. You cannot deferred as you would have passed the deferment age. Whether it is poly, A, ITE dropout, they are all considered under the O/N level batch. Usually they belong to the mono-intake batch. Private education may not be recognized by the mindef.
              
              Yeap, you think too much, just serve and f off.

              <p>you will be registered together with the 'dropouts' as long as you are not from a government school.</p>
              <p>The rare cases i seen are those singaporeans who returned from overseas. But then, they enlist after they graduate with a high school diploma. You on the other hand, will not have any cert at hand at point of enlistment, so i think very highly you will be classed as 'dropout'.</p>
              <p>and if they send you enlistment notice, then most likely everything fixed liao, cannot change.</p>
              <p>However, if you still had not gotten your enlistment notice after receiving your cert next yr, maybe you could try updating CMPB, and perhaps they can then do something about it.</p>

              <p>?????you actually dont really cut it for any command school presently.go get a science degree and then think about being in ocs and scs.for now you should be classed under o levels..and why u need to be a commander ocs etc when you arent fit?</p>
              <p>but then cmpb dont put u as a dropout unless you didnt give them the documents for your o levels.and why and how did you get classified info from cmpb about your data as a dropout??all these are not supposed to be revealed to you at all!</p>

              <p>Thanks for the advice guys.I sent MINDEF an email concerning this issue.Not expecting much though..From my experience they rarely see things with human empathy,always going by the book and being anal about everything and all..</p>
              <p>@hitman - well,when I was at my 1st medical check-up at CMPB,the staff that attended me at the front counters assisted in my registration.I explained to her my situation but since back then I had temporarily withdrawn from my private school,she put my education status as 'dropout'.saw it with my own eyes man..</p>
              <p>And I'm not so unfit bah.For now since I've been mugging like no tmr,I admit my fitness level has dropped a lot actually..</p>
              <p>@deathmaster - as long as I ain't from govt school?Whoa,I believe that's pretty discriminatory against private education when there are proper facilities and capable qualified teachers in these schools who can teach as good or even better than the public school teachers..My physics teacher here is really quite good.But well..this is Singapore</p>
              <p>And is it true SISPEC only need O'level?Or does it once again depend on whether u mono-intake or tekong?</p>
              <p>@lokey - Haha.Well yea,at first I also thought about just getting over and done with these 2 years which won't even help me with my future career (unless it is in the SAF of course..) But then again,I do have my reasons for wanting to go to OCS so much.It's the experience and camaraderie I'd forge there that I believe most other units can't give you.Correct me if I'm wrong there.And of course,the money is a plus,but I'd probably save it all for my tertiary education anyways..</p>

              <p>No, it is not true. To get into command school you have to have a minimal A-levels or diploma. Going to Tekong for your BMT does not garauntee that you have a chance to go for command schools. I've had some O-level mates during my time there.</p>

              <p>There is an exception. PHD (Poly halfway dropouts) gets to go tekong. Jc-dropouts different matter. phd will have chance to make it to spec at best.</p>
              <p>if you are pes C, you will also go tekong, since there is no other place with pes C intake. But the downside is, for pes C, you will <strong>never</strong> qualify for ocs or sispec. But for the few fortunate ones, they might end up in vocations such as technicians, storeman, driver etc, where you get ur 3sg rank with experience.</p>
