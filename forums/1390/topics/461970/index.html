              medical examination at the Medical Classification Centre (MCC)
              within the Central Manpower Base (CMPB). This examination allows
              the medical fitness of a pre-enlistee to be assessed and this
              subsequently determines his Physical Employment Status (PES).<br> <br> <strong>Medical Screening Appointment Preparations</strong><br> <br> As part of the e-documentation, you are also required to select
              your preferred medical appointment date as well as to complete the
              medical questionnaire (e7F). You will need to go through the
              medical questionnaire form with your parents / guardian so that
              useful medical information about you is captured.<br> <br> To ensure that your medical experience with us is pleasant and that
              the overall screening process is not unnecessarily delayed, we have
              compiled a checklist for you:<br> <br></span></p>
              <ol>
