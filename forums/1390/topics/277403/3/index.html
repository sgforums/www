Problem is, more work just kept piling up and the quality expected of us increased too. There is a limit to all this of course, I mean, at times we were expected to do the impossible and stupid us did it.<br><br>Then it came to a point when we all decided it would stop. We told our officers very clearly what we would do and the quality of work we will provide, nothing more, nothing less. By then, of course we had a good track record so we could negotiate that way. Funny thing is, the last platoon did the least work, got the least work, and no one said anything.<br><br>The 2 platoons who could work were simply given more to do and the 1 that couldn't, well, doesn't really matter does it?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The thing is, if you just show outright that you're not gonna get the work done, chances are they'll give you less work. They won't appreciate it if you keep meeting or exceeding their expectations, so don't. If you feel guilty about not being able to provide quality work, there are plenty of reasons why you shouldn't. </span><br><br>And yes, in the Army, rank wins all. So unless someone else with a higher rank is willing to shield you, don't bother arguing.</div></blockquote>True.  I have a senior who always disappears frm office and does as little work as possible.  He does this so often that the superiors have more or less come to accept that he is like this.</div>

In other words they exploit loopholes in the system n when its found out during checks we kana deep trouble (being charged, xtras etc)  espeically us NSF who r doing work for them.  I m doing this now n apparaently wad i m doing is found out. Seriously i hope not to get into trouble haiz  damn worried now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
