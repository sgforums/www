            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, it may seem counter-intuitive, but do less work.<br><br>During my time, 2 platoons, mine and another did a hell lot of work for everyone, and we did it well. Problem is, more work just kept piling up and the quality expected of us increased too. There is a limit to all this of course, I mean, at times we were expected to do the impossible and stupid us did it.<br><br>Then it came to a point when we all decided it would stop. We told our officers very clearly what we would do and the quality of work we will provide, nothing more, nothing less. By then, of course we had a good track record so we could negotiate that way. Funny thing is, the last platoon did the least work, got the least work, and no one said anything.<br><br>The 2 platoons who could work were simply given more to do and the 1 that couldn't, well, doesn't really matter does it?<br><br>The thing is, if you just show outright that you're not gonna get the work done, chances are they'll give you less work. They won't appreciate it if you keep meeting or exceeding their expectations, so don't. If you feel guilty about not being able to provide quality work, there are plenty of reasons why you shouldn't.<br><br>And yes, in the Army, rank wins all. So unless someone else with a higher rank is willing to shield you, don't bother arguing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Othello_Red:</div><div class="quote_body">Seriously, it may seem counter-intuitive, but do less work.<br><br>During my time, 2 platoons, mine and another did a hell lot of work for everyone, and we did it well. Problem is, more work just kept piling up and the quality expected of us increased too. There is a limit to all this of course, I mean, at times we were expected to do the impossible and stupid us did it.<br><br>Then it came to a point when we all decided it would stop. We told our officers very clearly what we would do and the quality of work we will provide, nothing more, nothing less. By then, of course we had a good track record so we could negotiate that way. Funny thing is, the last platoon did the least work, got the least work, and no one said anything.<br><br>The 2 platoons who could work were simply given more to do and the 1 that couldn't, well, doesn't really matter does it?<br><br>The thing is, if you just show outright that you're not gonna get the work done, chances are they'll give you less work. They won't appreciate it if you keep meeting or exceeding their expectations, so don't. If you feel guilty about not being able to provide quality work, there are plenty of reasons why you shouldn't.<br><br>And yes, in the Army, rank wins all. So unless someone else with a higher rank is willing to shield you, don't bother arguing.</div></blockquote>Good points raised.<br><br></div>
