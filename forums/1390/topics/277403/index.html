            <div class='col-md body'>haiz i m working under a regular (SSG) whom in my opinion CMI....Always talk big, qn ppl, n give those kind of look u wana punch.<br><br>I was given so little training in wad i am supposed to do, in fact i am doing the actual stuff while learning and of course i m bound to make mistakes etc. N when it happen he explodes, questioning me n scolding me. There was even once my colleague parents when to screw the regular. I have been working overtime to meet the demands n when i call him after office hrs to ask him soemthing, he argued back,saying why i always give him so much trouble even after office hrs...<br><br>This is it, i am not going to suffer like a dog, there are several times i almost wanted to explode n argue back but i held back. I was wondering should i vent it out. Seriously i still got until MAY 2008, do i need to show him i m not a person to be easily taken advantage of?</div>
