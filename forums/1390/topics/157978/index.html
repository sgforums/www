We are not allowed to bring our weapons to a public area, unless we are passing through, enroute to an exercise area. That's why I remember our instructors reminding us to hand in our weapons before going moving out of camp. Some reservists friends of mine were charged for leaving their weapon in the boot of the car and driving out to the hawker centre to eat.
