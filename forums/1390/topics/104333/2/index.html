            <div class='col-md body'>During BMT fieldcamp, rained 7 out of 7 days. on the 5th day night, due to some delay we reached the new camp site only at 11pm, the weather looked clear so our sergeants think we need not pitch basha since it was late. we laid ground sheet and slept.<br><br>at 3am+, it rained heavily with high winds blowing, i was in reclaimed land, we really shivered cold and can't sleep. Slowly, we congregated and lit all the remainining solid fuel we had left.... also cooking milo and other hot drinks. we gathered round the fire and passed the mess mugs of hot drinks around. we suffered together but in the suffering still could find comfort among us.<br><br>In taiwan during their winter time, the moment we arrive it was sunny but when we reached camp, it just became cloudy and rainy and remained so for the next 2 weeks. During Navex exercise, we braved the rain and cold, though tired we cannot stop as it would mean bringing our body temperature down. Our uniforms are wet at night and sleeping meant shivering all night long. Once again, i was with the same friends that suffered thru the BMT fieldcamp. again, we cooked the combat rations and hot drinks with loads of oranges given by locals. haha.<br><br>Once again, we forge very strong friendship despite testing times.<br><br>When we had our non-tact break after 2 weeks, the sun appeared again it was warm dry. We are so happy to have felt warmth after 2 weeks that we ran out of bunk to their parade square to bask in the sun. haha.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>u took an SQ flight to lancer? and you sounded like you went there all by yourself. </blockquote>Huh? There's usually 3 ways of aerial commute for servicemen: via the C130, via commercial plane "by nominal roll" (i.e. back gate) or, more rarely, via commercial plane by passport.<br><br>I flew commercial (SIA &amp; China Airlines) to Starlight twice later, both "by nominal roll" with the rest of the unit. The infantry BN did the same for Lancer, except for we attached personnel &amp; some senior commanders who checked in normally - with passports - for the same flight. FYI Full access to duty-free shopping during the return trip too, unlike the men who had to order liquor &amp; cigarettes through their RSM.<br><br>My attached Arty group was a hodgepodge of regulars/NSFs (a FSO &amp; TA from W SA, a TA from X SA, a FO from Y SA, plus a full FSO team from Z SA) &amp; I only knew one of them from my SOAY-course days. So, yeah, I guess there was a lot of autonomy. The only thing my unit did was to get a Land Rover to drive me to, inexplicably, the rendezvous camp that was furthest away from Changi Airport! ~lol~<br><br>In fact, I ended up so "latchkey-ed" that I had to fight entirely on my own for the owed off-in-lieu's. The senior officer of that Arty group - one of 2 regular CPTs - verbally agreed to back up everyone's claim for 9.5 days' off (5 Saturdays &amp; 5 Sundays) but failed to follow up on returning. I pleaded in vain for my BC to contact him, while my BC in turn sought to bargain down to 2 days as a "magnanimous internal solution". Things was left in limbo until the unit ORD'd &amp;, as the old bird, I was able to "manipulate" the newly posted-in officers into honoring the quota ~wink~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The most unforgetable: ROC stint during R&amp;R...after a prolong 2 week stint in the field, we thought we were going to at decent hotel but as it turned out we had to stay in a freaking 'Love' Hotel..complete with Heart shaped bed for the 4 of us.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> ..it had a remote to go to vibrating mode too plus the 24 hours all you can watch porn!!!<br><br>Normally that would be damn shiok for a soldier after 2 weeks of never seeing any woman but after seeing some humans doing it with some animals you tend too lean towards the bath tub more and getting yourself cleaned <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Hilarious moment was when the platoon walked into the hotel lobby and scared the shit out of all the ...'patrons'..must think we were a bunch of gays or something LOL!!!<br><br>P.S. We ended up sleeping on the floor looking up at the mirrored ceiling...the bed was too freaky..</div>
