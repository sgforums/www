              <p>if any of the parent dun hold the red passport it doesn't make sense for your cousin to be liable for NS right? since the parents are stilling holding on to their current citizenship, automatically your cousin should have the same citizenship automatically.</p>

              <p>What I suggest is that you ask your cousin to send a query to CMPB or something.</p>
              <p>As kengkia has pointed out, your cousin would be liable for NS only if at least one of his parents is a full citizen. The same goes for my PR friend; as far as I know he was liable only because his mom is a full citizen.</p>
              <p>Of course, we could be wrong, and CMPB/ICA may have changed their rules, so it's best to just ask the people in charge directly.</p>
