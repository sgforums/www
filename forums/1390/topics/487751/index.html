              <p>The Advisory Council on Community Relations in Defence (ACCORD) on 
              Wednesday (Feb 25) announced it has submitted 18 proposals to the 
              Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) aimed at boosting support and recognition 
              for National Service (NS).</p>
              <p>The 18 proposals include initiatives to
               help ease the transition for servicemen returning to school after 
              full-time NS, encourage community organisations and small businesses to 
              show appreciation for those in uniform and strengthen MINDEF's 
              engagement with women's organisations, according to the ministry's press
               release.</p>
              <p>ACCORD also proposed that MINDEF enhance the way it 
              recognises and commends employers, businesses and organisations that go 
              the extra mile to support NS.</p>
              <p>The full list of recommendations:</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Chairman
               of ACCORD and Minister of Social and Family Development Chan Chun Sing 
              said he was encouraged by the council's efforts to engage key 
              stakeholders as well as families to explore ways to boost support for 
              NS.</p>
              <p>“I am heartened by the strong societal support for national 
              defence and NS, and look forward to more of ACCORD’s good work in 
              strengthening collaboration between the community, MINDEF and the SAF," 
              Mr Chan said.</p>

              predicament beyond their control eg. theft, fine, medical bills,

              3338; 6373 3336<br> <br> <strong>The SAF Finance Clinic</strong><br> The Finance Clinic is set up with the aim to assist servicemen who
              are financially distressed. Servicemen in financial distress must
              come forward and they must go through the formal channel of
              declaration before assistance can be rendered. The SFC aims to
              provide debt management to distressed servicemen, so as to mitigate
              their situation from deterioriating into an indebtedness cycle.
              Credit Counselling Singapore (CCS) had been engaged to assess and
              structure the debt management plan. Servicemen who does not meet
              the CCS criteria will be referred back to SFC for other forms of
              help e.g. through welfare grant or loan.</p>

              Al-Fyan Yew bin Abdul Hafiz Yew drew a stable income of about $700
              a month working in sales and was the breadwinner in his family.
              Hence, he was understandably worried when he learnt that his
              monthly NS allowance would be half of what he used to earn.<br> <br> Fortunately, with the intercession of his superiors in the SAF, the
              SAF Personnel Services Centre (SAFPSC) was able to help him through
              SAF Financial Assistance Schemes. Said the supply assistant of
              Supply Hub East: "I’m thankful for the extra $600 that I receive
              every month on top of my regular NS allowance as it has greatly
              contributed to the payment of my family’s bills."<br> <br> 1st Warrant Officer (1WO) Kng Ter Sern, Officer-in-Charge Asset
              Management Team, Pasir Ris Camp, went one step further by following
              up on PTE Yew’s case when his initial Term Financial Assistance
              Scheme expired. Said 1WO Kng: "Caring for our soldiers is one of
              the SAF core values...when Max’s initial financial assistance
              scheme ended in December last year, I conducted a house visit and
              recommended that he receive further financial help from the
              SAF."<br> <br> PTE Yew is just one of many examples of how the welfare schemes
              administered by the SAFPSC have benefitted around 65,000 in-service
              personnel of the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and the SAF, as well
              as Operationally Ready National Servicemen (NSmen).<br> <br> "The SAFPSC’s primary role is to strategise and design welfare
              structures in order to support the SAF’s philosophy on welfare...
              We believe in the virtues of commitment and engagement, and to
              achieve that, we are concerned with the well-being of personnel and
              their families," said Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) (NS) Koa Boon Teck,
              Head of SAFPSC.<br> <br> As secretariat to the SAF Welfare Council, the SAFPSC introduces,
              implements and reviews the proposed welfare schemes and services.
              Its welfare efforts cover five broad areas: health care, work-life
              balance, finance, vacations and insurance.<br> <br> On the SAFPSC's latest efforts in improving welfare support, LTC
              (NS) Koa said: "We want to move away from the mental model of
              welfare as a reactive element, where people subscribe to welfare
              only when they are in need..we felt that there was an impetus to
              changing the image of welfare."<br> <br> Here are some of the latest welfare initiatives spearheaded by the
              SAF Welfare Council and the SAFPSC:<br> <br> <strong>SAF Central Welfare Fund Bursary Awards</strong><br> 2nd Warrant Officer (2WO) Tanusha Tan of Headquarters 9th Division,
              whose 19-year-old daughter, Natasha, received the Bursary Award at
              the polytechnic level worth $1,200 last year, remembers her
              daughter being ecstatic at receiving the notification of her
              successful application.<br> <br> "It was a very good morale booster for Natasha, and it will surely
              further encourage her to do well," added 2WO Tan.<br> <br> Starting from February this year, the award, which is given to the
              children of MINDEF/SAF personnel to recognise their academic
              excellence up to the local degree level, now has a qualifying
              family income cap of $4,000 levied on each level of study, compared
              to the previous staggered qualifying income caps across all levels
              of study. In addition, the quantum awarded for all levels of study,
              less the junior colleges, polytechnics and local universities, has
              been increased.<br> <br> <strong>SAF holidays/ vacation spots</strong><br> The SAF Seaview Resort, Bintan Lagoon Resort &amp; Golf Club, as
              well as the Joondalup Bungalows in Perth, Australia, are examples
              of resorts which recently underwent their first major revamp to
              ensure the highest levels of modernity and aesthetic appeal for
              holiday-makers.<br> <br> More exciting locations have also been added to the stable of SAF
              vacation spots, including the Amara Sanctuary Sentosa, Ascott Kuala
              Lumpur and Club Bali. This means that active servicemen and NSmen
              can enjoy relaxing stays at a wider array of resorts, at exclusive
              prices of up to 60 percent below published rates.<br> <br> In addition, a new travel portal will soon be introduced to allow
              MINDEF/SAF personnel and NSmen greater flexibility, choice and cost
              savings when booking rooms, airfares, car rental and even travel
              insurance when they go on vacations. Named Free Independent Travel,
              the interactive and user-friendly one-stop portal will be launched
              tentatively on 1 Apr.</p>
              <p><strong>SAF Group Term Life (GTL) Insurance
              Scheme</strong><br> From 1 Jan 09 onwards, the scheme automatically covers
              newly-recruited MINDEF/SAF personnel for $100,000, and now has a
              maximum coverage of up to $600,000, unless they choose to opt out.
              Spouses and dependants are included in the coverage, which extends
              beyond the serviceman’s stay in MINDEF/SAF. NSmen are also eligible
              for the competitively-priced scheme.<br> <br> More information can be obtained via the Aviva-SAF Insurance
              Infoline at 68278000.<br> <br> <strong>SAF Financial Assistance Schemes</strong><br> <em>Last September, monetary lifelines such as the Term Financial
              Assistance Scheme, which aims to alleviate the financial stresses
              of servicemen, were improved. This scheme, which helps needy NSFs,
              had its period of assistance extended from six months till the
              serviceman's Operationally Ready Date but subjected to review after
              12 months. A term financial loan scheme was also launched for needy
              servicemen.</em><br> <br> <strong>100% subsidy for Defensive Riding Course
              (DRC)</strong><br> As of 1 Oct 09, the DRC, which is designed specifically for
              MINDEF/SAF personnel, became fully subsidised. Held at the
              Singapore Safety Driving Centre (SSDC) located in Woodlands, the
              half-day course aims to encourage road safety among those who
              regularly commute to work or perform despatch duties by
              motorcycle.<br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><br> *Applications for most of the welfare schemes can be found on the
              Integrated Welfare Applications and Disbursement System (iWADS) on
              the MINDEF/SAF intranet. All queries should be directed to the
              SAFPSC. Their numbers can be found via the iWADS.</em></span></p>

              <p>MINDEF has accepted recommendations made by the ACCORD councils to 
              strengthen support for national servicemen (NSmen), said Second Defence 
              Minister Chan Chun Sing in Parliament on Thursday (Mar 5).</p>
              <p>One of 
              the proposals is for the Total Defence Awards to be revamped to 
              recognise more people and organisations who have contributed to the 
              defence of Singapore. Instead of just recognising employers, the awards 
              will now also recognise colleagues and immediate superiors who are 
              supportive of NSmen when they answer the call of duty.</p>
              <p>MINDEF will also continue to strengthen its partnership with employers and businesses to provide strong support for NSmen.</p>
              <p>Some
               NSmen undergo leadership courses during their In-Camp Training (ICT) 
              and it would be useful for employers to know of their employees' 
              performance during these courses, so they can maximise their skills at 
              work. Hence, MINDEF will consider implementing a pilot trial for this 
              initiative for NSmen attending the NS Command and Staff Course.</p>
              <p>"The
               performance of the NSmen in SAF (Singapore Armed Forces) provides 
              valuable signals to the companies on the potential, energies, 
              capabilities and commitment of their employees. Hence, MINDEF and the 
              employers can work together to let employers know (about) the talent and
               attributes of the NSmen, their employees, to allow employers to 
              appreciate and make best use of the talent of our NSmen," said Mr Chan.</p>
