              <p>I REFER to last Friday's letter by Mr Michael Ang, 'Make English and modified NS a must'.<br> <br> National service (NS) is not merely a rite of passage for young male
              Singaporeans. It was conceived with a specific objective to build up a
              citizens' army to defend Singapore militarily. This objective remains
              true today.<br> <br> It is tempting to argue that foreigners should do NS as a price to pay
              for Singapore citizenship because many view NS as a liability borne by
              Singaporeans. However, NS functions as part of a wider framework of the
              war-fighting doctrine of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), as well as
              Singapore's national development. Manpower requirements, including
              those for conscription, must be meticulously identified and implemented.<br> <br> Many foreigners coming to Singapore are in their late 20s or older.
              They are already economically productive and can immediately contribute
              to Singapore's economy. It makes little sense to disrupt their
              activities for two years. Whatever social networks they have developed
              would also need to be rebuilt.<br> <br> Having modified NS is feasible only if it fits in with the overall
              requirements of the SAF and complements its capability. It is a waste
              of resources if it exists only to make some people 'serve their duty'.<br> <br> Furthermore, the largest army corps is the infantry and this is where
              the SAF needs the most people. However, studies in other countries have
              shown that the specific kind of fitness needed for infantry soldiers,
              involving a combination of agility, stamina and tolerance of sleep
              deprivation, starts to degrade from the late 20s onwards. This is why
              armies across the world have a lower maximum age to join the infantry.<br> <br> <strong><span style="color: red;">Xiao Fuchun<br> </span></strong><br> <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Story/STIStory_415050.html">http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BFor...ry_415050.html</a></p>

              <p>Most of us enlisted at 19/20 years old. But your reservist starts typically around 25+ and lasts for 10 years or age 40 (warrant officers/specialists/enlisted) or age 50 (officers).</p>
              <p><br>In fact, most of our reservists are aged late 20s to mid 30s, so this Xiao Fu Chun chap is talking rubbish. In fact, I have fellow reservist cheonging with me through BCTC assault course at age 39 while I was age 32. My friend who is aged 40 by end of this year still got called up although he is PES C2.</p>
              <p>I don't mind foreigners coming in on a level playing field. But they want to have their cake (siam NSF/reservist) and eat it too (enjoy jobs/careers'/$$$). Even if they don't serve combat vocation, there's tonnes of national/public service they can do.</p>
