            <div class='col-md body'>From <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/231189.asp" rel="nofollow">TODAY Online:</a><br><br>Actor's detention upheld<br>Leong Wee Keat<br>weekeat@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>TELEVISION viewers know him as Phua Chu Kang's nephew, Aloy. But actor Marcus Ng Yi Loong was at the heart of a real-life courtroom drama yesterday.<br><br>A full-time National Serviceman, Ng was appealing against a subordinate military court ruling, after he had been convicted on two charges of insubordinate behaviour and conduct to the prejudice of good discipline.<br><br>On Feb 28 last year, Ng's superior at Nee Soon Camp's SAF Medical Training Institute called Ng and another serviceman into a room to address them about an earlier incident.<br><br>After reprimanding the other serviceman, Second Warrant Officer Saraswathi told Ng, who had asked, "Why me?", not to question her orders.<br><br>Ng became angry and accused 2WO Saraswathi of picking on him.<br><br>Both raised their voices.<br><br>Afterwards, Ng confronted her outside the room and their two-minute exchange drew the attention of Master Warrant Officer Ger Ah Kee.<br><br>Seeking to defuse the situation, MWO Ger put his hand on Ng's shoulder.<br><br>Ng rudely shrugged MWO Ger's hand off by moving his shoulder aggressively.<br><br>Later, Ng was sentenced to seven days' detention on each of the two charges, with the sentences to run concurrently.<br><br>The 22-year-old appealed to the Military Court of Appeal, making the case that the Court Martial judge, in convicting him, had erred in law and in fact.<br><br>Ng's lawyer Wendell Wong said there were conflicting accounts from eyewitnesses, and called the sentence "manifestly excessive" and "crushing for a young serviceman", while citing other cases where servicemen were given fines, a reprimand or letter of warning for seemingly more serious offences.<br><br>In response, Singapore Armed Forces prosecutor Luke Tan argued that the Court Martial's finding of guilt was based "on sound and established legal principles".<br><br>The five-member panel of the Military Court of Appeal, chaired by High Court Judge Justice Choo Han Teck, agreed.<br><br>They dismissed Ng's appeal against his conviction and sentence on the charge of insubordination, even as they reduced Ng's sentence on the second charge to a reprimand.<br><br>This means Ng still has to serve seven days' detention.<br><br>This was not Ng's first brush with military law. Last October, he was convicted and fined $1,000 for two other offences of disobedience and non-compliance. Lawyers were also hired for him at the time.<br><br>Ng's mother, Mdm Florence Tan, told reporters she has spent $80,000 on legal fees.<br><br>She gave her son a hug before he was led away to begin his detention.<br></div>
