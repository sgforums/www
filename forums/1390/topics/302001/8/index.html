He also shrugged off the hand of a person superior in rank. He was dealt seven days' detention for each offence, to be served concurrently, but on yesterday's appeal, was given a reprimand for the second offence.</strong><br><br>This means both incidents occurred 15 &amp; 11 months ago, respectively. He was convicted of the second offence last July (DB), &amp; of the first offense last October (fine). He was appealing against the former sentence.<br><br>David Boey said he'd enlisted in July 2006 (not Sept -- dunno what happened with the ST article).
