He was also reprimanded by a Military Court of Appeal for being rude to his superior.<br><br>This is the second time he has been hauled up since he started his military service in September 2006.<br><br>Ng, who holds the rank of Private, is perhaps best-known as the rebellious teen in the TV sitcom Phua Chu Kang.<br><br>Ng's troubles in the SAF began in October 2006 when his superiors at the SAF Medical Training Institute slapped him with four charges for offences including not obeying orders.<br><br>In February last year, while he was being investigated by the SAF legal process, Ng chased and argued aggressively with a 50-year-old woman Warrant Officer in his unit's Operations Room.<br><br>A Master Warrant Officer, a trained Commando, saw the altercation and intervened.<br><br>Ng rudely shrugged off the Master Warrant Officer's hand when he tried to calm the Private.<br><br>For this, Ng faced two more charges: one for insubordinate behaviour after the Operations Room argument, and another for improper conduct.<br><br>Last July, an SAF court martial found him guilty of these charges and sentenced him to seven days jail at the SAF Detention Barracks for each charge.<br><br>Unhappy with the sentence, Ng lodged a Notice of Appeal - a legal right for all SAF serviceman to seek redress - and was granted a hearing by a five-person panel chaired by Justice Choo Han Teck.<br><br>In the meantime, Ng was fined $500 for two of the earlier charges and acquitted on the other charges.<br><br>On Tuesday, Ng's defence lawyer, Mr Wendell Wong from Drew &amp; Napier, said a jail term was 'the harshest punishment I've ever seen for this sort of offence'' and urged the panel to quash the convictions or impose a fine instead.<br><br>But Mr Luke Tan, head of Military Law at the Ministry of Defence, argued: 'This is akin to a case where a person is on bail. Has he learnt anything from it? No, he goes one up and goes after two other officers.'<br><br>'It would be inappropriate to give a little slap on the risk by imposing a fine as that would be of little consequence to him.''<br><br>Some 25 people, including Ng's mother, Madam Florence Tan, 58, were in court when the panel reached a unanimous decision to uphold the first charge and reduce the second sentence to a reprimand.<br><br>He appeared teary-eyed when led away to begin his sentence.<br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/image/20080108/latest-%20pixmarcus.jpg"></div>
