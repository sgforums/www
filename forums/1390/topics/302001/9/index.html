            <div class='col-md body'>Here, I scanned the TNP reports after failing to find any online. They also had another article in the inside pages themed about ex-child stars losing their way, talking to &amp; quoting Shahrin Azhar (Aksi Mat Yoyo), Michelle Chia &amp; Edmund Chen (whose kids are advertisement mini-celebs together with him &amp; Xiang Yun). Left that one out cuz it's not directly relevant &amp; in any case will only prolong this post ....<br><br><strong>P.C.K. CHILD ACTOR IN MILITARY DETENTION: GUILTY SAYS APPEAL JUDGE<br>DESPITE ALL THE EVIDENCE, MUM STILL SAYS ...</strong><br>By Kor Kian Beng<br><br>My son, a bad boy?<br><br>No way, the mother of former teen actor Marcus Ng Yi Loong said.<br><br>He is a well-mannered, humble and respectful person despite finding fame early, Madam Florence Tan, 58, told The New Paper yesterday.<br><br>Ng, 22 is better known for his role as PCK's nephew Aloysius in popular TV sitcom Phua Chu Kang Pte Ltd.<br><br>But Ng's army superiors didn't share Madam Tan's views.<br><br>He has found himself in trouble with the army for a series of offences since he began his national service in July 2006.<br><br>Yesterday, the young man was ordered to serve one week in detention barracks after he failed in his appeal against a sentence meted out to him following a military trial in July 2007.<br><br>Ng, who holds the rank of Private, also received a reprimand from the Military Court of Appeal for being rude to his superiors.<br><br>During the July trial, Ng, who represented himself, faces two charges for offences -- insubordination and improper conduct -- committed during an incident on 28 Feb 2007.<br><br>He had raised his voice and argued aggressively with his superior Warrant Officer K. Saraswathi, at the operations room of the SAF Medical Training Institute in Nee Soon Camp.<br><br>During the incident, Ng, who is a service medic, also rudely shrugged off the hand of another superior, Master Warrant Officer Ger Ah Kee, when the latter tried to calm him down.<br><br>He was sentenced to one week's jail for each charge, which were to run concurrently.<br><br>Yesterday, Ng's lawyer, Mr Wendell Wong, a director from Drew &amp; Napier, tried to convince Justice Choo Han Teck and four other members of the appeal court that Ng had been treated unfairly during the trial last year.<br><br>The lawyer alleged that the prosecution had failed to provide relevant documents or offer prosecution witnesses to Ng.<br><br>Mr Wong also describes the jail term as "crushing" for the offences Ng had committed and asked the court to acquit him or impose a fine instead.<br><br>But the court only reduced the sentence for the second charge to a reprimand.<br><br>Madam Tan said she was terribly disappointed at the outcome, even though she had prepared her son for the worst.<br><br>She said: "I told him not to cry no matter what happens."<br><br>The loving mother cannot accept that her son had committed the offences, even though it was pointed out to her that the incident took place in the midst of an investigation into offences he had committed earlier.<br><br>In Ocober 2006, Ng's superiors had slapped him with four charges for offences, including disobeying orders.<br><br>After a military trial in October 2007, he was acquitted on two charges and fined $500 for each of the remaining two.<br><br>Madam Tan, who works as a secretary, said: "My son is not the kind to raise his voice and behave aggressively. His character is not like that."<br><br>"He is someone who cares about his public image."<br><br>And despite Ng's numerous offences in the army, Madam Tan rubbished the suggestion that her son was yet another example of a former teen star gone astray.<br><br>Instead, she tried to paint a rosy picture of her son as a sensible, down-to-earth and well-behaved person during the interview with The New Paper last night.<br><br>Madam Tan claimed that her son chose not to engage any lawyers for the July trial because he knew it would be costly. She claimed that she has spent $80,000 on legal fees.<br><br>She also claimed that she has not heard any negative comment about her son from anyone, including those he worked with on the TV sitcom.<br><br>She believes that her son had positive influences from his co-stars, such as Gurmit Singh and Pierre Png, whom he hung out with often in his teen years, having meals or playing arcade games with them.<br><br>Madam Tam also described her son as a homely person who seldom stayed out late at night.<br><br>She said: "He seldom goes out, except to play football with his friends on weekends or to watch football on TV at his friends' homes.<br><br>"Most times, he would go out with me. He has even taken me out for movies with his friends.<br><br>APPROACHED BY STRANGERS<br><br>And whenever she was out with her son, Madam Tan claimed that she has never seen him behave impolitely or arrogantly to strangers who approached him for a chat or photo.<br><br>She said: "People would come up to him and said 'Marcus, you've grown so tall now' or 'Marcus, you're so handsome now.'<br><br>"He has never turned anyone away rudely or complained about this."<br><br>But she revealed that her son had confided in her that he has heard criticisms of him being arrogant and snobbish.<br><br>Madam Tan, who also has a 32-year-old daughter, said: "I told him to ignore them because we cannot stop the whole world from bad-mouthing him."<br><br>Ng appeared terse and worried when he chatted with The New Paper before the verdict.<br><br>When asked about his plans after he ends his NS in July, Ng said: "I'm waiting fo opportunities."<br><br>Madam Tan believes that her son's acting career will not be adversely affected by his military offences.<br><br>She said: "I'm not worried because what is more important is if you have real talent."<br><br>-----<br><br><strong>P.C.K.'S IRENE ANG: WE TOLD HIM TO BE MORE FILIAL</strong><br>By Wendy Teo<br><br>He was a bit spoilt at first, but he grew out of his pampered ways.<br><br>Actress Irene Ng, who played Phua Chu Kang's wife Rosie, admitted that when Marcus first joined them on the set of Phua Chu Kang Pte Ltd in 1997, he was still very young and "a bit spoilt."<br><br>"He was the only son, you see. But we constantly reminded him to be filial to his parents because we were just like family to him too."<br><br>Marcus, now 22, had played Aloysius or "Ah Boy" in the popular Channel 5 sitcom Phua Chu Kang Pte Ltd until it ended its 10-year run last year.<br><br>Irene added: "He had toned down a lot by then (the end of the PCK run) and was more sensible.<br><br>"Like any teenager, I guess he will be a bit angst-y, but he's essentially a good boy.<br><br>Gurmit Singh, who played Phua Chu Kang, agreed, saying Marcus is a good boy.<br><br>He added that Marcus was always punctual for filming and eager to learn.<br><br>Gurmit said: "He was on PCK when he was only 8 and I would say he was pampered by his mum. Being the youngest on the set, people took care of him too, naturally.<br><br>"But he's a well-grounded boy."<br><br>Marcus' onscreen father Pierre Png, who played Chu Beng, said: "From what I know, he responds well to authority. He listens to th director and does his work."</div>

Ought to use $80k to go and find some specialist to downgrade and go find MP to push my case through. Don't think it even cost u near $50k. Throw some 30days MC at them.<br><br>Anyway nobody knows the real truth... Not that anyone expect the real truth to be really revealed by those people. Well at least not anyone who has been through the crap.</div></blockquote>The MWO was trying to restrain him. That is not assault at all.<br><br>Please get your facts right. Thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the army is different from the outside world.<br><br>outside, if u talk back/refuse to cooperate/rude/being insubordinate to your boss/teacher/superiors, at most u get fired/expelled. they won't possibly call up the police to arrest u.<br><br>but in the army it's a different story, they won't hesitate to charge u with (almost) anything.</div>

I feel a bit sad for her ....... she's blind .....  </blockquote>Her reaction reminded me of Michael Fay's mum's. That parent had brayed her self-righteous indignance out to People magazine (instead of a local publication), so I'm not sure you old-timers ever caught it. In that article piece, she'd harped about her son's innonence &amp; vowing to prove how the S'pore Govt was plainly wrong. Thereafter, things laid low until her son was caught for smoking pot, so LPPL for her.<br><br>The funny thing was how sane she'd sounded, like Marcus's mum here. The mother's unconditional love is discernable, even as the PCK cast tried not to highlight her erstwhile pampering too much. "Sad" is the right call ....</div>
