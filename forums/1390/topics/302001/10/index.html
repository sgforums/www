Encik abuse of power?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> </div></blockquote>Encik was doing his job. The private in question was brought into the ops room for insubordination, I was the witness. Encik had been briefed about his mismeander earlier during a training excercise. Imagine you are told to "knock it down" as a common punishment, which we are all so used to we do not even think about it, the only thing that matters was how fast we can adopt the position. Do first, ask questions later. What happened that day stunned me. The private just sat down on the ground, turned and looked at his trainer (my colleague) and turned back and blatantly refused to obey. He eventually relented when his section mates "coaxed" him to follow orders. We were all bewildered at his behaviour. I think he may have had some strange ideas when he got off his bed that day.<br><br>I made him "enjoy" his punishment afterwards. Of course it didn't end there. Which brings us to the events that occurred in the ops room. Insubordination. What's there to explain? You are in a combat unit, you jump out of aeroplanes for goodness sake, and if we allowed everyone to behave in such a manner, who knows what kind of serious consequences that may result in loss of life and property might follow? You are in the army, you carry weapons, your individual rights come in second when compared to operational readiness. This has been the undisputable fact of armed forces throughout the world and throughout history. If he was not happy with the system, he should have applied to be transfered out of the unit. We sure as hell didn't want his type there.<br><br>Abuse of power? Had he not done that, it would have been negligence. The little brat didn't deserve to be training in my camp.

            <div class='col-md body'>That's right, nobody knew what <strong>actually</strong> happened. But judging from the newspaper report alone, I say that the actor boy is in the wrong. I was in SPF for my ns, not SAF. All my superiors are police officers. For a private to behave that manner to a warrant officer, is like me an sc/sgt behaving rudely and insubordinate to an ASP. SAf hierarchy from Pte to WO got how many ranks in between?<br>Anyway, it should be noted that he was sentenced to DB, not imprisonment. Meaning there would be no criminal records. If he got screened on the road by police officer, the results would still be green. To those who support the boy and think he did no wrong, think again.
