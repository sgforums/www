            <div class='col-md body'>with the recent dave teo's incident, the spotlight has centered on guard duties. no doubt all camps in SAF now are tightening the way guard duties are conducted.<br><br>therefore i will like to give my take on how guard duty is conducted in my camp, how some of the things i felt needs improvement. do share with us your experiences as well.<br><br>to get things started, my camp is not a combat camp, there are no combat units inside (actually there is a combat unit but they are classified so lets not go there). there are 2 training schools which takes turns providing guards for guard duties.<br><br>so everyday we have trainees as guards. most of them are fresh PTEs out of BMT, some are CPLs fresh from BSLC, some are men from other units attached to my camp for course, once in a while we have cadets as well.<br><br>The guard com is always a sergeant from the main training school of the camp, the 2IC is usually a sergeant from the other training school, the 3IC is a CPL/PTE from the other training school who is a perm staff of the unit.<br><br>there are many units inside the camp, each with their own different designed camp passes.<br><br>ok so with all these basic info listed out, here are some of the problems i usually face with them.<br><br>[*] because the guards are trainees, they do not know how the camp works and are not familiar with the different passes. many times, whenever someone flashes a pass at them, they will just let them in, even if the passes are from other camp or a visitor pass. one is not supposed to book out of camp with a visitor pass.<br><br>[*] because the guardcom and his guards are from different units, the guardcom will find it hard commanding them.<br><br>[*] sometimes the guards are from other mono-intake units attached here for course. they never use a M16 before as they are trained to handle SAR21 since their mono-intake BMT.<br><br>selecting soldiers who are not even M16 trained for guard duties really makes me wonder whoever select the guards did he even make an effort to check whether all of them are M16 trained or not?<br><br>there's are many more i'll like to bring up but this post is getting too long so i'll leave to the rest of you to share with us your experiences.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, my camp was next to Gordy's. We never had problems with our guards, they were mostly specialists and even if there were trainees or newly-posted in personnel, we always tried to keep a 3SG together with a greenhorn PTE/LCP so that the former can guide the new bird.<br><br>And yes, we used AR-15s. However, we had no mono-intake personnel as it was a majority Specialist camp, so there wasn't a problem with new birds not knowing how to use one of those things.<br><br>However, as I usually walked over to his camp for lunch,  I always felt that his camp sentries were quite on the ball when it came to ensuring that people only enter after they've been processed, or gotten the required pass.<br><br>I'll post more another time. Just to share how different camps can have vastly different styles.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
