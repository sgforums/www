            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>with the recent dave teo's incident, the spotlight has centered on guard duties. no doubt all camps in SAF now are tightening the way guard duties are conducted. </blockquote>I don't think it's fair to link this way to Mandai Hill Camp, which is a combat one. (Dave Teo also deserted on a Sunday night, apparently during the usual book-in hours. So it's hard to believe there were no eyewitnesses if he did blatantly walk out of the main gate.)<br><br>No idea whether what you described is that commonplace elsewhere. But, in my time long long ago, my course-time camp used to see varying standards too. It had personnel from various operational, training-wing, HQ Formation units &amp; even the SAF Boys' School pulling guard duty -- over &amp; above the RPs manning the gates during the daytime. Let's say their prowler system wasn't that "disciplined" either, as compared to my active unit's (as I discovered later).<br><br>But things were offset by a very reactive regimentation, meaning multiple guard turnouts &amp;, as I recall, some of the BOS's driving around the camp past midnight (to check on the "autonomous" prowlers?). Every SOP was like it was still BMT; luckily I was only a vocational trainee but imagine how the operational troops must've felt at being treated like the lowest common demoninator there for the rest of their NS.<br><br>Perhaps, as the SAF got more professional, the end of these pure-tekan, bureaucratic BS had created a power vacuum which was never quite refilled, even as non-combat camps must continue to maintain a sustainable level of security.<br><br><blockquote>yes but 20 SA does not do gate sentry it is only 2SIR guards do gate sentry.</blockquote>If we're talking Amoy Quee, I know 20 SA guard their "own" side gate various periods in the past. Speaking of which, if there's one security flaw with the SAF gate-sentry system IMO it's these side gates. Yes, access is controlled in the sense that they're only open certain hours but, on the whole, only a Gate IC &amp; an armed sentry are stationed &amp; neither have direct contact with the main guardroom (private cellphones aside). If the camp is big, it can take 10 minutes to run back &amp; report any incidents.</div>
