FYI To get by, we resorted to setting aside one set of stand-by-cupboard equipment (toiletries, SAF uniforms - i.e. we had one pair less to wear for actual training) for such purposes, often standardized-wrapped to meet standby FBO criteria as well. These stuff went untouched for the whole NS period, &amp; were still brand new by the time we ORD'd.<br><br>Gosh, I remember we had to buy brown tracing paper to line up the top shelves, plus hang an orange polishing cloth to block out the bottom shelves. The latter's more for BMT; all your barang - except shoes - at the combat unit must be kept inside a civilian bag stored in the same locker place. I can recall memorably being punished for folding my blanket differently (Tekong-taught vs. mono-intake version) as well.<br><br>Our mentality was that we normal peng had it good; the then-contemporary OCS cadets went through even more stifling regimentation for a whole 9 months!</div>
