            <div class='col-md body'>Change parade has to be the absolute craziest. It was already banned during my time, but legends abound on how creative the tekaning could be - since that's precisely the end in itself. Now we could only get a glimpse of it in those Taiwanese "Reporting, Sir" film comedies ~lol~<br><br>The swimming instructors during my Tekong days were very inventive too - lucky for me cuz I couldn't swim then. It was, like, 45 minutes of exhausting circuit training &amp; 10 minutes's actual swimming for those who would have no problem passing the test. Not so much super-siong but all the complementary humiliation left the trainee disoriented: "Recruit, you so blur you must've pa chiao with your left hand instead of your right, yah?" "Yes, Instructor!"<br><br>Those by PTI's &amp; during range butt-parties came with the territory, I guess.<br><br>The most sadistic has to be the UC instructors, though. Them buggers never hazed or shouted at you; they just conduct their training under the blazing sun (meaning your palms get burnt on the hot asphalt), or subject you to knuckle pushups (to beget the "required" calluses), or stretch you into very-painful postures during warm-up sessions. Even the officers cannot escape; it was the only occasion when I witnessed my CO involuntarily plead for mercy.</div>

Usually when e recs ran to touch that something e specs would just stand one corner n watched. But suay suay that day our OC cme to e soc ground. He fu*ked all e specs upside dwn, saying u all hve to follow e recs whenever they go. So lan lan, when we all went to touch e tree/ low wall, e specs hve to run w us too. In e end PTI nt only punished e recs but oso e specs suffered..kekekeke<br><br>N oso e change parade, even though my time already banned liao, but we oso kana. If no ban, think will kana even more often. We were in e bunk in smart 4 waiting to take e ferry to book out. Than suddenly e officer told us to change to ptkit than fall in downstairs, after fall in liao, told us to go up to bunk change to smart 4 again n fall in downstairs.

            <div class='col-md body'>The "the tree" punishment originated from bayonet fighting, rather than by PTI's or whatever. Theoretically, such combat skills are applicable only in a personal dogfight in wartime, so soldiers "must" be tekaned until complete exhaustion before conducting rote training.</div>

U cannot any hw take 1 cse they would check. Of coz cannot find lah, 120+ rifles lei in 3 mins. Than redo, tis time we stack it nicely, but oso cannot complete in time. Than in e end tekan very chia lat crucnches, knock it dwn, etc loh, hundreads of time. All becse they found an unopened combat ration in e dustbin n no one wanted to admit it.<br><br>We were oso e only company that brought along our field pack to shelter during CAT 1. Other companies just kept theirs in e bashar. N e worst part, our field camp was in DEC, e raining season. Everday a lot of CAT 1 smetimes in e middle of e nite, had to wake up, walked in e rain/ lighting/ thunder in full battle order to shelter. N we were not allowed to wear our ponchos. Our ponchos in our sbo that we wore along r 4 pai sui only. Cat 1 status came out so long ago liao, always when began to rain than proceed to shelter. E lightings n thunders r right on top of my head. Never heard e thunder so loud n lighting so bright in my life b4. E spec oso gt scared, quickly bend e metal rod  that was attached to e radio set he was carrying on his back.<br><br>At e end of sit test, e tonners came n wated to bring us back. But e OC just told them to go back empty.  E whole company had to march back in full battle order - 8km lei. E specs r all not prepared for it. As it was getting dark there were no reflective vest, troop marching signages, neon light sticks etc., but they still called us to march. Half way during e march, i saw a landrover sped passed us, when we were about a quarter to BMTC it cme back w e reflective vests, signages, neon sticks. Wts e use, we were about to reach liao. Or izzit because BMTC gt a lot of other plp, so must waiyang that they had all e safety devices w them.<br><br>Still gt a lot more, lazy to type all out.<br><br>Our OC like a gangster, stand on e land rover bonnet shouting. Always look at recs sideways nt directly.</div>
