              <p>Archelli I am sorry for being harsh, becoz I do recall a number of ppl posting such statements all the time in forums, eg sign on only if you are a scholar or unless you're signing on as SAFOS, don't sign on. I apologize to you if I was overly harsh. I get your point. Hope you get mine also.</p>

              <p>I believe he went for something called <a title="Logistics Executive" href="http://202.176.209.76/keppelLive/JobSearch3.asp?Source=1&amp;DesigDetCode=156&amp;SearchCriteria=&amp;JCategory=4&amp;JCategoryDesc=Contracts/%20Procurement/%20Trading/%20Warehousing&amp;CountryCode=188">logistics executive</a> or maybe the manager position.He was rather hush hush about it before he left as the CO wasn't really happy with his decision since he recommended him for Maj in the first place and shortly after his promotion,he decide that he want to leave the army.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Link salah,sorry.But go to  <a href="http://www.keppelcareers.com">http://www.keppelcareers.com</a> and look under <span style="color: #000000;">Contracts/ Procurement/ Trading/ Warehousing</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Only thing he ever told a few of us was that he was bored of army life and that he felt "stagnated".He declined to explain further..might be due to the fact that he is regular and the rest of us NSF,so not so appropriate.</span></p>

              <p>from wad i know LG(Ret) Ng retired as a Arty officer... perhaps he was from Signals before that.</p>
              <p>in fact, Winston Choo was a Signal officer.</p>
              <p>also, i believe Combat Engineers are Combat Support. MES is Combat Service Support. Think somewhere along this thread this got confused.</p>
              <p>Signing on and excelling - i think this is without regard to your chosen vocation. All vocations have the chance to excel in their field of work. Although notably, I have never seen a Commando BG, yet. BG Phillip (i'm not sure if he's still in SAF) was a former red beret, or so i'm told. He has since been sporting a black beret, perhaps a significant change in formation so he can rise the ranks.</p>
