              <p>I applaud you for willing to look at the "good" side of things but let's be realistic,no one wants to sign up knowning that he will be an underdog compared to another.Want the best career prospects?Be a SAFOS.If a person is contended with uncertain and limited prospects,so be it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are ranking exercises for the regulars and it involves a few "predeterminded factors".Plenty will hit the ceiling at MAJ or LTC.I have seen a real life 40 year old MAJ with a 35 year old LTC as his direct superior,want to make a guess as to which is the farmer,which is the scholar? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3 type of vocations in the Army:Combat,Technical and Service.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All combat support(Signal,Arty,Engineer) formation are combat vocations,they receive combat pay too.They are not direct front line troops but they serve in a combatant role nonetheless.Logistics is under combat <strong>service</strong> support.</p>

              <p><span class="139361501-02052008"><span style="color: #000000;">This thread I started was for the benefit of 
                                      those who were not eligible or were rejected for the SAFOS scholarship and may like to know whether combat support is disadvantaged or not. </span></span></p>
              <p><span class="139361501-02052008"><span style="color: #000000;">Actually non-SAFOS is 
                                      already farmer liao. So I don't know what you mean by your last sentence. </span></span></p>
              <p><span class="139361501-02052008"><span style="color: #000000;">The term farmer was coined 
                                      in the early 1970s, almost 4 decades ago when the SAFOS was born and they were clever guys sent to top UK 
                                      universities. All non SAFOS were referred to as farmers and thats the correct definition even today. Non SAFOS- ATA, LSA are 
                                      all farmers. Doesn't matter whether you have degree or not. Local grads, please take 
                                      changkul and start digging. You think there is a big difference between a poly dip and a 
                                      NTU degree in SAF or anywhere else for that matter? LOL </span></span></p>
              <p><span class="139361501-02052008"><span style="color: #000000;">I know so many poly guys 
                                      who are smarter than local graduates. People from crappy JCs who make it to crappy NTU and NUS courses are NOT superior to poly guys and are NOT SAFOS material. Many people in Poly go there with better O level grades than people in crappy JCs like SRJC, YJC, JJC, etc. </span></span></p>
              <p>Local grads can take changkul and dig as well.</p>

              interested to sign on whether its for money or other reason, does signing on 
              with COMBAT SUPPORT or COMBAT SERVICE SUPPORT (logistics) really lose out? </span></span></p>

              <p>You are wrong. There are SAFOS in combat support arms who made CDF and BG. I know the COAs you are talking abt.</p>
              <p>Notably, Ng Yat Chung is from Signals and made CDF. We also know that he was quite overweight. He's super smart lah.. won't say more.</p>
              <p>Lee Hsien Loong was Artillery SAFOS and Lee Hsien Yang was Signals SAFOS. Both support arms.</p>

                                      everyone is cut out for SAFOS material. Everyone got different place in life and 
                                      everyone has a limited calibre. I know a lot of women who tell me they know they 
                                      can never go far and are content being executives all their lives, have no wish 
                                      to get manager or director title. </span></span></p>
              <p><span class="139361501-02052008"><span style="color: #000000;">In a huge organisation 
                                      like SAF, you need the SAFOS to lead it and you also need the people who are 
                                      cogs and wheels of the organisation for operational fitness. Do you think the 
                                      whole of the SAF can survive with only 6-8 people a year, the no. of SAFOS a 
                                      year?</span></span></p>
              <p>What you're basically saying is that if you are not as good as the top 8 people of a given cohort, you will not deign to participate. So were YOU one of the top few A level people your year? if not, then what qualifies your arrogance after? LOL</p>
              <p><span class="139361501-02052008"><span style="color: #000000;">You sound so arrogant, 
                                      like if someone is not a SAFOS can forget abt joining SAF cos he should feel 
                                      prideless that he is not as good. </span></span></p>
              <p><span class="139361501-02052008"><span style="color: #000000;">Don't say SAF lah. This scenario can be 
                                      transplanted to anywhere in the private sector. </span></span></p>
              <p><span class="139361501-02052008"><span style="color: #000000;">If a good SAFOS's CEP is BG and 
                                      you think if one is not a SAFOS can go and die liao, then how confident are you 
                                      that YOU can hit a BG-equivalent in the private sector?? LOL LOL<br></span></span></p>
              <p><span class="139361501-02052008"><span style="color: #000000;">BG is the rank of a number 
                                      of SAF generals who transited to become politicians. You talk very big hor? </span></span></p>
              <p><span class="139361501-02052008"><span style="color: #000000;">So you think if you are in 
                                      private sector, you are Jackson Tai (DBS CEO) material?</span></span></p>
              <p>Also, a farmer grad can hit LTC easily (with most of them retiring as LTC and some as COL); I even know poly grads who leave as LTC. Retire as MAJ only happens to 2 groups of people- condemned farmer grad who is lousier than shit (many of whom are women regulars, have basic NUS arts degree but all got chi bao deng si attitude) AND mediocre non-grads (no degree and no excellence to show for it). A <strong>good</strong> non-grad (poly, A level) can easily hit LTC.</p>
              <p>To most people, retiring as LTC is not too shabby for their level of capability and the LTC combat pay is above and beyond what they can command outside in the private sector. It is a good deal for them.</p>
              <p>So why so arrogant? You think everyone thinks they can be general? Can YOU be a general?</p>

              <p>Artillery, Signals and Combat Engineer are <strong>Combat Support</strong>. They are part of Combat but do Combat Support Work. Frontline won't be them. Infantry, Commando, Armour and Guards are on the frontline. When do you ever see Signals and Arti on the frontline chiong sua? Arti shoot from far far away from big powerful guns, not on frontline. Combat support arms also get combat pay but don't have to chiong sua.</p>
              <p>Only 4 arms chiong sua and they are combat arms - INF, CDO, ARM, and GRD.</p>
              <p>Engineering and Logistics are Combat SERVICE Support. They totally do not participate in Combat but offer service support in order for combat to happen.</p>
              <p>baikachuchu is correct on the classifications.</p>

              <p><span><span style="color: #000000;">In a huge organisation like SAF, you need the SAFOS to lead it and you also need the people who are cogs and wheels of the organisation for operational fitness.

              <p>What you're basically saying is that if you are not as good as the top 8 people of a given cohort, you will not deign to participate. So were YOU one of the top few A level people your year? if not, then what qualifies your arrogance after? LOL</p>

              <p><span class="388221404-02052008"><span style="color: #000000;">You don't seem to get it. 
              You sounded VERY arrogant by basically saying "Sign on only if you are SAFOS. if 
              not dun sign on". That was what you said lor, you can't deny it now cos we 
              quoted your words. Basically you are saying that unless can get SAFOS, one has 
              no reason to sign on.</span></span></p>
              <p><span class="388221404-02052008"><span style="color: #000000;">Now you're defending your 
              elitist words by saying that you only meant that as good advice for ppl who want 
              to reach the top? Which part of my and Del_Co's words do you not understand? We 
              said not everyone has aspirations or believe that they are Gen material. Do you 
              know the rank of a Gen and do you think it is very easily attainable? </span></span></p>
              <p><span class="388221404-02052008"><span style="color: #000000;">FYI, whether there are 
              Generals who went to be politicians recently, 1 yr ago, 5 yrs ago or 10 yrs ago 
              is not material to this discussion. What I said was, BG is the average rank of 
              ex SAFOS who went to politics. You think it is an easy feat? That was what I 
              meant. How does WHEN it happened affect my statement?! If you want the LATEST 
              person who did the transition for your own general knowledge, SURE. It's RADM 
              Lui Tuck Yew, the former Navy Chief who's now Minister of State who made the 
              transition 1 yr ago. SO WHAT? What is the diff between 1 yr or 10 yrs? 
              Basically, General level rank is the most common rank of ex SAFOS in politics. 
              You think very easy to be SAFOS ah?</span></span></p>
              <p><span class="388221404-02052008"><span style="color: #000000;">We both have told you, 
              there are many different kinds of ppl needed in a big organisation. It does not 
              mean that if one can't get the SAFOS scholarship, he should not consider a 
              career in the SAF. I said before, a farmer grad who does well can retire as a 
              LTC or COL. That is not shabby to them and the pay is infinitely better than 
              what they can get outside with the level of their calibre.</span></span></p>
              <p>Of cos we know it is harder to reach the top for a farmer, but how many times must we impress upon you that not everyone has such super high expectations for themselves?! So if you can't be prime minister, please don't work in the civil service. And if you can't be Jackson Tai or Kwek Leng Beng, please don't join the private sector. That was how ridiculous you sounded and that was what we tried to tell you.</p>
              <p><span class="388221404-02052008"><span style="color: #000000;">Saying that unless one is 
              a SAFOS, one should not consider signing on with SAF is as naive as saying 
              unless one can become Jackson Tai of banking, he should forget about working 
              lah. Just break his legs and stay at home. Collect $ from 
              gahmen.</span></span></p>

              <p>Well then the person who contributed to Wiki for Ng Yat Chung is wrong. Anyone older than mid 20s or so will know that he is from Signals. Not Arti. Also, I pointed out that Lee HL and Lee HY are Arti and Signals respectively and both were BGs. BG Ravinder Singh was from also Signals and holds a very high appointment, one of the more high ranked Joint Chief.</p>

              <p>Err, do you not know that SAF sends its officers to academies all over the world for training &amp; upgrading all the time? These range from US naval college, Westpoint academy, Fort Benning, civilian degree programmes and for SAFOS, they go to overseas command and staff college? It is VERY common.</p>
              <p>I know so many farmers who went overseas already for master's programmes in CV schools and military schools alike in France, US, UK, Australia. And they are not high fliers. In fact I'd say it is easier to get yourself sent overseas sponsored for such stints in the SAF than in the private sector, because the non high fliers I've seen sent overseas are not really the sharpest tool in the shed.</p>
