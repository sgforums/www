I for one did not enjoy the cursing/swearing-of-profanities culture in the SAF.<br><br>However, ultimately, your views are way too idealistic. I guess you have yet to be exposed to the Army life, but you must realize that Army and civillian lives are two totally different worlds. Stepping on Tekong is somewhat akin to stepping on an alien planet - the culture there is totally different.<br><br>I'm not asking you to enjoy swearing and cursing people. I'm asking you to have an open mind and be willing to accept new circumstances which have been forced upon you. And believe me, those circumstances WILL be forced upon you once you enter the Army.

I curse and swear (normally in english) when things go wrong or when i am pissed. I use profanities as an expression sometimes but does that make me a uncivilised gorillia</div>
