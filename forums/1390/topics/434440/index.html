              <p>The ankle that pop in and out is called chronic ankle laxity.  Walk too much, you will end up with arithitis.</p>
              <p>"double
              Joint on my left thumb" &lt;--- I dont know what is this.</p>
              <p>"Pull back muscle" &lt;-- People will just think you chao keng. Stop bluffing.</p>
              <p>The VA is a phyiscal test like IPPT.</p>
              <p>With problem like that, you should be downgraded and still one to go for what sotac? But anyway, if you tell this same thing to the SGT in CDO, they will surely think you chao keng, and you will sure get in and suffer. After you are screened, you get Pes A in the first place. So you should be 100% fit with no single defect.</p>
              <p>Good luck! Dumb boy!</p>

              <p>Injury is nothing to them. They will even tell you they have injuries. You have to die during training to make it a "big deal" to them.</p>
              <p>No, wait... Even deaths of trainees are also no biggie to them as it's "only 0.5% of the cohort" of 4 decades.</p>
              <p>When you get into cdo, your life suddenly becomes cheap and common. You need lots of good luck to survive in a place where human lives are not regarded at all.</p>

              My opinion is not to go for CDO if you have any injuries.
              
              A friend of mine was quite a good sportsman but had knee injury. Didn't declare as he wanted to chiong for OCS. He got PES B, some more failed NAPFA, but still posted to CDO for PTP!
              
              In the end his knee gave way and he downgraded to E1L9. The last I heard, this affected his sports too.
              
              So don't make the sacrifice! SAF is just for your 2 years NS (or regular contract) but your body stays with you for your entire life!

              Declare all injuries honestly. The MO will know what to do.
              
              Remember bring specialist memo to prove your injuries.

              <p>It would be very funny one day when more people get medically excused from VA. </p>
              <p>They might have to call up even more people for VA, or they might post people direct from BMTC without VA so it comes as a surprise. Then maybe they'll raise the commando and jump allowances.</p>
              <p>The standard of the commandos will drop, they might never win the best combat unit trophy again.</p>

              <p>Like I tell every single Rambo-wannabe who wants to hide their pre-existing medical conditions: USE YOUR BRAIN TO THINK, NOT YOUR BALLS.</p>
              <p>Okay, it's honourable and all to be in the commandos, but is it honourable to go home to your mother in a wheelchair because you chose to hide your medical condition?</p>
              <p>By the way, if you do get injured, and it turns out that the injury was directly related to a pre-existing medical condition or old injury which you failed to declare, the SAF will NOT compensate you OR pay for your medical support.</p>
              <p>So unless you are a medical doctor, do the right thing and declare all pre-existing medical conditions, with specialist's letters where possible.</p>
              <p>If the MO decides that you're combat fit, then good for you.</p>
              <p>And if he doesn't, then bear in mind that he has your best interests at heart.</p>
