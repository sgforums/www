This is just another way of transferring the work to another MO to do the dirty work.<br><br>Your Tekong MO is going to be pissed when you first present. Not really with you but the CMPB MO. If you bring ALL you investigations and a <strong>recent</strong> medical report and recommendations by your specialist, you will be put up for a medical board if your condition warrents one.<br><br>Medical boards at Tekong are 2 weekly. Sometimes there is a backlog so it can take about a month. You will sometimes be asked to attend the board. In other cases, the case is so straightforward that your presence will not be required.<br><br>In the interim, you will probably be put OOC.
