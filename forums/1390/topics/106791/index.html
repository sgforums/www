            <div class='col-md body'>Short history of the Engineers...<br><br>On 22 January 1977, the first Engineer Colours was formally presented to the Singapore Combat Engineers (SCE) by the late President Benjamin Sheares at Jurong Town Stadium. The presentation of Colours signifies esprit de corps, pride and identity. "The brown base colour represented the harsh terrain which Engineers must always advance through and overcome. The sword, wings and anchor depicted the support given to the land, airborne and amphibious forces while the laurel and words formed a golden circle representing unity."1<br><br>Often associated with difficult tasks such as clearing minefields, setting up field fortifications and building military bridges, the SCE is indispensable to the SAF. It is no wonder then, that when the SAF Training Institute (SAFTI) was set up in 1967 as the first military training institute to train officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs) to lead the embryonic SAF, an Engineer Training Wing was incorporated into the set-up. Two young officers, 2LT Gurcharan Singh and 2LT Chng Teow Hua, were selected to attend a basic engineer officer's course in Fort Belvior, Virginia, USA. Upon completion of their course, these two officers, with the Commanding Officer, MAJ George Mitchell, conducted the first Engineer Commanders' Course from April to August 1968. The graduate officers and NCOs from the course formed the nucleus of the SCE.<br><br>As her role became more defined and her responsibilities expanded, the Engineer Wing was renamed the School of Field Engineers and moved from SAFTI to new premises on Pulau Blakang Mati (now Sentosa) that same year. In April 1970, the Engineer Headquarters (EHQ) was established with MAJ Mitchell as the Senior Engineer Officer. The EHQ was renamed HQ Singapore Combat Engineer in 1974 and the commander's designation was changed to Chief Engineer Officer.<br><br>Today, SCE continues to serve the SAF and the nation with confidence and professionalism, hence contributing to the SAF's credibility and strength.<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/pixhistory/Jan04Pix2.jpg"><br>The tasks of field clearance and bomb disposal also fall on the Combat Engineers. These specialists get rid of unexploded bombs, missiles and other explosive devices, clearing the area for military operations or rendering the place safe for civilian<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/pixhistory/Jan04Pix4.jpg"><br>An Armoured Vehicle Launched Bridge (AVLB), a sophisticated bridge-laying vehicle.</div>
