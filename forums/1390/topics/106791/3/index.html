            <div class='col-md body'>Well I am from 35 also (sad to say), I am representing my dept to ask a question, hopefully you kind ppl out there can give a nice solution. The grp of us are going to ORD in less than 3 mths time and being CPLs, our CO made us post over to another company, which is going to have the new BTP intake, to be AI. The main objective said was to let us learn and experience being a commander.The BTP is frm 11 march to 8th april. However the OC of the Coy we posted to wanted us to stay till mid BMT, and as a result he is forcing us to clear our OFF, which we saved to clear for ORD, or else he is going to forfeit them. Is this an appropriate method for us to go LEARN or is he using the chance to make use of our resources to work for him. By such measures is it really making us learn with open heart or to learn because they have the rank and treat us with such 'welfare'? By the way that Coy is not short of any commanders. They themselves have 10 CPLs, 4 3SG 1 PS and a PC per platoon, I repeat PER PLATOON!! So I assume that the shortage of manpower is not a valid issue since in BMTC a platoon consists of 4 sections commanders 1 PS and 1 PC. Is it fair for the few of us get posted to such management grp and work all the way till the day we start to clear for ORD? While there are other CPLs around in my original coy get to enjoy the COUNTDOWN?<br><br>So any suggestions what we can do? I tried talking to my previous OC and hope he can do something about it. Hopefully CO can help us, or else Chief Engineer's good intention of launching the 'TING' project last year will be a waste. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am currently in STW. Staying in field. For so far in SOCE, many might say its bad, its xiong, bad system everything. But i met a good bunch of instructors and went thr a rather easy-going basic course to say. I do not know abt my next phase but it will just be another matter of mental endurance. Whether u wanna hold on and come out stronger or be a wuss and back off, finding every possible bit to chao keng. Yup, ppl have come and been thr and so can we do it. Y dun we just put in a little bit more effort?<br><br>Other then that, my mates have been highly un-cooperative often messing up our welfare. My OC is a great man though. Often so forgiving and he is really taking care of us like a dad.<br><br>Besides the ppl there, the environment is really bad at times. Ya lack of shade and some really bad weather. Bunk 1 is a killer. It is a Sauna facility. Glad i am off to bunk 2.<br><br>Think nowadays we ppl are getting extremely pampered with ppl actually exploiting SAF hotline to get an easier life in the army. How are we to fight a war with wimps man..... I do agree 80 kg bridge 4 ppl carry is very bad but i do agree too with the pride associated when forces actually made it across the banks all thanks to u.<br><br>we really shouldnt be complaining, our fathers' time was far more worse then now. all the fbo shit, tekan like nobody's business, run soc 20 times, uniform that can stand on its own, pushups till u cant feel ur arms, treatment like u are no mother's son.<br><br>Though it is not easy, but think it thr folks.
