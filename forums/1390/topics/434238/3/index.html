                                              Actually, when you think about it, it may not be so much the
                              fault of the person himself, but the <em>environment</em> he was
                              brought up in.</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>He could have been brought up in a sheltered, comfortable
                              environment where he lacked nothing. Every day he would go home to
                              have his maid cook his food and make his bed. He would sleep in an
                              air-conditioned room and play with the latest game consoles. He
                              would go to a top school and be the star student where all the
                              teachers love and praise him, and he would be the darling of his
                              chess club CCA or something to that effect.</p>
              <p>Then he goes to BMTC without knowing what to expect, and gets
                              thrown into an alien world where he has to stand by bed, shine his
                              own shoes, and have his sergeants shout 'CCB' and 'KNN' in his face
                              at every chance they get.</p>
              <p>Someone in those circumstances may just crack if he doesn't have
                              the mental fortitude to deal with adversity to begin with.</p>
              <p>Goes to show that you really should not pamper your children too
                              much lest they are not prepared for the kind of difficulties that
                              every Tom, Dick and Harry are expected to face.</p>

              <p>Somehow I think he's not a  wimp. He might just be used to doing as he pleases without any consequences. He might even have meant to come back after his swim. I know of so many other soldiers who wouldn't do the same simply for fear of the crabs on the beach.</p>
              <p>A top student should know how to suffer the present for the sake of the future. Running away is more like a beng who goes AWOL and to DB without losing anything.</p>
              <p>He should be careful, or his attitude might get him vocated as a Commando.</p>

              <p><br>A RECRUIT from the Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) on Pulau Tekong, said to have been having problems coping there, attempted to swim back to mainland Singapore last December.<br><br>Responding to queries from The Straits Times, the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) confirmed that the recruit 'attempted to swim out of Pulau Tekong towards the main island of Singapore'.<br><br>He was, however, spotted and picked up by the Police Coast Guard and handed back to the authorities in BMTC.<br><br>Mindef spokesman Desmond Tan said the young man was found on the Kechil Land Link, a strip of land linking Pulau Tekong and Pulau Tekong Kechil.<br>  The incident is believed to be the first time someone has tried to swim out of the island since the 1980s.<br><br>Pulau Tekong lies 2km from the mainland at its closest point; the distance from its jetty to Singapore is 3.8km.<br><br>Former military psychologist Stanley Chua, 33, said he hoped this incident would not spark talk that today's enlistees are softer or that national service (NS) is easier than before.<br><br>The former major in the Republic of Singapore Air Force, who now runs private consultancy N.S. Formulas, said the recruits today 'have a harder time' making the transition into military life and coping with the mental and social demands NS makes of them.<br><br>He added that it is not the Singapore Armed Forces' job to prepare young men for NS: 'The BMT commanders and buddies will only know the recruit for a few weeks... The onus is on parents, who have brought up their sons and should know better how they cope with difficulties or stress.'<br><br>Article is in today's Straits Times print edition.</p>

              <p>Actually, when you think about it, it may not be so much the fault of the person himself, but the <em>environment</em> he was brought up in.</p>
              <p>He could have been brought up in a sheltered, comfortable environment where he lacked nothing. Every day he would go home to have his maid cook his food and make his bed. He would sleep in an air-conditioned room and play with the latest game consoles. He would go to a top school and be the star student where all the teachers love and praise him, and he would be the darling of his chess club CCA or something to that effect.</p>
              <p>Then he goes to BMTC without knowing what to expect, and gets thrown into an alien world where he has to stand by bed, shine his own shoes, and have his sergeants shout 'CCB' and 'KNN' in his face at every chance they get.</p>
              <p>Someone in those circumstances may just crack if he doesn't have the mental fortitude to deal with adversity to begin with.</p>
              <p>Goes to show that you really should not pamper your children too much lest they are not prepared for the kind of difficulties that every Tom, Dick and Harry are expected to face.</p>

              <p>Say really i was culture shock a bit. 5am wake up to brush teeth. Really wonder what the fuck am i doing here. haha. Den the Sergent really scold me KNN, CCB and kick my bed so hard that i thought ghost kick me. WTF&gt; at that time i really want to give him a good punch on his fucking face. So Xia Lan. THat time if got chance to ham tum the sergent. I think he will die on the spot. Can you imagine 150 jumping jet, 4-5sets x20 of push up,sit and run around the area before u go for breakfast. I remenber that morning in my brain. My whole platoon that morning cannot even eat the Fried rice. No appetite to eat. hahaa</p>
              <p>FYI, i din undergo PTP and straight to BMT. I was from Leadership batch (Direct Enhanced). That why the sergent wack us hard.</p>
