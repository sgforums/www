Anyway - the platoon has manpower shortages as described in the book - I assume they are short of a PC as well.<br><br>Yes, they have similar problems. In fact, during the 1st gulf war, we watched their breaching exercise on CNN and it was almost the same as we did ours. Too bad I cannot remember the Marine unit that come over for joint training right after the war - could have been the same 2/7 Marine unit as the writer. They were still wearing the desert camo and showed us pictures of their babies/kids they have not seen in months.</div>
