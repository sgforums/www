              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Hi everyone, I am aiming to go OCS and I know there is alot of factors that affects whether one can enter OCS. Things like gold IPPT, situational test, peer appraisals, education level, IQ test. I am mentally prepared for all these! But there is something that has been bugging me for quite sometime which i regarding the Security Clearnace. I am going to enlist soon in few days time. but I heard that security clearance is a very important that affects whether you can enter OCS.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Personally, I have a clean record. Have not get into any trouble before. But however, my dad is a drug offender and has been going in and out the jail a few times before when I am young. But he has clean records for 7 years now. Will the crimes that he did affect my clearance? Can I still go OCS because of this?</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">It is really unfair if I can't enter not because I got no ability to. But can't enter because of what my dad did in the past. Can someone enlighten me on this? On whether I still have a chance to go OCS. Or do anyone know if there are others whom father is a ex convict and still manged to enter OCS.</p>

                  period of 5 years starting from either the date of sentence (for cases 
                  where no term of imprisonment is imposed) or the date of release from 
                  legal custody. During the 5 years, the person must not be convicted of 
                  another crime, or be unlawfully at large for a crime. He must not be 
                  detained or placed under police supervision under the Criminal Law 
                  (Temporary Provisions) Act, and he must not be subject to supervision or
                   admitted to a drug rehabilitation centre or other centre for drug or 
                  inhalant abuse.</p>

                  record spent on any of the grounds in section 7C , which are that -- </p>

They are murder, kidnapping, rape, theft, cheating, trespass, mischief, forgery, counterfeiting, amongst others.<br><br>    <br><strong>What are the offences specified in the Third Schedule?</strong><br>    <br>The Third Schedule lists out the offences for which a criminal record cannot be spent, such as drug trafficking, rioting, culpable homicide, causing grievous hurt, sexual offences, gang-robbery, amongst others.<br><br>    <br><strong>Is the record of an offence not found in the First and Second Schedules of the Registration of Criminals Act considered as a criminal record?</strong><br>    <br>A record of an offence not included in the Schedules of the RCA (i.e. a non-registrable offence) will not be considered a criminal record. The term "criminal record" is defined as records of convictions for offences registered under the Registration of Criminals Act.</p>
              <p><br><strong>What is the effect of a spent record?</strong><br>    <br>A person with a spent record is deemed to have no such record and may lawfully not disclose the spent record for all purposes, except in the case of:<br><br>i) any investigation by a person authorised under the law;<br><br>ii) any prosecution against the person for any offence;<br><br>iii) any proceedings before a court; and<br><br>iv) any appointment to an office or employment in a profession for which the person may be disqualified under written law by reason of that conviction.<br><br>    <br><strong>If a person's criminal record is "spent", does it mean that he can answer "no" when asked if he has a criminal record in an employment application?</strong><br>    <br>A person who has a criminal record that is rendered spent can say "no" when asked if he has a criminal record in an employment application.<br><br>    <br><strong>If a person's criminal record is "spent", does it mean that he can answer "no" when asked if he has ever been convicted in a court of law in an employment application?</strong><br>    <br>A person's criminal record that is rendered spent does not change the fact that he had been convicted before. Hence the person has to answer "yes" when asked if he has ever been convicted in a court of law.<br><br>    <br><strong>Does a person need to apply to the Police for his record to be rendered spent? How would a person know whether his criminal record has been rendered spent?</strong><br>    <br>There is no need for a person to apply to the Police for his record to be rendered spent. Those who qualify will automatically have their criminal record rendered spent.<br> <br>A person may use the electronic portal which was launched by the Police to allow ex-offenders round-the-clock convenience to check whether his personal criminal records have been marked as spent. The electronic portal can be accessed via the internet websites: http://www.spf.gov.sg or http://www.ecitizen.gov.sg , by using the NRIC number as the login ID and SingPass (Singapore Personal Access) as the authentication password. More information on SingPass can be found on the SingPass website at http://www.ecitizen.gov.sg/singpass/index.htm. <br><br>Alternatively, any person who has no internet access or wish to clarify the contents of the information on the electronic portal may call the inquiry hotline at 6557 5700 during office hours.<br> <br>    <br><strong>What will happen to a person's registrable particulars such as fingerprints, photographs and body samples records if his criminal record is rendered spent?</strong><br>    <br><br>A criminal record that has been rendered spent is not erased from the Register of Criminals but is marked as spent. Thus, the registrable particulars collected as part of that criminal record will still remain in the Register of Criminals kept by the Police.<br><br> <br><strong>Will pending cases against me during or after the 5-year crime-free period affect my chances of my criminal record of a previous conviction being rendered spent?</strong><br>    <br>A criminal record becomes spent when a person satisfies a crime-free period of 5 years. If, during the 5-year period, the person is convicted in court of another registrable offence, or if he is unlawfully at large in respect of a registrable offence, his record will not become spent. In addition, if a person has an outstanding warrant of arrest, he will be disqualified from having his record spent as long as the warrant remains outstanding. However, if the person has satisfied the crime-free period, his record will become spent and any subsequent conviction or warrant of arrest will not revive the earlier record.<br><br>    <br><strong>Will a person who had previously been placed on probation be eligible for his criminal record to be rendered spent?</strong><br>    <br>A probation is not considered a conviction and thus not a criminal record.<br><br>    <br><strong>Can a person's criminal record be rendered spent if he has just missed the criteria by a few days or by a few hundred dollars? Is there an appeal channel?</strong><br>    <br>A person who is disqualified by the conditions stated in section 7C of the Registration of Criminals Act can apply to the Commissioner of Police for their criminal records to be rendered spent.<br><br>    <br><strong>How would a person's spent criminal records affect his ability to engage in activities overseas, for example, employment, immigration, studies, adoption? Is it legal for the person to declare that he has no criminal record to the foreign government authorities, that is, will he be liable for committing an offence?</strong><br>    <br>The Registration of Criminals Act is a domestic law which applies within Singapore. If a person is employed by an employer in Singapore under Singapore law but posted overseas, the RCA applies, and he may lawfully not disclose a spent record when asked about his criminal record. However, if the matter is not governed by Singapore law, then the answer will depend on the law in the relevant foreign country.<br><br>    <br><strong>What is the Home Team doing to educate the public and employers on giving ex-offenders a second chance?</strong><br>    <br>The Home Team will engage employers to encourage them to ask about "criminal records" instead of "previous convictions" in their employment questionnaires.<br><br>    <br><strong>Will the public be in danger (compromise on public safety) because ex-offenders are getting their records spent, for this may mean that there is no prior knowledge of their criminal past and hence little room for taking precautions against them re-offending in future?</strong><br>    <br>While the government is committed to giving ex-offenders a second chance, public safety remains the key concern. This is why only records of less serious crimes are allowed to be rendered spent. These are very minor crimes such as shop theft where public safety would not be compromised even with the implementation of the policy to render these records spent. Criminal records of serious crimes such as culpable homicide and drug trafficking will not qualify to be rendered spent.<br>    <br><strong>Why can't the government take a more liberal approach by expunging the criminal record of minor offences?</strong><br>    <br>There is a need to strike a balance between the interest of ex-offenders and the interest of employers and the concerns of society. As this is a new initiative, the government has decided to adopt a more cautious approach by providing for records to be spent instead of expunged. The scheme will be regularly reviewed and the expunging of criminal records can be considered in the future.</p>

              <p>The Singapore system of meritocracy does not link any person's record to their family/relatives/parents...</p>
              <p>We do not practice a class system.</p>
              <p>There'll be security clearance checks when considering people's postings to certain units. While the method of assessment is obviously classified, it pertains mainly to whether you're in danger of compromising Singapore's national security to foreign powers, etc. (ie. it checks your family background for potential links to groups/people overseas).</p>
              <p>Once again, your future is your own. Do not be unduly afraid or bothered. Nowhere in the govt system do they check on who your parents/relatives are and affect your future.</p>

              <p>Not true. I had BMT mates who were scholarly, straight As for 'A' levels, from top JC, but weak, fail IPPT - complete nerd.</p>
              <p>He tried to sign on as an officer. He didn't even make it to be a specialist. They deemed him unsuitable for leadership.</p>
              <p>Contrary to popular belief, officers only get selected if they have leadership qualities and are physically fit - that's why you will never see weak/obese/nerd officers.</p>
