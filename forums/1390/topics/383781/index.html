              <p>Basic Military Training (BMT) equips recruits with the basic military skills to become combat-ready soldiers. It also aims to give them a sense of purpose and a positive experience in their National Service. To better engage and train recruits, the SAF undertakes periodic reviews to strengthen the BMT system. <br><br>The current review was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, the SAF looked at how recruits undergoing the 4-week Physical Training Phase (PTP) could be better prepared for BMT. This resulted in the introduction of an 8-week PTP which will raise PTP recruits' physical fitness to a level that is comparable to their direct-BMT peers'. The new PTP programme will begin in December 2009. The second phase of the review focused on customising the other BMT programmes to engage recruits and prepare them better for their subsequent combat, combat support and combat service support roles. The BMT system will now include a new 19-week BMT for obese recruits with effect from February 2010, a new 9-week BMT for PES B2 recruits from June 2010, a new 9-week BMT for PES C recruits from June 2010, and a new 4-week BMT for PES E recruits. There will be no change to the standard BMT for PES A/B recruits. <br><br><strong>19-week BMT Programme for Obese Enlistees</strong><br><br>The new 19-week BMT programme will be conducted for recruits whose Body Mass Index (BMI) exceeds 27. This BMT programme is designed to help obese recruits improve their physical fitness incrementally while equipping them with basic soldiering skills and knowledge. Over time, obese recruits have shown that they can achieve optimal fitness levels and weight loss in about 19 weeks, hence the 19-week BMT programme for this group of recruits. <br><br><strong>9-week BMT Programme for PES B2 Enlistees</strong><br><br>The new 9-week BMT programme will be conducted for recruits who are medically fit for deployment in selected combat and combat support vocations, such as signal operators, combat medics and naval system operators. These recruits will be given a new medical classification of PES B2, in place of the existing PES C1 classification. This is to ensure that the medical classification of our soldiers is consistent with their deployment. The new 9-week programme will include customised physical training, as well as basic combat training to prepare them for their combat and combat support roles. <br><br><strong>9-week BMT Programme for PES C Enlistees</strong><br><br>The new 9-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES C recruits. This programme will include light physical training and vocational training to prepare them for combat service support vocations, such as service medic, and those related to logistics and administration such as supply assistants.<br><br><strong>4-week BMT Programme for PES E Enlistees</strong><br><br>The new 4-week BMT programme will be conducted for PES E recruits. This programme will focus on National Education, SAF core values, regimentation and discipline, as well as vocational training to prepare recruits for combat service support vocations.<br><br>Source:<br><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2009/dec/04dec09_fs.html">www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2009/dec/04dec09_fs.html</a></p>

              <p id="articlecontent"><span>SINGAPORE: Changes will be made to the Basic Military Training programme for National Service recruits from 2010. <br><br>There will be a new 19-week BMT for obese recruits, and either a 9-week or 4-week customised BMT for other classes of recruits to better prepare them for their subsequent combat, combat support and combat service support roles. <br><br>Releasing details on Friday from the its two-stage review, the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) said recruits whose Body Mass Index (BMI) exceeds 27 will have to undergo the new 19-week BMT programme that is designed to help them improve their physical fitness incrementally while equipping them with basic soldiering skills and knowledge. <br><br>This is with effect from February 2010. <br><br>It said the programme was introduced after a review to strengthen the BMT system as it was seen that over time, obese recruits have shown that they can achieve optimal fitness levels and weight loss in about 19 weeks. <br><br>Recruits who are medically fit for deployment in selected combat and combat support vocations, such as signal operators, combat medics and naval system operators, will be given a new medical classification of PES B2, in place of the existing PES C1 classification. <br><br>The SAF said this is to ensure that the medical classification of the soldiers is consistent with their deployment and the recruits will undergo a new 9-week programme from June 2010, that will include customised physical training, as well as basic combat training to prepare them for their combat and combat support roles. <br><br>As for those who are placed as PES C recruits, they too will undergo a new 9-week BMT programme from June 2010, with light physical and vocational training. This is to prepare them for combat service support vocations, such as service medic, and those related to logistics and administration such as supply assistants. <br><br>There's also a new 4-week BMT programme that will be conducted for PES E recruits, focusing on National Education, SAF core values, regimentation and discipline, as well as vocational training to prepare recruits for combat service support vocations. <br><br>Colonel Ng Wai Kit, assistant chief of general staff (training), SAF, said: "The latest changes to the BMT system begin with the introduction of the physical training phase to prepare our recruits who are less fit, and raise their fitness level to that which is comparable with their direct BMT peers." <br><br>There will be no change to the standard BMT for PES A/B recruits. <br><br>In the first phase of the review, the SAF looked at how recruits undergoing the 4-week Physical Training Phase (PTP) could be better prepared for BMT. <br><br>This resulted in the introduction of an 8-week PTP, which will raise PTP recruits' physical fitness to a level that is comparable to their direct-BMT peers. <br><br>The new PTP programme will begin in December 2009. <br></span></p>

              <p>1/2 yr BMT would be too long and most vocational courses are just 3 months long. If u wan a longer BMT, they will just increase NS duration because having NSFs working in units for just 1 yr is too short a duration to clear all the training or work required depending on combat or CSS vocations.</p>

              <p>Posting etc would seem to be quite messy and i do wonder how the training schools are all going to cope since they will need to cater to all the different POP and POC timings due to all the new changes.</p>

              <p>I think training schools with courses lasting 3 months or more
              will continue to follow the old quarterly dispersal patterns, up
              till June 2010. I think such courses tend not to have a mixture of
              PES A/B and C, so there shouldn't be too many problems.</p>
              <p>Courses are storemen should be quite regular, so not too many
              problems there as well. </p>

              <p>Haha, technician course is 2-3 months long and they do contain a mixture of PES A/B/C and maybe E if i didn't remember what you told me wrongly.</p>

              <p>Not sure about now but during my time, we had about the same or even slightly more PES A/B technicians since we still need to go outfield at times and some of those that are excuse outfield would be unsuitable.</p>
