            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Guys,<br><br>As part of my uni thesis, I have recently co-patented a special flash autoclaving(steam heating) unit. It allows surgical instruments to be autoclaved/sterilized at half the time it used to be. This instrument is useful for all our brudders for field training or disaster relief cos you can autoclave it quickly and bring it into the battlefield. Hopefully, this will save more lives and limbs when we go outfield in case there is a shortage of sterilzed instruments. Dirty surgical instruments are the no.1 cause for gangrene and amputations....<br><br>The only problem I face before bringing the technology back home is that i need to noe if SAF medical centres still use autoclaving for surgical instruments, this is becos i'm ending my stint here and i need to hammer down the dimensions for the unit... Hopefully any brothers working as Army medics or even best Medical Officers can provide some information on how we do our autoclaving so that i can adjust accordingly. If you can Email me or IM me on gmail, that would be the best... Lets make SAF stronger and save more of our brother's lives and limbs....<br><br>My contact details are as follows:<br><br>Email: Tabletop@gmail.com<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Icic, thanks for the information bro. Granted that autoclaving cannot be used in the field, but this device can still be used in a Medical Centre or Field Hospital Setting. Sydex and other chemical sterilization processes takes a long time to kill all possible pathogens and you have to clean up the instruments nevertheless. Sydex takes about 10 mins to sterilize instruments just for normal pathogens but 10 hours or more for spore like pathogens. Hopefully our enemies won't use Anthrax on us.<br><br>What can be practical would be Flash sterilization of the instruments using this device within at the HQ level and putting them in a sealed containers for use when needed.<br><br>But yeah, you are right that this device might not be practical at the battalion level during outfield, perhaps more at the HQ and medical centre level cos flash sterilization can help to cut waiting time and it's used more for orthopedic/emergency related surgical instruments where you have alot of bone/muscle tissue remants on the instruments and you want to reuse them asap on the next patient.</div>
