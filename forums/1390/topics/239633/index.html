            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Since the beginning of this year, all Army recruits have been issued new and enhanced personal equipment that will help them meet the operational demands of the Army today.<br><br>The new equipment includes a Load Bearing Vest (LBV) which replaces the traditional webbing, a larger field pack, a new torch light and a multi-function knife.<br><br>Lieutenant-Colonel (LTC) Kong Kam Yean, Head Plans of 9th Singapore Division/Infantry, explained that the introduction of the enhanced personal equipment was part of the Army's effort to transform into the third-generation fighting force.<br><br>"The third-generation soldier is required to meet varied operational profiles," said LTC Kong. "And he needs to be flexible in his use of equipment according to what the mission demands of him."<br><br>A team of senior Warrant Officers and Specialists was responsible for coming up with the design and new features of the enhanced equipment.<br><br>At the initial stage, the team, known as the Infantry Personal Equipment Experts (INPEX), asked themselves what they would like to see in the new equipment. After a prototype was produced, the equipment was issued to an Army battalion for the soldiers to test and use.<br><br>From the feedback received, further enhancements were made and the equipment was then given to another Army battalion for testing.<br><br>This process was repeated about seven times with different formations of the Army.<br><br>In the end, the new and enhanced personal equipment like the LBV was finalised and issued to recruits for their Basic Military Training.<br><br>The LBV offers a lot of flexibility to the soldiers. Unlike the previous webbing, which consists of a fixed number of pouches and thin shoulder straps, the LBV allows soldiers to customise the pouches that they want to carry.<br><br>This is done through the use of a unique Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment (MOLLE) system. Using the MOLLE system, soldiers can choose the number of pouches that they wish to use and attach these onto their LBV.<br><br>For example, an ammunition pouch can be attached onto the LBV by weaving the pouch strap over the LBV several times. No additional knots or hooks are needed to firmly secure the ammunition pouch, and it will be firmly attached to the LBV within seconds.<br><br>"This customisation feature allows the soldier to perform specific roles during combat," said LTC Kong.<br><br>Therefore, a soldier using the M203 will have an M203 ammunition pouch fixed onto his LBV, while a SAW gunner will fix a SAW ammunition pouch onto his own LBV.<br><br>Another new feature of the LBV is that it comes with a durable hydration bag that can store three litres of water. A soldier can drink water while keeping his hands firmly on his weapon during his operations.<br><br>Another personal equipment is the new field pack. The new field pack is 80 per cent bigger than the previous one. It also sports the MOLLE system for more pouch add-ons.<br><br>That, however, does not mean that soldiers have to carry more equipment.<br><br>INPEX's Master Warrant Officer (MWO) Ho Kian Lee revealed that soldiers testing the enhanced personal equipment were worried the extra space meant they would have more things to carry.<br><br>"That was one of their worries but this was looked into because in terms of how much a soldier can carry, we have certain guidelines for that," said MWO Ho.<br><br>He explained that the primary function of the bigger field pack was to allow soldiers to fit all their equipment into the field pack.<br><br>When the recruits eventually get posted to their new vocations after their Basic Military Training, they might be required to carry additional equipment.<br><br>A combat medic, said MWO Ho, would have to carry a stretcher around and it would look unprofessional to sling it on the back. With the new field pack, the medic can put the stretcher into the field pack and still have ample space for other contents.<br>The old field pack was top-loaded, meaning content could only be unloaded from the top opening. The new field pack is not only top-loaded but also front-loaded. Therefore, if soldiers wish to reach for something at the bottom of the field pack, they can unzip the front side of the bag to gain access to the bottom portion without having to first unload all the contents.<br><br>A water-proof torchlight with changeable coloured shades and a seven-function multi-purpose knife were also introduced and will form part of the enhanced personal equipment.<br><br>The introduction of the enhanced personal equipment was welcomed by the recruits.<br><br>Recruit Muhammad Redzahuddin bin Jaafar had used the webbing during his secondary school co-curricular activity days with the National Cadet Corps (NCC).<br><br>After a few weeks of using the LBV and new field pack since enlisting for National Service, he gave a thumb's-up for the enhanced equipment.<br><br>He said, "I feel comfortable wearing the LBV because it has wider shoulder pads.<br><br>"I also like the water bag, so when I go for route marches, I need not worry about dehydration."<br><br>As for regulars and Operationally-Ready National Servicemen, LTC Kong said they will receive their enhanced equipment at a later date.<br><br>The enhanced personal equipment will also be made available at SAF.eMart outlets subsequently.</blockquote><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/publications/cyberpioneer/news/2007/February/21feb07_news.-imindefParsSub-0001-TextImage.imindefParsSubtextimage.gif"><br>Recruits sporting the LBV and the improved field pack (left) and the current webbing and field pack (right).<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/publications/cyberpioneer/news/2007/February/21feb07_news.-imindefParsSub-0002-TextImage.imindefParsSubtextimage.gif"><br>The improved field pack (right) is 80 per cent larger than the current one.<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/publications/cyberpioneer/news/2007/February/21feb07_news.-imindefPars-000100-TextImage.imindefParstextimage.gif"><br>Recruits marching with the new enhanced personal equipment.<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/publications/cyberpioneer/news/2007/February/21feb07_news.-imindefPars-000101-TextImage.imindefParstextimage.gif"><br>Using the MOLLE system, a pouch like this is weaved onto the LBV using the pouch straps.<br><br>Can't stand this you know... imagine my torture in packing my field pack during bmt... now... got extra space somemore...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>ok i stop whining.</div>
