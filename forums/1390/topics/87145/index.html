            <div class='col-md body'>SAF switches to paper meal boxes, food kept warm for up to 4 hours<br><br>SINGAPORE : It may sound a little ironic, but Singapore Armed Forces' soldiers are getting even greener than before.<br><br>They are going to stop using styrofoam food containers and switch to eco-friendly paper ones.<br><br>A piping hot meal is one of the few pleasures that can boost the morale of soldiers out in the field.<br><br>To make sure cookhouse meals get to the troops before they turn cold, the Army has switched to a new locally-designed paper meal box which can keep food warm for up to four hours.<br><br>Lieutenant-Colonel Sebastian Tan, Head of Material Branch at Army HQ Supply and Transport, said: "Normally out-rations are packed in the cookhouse in the unit and some of the training areas can be quite far away from the cookhouse. It may take one to two hours to deliver the food to the soldier. By the time the soldier gets to eat it, the food may not be warm enough."<br><br>"The food is definitely much warmer than what we get, it is tastier also."<br><br>"I can see no spills and so it is easier to eat, so I feel it is much better."<br><br>From August, the entire Armed Forces, from the army to the navy to the airforce, will be using paper meal boxes.<br><br>This means all servicemen going out on field exercises will be getting their meals piping hot!<br><br>The Environment Council has welcomed the SAF's move to use green products, especially since it uses five million pieces each year.<br><br>Mr Howard Shaw, Executive Director of Singapore Environment Council, said: "One of the things that we address very strongly is to use less disposables, and if you are going to use disposables, use the right kind of disposables.<br><br>"The advantage of paper packaging is that it is biodegradable, whereas the polystyrene or plastic equivalent will remain in ecosystem indefinitely."<br><br>Also getting increasingly popular, disposable plates, bowls and cutlery made from rice husks, sugar cane and corn!<br><br>One foodstall in Jurong is one of those that has switched to using these locally-designed products.<br><br>Not only do they look and feel like regular plates, they are even sturdier than disposable ones.<br><br>The only drawback is they cost eight times more than styrofoam plates, but the stallowner says they are still cost effective!<br><br>Bernie Utchenik, Foodstall Owner, said: "For us, it is very quick and easy, we do not have to hire a cleaner to wash our plates. Our water bill is lower than anyone else around here."<br><br>To take the recycling process one step further, the manufacturer is designing a machine which can grind all the plates and the food waste into powdered fertilisers. - CNA<br><br></div>
