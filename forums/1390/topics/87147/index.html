            <div class='col-md body'>On 17 May, Neo Tiew Town became a warzone. Soldiers from the <strong>Army Developmental Force </strong>equipped with sophisticated gear stormed a HDB block, using shotguns to blast locked doors open and fibrescopes to scout enemy positions while being backed up by covering machine-gun fire. As the building was secured, remote-controlled cars and tanks moved onto the streets to sweep the place of enemies.<br><br>What actually transpired was a live demonstration of urban warfare and the use of Fighting In Built-Up Areas (FIBUA) equipment in an enclosed combat environment, witnessed by Chief of Army (COA), MG Desmond Kuek and other commanders. In his visit, COA also heard a presentation on the key developments in urban operations and viewed static displays of the new equipment, weaponry and technology that will be used in the near future for such combat.<br><br>Chief among the new features is the <strong>Tactical Engagement System (TES)</strong>, which consists of all the new equipment and technology that will form soldierÂ’s standard gear during urban exercises. Replacing the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System, TES has the following new features:<br><br>Â· Shorter laser codes, for improved performance through smoke and foliage;<br>Â· Lighter equipment, as it replaces part of the Skeletal Battle Order;<br>Â· A sensor that can record the injuries sustained by a soldier;<br>Â· A software-configurable weapon which can be programmed to function like the various weapons used for real combat.&lt;<br><br>The urban warfare demonstration also marked <strong>the launch of Neo Tiew Town as a specially designed training ground with modified features to support training for urban operations.</strong> For example, the ground-level walls of the apartment blocks had been demolished to allow troops to observe the exercise, and a building was demarcated as a place of religion to make the soldiers aware of sensitivities in urban warfare.<br><br>2SG Dominic Teo, one of the soldiers who took part in the demonstration, said, Â“The other training grounds for urban warfare cater more for individual drills. For integrated and realistic exercises, Neo Tiew Town is the best.Â” He also thinks highly of the TES, saying, Â“It is much more flexible, with the functions more realistic - it can tell you if you have received light injuries, or heavy injuries.Â”<br><br>The development and improvement in training facilities and equipment to meet future challenges for urban warfare indeed shows Our Army moving decisively forward on its transformation journey.<br><br>-ANI</div>
