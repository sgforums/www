              <p>Hey guys, I need to seek help on a very serious issue. I got
              heat stroke a few weeks ago due to heat stroke in my military
              exercise with guards course on the final week. i ooced and was like
              unconcious for like 6 hours before waking up in Tan Tock Seng
              Hospital, hospitalised for 6 days. someone told me like heat stroke
              would land one into e1l9 pes status but so far i've been retraining
              ever since the incident. however, i have been feeling chest pain
              and my heart throbbing as though its adrenalin rush every moment. i
              pant when i walk. BUT, the medical examinations says my heart is
              alright. repeating the course is worse enough but the PAIN, no!
              simply unacceptable. someone suggest a way to downpes. i cant carry
              on but there is no light at the end of the tunnel..</p>

              There is actually a genetic disease with excess perspiration called hyperhydrosis. These people can sweat excessively to beyond dehydration. 
              
              Like an opened tap that cannot be closed, these people have excess sweating on hands, feets, armpits, chest and back. They can get dehydrated by they forget to drink water. 
              
              So if you have that you can downgrade.
