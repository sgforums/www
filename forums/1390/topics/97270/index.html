            <div class='col-md body'>ok.. what heck language is Armskote?<br><br>before i went in the army.... the place to store arms is called arms room, arms vault or arms safe. but i never heard of armskote till i was in the army...<br><br>so i wondered...and checked a few dictionary... there is no such word as Armskote.    Arms Kote.... "kote" isn't a work.<br><br>the other thing.... you place telt or talc or teld on your map....<br>but what exactly is it????<br><br>the "official" spelling was "unveiled" in the book "shoulder to shoulder" and a NSman described the times when he had to telt the map....<br><br>but there is no such word as "telt"<br><br>In sispec..... those warrants spelt it as TALC....  so i looked up the dict and it says talc is a mineral used for talcum powder or could be applied thinly on paper for protection. but i cannot see how TALC can be equivalent to "polyethylene".<br><br>so what the heck is "telt"? "talc"<br><br>i kinda guess if talc was a acronym like "tactical analysis liner chart"?? hahaah.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I asked around for general agreement before posting these:<br><br>"WO" stands for "Wash Out", which is a standard reference for a zero score. Back with the more primitive, manual-labour shooting ranges of the '70s - plywood targets, butt parties, signal-line comms, hot/stuffy/polluting conditions - the butt-party officer had to relay the scores back to the command post via telejay. The results started to recite tauntingly back as "wowo" (rhymed with zero), which in turn was scorned further by instructors - or among the peng themselves - as "bobo" (better cadenced with "bozo", or clown).<br><br>"Armskote" is army lingo for "Armaments Store", &amp; it doesn't completely refer to the armoury either. Mobilised reservists, when ordered to load up store when reporting back, could be directed to the garage "armskote" by the senior NCOs, i.e. the packed crates containing various shrinked-wrapped equipment &amp; weapons. Also, it's not just rifles that are kept inside the armskote either. Certain weapon-system parts (not sure I should name them) are also locked up there, instead of in the less-secure CQ store or optical store.<br><br>"Talc", the correct spelling, is obviously derived from "Plastic Talc". It wasn't that popular when used as a verb during my time - eg. "to talc a map" (as opposed to "to wrap a map in (plastic) talc" - though it must be mentioned that only ops-room people spoke that lingo, compared to orderly-room or company-line personnel. I dunno if "plastic talc" is a misnomer, since it's known more as "PVC roll" in the outside world. Talc itself is a mineral that could be utilized to help make many things, including translucent paper, so maybe that's the link.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Moxie:</div><div class="quote_body">I asked around for general agreement before posting these:<br><br>"WO" stands for "Wash Out", which is a standard reference for a zero score. Back with the more primitive, manual-labour shooting ranges of the '70s - plywood targets, butt parties, signal-line comms, hot/stuffy/polluting conditions - the butt-party officer had to relay the scores back to the command post via telejay. The results started to recite tauntingly back as "wowo" (rhymed with zero), which in turn was scorned further by instructors - or among the peng themselves - as "bobo" (better cadenced with "bozo", or clown).<br><br>"Armskote" is army lingo for "Armaments Store", &amp; it doesn't completely refer to the armoury either. Mobilised reservists, when ordered to load up store when reporting back, could be directed to the garage "armskote" by the senior NCOs, i.e. the packed crates containing various shrinked-wrapped equipment &amp; weapons. Also, it's not just rifles that are kept inside the armskote either. Certain weapon-system parts (not sure I should name them) are also locked up there, instead of in the less-secure CQ store or optical store.<br><br>"Talc", the correct spelling, is obviously derived from "Plastic Talc". It wasn't that popular when used as a verb during my time - eg. "to talc a map" (as opposed to "to wrap a map in (plastic) talc" - though it must be mentioned that only ops-room people spoke that lingo, compared to orderly-room or company-line personnel. I dunno if "plastic talc" is a misnomer, since it's known more as "PVC roll" in the outside world. Talc itself is a mineral that could be utilized to help make many things, including translucent paper, so maybe that's the link. </div></blockquote>I am still not convinced about the armskote. how does it even sound close to Armanents Store. Anyway, i have this impression that SAF will use British Army lingo for such things. But i do not hear Armskote in the brit lingo.<br><br>Why i think saf uses brit lingo because of certain words.... eg, LEFT-ten-nant as opposed to LIEU-TAN-NENT.  Then "indenting" stores compared to "procuring"...  "section" to "squad". etc etc.<br><br>As for talc....  hmm it's really a mystery... maybe we should find out from other army's how they would plan their overlays... because i doubt they would use plastic overlays for planning.<br><br>moreever....  the "correct" spelling for talc is telt.</div>

A "kote" refers to a storage place.Yes, there are people who are trained as armskotemen and there are others who are Supply Asst  but are appointed as armskotemen.Armament Specs are in charge of these armskotemen, sort of like their sect. comd.</div>
