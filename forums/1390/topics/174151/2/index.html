            <div class='col-md body'>Gentleman, you want to know more about 4 SIR, take it from me or pkchukiss. I am the outgoing Asst Chief Clerk and pkchukiss is an outgoing Scout...meaning, we are rotting at a corner of 4SIR waiting to ORD.<br><br>Firstly, DuanChengFeng, the NEW CO is not a CDO Officer. That one is YOUR reservist CO.<br><br>Secondly, yes the RSM is an Indian. Very nice guy, but then don't fool around with him. Trust me on that lar, I am a specialist.<br><br>Thirdly, all the new OCs are the pervious 2IC and hence, they are all very nice ppl. The OC that DuanChengFeng mentioned, his previous appointment was SAFDB Deputy Commandant, so I advise all that go his company to be vigiliant.<br><br>I no need to tell you much on the location and the surrounding is like since DuanChengFeng and pkchukiss has talk about it at length. But did I mentioned that one of the company have got a female specialist...go figure which company.<br><br>If you need directions to the camp, I believe CMPB had mailed you the map that took 1 enlistee, 1 specialist and 1 officer to prepare, photocopy, staple and 2 enlistee to fold. In short, effort had been put in to ensure tat even before you enlist you are welcome to the eagle family and the next 2 years it is gonna be hell of an experience; just like anyone else that had been through NS.<br><br></div>
