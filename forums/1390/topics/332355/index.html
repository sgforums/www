So technically, back to company line, they are not in the wrong asking you to do upper limb training. Anything happen to you because of the condition you report sick about and while doing upper limb training is answerable by the MO or the doctor. Why he give a wrong diagnosis of the condition and did give you inadquate or wrong excuse. If you are still made to do lower limb training while excuse lower limb, then it is the commander that made you do those training defying the MO's order and should be subsequently held responsible.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>back in 1G Army, deaths are not often publicised. Either back then its very sensitive or secret or the fact that technology not so high tech..so very hard to whistle-blow.. Now every man and his dog got a phone an can easily tip off the media. I remember when a tonner crashed in Tekong in  04 or 05 and a few guys got hurt.. 2 hours later it was out in the news. So now with every incident, MINDEF  will release the news instead cause hearing it first from a news agency would not sound too good for the public. my 0.2 cents anyway...</p></div>

              <p>The debate now is not really why he did chin up and die or he did sit ups then die or look at people do also die. I believe that he will die even if he is at home sleeping. The focus now is on the procedures.</p>
              <p>It has always been a tradition to force sick and injuried people to do things they can;t suppose to. Countless times have i seen people with excuse upper limb, excuse heavy loads being asked to 20+ 20kg water cans and other stores from place to place. The reason why this is so , is easy to understand. "Why ask fit personals that have trained all day to do all this tough labour. They are so tired after all the training. Use those pikachus to do the job so the rest can rest." However, the pivot of this balancing scale is not at the center, it is very taxing and painful for those who are injuried to do this tough jobs.</p>
              <p>How manys times have your 1 month MC being discounted to 1 week MC by the MOs or your 3 months excuse upper limb to 1 month ? MOs in camp always think that you are trying to keng when you see them. most only believe at most half of what you say. Whats more is that they don;t even believe what specialist tell them. Comeon, most of the MO are fresh out of thier course, if they so smart why aren't they all specialists.</p>
              <p>Does endosing MC in the medical centre value add the MC ? What rights do the MOs have to override MCs given by other doctors? All are doctors right? All of them also CPT in the army what. Become civilian then all of a sudden , all that they say not believeable ?  Like that government should ban all private clinics and change all hospitals to  army ones. why lets our people visit doctors that are "hiding" our conditions from us?</p>

              <p>For someone to be as weak as to die after 7 chin ups, anyone with IQ above 50 knows that he would have died running after the bus or during primary 3 PE lessons.</p>
              <p>Perhaps in view of the new breed of weak Singaporeans, we should reduce chin ups to 6 and not 7, and do 5 sit ups only. And run 200m. Maybe then, only maybe then not a SINGLE person will die for sure.</p>

              <p>When did I say that MOs are regulars or that they're not NSF? of cos i know they are NSFs. who dunno that? There are regular MOs but there are many times more NSF MOs. In fact the ratio is not even comparable. who dunno that</p>
              <p>For another fellow NSF to form such a poor judgment abt the soldiers in general as he diagnoses them, when he himself is an NSF just shows how blatant the kenging culture is. Thanks for reinforcing my point.</p>

              <p>Point is, the prevalence of kengsters does not equate to dismissing the oath one takes as a doctor lightly.</p>
              <p>There is a difference between manpower requirement in peace, and wartime. Get the priorities right, because there seems to be a gap, and a glaring one.</p>
              <p>Secondly, if you're an NSF who always kengs, chances are, it will come back to bite you in the ass when it's your turn to be credibly sick.</p>
