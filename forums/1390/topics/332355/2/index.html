              <p>Point is, the prevalence of kengsters does not equate to
                  dismissing the oath one takes as a doctor lightly.</p>
              <p>There is a difference between manpower requirement in peace, and
                  wartime. Get the priorities right, because there seems to be a gap,
                  and a glaring one.</p>
              <p>Secondly, if you're an NSF who always kengs, chances are, it
                  will come back to bite you in the ass when it's your turn to be
                  credibly sick.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>There's no MO who will diagnose a truly ill soldier who's vomitting blood errorneously. That'll be taking the oath lightly. If a dispropotionately number of a sample size has shown to be a certain way, logic requires a thinking person to veer towards that if he was on the 50-50 mark between belief and disbelief.</p>
              <p>Second, there is NO difference in manpower requirement in peace and war time. So i guess you think you can have an army in a certain way in peace time that will on auto mode be like Rambo in war time. Then I am relievef that you're a nobody in SAF.</p>
              <p>Third, NSF who always kengs where got kena bitten in the ass when he's credibly sick? If so then indeed you have proven that it is CORRECT for the MO to err on the side of skepticism. Its the MO's tendency to think a kengster is kenging so indeed when the one time he's not, he gets punished for his wrongdoing.</p>
              <p>Also, where got bite ass??? it costs the kengsters nothing to keng. their mentality is: if they dun try, the chance is 0%. if they try and fail, then they have to go back to try to be a real man who takes up his responsibility as a person. if they try and it works, hurray! so of cos they will try.</p>

              <p>Now you're speaking on the same page. It would be unfortunate to do so otherwise, which always lead to a credibility gap between policymaking and execution at the other end of the rope.</p>
              <p>But, and I say it with careful deliberation, the people at the bottom are able to shape policy even if it is from a reactionary perspective. On a slightly unrelated note, I'm sure you have heard of the notion of the "Strategic Corporal".</p>
              <p>Bottoms-up autonomy of action and decision can be a positive force as well. And similarly, it would be a mistake to dismiss all concerns from the ground, and label the view from the bottom as one clouded with jealousy. It could very well be miscommunication of values and lessons learnt, or even a deficit in the process of taking care of the men that prompt a "keng" mentality.</p>

              <p>Bottoms-up autonomy of action and decision can be a positive
              force as well. And similarly, it would be a mistake to dismiss all
              concerns from the ground, and label the view from the bottom as one
              clouded with jealousy. It could very well be miscommunication of
              values and lessons learnt, or even a deficit in the process of
              taking care of the men that prompt a "keng" mentality.</p>

              <p>touching further on what you say decisions from the top may complicate and add more work to the middle management, here's something to think abt.</p>
              <p>The bulk of the deadwood in SAF are concentrated in the middle management. Middle management is where you can find all the people who would not go beyond a certain rank so they're parked there. until their contract expires and they cease wasting taxpayers' $.So you'll find that in that zone you see the highest % of them there. of cos there are high fliers and they too have to go through their maj and ltc but because of the large number of deadwoods parked there, high fliers are a small %.</p>
