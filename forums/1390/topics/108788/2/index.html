He told us that we could take off our boots and squeeze-dry our socks and insoles. We all decided not to, for we knew it would soon rain again.<br><br>And so, we all watched as our PS sat on a boulder, took off his boots and socks, dried the insoles, etc etc.... and just as he finished tying the laces again, it started to rain again. Cat 1, no less.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>He looked at us with killer eyes.<br><br>"ANYONE WHO LAUGHS IS GONNA GEDDIT FROM ME!!!!!!!!"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tkw88:</div><div class="quote_body">For those of us who are "other ranks", we have come across officers whom we respect and officers whom we do not respect. Here's a true story about the latter.<br><br>Our reservist SIR was in ROC for ICT. During the initial phase of training, the S3 CPT (NS) walked around the training ground in his clean 4 and made all the super-intelligent remarks about how we should have done better -- "You should take cover over there", "You should this ...", "You should that ...". "What if the enemy were to do this &amp; that ..." Easy for him to say of course -- use mouth only.<br><br>Then came the interesting part. Time for battalion mission. Whole battalion got to be involved. So Bn S3 also need to walk for MTC. Well, many of us know the ROC terrain. Up &amp; down the hills. Most of us by that time already got used to the terrain. But not the Bn S3. He got so shagged that half way through he could not walked any more and sat at the side of the road to rest like a punctured tyre, right in front of all the men who continue moving forward.<br><br>Although it was night movement, it was bright enough for us to recognise him, and his 3 bars. Anyway, the revervist privates couldn't resist themselves -- they pretended they couldn't recognise him &amp; suanned, chided him as they walked past. Poor S3 CPT lan lan &amp; had to eat his humble pie.<br><br>On we went. Reached the first objective. The point company contacted enemy and got into a fire fight. Our company was behind. As usual, all of us proned whilst the point company is taking care of the enemy. The fire fight went on with sound of all the guns blazing, then we saw someone nodding his head in the prone position -- asleep &amp; snoring! It was our LTA (NS) OC.<br><br>Our OC is one of those kao bei kao bu officers whom men hate. So one of them picked some stones &amp; threw them at the back of OC's helmet. "Tok". "Tok". "Tok". The poor OC woked up after getting hit by a few stones -- but too blur &amp; confused &amp; didn't react... All of us had to control &amp; not laughed out loud.<br><br>They should make this a case study for the young cadets at OCS so that they learn to earn respect from the men that they have to lead.</div></blockquote>just curious was the OC one of your PCs during active service ? quite a number of times the projected OC of the reservist are supposed to be one of the NSF PCs who went for CTC, but quite of high percent don't return due to studies, so your OC might be a PC from some other Bn.<br><br>But chances your NS OC is supposed to be a garang officer as he has to be in the top 10% of his infantry cohort to go for the CTC.<br><br>oh well there are blacksheep all over. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A few funny incident that I can recall.....<br><br>I'm from Armour, AI to be precise. We used to carry a lot of food in our m113 (Lychees Longan, Bread etc ) during outfield.<br><br>One particular outfield, one of my platoon mate need to do big business, don't have tissue paper, grabbed one piece of gardenia bread as toilet paper. Comment from him was that it was the softest 'toilet paper' he ever used.<br><br>Another incident, we are at lugger/harbour (whatever) all tele-j were laid. CO walking around inspecting us. Saw my friend manning the tele-j.<br><br>CO: Yo! You know how toused the tele-j?<br>Man: Yes Sir! This sort of things idiot-proof one!<br>CO: Ok. Get your OC on the line.<br>Man: Yes Sir! .... Sir what is the telephone no?<br><br>Another incident, I(MG gunner) is assigned with 2 others to provide a support firing base while others advanced. After tracking a few km to our fire base, we realize that the 4 boxes of MG rounds we are carrying contains empty cartidges that we have picked up the morning before.. My PC make us shot "Bang! Bang!" all the way until the platoon complete their flanking assault.<br><br></div>

We were to go up to the instructors and do the 'e-spring, squeeze trigger' thing once we were done. The instructors were all having their fresh rations dinner then while sitting in a semicircle.<br><br>I accidentally dumped too much powder down there.... needless to say, when I did the drill in front of my instructors, the resulting 'mushroom cloud' was huge..... My instructors' food all got coated with the powder. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Needless to say, I had to carry on 30...... since I was LAW gunner some more, I had to lay the M16 across my hands and sling the LAW across my back.</div>
