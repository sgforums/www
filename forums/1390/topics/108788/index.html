            <div class='col-md body'>I remember seeing another thread like this a long time ago.... but I can't seem to find it. I had a lot of fun reading through the thread.<br><br>So anyway, let's all share our funny experiences during training. Outfield, in particular.<br><br>Let me start......<br><br>1. BMT outfield:<br><br>i. My batch was the first (and the last, if I'm not wrong) to do 10 days straight of outfield. It hardly rained when we were in camp, but we got 8 days of Cat 1 in the jungle. Needless to say, nearly half the company came down with flu by the end of the outfield. Yours truly included.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>ii. One night our harbouring area got invaded by wild boars. 'Sergeant! Wild boar! Wild Boar at Platoon 2!!!!' could be heard in one section of the campsite. After chasing them away, the specs returned to their area. Then, a few minutes later.....<br><br>'Sergeant! Wild boar at Platoon 4!!!!'<br><br>Then.....<br><br>'Sergeant! Wild boar at Platoon 1!!!'<br><br>Since the safety of the recruits was paramount, they decided to let us sleep in the training shed that night.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>2. Thailand:<br><br>I was digging my shellscrape in the soft, sandy ground. I was feeling really tired at that point in time. I was mechanically whacking my ET tool into the ground. I was so tired when suddenly..... wham! I whacked my ET blade straight into my shin.<br><br>When I examined the wound, I realised that blood was gushing out. Somehow I could still retrieve an FAD from my medical orderly pouch (I was the company medic), apply it to my shin and walk down to my Battalion Casualty Station without aid.<br><br>You should have seen the look on my MO's face when he examined the wound... priceless.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

I amazingly felt little pain as well. My MO explained that I had what is called a 'burst' wound. The ET blade had destroyed the nerve endings around the wound. That's why I felt little pain.<br><br>Anyway, the rest of you... share stories leh!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>funny...hmm...one incident i recalled was when my Bn was doing our BDE prof test, as the TAG platoon we were marshalling in the birds as usual, all went well till in typical SNAFU fashion, there was a chinook coming in with a MB jeep in a stick and wave not supposed to be on...god noes how in the world they bumped that flight in, but it was already 10pm, whereby the aread was pitch dark, the birds were using NVGs on IR Mode.<br><br>So when my marshaller was marshalling in the bird, he didnt judge the jeep height from the ground and gave the command to cut load...and the jeep dropped i think 3m ......my marshaller and i went..."HOLY SXXT !!! as the load was a 120 MM MB jeep with simulated rnds.amazingly the MB was still in one piece and could drive ....god knows what absorbed the impact...<br><br>2nd incident also within the same prof test, i was planting my men for my defence mission where 3 wild boars appeared at the rear of me and my runner...we walked away to avoid them and the followed, only for them to charge at us.So we ran and ran from 1 end of the defence line to the other end where we saw a puddle of muddy brackish water, and to hell with smell ..we jumped in ..and 1 of the boar jumped in and drowned  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>the funny thing was my whole platoon saw me and my runner running dame fast haha...3rd mission already..tired, and we were carrying our 900 series radios along with our SBOs ...and we still RAN ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guess it's no harm revealing the following since they happened many moons ago &amp; my unit's already stood down.<br><br>My reservist recce group got a lot of autonomy to move around &amp;, once night training were concluded, the 4 battery-line Land Rovers (&amp; the RSM vehicle) used to individually sneak out for baths, coffee-shop supper &amp; - if the deployment grounds are poor - find a secluded spot to retire for the night. Our favorite haunt for the latter was at Yishun Sports Stadium, a deserted place after midnight. We usually parked against a wall or pillar behind, stored the M16s "furthest inside" possible (usually under our fullpacks), rolled down/secured the back flaps, locked the vehicle doors, &amp; then slept on ponchos alongside. Not very tactical at all, but the mentality was we're all light sleepers &amp; would anyway be awake by 5:30am to drive back for stand-to. Sometimes a couple of us would stay up late to talk cock, &amp; thus act as indirect sentries too.<br><br>FWIW No trouble at all doing this through the years, but for 2 instances when it caused some mirth. Once was when we spent the night thus along the long stretch of Lim Chu Kang Road, with most of us "kooning" on the footpath - except for a signaller in the back of the Land Rover ... &amp; the driver who, during the middle of the night, climbed to sleep <strong>on top</strong> of it (with legs over the windscreen). There's the normal engine roar of the cars/trucks that occasionally zoomed past, but all of us to wake up when we sensed someone stopping. Turned out to be a police patrol; they said they respected being out of the SAF jurisdiction but advised us to rein in our driver's blatancy. Bit embarassing for my officer then, though we later looked back &amp; laughed over the affair.<br><br>The other incident took place in ROC. Same "SOP": 10km+ drive back to bath, too late for supper &amp; looking for cleaner places to sleep. The 1st night was at an unfinished condo block where we informed (&amp; bribed with combat rats) their guardpost, so no harm done. The 2nd night ended up more improvisory, cuz it was a small village &amp;, noting the ulu environs, we chose to park in a small lane &amp; grab about 4 hours' rest.<br><br>Quite dumb to admit this, but up to then it somehow escaped all of my recce group that we were in a foreign country! As chided by my fellow recce mates (when told what we did), all our standard precautions were a false sense of security - we could've been easily ambushed by delinquents, let alone secret-society thugs (which Taiwan still has a lot of) or, worse yet, the media if they spotted a scoop &amp; played up our "chin-chye" discipline.<br><br>All quite true - &amp; we made sure to sleep in with the rest of the unit thereafter -though in reality nothing really happened that night. There were some wild dogs on the loose but they didn't come near; what did wake us up was, I recall, a middle-aged woman nosily opening her shutters nearby to get to her van. She looked at us in stunned silence, before turning away as if to mind her business, but smiled when we caught her eye again with our greetings. It was already 1st light anyway - the sun rises at 5am over there. But, out of civility, we couldn't urinate/defecate anywhere &amp; had to find a convenient Mom-&amp;-Pop eating house to do our morning business. The one place we chose loved our spending breakfast money with them - there were 7 of us - but must've been befuddled at the sight of us, one-by-one, using its toilet!</div>

As usual, all of us proned whilst the point company is taking care of the enemy. The fire fight went on with sound of all the guns blazing, then we saw someone nodding his head in the prone position -- asleep &amp; snoring!
