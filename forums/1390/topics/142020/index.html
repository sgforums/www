Even showed the MO 16 pieces of X-rays I've taken over my short course of life. Then on Feb earlier this year, got a letter to report to Pasir Ris camp. Then did the interview and the MO asked if I have medical conditions, I highlighted my knee problems too.<br><br>Anyway, I heard from a clerk @ CMPB that if I haven't enter NS 1 year after a medical check-up, I'd have to go through it again before I get enlisted, is that true?<br><br>Think I'd go ahead and get the specialist report on my knee, cause sometime it hurts even when I walk, perhaps aggrevated by the Great Singapore Sales.</div>
