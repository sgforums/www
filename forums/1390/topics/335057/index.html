              <p>Incidentally, the comms tech who is attached to my workshop is also gg for night studies haha! But he is a regular who will be ORDing in OCT 09. I believe 6AMB deals with light arms and comms. The comms tech spec in my platoon comes from 63FMD.</p>

              <p>just a short introduction about myself.</p>
              <p>just OOTed after a week in BMT and got posted to a unit 1 week later.</p>
              <p>am currently doing OETI (Comms). my course officially starts on the 22nd Dec and ends 3 months later. subsequently will be having OJE (On Job Experience) for 2 months and afterwhich i guess that's when i'll be posted to my 'permanent' unit.</p>
              <p>i feel like doing a part-time degree during this period of time but i'm not sure if my final posting will be a 8-5 vocation as well. need advice on this <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>

              <p><br>If you remain Pes A/B then yes you will go to an enhanced batch. After which you will most likely be posted to a combat vocation. When you will do your recourse is up to you. You must first pass your BMT Recourse FFI. You will fail it if you are still seeing a specialist. I highly recommend you to downpes to Pes C so that you can remain in the AMBs while attending a much easier Pes C recourse batch (no confinement week, no recruit haircut etc).</p>
              <p>In my unit (1AMB), quite a number of people are doing night studies. You will need to get your DC's (engineering equivalent of combat's OC) approval first. Try it once you get posted to a FMD.</p>

              <p>Wrong. It is up to your immediate superior to determine if you can go off earlier for classes.</p>

              <p>I think it is only of privilege that any servicemen are granted for night classes/courses and any other activities by their superior. It is mandatory to serve. The thread starter feels like taking up PT degree course and assume that if his posting is 8-5 vocation, it will enhance his chances.</p>

              <p><br>9/10 times, you will be allowed to go for your night classes/driving class. And generally, you might even be excused from overtime etc. It depends on your superior.  </p>
