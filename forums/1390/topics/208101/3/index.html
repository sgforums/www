(Except for Sweden, which I couldn't understand why its in "perilous situation") Over the years since our independence, we had develop a much closer relationship with our most potential aggressor, Malaysia and Indonesia than say Israel could ever hope for with perhaps <strong>Iran</strong>. However, one of the main factor that made this possible was our NS policy which directly contributed to our military defence. Our independence coinncide with the period of de-colonisation where a good number of former colonies were thrown into turmoil immediately after their colonial master withdrew. It was also a period where Indonesia lay claims to a large number of these decolonised terriority such as Aceh and East Timour. There was geniue cause then to believe that we could be a target. And indeed, during the 60s till 70s there were a few operations launched against us.<br>Increasing our military defence through NS then was also to prepare against any possible communists attacks which was a common cause of concern during the cold war period. MCPs and Viet Congs were all not too far away both in terms of geography and time.<br><br>More importantly, a relatively strong military defence will be a good deterence for any potential aggressor. As a Singaporean scholar had pointed out, our military's role then was like a scorpion sting, although we caannot neccesary defeat our enemy, we certaintly can make them pay such prices that they would rather not invade.<br><br>One might then ask what is the purpose of NS now then? Earlier on, I had used the example of Israel's relationship with Iran (in bold). Ironically, 30 years ago, the two states were the best of friends in the middle east. Iran was the first and few middle east state to recognise Israel and together with Iraq, were the closest allies of the US in the region. The sudden Iran revolution changed everything overnight and suddenly Iran is talking about wiping Israel off the map. We have witnessed the potential of Indonesia being thrown into political disorder and it is really uncertain if our friendship with our neighbours would remain unaffected if there is a change of power. The previous Indonesia President, Gus Dur had talked about an alliance with Malaysia to "cut of our water supply" (even though Indonesia didn't supply us water). But it just proves that crasy SOB can land their hands on power sometimes and being crazy SOB, they will do crazy stuff. Having a strong military defence is not only a "gentle reminder" for these potential crazy people to wake up for a while, but also if necessary, to really fight and win any conflict. Which with our current capability, is highly possible, again with a fair degree of contribution from NSmen.<br><br>Investing in defence also pay off in the long run. A strong military defence helps create a stable area for investment. Nobody would dare invest in Singapore if we can be taken out easily.<br><br>Israel may not have secured peace by winning almost every war, but they are certaintly still on the world map. Something that would definitely not be possible without the IDF. And although the IDF was unable to remove threats from neighbouring states completely, it was able to limit them. The recent Hizbollah attacks (one that is said to be proxy of Iran) 's damage was kept to the minimum because the IDF are constantly disrupting the Hizbollah rocket launchers. Just because AIDs is an incurable disease doesn't mean that the patient give up his/her treatment completely, at least the treatments can keep the illnes under control.<br><br>While violence indeed cannot end violence all the time, it certainly is capable of creating a space and leverage for diplomacy. Your enemy would not be bothered to talk to you if they can crush you with a finger.<br><br>I agree with your points of working hand in hand with our neighbours, but military defence may not always hinder it. In fact a good number of diplomacy is done primarily through military exchange and assistance. Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia had a number of joint exercise which improves our relationship and the three navies are trying to work together to stop pirarcy.<br><br>Singapore's defence is one of the best in the region and various military personnel had confirmed Singapore's standard. Although we cannot survive a nuclear bomb attack, but it doesn't mean we should give up our defence completely. Most human are going to die of some disease at some point in time, this doesn't mean we might as well just give up our immunity system.  A nuclear attack is disasterous, but in reality, who is going to use it on us? Non-state actors such as terrorists might consider it, but thats precisely what our military intelligence are for. Much of the billions that we invest are spent on intelligence gathering and Singapore is also reputed within the region for its intelligence gathering ability.<br></div>

Come on who also know that some of the people would rather go sleep  or apply too little. But who fault is it? it their own fault. I know that if anything happen to them, surely some parents would make a big fuss out of it. They just do that to cover their asses. But do u really think this is a way, a army should be? Pamper you and make sure that "you yourself take care of yourself". Guess the most problem in the end would be that, the army is too scared of any complains...that causes example of this kind of things.<br></div>
