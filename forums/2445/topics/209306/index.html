            <div class='col-md body'>022615, I hope I can contribute at least some articles to your forum, thanks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>-----------------------------------------------<br><br>21/08/2006 09:10  - (SA)<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Danel Blaauw, Die Volksblad </span><br><br>Bloemfontein - A man from Bloemfontein survived a 1 000m fall by landing in a ploughed field after his parachute failed to open properly while he was executing his first jump.<br><br>Shocked family and friends stood watching at Tempe airport in Bloemfontein as Benno Jacobs, 35, struggled to disentangle the ropes of his parachute while hurtling through the air at a dizzying speed.<br><br>"As it was my first jump, I thought it was only a bad jump, and not a fall," said the father of two.<br><br>Jacobs didn't even break a bone or tear a ligament.<br><br>He suffered a few bruises, a bruised lung, a swollen lip and an aching body.<br><br><strong>'A miracle' </strong><br><br>"It's a miracle. I wasn't really injured." Jacobs was admitted to the neurological unit of Bloemfontein Medi-Clinic for observation.<br><br>The only things on his mind as he was falling about 1 066m on Saturday afternoon, were his children and a prayer.<br><br>"It must have been a very short prayer," he smiled.<br><br>His mother-in-law, Rika van der Spuy, who watched him fall, described the incident as an absolute miracle on Sunday.<br><br>"It was terrible," she said. "Everybody was in a shocked state. Nobody could believe that he had survived."<br><br>Usually a jump took about six minutes, said Jacobs. Although it felt like ages, Jacobs hit the ploughed land within 60 seconds of leaving the aircraft.<br><br>Jacobs, Daniel van der Spuy, his brother-in-law, and Theunis Lambrechts, a colleague, did a parachute course at the Bloemfontein parachute club on Friday evening.<br><br>The three men executed their first jump on Saturday afternoon.<br><br>Jacobs said he immediately realised the ropes were tangled.<br><br>"They call it a line twist," he explained.<br><br>After what felt like ages, he managed to disentangle the ropes.<br><br>"But I couldn't pull the brake."<br><br>Because it took him so long to disentangle the ropes, he could not estimate how close he was to the ground in order to open the emergency parachute.<br><br>Jacobs, a sales manager at Peri Wiehahn, said he was amazed when his parachute started spinning. "It was 75% open, but there was a rope over the top."<br><br>After the fall he simply got up and, with a bleeding nose and somewhat disorientated, walked to a farm gate about 100m away, where an ambulance was already waiting.<br><br>"It hurt a bit, but the adrenalin rush must have been so much that I didn't realise how much it actually hurt."<br><br>He said although he was the third person to jump from the aircraft, he was the first to land.<br><br>According to his calculations, he hit the earth at about 60km/h.<br><br>"I beat them (his brother-in-law and colleague)," he laughed.<br><br>The only other adventure sport he does is quad-biking, although he has done the Argus cycle race seven times.<br><br>He always wanted to do parachuting, but after his narrow escape, he has said he wouldn't be trying that again.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------<br></div>
