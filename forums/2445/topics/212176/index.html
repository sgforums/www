They normally form when the remains of a dead star collapse under their own gravity, squeezing their mass together.<br><br>Although black holes can't be seen, astronomers infer their existence by the gravitational effects they have on gas and stars around them.<br><br><strong>Making black holes</strong><br>Some models of the universe suggest extra dimensions of reality exist, each folded up into sizes ranging from as tiny as a proton, or roughly a millionth of a billionth of a meter, to as big as a fraction of a millimeter.<br><br>At distances comparable to the size of these extra dimensions, gravity becomes far stronger, these models suggest.<br><br>If this is true, the collider will cram enough energy together to initiate gravitational collapses that produce black holes.<br><br>If any of the models are right, the accelerator should create a black hole anywhere from every second to every day, each roughly possessing 5,000 times the mass of a proton and each a thousandth of a proton in size or smaller, Landsberg said.<br><br>Still, any fears that such black holes will consume the Earth are groundless, Landsberg said.<br><br>For one thing, theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking calculated all black holes should emit radiation, and that tiny black holes should lose more mass than they absorb, evaporating within a billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, "before they could gobble up any significant amount of matter," Landsberg said.<br><br><strong>Not destroyed yet</strong><br>CERN spokesman and former research physicist James Gillies also pointed out that Earth is bathed with cosmic rays powerful enough to create black holes all the time, and the planet hasn't been destroyed yet.<br><br>"Still, let's assume that even if Hawking is a genius, he's wrong, and that such black holes are more stable," Landsberg said.<br><br>Nearly all of the black holes will be traveling fast enough from the accelerator to escape Earth's gravity.<br><br>"Even if you produced 10 million black holes a year, only 10 would basically get trapped, orbiting around its center," Landsberg said.<br><br>However, such trapped black holes are so tiny, they could pass through a block of iron the distance from the Earth to the Moon and not hit anything. They would each take about 100 hours to gobble up one proton.<br><br>At that rate, even if one did not take into account the fact that each black hole would slow down every time it gobbled up a proton, and thus suck down matter at an even slower rate, "about 100 protons would be destroyed every year by such a black hole, so it would take much more than the age of universe to destroy even one milligram of Earth material," Landsberg concluded. "It's quite hard to destroy the Earth."<br><br>If the Large Hadron Collider does create black holes, not only will it prove that extra dimensions of the universe exist, but the radiation that decaying black holes emit could yield clues that help finally unite all the current ideas about the forces of nature under a "theory of everything."<br><br></div>
