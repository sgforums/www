For fear that she might be illegally arrested, I signed a guarantee statement on her behalf several times, including forms provided by the detention center, the police station and the court. I also wrote a statement denouncing Dafa on her behalf, and swore at Master and Dafa out of anxiety and fear, due to the pressure we were under. Now I understand that it was wrong for me to cooperate with these unlawful activities. I solemnly declare that all the things I wrote and signed for my wife are invalid, and I will never again denounce Master or Dafa. I will do everything I can to support Dafa as a good person in accordance with the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion and Forbearance.<br><br>Wang Tingcai, June 2006<br><br>http://minghui.ca/mh/articles/2006/7/28/134161.html<br><br><strong>Solemn Statement </strong><br><br>Due to the Chinese Communist PartyÂ’s (CCP) propaganda, I developed misunderstandings about Falun Gong and acted badly towards it. After Falun Gong practitioners helped me better understand Falun Gong, I realized what is right and what is wrong, and I now know that Falun Dafa is good. I fully support Dafa and hope that DafaÂ’s Master will forgive me. I solemnly declare that anything bad that I have said about and did to Dafa was wrong. I will compensate for my deeds and do my best to stop the persecution of Falun Gong by the evil CCP.<br><br>Zhao Guihua, April 6, 2006<br><br>http://minghui.ca/mh/articles/2006/7/28/134161.html<br><br><strong>Solemn Statement </strong><br>In recent years more and more people, including my family members, have started to practice Falun Gong. Falun Gong harmonized my family and cured my elder sisterÂ’s diseases. Though I donÂ’t cultivate Dafa, I require myself to follow the standard of Truthfulness, Compassion and Forbearance. Once when my elder sister and I were passing a crossroad, some police were there forcing passers-by to step on a picture of Master Li Hongzhi. If the passsers-by refused, they would not be allowed to leave. My sister refused and was stopped by the police. I quarreled with them and they seized me by my neck. Out of fear that my elder sister would be arrested, I stepped on MasterÂ’s picture. The police then threatened to detain us if we didnÂ’t tear down MasterÂ’s picture., I reluctantly agreed under the pressure, but carrying out this act brought me much pain. I was deeply regretful about what I did. Here I solemnly declare that this bad thing I did against Dafa was wrong. I believe that Dafa is good and fully support Dafa.<br><br>Zhang Suxia, July 8, 2006<br><br>http://minghui.ca/mh/articles/2006/7/29/134248.html<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Solemn Declarations by Dafa Practitioners</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(Clearwisdom.net) </span><br>=========================================================<br><br><strong>Solemn Declaration </strong><br>I was happy to learn Falun Dafa in April 1998. All of my illnesses disappeared during my cultivation practice. I had never felt this healthy before practicing Falun Dafa. On July 20, 1999, the evil started persecuting Falun Dafa, and I was illegally detained twice because I went to Beijing to appeal for Falun Gong. After that, the police station, village government, and city 610 Office frequently came to persecute me. Under this pressure, because of my sentimentalities and various kinds of my attachments, I committed bad deeds against Dafa, including signing a "confession statement" that my father wrote for me so that I would not be persecuted by the evil Chinese Communist Party. I regret very much these deeds. I left stains on my cultivation path. Herein, I solemnly declare that all of what I did, said, and wrote against Dafa, including what my father wrote for me is void. I will continue to practice cultivation, and do what a real Dafa practitioner should do. I will wash clean the stains and do the three things well that Master requires of practitioners.<br><br>By Zhang Mizhen on July 17, 2006<br><br>Translated on: 2006-8-5<br><br>The Chinese version available at: http://minghui.ca/mh/articles/2006/7/25/133706.html<br><br><strong>Solemn Declaration </strong><br>I started practicing Falun Dafa in 1998. I went to Beijing's Tiananmen Square to appeal for Falun Gong twice during December 2000. I was then forced to become homeless because of the evil persecution. In April 2001, I returned home from out of town and was soon arrested by the local police. At the police department, the officers asked me, "Do you still practice Falun Gong?" My daughter answered for me, "No, she doesnÂ’t." I nodded. The police had gone to the unit where my daughter works and interfered with her work. I didnÂ’t want to involve her, so I said against my will, "No. I am no longer a practitioner of Falun Gong." The police told me to sign and give my fingerprint. I thought that I could reduce my troubles by answering "No" to deceive them. However, my troubles increased. They continued to pressure me, told me to give them 1,000 yuan, to report to the police department every day, and to write a "thought report" every week. Eventually I woke up and made up my mind not to obey any of these evil demands any longer and to maintain my belief in Master and Dafa. As a result, nothing has happened. The policemen no longer give me trouble. Nevertheless, I did wrong. I apologize to Master and Dafa. I solemnly declare null and void everything that I did and said that was not in accordance with Dafa. I will do the three things well to clear my stains and double my efforts to make up the damage that I have done to Dafa. I will practice Falun Dafa to the end.<br><br>Wang Yulan on July 11, 2006<br><br>Translated on: 2006-88-5<br><br>The Chinese version available at: http://minghui.ca/mh/articles/2006/7/29/134247.html<br><br></div>

After learning Falun Dafa, she became very healthy, and was a good person who was well respected by the people in her village. In order to help more people see the truth about the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and to tell them that Falun Dafa is good, she passed out truth clarifying materials in the Qianquzhuang Neighborhood at around noon on September 12, 2006. She was detained by the Qianquzhuang Security Chairman Li Zhiqiang in his apartment building on the fourth floor, second door, building 102.<br><br>Li Zhiqiang took Ms. Chen Suxiang to the Qianquzhuang Village CCP Committee office and beat Ms. Chen brutally together with guard Li Jianjun (male). They punched and kicked her in the lower back, head, legs, and caused her to have a large area of bruises on her body. They struck her severely, resulting in her collapsing on the floor. The Village Women's Association workers Liu Xiaohua (female) and Guo (female, first name unknown) witnessed the beating.<br><br><img src="http://clearwisdom.net/emh/article_images/2006-9-18-chensuxiang02--ss.jpg"><br><img src="http://clearwisdom.net/emh/article_images/2006-9-18-chensuxiang03--ss.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Qianquzhuang Village CCP Committee Office<br><br>Kaiping District Police Station </span><br><br>On the morning of September 13, 2006, Ms. Chen Suxiang was arrested and taken to the Kaiping Police Station.
