              Begin story time as early as you could to bond with your child and give her a head start on learning.
              Even if your baby is more interested to put a book in her mouth than to turn its pages, It doesn't mean it's too soon to start reading to him/her. Experts say exposing babies to books in the first year is crucial to their intellectual and emotional growth. In fact, research shows that reading to infants can help jump-start brain development and can even make them more receptive to learning.
              Picture books with bright, simple images provide visual stimulation that enhances your child's cognitive skills. Pointing to the images in the book and talking about them with your baby helps him/her link words with specific objects. This shows him/her that what she sees in books exists in real life. An example would be : â€˜The little boy has a blue romper? They're just like the blue romper you are wearing!â€™
              Sharing story time with your baby can boost his/her emotional development. "Being held and hearing your voice during specific reading sessions daily gives your baby a sense of stability and security. It also creates a positive association between special bonding time with books, and this encourages a lifelong love of reading."
              Of course, reading to young babies isn't always easy. While some infants sit still and listen intently, many others run away and fuss or try to pull the book out of your hand. This is very normal. Don't worry if your baby do not seems to be interested at all when you first start reading to him. With a little practice and patience, your baby will most likely learn how to settle down. 
              Eliminating distractions and giving your child something to hold, such as a bottle or a <a href="http://www.glynnisbaby.com">toy</a>, might help him/her focused. Changing the tone of your voice, making faces to show emotion or surprise, and interacting with your baby while you're reading like tapping him/her nose when a horn toots help draw her into the story. But if your baby keeps trying to run away, it's best to put the book down and try again later.
              The key is to make story time a fun activity for your baby and for you. Here are some ways to do that.
              1. Choose the correct timing
              Make it a habit to read several times during the day when you're in a relaxed mood and your baby is receptive to stories, such as after a nap or just before bedtime. Start reading to him for just a few minutes, and gradually increase the time to get him used to looking at books. Remember, Itâ€™s never too early to start. 
              
              2. Tune up your tone.
              When reading, use a high-pitched, expressive voice. Speak slowly and clearly, pronouncing each syllable so she can hear the different sounds of language. Researchers have found that babies prefer and learn best from a singsong, exaggerated tone. 
              
              3. Read it again and again and again.
              Read your <a href="http://www.glynnisbaby.com">baby</a>'s favorite books, and repeat some of the words over and over. Reading familiar books makes your baby feel comfortable, confident, and secure because he knows what to expect next.
              
              4. Follow her lead.
              Let your baby play the main lead by letting him/her hold, touch, and play with the book. At around 8 months, help her learn to turn the pages of the book. Prepare books made of sturdy cardboard, heavy-duty cloth, or soft plastic because they stand up to chewing, grabbing, and tossing. 
              Even if you read only a few words at each session, your baby will definitely benefit and perhaps even develop a lifelong affinity for books.
