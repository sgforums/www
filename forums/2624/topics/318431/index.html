              <p>Do you think that the Singapore Governement did the right thing in increasing the GST to 7% last year?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What are your views?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the current increase in inflation and it keeps on increasing, will more Singaporeans find it harder to make ends meet now, especially those who are poor?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you think it's the right thing to do by giving a one time-off monetary award to offset the GST, or is it better not to increase the 2% GST and wait until a little longer?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't know about you, but I find that it's getting harder now to make ends meet. It seems that I am spending a double amount of money for the same amount of basic goods that I had bought last year before thr GST increase.  </p>
              <p>Yes, they increase our salary to about 4 % or so... but the price of goods increaesed to about 12% or more.... (am I right or  wrong?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is there anyone out there who doesn't feel the effect of the inflation nowadays?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course you are not, if you are filthy rich....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you also think that the gov't is going for a deficit next year as predicted by the parliament?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is the gov't being too conservative in its prediction?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I just wonder what happens to all the money invested by Temasek holdings and its "gang"?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Aren't those our CPF monies and aren't those profits are supposed to be used in times of crisis like the current one?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'll bet next year the gov't will definitely have a BIG surplus (as usual) for whaever reasons they might quote....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And for the 2009 budget, there will be another deficit as you know, the gov't will spend even more such that the budget will be predicted as a deficit, again....... </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does anyone share my views??</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"> give me a choice of increasing the ministers pay and 2% GST, i choose the former.</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you also think that the gov't is going for a deficit next year as predicted by the parliament?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"> how to get deficits when there are more erp gantries and longer operating times.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is the gov't being too conservative in its prediction?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"> predicting a 0.7mil deficit and ending up with a 7 mil surplus, is that conservative or wayang prediction?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Aren't those our CPF monies and aren't those profits are supposed to be used in times of crisis like the current one?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"> since when? they are kept in vaults around the country, they don't use that money one. because they said its our money. weird, yet we can't use them when we want to.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">only the reserves can be used, but can only touch when disasters strike, such as volcano eruptions, earthquakes (violent ones, not tremors), typhoon or hurricane. is that happening? if not, cannot touch one.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'll bet next year the gov't will definitely have a BIG surplus (as usual) for whaever reasons they might quote....</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"> big surplus also like that, deficit also like that. i don't really care.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And for the 2009 budget, there will be another deficit as you know, the gov't will spend even more such that the budget will be predicted as a deficit, again....... </p>

              <p>i just wonder whether POREANS are brave enough to vote for two-party systems....</p>

              <p>Will the spill-over effect of Malaysia's Anwar Ibrahim be brought here??</p>

              <p>Well, only GOD knows, I guess...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, can you see all the things the gov't has been doing to make sure none of the opposition will ever step foot into parliament??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the formation of big GRCs... and the decision of not having a by-election after the premature death of an MP.... all these lead to one thing..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Either the PAP wins almost all the parliamentary seats and almost none for the oppositions... at all costs....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You get what I'm trying to say???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the next GE.... only those POREANS with real "balls" will actually vote for the oppositon parties... and deny the current gov't of their two-thirds majority...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only then... and only then... the gov't will start to listen to the peoples' voice more seriously... and only then the peoples' power will begin to rule again.... not the gov't's power....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess that day will only happen in my dreams.... not in reality... sigh....</p>
