              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The U.S. Dollar Index is trading 
              sharply higher this morning gaining 0.68 cents to $81.00. On November 
              4th, 2010 the U.S. Dollar Index was trading as low as $75.63. At the 
              same time the S&amp;P 500 Index was making new highs for the year around
               the 1227.00 level. However, once the European Union began to signal new
               debt worries the U.S. Dollar Index has surged higher and the major 
              market indexes around the world have sold off. Is a stronger U.S. Dollar
               index good for the world or bad for the world?<br> <br> When the U.S. Dollar Index declines or trades lower the global markets 
              seem to inflate and trade higher. Most commodities from copper(NYSE:JJC)
               to cotton(NYSE:BAL) soar higher when the U.S. Dollar Index declines. 
              Oil and most other energy products also increase in price when the U.S. 
              Dollar Index declines and higher oil actually makes most manufactured 
              goods more expensive. It is important to note that  oil is used in the 
              making of rubber, plastic, paint, and almost everything that is made for
               commercial and industrial use. Therefore, while a weak U.S. Dollar 
              Index will help inflate asset prices it is a direct tax on the U.S. 
              consumer. <br> <br> What are the positives of a stronger U.S. Dollar Index? The stronger 
              U.S. Dollar Index will simply make for cheaper prices in all 
              commodities, and give the U.S. consumer stronger buying power. As we all
               know by now the U.S. consumer loves to spend money. Please note that 
              U.S. consumer spending accounts for roughly 70.0 percent of the gross 
              domestic product in the United States. If the U.S. consumer could buy 
              more goods at lower prices why would that be a bad thing for the U.S. 
              economy? If Americans can find goods to be fairly valued they would 
              certainly consume a lot more. For example, if the housing market in the 
              United States declined enough most people with money would certainly  
              begin to buy up the excess supply. As it is right now there seems to be 
              very little interest in the buying of homes in the United States. Supply
               is out pacing the demand by a huge margin. This weak demand comes 
              despite the lowest mortgage interest rates in modern history.<br> <br> The answer to solving this problem is to let supply and demand work as 
              it was designed. If the system cannot function correctly the inevitable 
              will just be prolonged. If the stock market and housing market is ever 
              going to operate on the laws of supply and demand it will need to stop 
              being propped up by the central banks around the world. Once supply and 
              demand dictates what trades higher and lower the world will be fine once
               again. </span><br> <br> <img src="http://www.inthemoneystocks.com/userfiles/dxy%20d%2011_29_10.bmp" alt="" width="576" height="532"><br> <br> <br> <em>Nicholas Santiago<br> Chief Market Strategist<br> </em></p>
