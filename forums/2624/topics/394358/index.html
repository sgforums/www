I have called their hotline and checked if  i can recontract early and guy "M" said will check and call back. His colleague called the next day saying that they would like to give me an exception to allow early recontract as a form of goodwill and proceeded to arrange for me to go down to paragon outlet. Went down the next day, the guy in the shop said, "Mdm, you got to pay $100 for this exception". I asked him what kind of <span class="text_exposed_show">goodwill exception is this? And i was simply shocked about the fees that i have to pay for an early recontract of line because the staff who called me to go down did not inform me of such fees. So i was asked to call back to M1 hotline. A lady repeatedly said this a a very good exception to recontract early and pay $100 instead of waiting till May 10.This is their policy.. I asked if it can be waived since i have 3 lines with them and have been with them for over 10 yrs and i am so disappointed that i wasn't informed beforehand otherwise i would have time to reconsder without making a fruitless trip down. So I hold the line. She came back and said manager said cannot waive. With so much calmness i asked to speak to mgr so that i can feedback that their staffs asked me to go to their shop without telling me I need to pay. I hold the line again. This time round, she told me all the managers are on the lines and cannot speak to me now. I asked her then how can i feedback? She said "I STRONGLY ADVISED YOU NO NEED TO SPEAK TO MY MGR BECAUSE EVEN IF THEY CALLED U BACK, THEY WILL JUST LISTEN AND TAKE IN AS A FEEDBACK ONLY" I said i will cancel my other 2 lines which are without contracts then, she said sorry to hear that and she understands but really cannot and if i really want to cancel, I can call in to do so. At that moment, i just simply regretted the patience i held for them and why i did not insist to speak to the mgr although now i felt that it is useless too because the mgrs don't seem interested to speak to me.</span><span class="text_exposed_show"> Is this what customer service is going to be for SG? They dun even bother to retain you as a customer especially when the customer is still so polite to them seeking their understanding and therefore its just bullshit to whatsoever loyalty customer! They did not even realized that retaining customer is so important to their organisation given the fact that their competitors are giants like Singtel &amp; Starhub, they should have even stronger reasons to retain their customers. There was no real empathy at all when the customer is in agony and seek their understanding. Staffs who keep saying that they understand does not help and they still DO NOT understand why it does not help because to understand is to empathise and at the same time finding solutions or giving suggestions for the customer. Instead they said okay to your intentions of cancelling lines and leaving them. It just seems to me it doesn't matter to them and perhaps its just losing one customer but they aren't aware that if this continues, everyday they are losing more than 1 customer to their competitors.</span></div>
