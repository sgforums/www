              <p>opulation of 5m, 5.5m, 6m, 6.5m or 7m ?<br> <br> First, we need adequate and efficient infrastructures in such a compact
              island. Also, we need cheaper and greener energy, and more importantly
              new sources of food supply and potable water that is affordable to all,
              especially those who are poor and struggling to make a living.</p>
              <p>On food to feed a population of 5.75m (midway between 5 and
              6.5m), I have to refer interested forumers to my comments on Jilin
              investments by Temasek Holdings (see below). It is also available at my blog:<br> <br> <a href="http://tan-koktim.blogspot.com/2010/09/temasek-holdings-investments-in-huge.html">http://tan-koktim.blogspot.com/2010/...s-in-huge.html</a><br> and <br> Facebook: tankoktim</p>

              <p>Temasek Holdings’ investments in a huge farm project in Jilin, China<br> Sharing and inviting comments on what I wrote to the government and the media on the subject matter.</p>
              <p><br> Quote:<br> I refer to the media reports that Temasek Holdings will invest in a
              huge China farm project, which will be a proposed super farm of 1,450
              sq km that will be named China-Singapore Jilin food zone with land
              twice the size of Singapore.</p>
              <p><br> In my email of 25 July 2002 [see below], I suggested to the Singapore
              government to invest in overseas farms, forestry, etc., and not just in
              concrete and steel in office buildings, hotels, industrial estates, or
              in banks, businesses or telco companies, etc.</p>
              <p><br> It is not too late for GIC and TH to look into more such investments by
              parking a few hundred millions of dollars here and there to invest in
              non-concrete projects.</p>
              <p><br> We should invest strategically by putting our eggs in more baskets and to widen our sources of food supplies in the long term.</p>
              <p><br> The news of the Jilin investment last week is a long wait for me as my
              suggestion to the government went back not just 10 years but to as far
              back as October 1990. &gt; &gt;</p>

              <p>Subject: &gt; More freedom, fewer safety nets, will help
              Singapore grow &gt;<br> 25 July 2002</p>
              <p>&gt; Dear Sirs, &gt; &gt;</p>
              <p><br> I refer to “More freedom, fewer safety nets ‘will help Singapore grow’
              ” (Straits Times, July 25th) and it reminds me that there is no
              absolute freedom in any aspects of the human life. Very few people
              understand this. &gt; &gt;</p>
              <p><br> In the Remaking of Singapore, we want the Govt to leave no stone
              unturned, not even the CPF sacred cow. &gt; &gt; But when the Govt
              announced the coming changes in CPF, those affected voiced against it
              strongly.</p>
              <p><br> It is all about on which side of the bread we want the butter to be applied. No one can have the cake and eat it. &gt; &gt;</p>
              <p><br> Govt has made many policy changes over the years. Some they got it
              right but not all. They have to pull the brakes and change course
              completely for some. &gt;</p>
              <p><br> However, on the whole, the Govt has done well. To err is human.
              However, it is wise to listen carefully, consult and not lose touch
              with the ground. &gt; &gt;</p>
              <p><br> In difficult times, the art of Govt is about how to bring down the
              costs of basic daily necessities. It will carry alot of political
              weight when such issues are addressed to calm nerves. &gt; &gt;<br> Many of us including some young MPs cannot remember the Welcome Club of
              the 1950s. We must not lose sight of that chapter of our history in
              nation building.</p>
              <p><br> It is still relevant to affluent Singapore today if we wish to continue to grow well economically. &gt;<br> &gt; I am glad the AVA has provided Bintan and Baatam with technical support in agriculture. More should be done.</p>
              <p><br> I wrote about this in Oct 1990 that we should invest in areas around
              our regions to ensure we have steady, cheap and reliable sources of
              supply for our basic food needs. We have invested in poultry, pig
              husbanding and pawn farming in many countries.</p>
              <p><br> The Govt will say that this be best left to the private sector.
              However, there is a strategic factor in such investments and the Govt
              should not rely solely on the private sector, which has only one aim
              and that is to make profits. &gt;</p>
              <p><br> &gt; It is still not late as I wish to bring forth again &gt; what I recommended many years ago: &gt;</p>
              <p><br> &gt; a) invest in rice, fish and vegetables farming to ensure such
              farming activities can thrive overseas as it is important to our own
              survival as we need a steady source of food supplies. &gt;</p>
              <p><br> &gt; b) help by giving the needed capital for fertilisers, farming
              machines and research in improving crops quality and yields. A firm
              foundation in farming will help feed the host nation too, a win-win
              situation as there will be less instability in the region when the host
              nations are fed, and at the same time ensuring we provide them a steady
              market for their produce. Terrorism will not rear its ugly heads so
              often.<br> Investments in factories and buildings are important aspects, it is a
              norm a trend, but it will not feed a nation in a downturn like what we
              see in Indonesia today. There is social unrest when factories are empty
              affecting all.<br> We should not put too many eggs in one basket. Countries like Laos,
              Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, they are hungry for investments to upgrade
              their farms. The World Bank can only do that much. But we enter into
              such investments for different sets of reasons, and it is for the
              betterment of everyone. &gt;</p>
              <p><br> c) Invest in deep sea fishing. We consume thousands of tons of fish each year.<br> We may not have the expertise and a blue-ocean fishing fleet, but we
              can invest in fishing vessels, build them here if we can and equip them
              with sophisticated fishing gears and have them manned by foreign crew.
              We can provide them a ready market for the catch. &gt; &gt;<br> No one owes us a living. We may invest in high-tech industries but we
              should not lose sight of the traditional areas, which are required to
              ensure a steady supply of our basic food needs at the lowest cost
              possible. Both the private sector and the government should unite in
              joint investments, which would benefit us as well as the investee
              countries. &gt;</p>
              <p><br> &gt; d) in addition we should balance and invest in some long term
              projects. Examples, joint ventures to open up land around the world to
              plant pine and teak forests, etc. It will help both the environment to
              stay green, and provide the needed material resources for future
              generations as trees will take years to mature.</p>
              <p><br> It does not need much upkeep and maintenance of the trees, and the
              future value of money in such investments will be protected. The
              initial investments will not be in hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
              <p><br> It is wise to spread our investments for the sake of our survival as a nation and for future generations. &gt;</p>
