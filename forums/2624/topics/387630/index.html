              <p>Malaysians face charges after morality police raids</p>
              <p>Dozens of Malaysians charged with sexual misconduct in New Year's Day hotel raids, including a 54-year-old grandmother, will face court next month, officials said Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Malaysia's Islamic morality police arrested 58 Muslim Malays for "khalwat" or "close proximity" under religious laws that bar Muslims from being alone with a member of the opposite sex before marriage.</p>
              <p>The raids targeted 20 budget hotels in the eastern resort town of Kuantan, the capital of Pahang state.</p>
              <p>"We will be charging them in a sharia court in February. If found guilty they face a fine and a six-month jail term," Ahmad Rafli Abdul Malek, head of the Pahang Islamic Department, told AFP.</p>
              <p>Ahmad Rafli said the 54-year-old woman, a grandmother of eight, was caught with a 38-year-old man.</p>
              <p>He related that when his officers knocked on their hotel door, they said: "How can we open the door. We are naked."</p>
              <p>Malaysia has a dual-track legal system and Islamic courts can try Muslims -- who dominate the multicultural population -- for religious and moral offences.</p>
              <p>Ahmad Rafli said the department was concerned that increasing numbers of couples were spending time alone before marriage and that this could lead to illicit sexual activity.</p>
              <p>"Then we will face issues such as abortion and dumping of babies," he said.</p>
              <p>Malaysia's minorities, which include ethnic Chinese and Indian communities, have complained over rising "Islamisation" of the country that is threatening its secular status.</p>
              <p>Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno, a 32-year-old part-time model, was sentenced to six strokes of the cane by an Islamic court in Pahang in July for drinking beer, although the punishment has not yet been carried out.</p>

              <p>Well when I read this article and wondering if Malay police knows about the sex and adultery scandal of National Institue of Education, Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This adultery case is one Malay Muslim Lady and Christian Negro married man, <br>the lady name is Mdm Mazian Binte Muhd, officer from Graduate Programme Research office, National Institute of Education, Singapore and the negro is Gratian Machraga, PhD Student from NIE, NSSE, Singapore. She has a family in Malaysia and behind her family, she has committed adultery affair with this nigro man.They even used to go to cheap hotels and meet almost every night.<br><br>Even NIE officials know about this adultery affair, they did not take any action and neglect them to let them free to do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why this negro manipulates our money supported him to study here but he commits adultery with a married muslim lady?Why this lady dare to do with bareface.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>NTU did face two scandals in 2009, why they let these barefaced guys to commit another scandal in 2010? I am wondering.</p>
