              <p>Let's say , a student got pissed off with her teacher as the teacher kept scolding the student for something minor or unreasonable .

              <p>As the student doesn't want to be rude or defiant , the student posted about the incident in her blog . She poured out her feelings and typed about every single thing the teacher does to prove that the teacher is bad WITHOUT writing the teacher's name .</p>

              <p>In Singapore, Insinuation can be sued too (even if the insinuated is 'wrong').  So I think there is enough evidence to show the student is insinuating the teacher.</p>
              <p>In this situation, my allegory is that the teacher is the superior and the student is the subordinate.  Almost like at a workplace, a superior can bully a subordinate and what can the subordinate do?</p>

              <p>since we're on the topic of education, it would serve you well to understand words such as 'insinuation' and 'allegory' before using them. Just a heads up, please don't be offended</p>
