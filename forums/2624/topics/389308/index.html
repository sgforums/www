            <div class='col-md body'><p>SINGAPORE, Jan. 27 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Five "Little Champions" from Singapore have recently marched onto the iconic Old Trafford football pitch for the UEFA Champions League fifth Group Stage match between Manchester United FC and Besiktas JK in Manchester. The roaring audience, bright stadium lights and exuberant atmosphere can be overwhelming for these young player escorts, yet giving them an experience they will remember for life. They are also the first from Asia to escort world-class players at this major event. <br><br>Undoubtedly, this must have been a "star kid" moment for every child on the field. This is made possible by the "Little Champions" programme, a joint promotion between MasterCard and Standard Chartered Bank where winners are picked based on the highest number of transactions on their SCB MasterCard credit cards. <br><br>More winners will be selected for other matches in the months ahead, right up to the Final in Madrid. Each child and accompanying adult will win a package for two including round-trip air tickets, 3 night accommodation and match tickets. The highlight would be the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the child to be a player escort to world-class soccer players at the upcoming matches. Air tickets will be courtesy of Standard Chartered, and hotel stay, match tickets and player escort opportunity will be courtesy of MasterCard, Official Sponsor of the UEFA Champions League. <br><br>To be a player escort, the child must be aged between seven and nine, 1.1meters to 1.3meters tall and proficient in English. Standard Chartered MasterCard credit card holders have to register at http://www.standardchartered.com.sg/littlechampions from now till 31 March 2010 (inclusive) and charge a minimum of SGD300 each month to their card to participate in the programme. Customers who do not register but still spend the minimum amount within the promotional period will be eligible to win UEFA Champions League branded MasterCard premiums. <br><br>This is golden chance for both child and guardian to experience something they will never forget. <br><br>(Photo: <a href="http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2010/01/07/20100107548537.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2010/01/07/20100107548537.html</span></span></a> ) <br><br>Note to Editors: <br><br>Standard Chartered in Singapore is part of an international banking group with an extensive network of over 1,600 branches and outlets in more than 70 countries in the Asia Pacific Region, South Asia, the Middle East, Africa, the United Kingdom and the Americas. <br><br>Standard Chartered has a history of 150 years in Singapore, opening its first branch here in 1859 and in October 1999 was among the first international banks to receive a Qualifying Full Bank (QFB) licence, an endorsement of the Group's long-standing commitment to its businesses in the country. <br><br>It serves both Consumer and Wholesale Banking customers.
