              <p>I strongly believe that those who are prepared to work at IT shows or any of these well received exhibitions have to really get in tune with their inner customer service personality and be prepared for whatever.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the recent Sitex 2010, i encountered both the best and worst customer service ever. There were some who patiently took the time to answer the million and one question that i had asked and even when they forgot to give me some of the promised items, i was still ok with hauling back the laptop and desktop that i had bought the day before to the retailers while they fixed the problems for me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, at these same retailers, i was also verbally abused by, ironically, one of the tech people there. I'm no angel but i don't believe that i had provoked or deserved to receive such a treatment. I was given the finger and chinese as well as english vulgarities were hurled at me. My advice is, if you can't take the heat, then don't be there, buddy.</p>
              <p>Kudos to those who tried their best to diffuse the situation. You really did your best and i appreciate that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Special thanks to Vincent and Tek Kai (i hope i spelled your names correctly) for patiently answering all my questions and doubts and also to the other IT guys who tried their best to help.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I may have gotten some good customer service but the bad experience outweighs the good and has really put me off such events. As to whether or not i'll ever attend such an event again remains to be seen. It has really made me appreciate the normal stores with normal prices as at least i get customer satisfaction and gurantee that not only is the product good but the service is excellent too.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Kudos also to Syafiee and another 2 Chinese girls whose names i did not manage to get. Thanks to all 3 for answering my many questions and also for assisting me when i came again to get the forgotten items.</p>
