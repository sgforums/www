            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>___________MAKING A DRESSING_________</strong></span><br><br>I have found the more primitive the techniques employed Â­ such as in a larp or a grilled meat salad - and the more robust the 'principal' ingredient (offal, dried fish or sweet prawns, for example), the more pronounced is the seasoning of the dressing. Most dressings are prepared separately before the salad ingrediÂ­ents are combined, since this takes the briefest of moments. But try not to make the dressing more than an hour or two beforehand. Usually chillies, garlic and perhaps coriander root are pounded before being seasoned with sugar, lime juice and fish sauce to make a dressing, but some dressings are a simple paste of grilled ingrediÂ­ents or some chilli jam, diluted and seasoned. Coconut cream can be used to add a rich body to the dressing. And occasionally, the dressing is made as the salad is assembled, with the juices that exude from the ingredients forming a delicious base for the dressing Â­ for example, Grilled Crayfish and Tomato Salad. Salad dressings are traditionally made using a pestle and mortar Â­ and, in this instance, conveniently too, since the ingredients are easily and quickly reduced to a puree. A blender could be used, but it saves little time and does not give the same well-textured finish. The ingredients should be added to the mortar in the following order, beginning with the hardest and most difficult to pound, or those that must be completely pureed.<br><br><strong>CORIANDER ROOT</strong><br>Coriander root is used to counter any strong, earthy tastes - such as shrimp paste or freshwater fish - or gamy, meaty flavours in a dressing. It also counterbalances the raw garlic. Coriander root creates an undercurrent taste Â­that is, it should never dominate a dressing. Always scrape coriander roots to remove the skin and then soak in water to dislodge any lurking soil. Dry before use.<br><br><strong>SALT</strong><br>Salt is used both as an abrasive and a seasoning element. Use the best quality availÂ­able, as the taste of good salt improves the salad.<br><br><strong>GARLIC</strong><br>This gives a meaty body to the dressing. Only a few cloves should be used, otherÂ­wise the garlic will overwhelm the balance.<br><br><strong>CHILLIES</strong><br>Despite their fierce heat, bird's eye chillies (scuds) lend a delicious floral taste and some pleasing heat to a salad, if not excessively used. Only the most fastidious, or fearful, remove the seeds. Remember that the more pureed the chilli, the greater will be the heat in the dressing. Normally, I prefer to use white sugar in a dressing with scuds, as palm sugar seems to mask their floral taste. Always deseed fresh long chillies before adding to dressings. I like to remove the white membrane as well, to reduce any excess heat and ensure a cleaner, fruitier taste. Chop or mince before adding to the mortar - this reduces the pounding substantially. With red chillies, I like to use palm sugar, as its richness marries well with the chilli; white sugar, I think, works best with green chillies. Sometimes, grilled chillies are used whole or torn as an ingredient in the salad itself, but mostly they are pounded into a paste, usually with grilled shallots and garlic, before being dissolved to make a dressing. Normally only red chillies are grilled; green or unripe chillies are harder to peel. The chillies should be grilled, cooled, peeled and deseeded before being added to the dressing. Grilled chillies create a smoky, hot, yet suggestively sweet flavour; they are not as spicy as raw chillies, since the grilling moderates their heat.<br><br><strong>SUGAR</strong><br>Too much sugar cloys the palate, swamping all other tastes and seasonings. Too little and the dressing will be sharp, thin and coarse. White sugar imparts a clean, sweet flavour to dressings. Although it is fine to use normal sugar, it does take some time to dissolve in a dressing, so the real degree of sweetness it will produce may not be immediately discernible. It is better to use castor (superfine) sugar, which dissolves more quickly, ensuring that the true seasoning can be tasted as the dressing is being made. Palm sugar imparts a mellow, slightly nutty and richer taste and texture to a dressing. Coconut sugar is normally lighter in colour and, although it has a slightly different taste, can be used interchangeably with palm sugar. Palm sugar can be softened by pounding with a clean pestle and mortar, pureeing in a food processor or melting in a microwave oven. So prepared, it dissolves quickly and a more accurate measure of its sweetness can be gauged.<br><br><strong>LIME JUICE</strong><br>Lime juice is the major souring agent in the dressing. As its flavour, fragrance and colour dissipate quickly, it is important to squeeze the limes only when the juice is needed - and to squeeze by hand (machines tend to rasp at the pith, break the shallots and chillies, becoming a salad in itself- a dish for those who pursue authenÂ­ticity to the extreme. Mostly, however, the whole fish is diluted and simmered with aromatics. Although fermented fish sauce (nahm pla raa) is not as salty as fish sauce, it is more obtrusive; use sparingly.<br><br><strong>LIGHT SOY SAUCE</strong><br>I prefer to use the light, Thai version of soy: light both in colour and in body. It has a subtle sweetness and is not too intensely salty, which means it can authentically replace fish sauce. The result will be different, as soy sauce lacks the capacity to 'disÂ­appear' in the way that fish sauce does. Slow, naturally fermented soy sauce is the best to use Â­ and the healthiest.<br><br><strong>ROASTED DRIED CHILLIES</strong><br>Almost invariably, dried chillies are grilled or roasted to impart a wonderfully smoky flavour, then ground before being added to a dressing. To roast, simply heat the chillies in a dry wok and stir until they colour and are fragrant; just be careful - the fumes are awesome. I find the rich and toasty heat of dried chillies addictive, but it is best to tread cautiously when adding them to a dressing: more can always be added. While dried long red chillies are sometimes deseeded before roasting, dried bird's eye chillies are rarely deseeded. Ground to make roasted chilli powder, they are an essential seasoning for spicy larp and grilled beef salads. Whole dried chillies can also be deep-fried or caramelised and used as a garnish for a salad.<br><br><strong>CHILLI JAM</strong><br>This rich, nutty relish is often used as a dressing for Thai salads. It is normally diluted with a little coconut cream and the seasoning adjusted before use.<br><br><strong>COCONUT CREAM</strong><br>Coconut cream adds a sumptuous quality to dressings. Often the 'principal' ingrediÂ­ent is cooked in coconut cream before the salad is finished and seasoned. Salads of this nature are usually sweeter than other types and are rarely highly spiced.<br><br><strong>SEASONING THE DRESSING</strong><br>Each ingredient needs to be thoroughly incorporated in the dressing before the balance of the seasoning is checked. When seasoning a dressing, sweet ingredients are usually added before souring agents. The salty elementÂ­ that is, fish sauce - is generally added last, as it is normally the strongest flavour. It needs to be handled carefully and added in proportion to the previous seasoning tastes. Fish sauce can easily upset the intended balance of the seasoning; while increasing the amounts of other seasoning components can restore this, it is difficult to achieve, as the dressing then often becomes too intense.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>_________SALAD INGREDIENTS__________________</strong></span><br><br>Because of their simplicity, it is vital that the ingredients in a salad are fresh and at the peak of their season. Hence the 'principal' ingredient depends on what is availÂ­able, but most salads include a handful of sliced red shallots, mint and coriander leaves as a consistent garnish.<br><br><strong>RED SHALLOTS</strong><br>Shallots impart a sharp and decisive taste to a salad. They are always cut lengthwise. Thai cooks prefer to use the smallest bulbs, which are sweet, comparatively subtle in flavour, and present a vivid and attractive pink edge. Shallots are occasionally grilled or roasted before being added to a salad. Traditionally this is done over an open flame, but an easier way is to 'roast' them in a wok with a little water, unpeeled, until the water has evaporated and the skin is charred. This ensures that the shallots are completely cooked and quite smoky but without any bitter, blackened parts that would taint the salad. Either way, once cool they are peeled, sliced and added to the dish. Deep-fried shallots add a wonderful nuttiness to a salad. Mostly they are sprinkled over the finished salad at the last minute, so they remain crisp.<br><br><strong>MINT</strong><br>The best variety to use is common garden mint. The leaves alone are used Â­ and the smaller they are, the better. Larger leaves need to be torn so that they do not overÂ­whelm the salad; do not cut them with a knife or the leaves will blacken. Mint is used in almost every Thai salad, but with discretion. Its fresh menthol flavour cools and refreshes and is a pleasant respite from the salad's intensity.<br><br><strong>CORIANDER</strong><br>Coriander's spicy and herbaceously sweet leaves give a clean sharpness to the salad. Picking the leaves gives the salad a refinement, but chopping will do. It is important not to add too much coriander Â­ it can so easily take over a salad.<br><br><strong>PAKCHIIFARANG</strong><br>Pak chiifarang (long-leaf coriander) is almost always shredded before use, although if very young the soft leaves can be torn into salads. For those who are not fond of coriander, this is a more palatable alternative, having a similar but less intense taste. Its enticing fragrance is mostly released on heating, therefore it is used mainly in the warm and spicy salads from the north and north-east, to temper and perfume.<br><br><strong>BASIL</strong><br>Thai basil is an uncommon salad herb. Normally it is served as a side dish with salads, but when it is added to the salad itself it imparts a sweet aniseed flavour. Leaves are added whole or torn; do not cut with a knife or the edges of the leaves will blacken. Holy basil is only used in a few very pungent, rustic salads from the north. The leaves have a clove-like intensity that can almost numb the tongue.<br><br><strong>LEMONGRASS</strong><br>Lemongrass is usually very finely sliced for salads. This should be done as close as possible to use, as the flavour and fragrance dissipate when exposed to air, and the stalk also discolours and warps. Some cooks plunge the stalk briefly into boiling water to soften it, thus making it easier to slice - and more fragrant.<br><br><strong>KAFFIR LIME LEAVES</strong><br>These should be prepared just before they are needed as they dry so quickly. Fold or roll no more than 3 or 4 leaves lengthwise, then shred as finely as possible. The fastidious remove the central rib by lifting it away from the leaf.<br><br><strong>COCONUT</strong><br>Raw coconut has a soft texture and rich taste. In Thailand, there is a special small, claw-like utensil to remove the coconut flesh from the husk; a zester is a good subÂ­stitute. Cut the coconut in half and wash the inside and then scrape out the flesh. Using a zester, make long strokes across each half of the coconut, rotating to ensure even scraping, and avoiding the brown skin. It is easier to collect the coconut scrapings if you work over a tea towel. Occasionally, the flesh is grated. If roasted coconut is required, roast the scraped or grated coconut in a very low oven, checking and turning often. Once it is golden and fragrant, it is ready to use, offering a sweet nuttiness and pleasing textural contrast.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>______NOODLES_______</strong></span><br><br>It sometimes seems that there is a noodle shop or stall on every corner of every street in Thailand - from the hub of Bangkok's business centre, Silom Road, to the dustiest village. Once there were hawkers who plied their wares along the streets of Bangkok, and even along the canals, where customers would perch on the banks as they ate their noodles. They are ubiquitous: it was even said that during one of the coups d'etat in the early 1980s, noodle stalls were set up near the scene of the conÂ­frontation, to cater to the opposing factions and the spectators. Noodles are eaten with fervour in Thailand at any time of the day, and in an extraordinary range of styles.<br><br>There are various types of noodles fresh and dried, made from wheat and rice flour Â­ and there are as many ways to eat them: blanched and dressed, in stir-fries and in soups. Most noodles are interchangeable; at noodle stalls one is always asked what noodles are preferred, and they are produced accordingly. Stir-fried noodles are cooked in a wok: some dishes are cooked rapidly over a fierce heat, in order to colour, even char, the noodles; others are cooked more gently, with the noodles being cooked and then incorporated into the well-seasoned dish. If egg noodles are used in a stir-fried dish, they need to be blanched in boiling water and drained before being added to the wok.<br><br>Fresh rice noodles are simply added. Blanched noodles Â­ which are dipped in boiling water or a light stock - can either be served in a soup (in Thailand described as 'wet') or merely seasoned and served 'dry' in a bowl. Noodles intended for soups are placed in a bowl and a ladle of broth is poured over; the stock must be full-flavoured, or the dish will be bland and insipid. Such stocks are often made with pork and duck bones and strong aromatics such as white radish, cabbage, spring onions, star anise and pandanus. The stock is then seasoned with oyster sauce and soy sauce, giving a deep, inviting depth to the taste and appearance of the soup.<br><br>In deference to their origins, noodles are generally eaten in the ChiÂ­nese manner in a bowl with chopsticks and a Chinese soup spoon - although some stir-fried noodle dishes are served on flat plates and eaten with a spoon and fork. At the table, noodles are served with an assortment of condiÂ­ments, kreuang brung: roasted chilli powder, ground galangal, Asian celery, sliced red chillies steeped in vinegar, ground deep-fried peanuts, white sugar and fish sauce. Some more elaborate garnishes could include Chinese Dried Shredded Pork and Preserved Cabbage. All the following noodle recipes are sufficient for 1 person.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>____DESSERT INGREDIENTS________</strong></span><br><br>The rustic combination of palm sugar, rice flour and coconut formed the basis of most desserts in Siam. Although these desserts may have had very limited ingrediÂ­ents, their quality and vibrant freshness lent them surprising dimensions of flavour, belying their simplicity. The palm sugar would have been freshly boiled sap Â­ sweet, but slightly bitter from impurities. The rice flour would have been freshly milled and soaked overnight to remove any excess starch; during the tropical night, the starch would slightly ferment. Fresh grated coconut would have been squeezed without the addition of water, to make an incomparably luscious cream.<br><br><strong>PANDANUS LEAVES</strong><br>These blade-like leaves release their resinous flavour only on heating. They can be boiled whole - although they are usually knotted to make them easier to remove Â­ in syrups and other desserts. However, they should only be simmered briefly, for if stewed they impart an oily, sallow quality. Pandanus leaves are also used to wrap or package small sweetmeats, and occasionally the leaves are blended with a little water to colour and perfume pastries.<br><br><strong>SAFFRON</strong><br>Although not a traditional Thai flavouring, I find saffron adds depth to syrups and a golden hue to egg desserts that can normally be obtained only by using duck eggs.<br><br><strong>COCONUT</strong><br>The coconut is indispensable in making Thai desserts, and it is used in all stagesof development - young, intermediate and old - and even the husk is employed. The most ancient recipes call for grated coconut, rather than extracted cream. The best coconut to use is one that is not too old, where the flesh has developed but is not as firm or hard as mature coconut. It has a crunchy yet soft texture, and a rich, sweet taste. However, the best coconut cream is made from old, 'dry* coconuts; it is essential to peel the brown skin to obtain a pristinely white cream. Ideally, coconut cream for desserts should be extracted from coconut alone, without adding water to dissolve it in, but it takes a massive amount of strength to wring out the cream this way. Frankly, I have never been able to achieve this successfully. Instead, aim to extract the cream for desserts using a minimal amount of water - about 1 cup to 2 cups grated coconut Â­ following the method given on page 148. This will yield a heavy, thick cream. Then wait for 30 minutes or so to allow the cream to rise to the top and skim off this even more concentrated cream. Coconut cream intended for desserts is immeasurably improved by being prepared with perfumed water, or smoked and perfumed water. The result is a cream of incomÂ­parable quality and resonance Â­ fresh, rich, luscious, slightly resinous and aromatic. Although it is possible to smoke and perfume the cream after it has been made, it does not taste the same, being rawer in taste and not as deep. After the coconut cream has risen to the top of the bowl and been removed, what remains is coconut milk, which can be used to poach fruit. If more is needed, simply mix the squeezed coconut flesh with additional water and extract again. Although a small amount of cream will be produced, the result will be mostly milk. When 'cracked' or separated coconut cream is allowed to cool, the cream separates into the oil and solids. The oil is used to deep-fry peanuts, shalÂ­lots, lotus seeds and bananas. It is a heavy oil which imparts a sharp, rather peppery flavour, and I like to cut it with some good flavourless vegetable oil. Undiluted, a litÂ­tle can be smeared in moulds to prevent desserts sticking to them. The oil lasts indefinitely and, if strained, can be re-used many times. The residue that remains after the clear oil is removed from separated cream is coconut solids or curds, which are used to give body and moisture to some desserts.<br><br><strong>SALT</strong><br>This is used in many desserts to varying degrees, mostly in minuscule amounts. Salt draws out the flavour of the other ingredients and has the effect of countering extremes of taste, tempering sweetness and reducing the unctuousness of coconut cream. Sometimes it is used as a strong flavour in itself. Salt can come as a surprise to the unsuspecting, and is an acquired taste in desserts; it may initially have been employed as a preservative.<br><br><strong>SUGAR</strong><br>Often sugar - of whatever kind - to be used in desserts is perfumed with flowers overnight before use the next day; the elusive perfume dissipates after a day or so. In Thailand, white sugar is produced by simmering and clarifying sugar cane with hydrolysed lime water. This results in a clean, but not always ultra-purified, sugar that is normally used to make syrups. For those who do not wish to clarify their own, either castor (superfine) or regular granulated sugar can be used. Moist, soft, honey-golden granules of Thai palm sugar are indisÂ­pensable when making these desserts. Different grades are used for different desserts as each imparts a distinct colour and flavour. The best quality comes from Phetchaburi, a renowned centre of dessert-making. When fresh, palm sugar is ambrosial, but regrettably it is often adulterated with cheaper cane sugar. AccomÂ­plished Thai dessert chef Tanongsak Yordwai suggests that one way to invigorate it is to dissolve it in a little mixed coconut cream and milk, then simmer, stirring regÂ­ularly to prevent scorching and promote its re-crystallisation. I think some young coconut water with a few pandanus leaves would also be an excellent liquid to use for this purpose. Remember, however, that sugar treated in this way will be denser and wetter than just-bought sugar, so reduce any other liquids in the recipe accordÂ­ingly. Palm sugar treated like this can also ferment, so make only as required. Coconut sugar shares many properties with palm sugar, although the aroma is creamier. Once, many desserts specified coconut sugar in their ingrediÂ­ents, but this is now rare.<br><br><strong>SUGAR SYRUP</strong><br>Originally a basic syrup was made by stirring - traditionally with a few folded panÂ­danus leaves Â­ sugar with cold water until it had dissolved. This takes little time if palm sugar is used, especially if the hands are employed, but slightly longer with white sugar. Now, more often sugar syrup is made by simmering white sugar (rarely palm sugar) in perfumed water. The simmering clarifies the sugar, giving the resulÂ­tant syrup an alluring sheen. Once the sugar has dissolved, the syrup is strained. Sometimes the syrup is simmered with crushed eggshells and egg whites to further clarify it and capture any impurities that tend to lurk in the not-so-refmed Thai white sugar. The syrup is allowed to cool slightly before the coaguÂ­lated egg whites and shells are carefully lifted from the liquid. Then it is strained through several layers of damp muslin or a few times through a very fine sieve. This process endows the syrup with a greater lustre and suppleness. Normally the proportions are 1 part sugar to 1 part water, by volÂ­ume or weight, but this proportion, and thus the density of the syrup, is very much a matter of personal choice. Some prefer lighter syrups made with 1 part sugar to 2 parts water; others like their syrup a little denser. Generally it is of little imporÂ­tance if the syrup is to be used to finish dishes or macerate fruit. However, when a dessert calls for an item to be poached or simmered in a syrup, it is imperative that the syrup is of the correct density. If palm sugar or coconut sugar is dissolved in water to make a syrup, be careful, for it will scorch and taint if simmered too long.<br><br><strong>MALTOSE</strong><br>This can be added as a safeguard when making concentrated sugar syrups and thick palm sugar candies, as its chemical composition retards crystallisation. It retains its distinctive taste when used with white sugar, but becomes indistinguishable when combined with palm sugar. Maltose also softens caramels and candies, helping them to remain pliable once cool.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>HONEY</strong><br>It is uncommon to include honey in Thai desserts, although it can be used as a subÂ­stitute for maltose. It also makes an ambrosial dipping sauce for fruit or pastries, perhaps tempered by lime juice.<br><br><strong>STICKY RICE</strong><br>The best white sticky rice to use for desserts is from the previous year's harvest. It has a deeper taste than new rice and, while it takes longer to cook, the grains retain a pleasÂ­ing toothsome character. Sticky rice is usually soaked overnight in cold water before use Â­ if this is forgotten, it can be soaked in warm, but not hot, water for 30 minutes or so. Black sticky rice has a tinted bran, and is used only for desserts. It must be soaked overnight in plenty of water before it is cooked and then boiled until completely tender. Otherwise, when sugar is added, any uncooked starch in the rice toughens.<br><br><strong>FLOUR</strong><br>Whatever it is made from - rice, tapioca, arrowroot or mung beans - flour can beprepared fresh or bought dried. All dried flour should be sieved before use in desserts. The most fastidious cooks will grind their own fresh flour. While time-consuming, this is not difficult. The rice (long-grain or sticky) is first soaked in plenty of water for a few hours, then it is milled Â­ traditionally in a heavy, granite affair. A modern reprieve is to blitz the rice in a blender or food processor, with a litÂ­tle water to facilitate the process, until it is truly pureed. The resulting paste is collected in a cloth bag, which is weighed down overnight to extract any excess liquid; it may slightly ferment during the night, but this only adds to its character. The paste retains some moisture Â­in fact, it is crumbly Â­ and must be used within a day, otherwise it will have soured too much. It is nutty and less starchy than dried flour and imparts an indefinable subtlety and finesse to desserts. In pastries, it makes a softer dough and, while allowing other ingredients to shine, it also retains its own nutty rice flavour. If using fresh flour, take into account the extra moisture it contains and alter recipes accordingly. Using completely dry flour means that pastries do lose some comÂ­plexity of taste, but it is unquestionably more convenient. Some Thai cooks perfume<br><br>dried flour with jasmine as a matter of course. Recipes may call for smoking the flour, others require it to be roasted: each process gives it a different, yet enhanced, taste. Rice flour is most commonly used in Thai desserts. The best qualÂ­ity is very white and absorbs a surprising amount of liquid. It cooks quite quickly and contains no gluten, so when cooked it yields a thick paste with a short 'crisp' texture and a good sheen. White sticky rice flour results in a rather heavy, densely textured pastry when cooked. It can be used alone, but more often is added in comÂ­bination with rice flour, each imparting its own qualities to the finished dessert. Black sticky rice flour has the same properties as white sticky rice flour, but it turns a deep purple when cooked and is not commonly used. Tapioca flour, extracted from the cassava root, gives a malleable, silken and dense texture to pastries. It is rarely used alone, but rather to lend elasÂ­ticity to rice flour pastry. Thai arrowroot flour is often quite lumpy: it needs to be ground and sieved before being added to other flour. It softens and lightens pastry, giving a crunchy texture. Mung bean flour is made from blanched or roasted mung beans, with their skins being removed before grinding. When cooked alone with water, mung bean flour becomes a translucent, tasteless paste; hence it is generally used with other flours.<br><br><strong>MUNG BEANS</strong><br>Yellow mung beans form the basis of several classic Thai desserts, especially yellow bean pudding. Roasted and ground mung beans, or occasionally roasted sesame seeds, may be used as a garnish. Mung bean flour (see above) is also used in some desserts.<br><br><strong>EGGS</strong><br>Duck eggs are ideal for use in Thai desserts; they are available from some deliÂ­catessens and specialist butchers. They are larger than chicken eggs and richer in flavour, with a deeper-coloured yolk and a more viscous white. Unless otherwise specified, the recipes here are for large chicken eggs, so remember to compensate for the difference in size if using duck eggs: a duck egg is roughly 25 per cent larger than a large chicken egg.<br><br><strong>HYDROLYSED LIME WATER</strong><br>Tender fruit is often soaked in hydrolysed lime water to tighten its cell membranes, enabling it to survive prolonged simmering without dissolving or toughening. Once soaked, the fruit must be thoroughly rinsed in running water.<br><br><strong>AGAR-AGAR</strong><br>This flavourless, seaweed-derived setting agent gives a crisp crunchiness to desserts that is unique. It is normally used to make a pleasant and cooling jelly flavoured with coconut, pandanus or eggs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>10 Weight Loss Tips To Use Now</strong></span><br><br><strong>Method : </strong><br>1. Stretch your meals to 20 minutes or longer. Your stomach, mouth and brain are all connected and it takes 20 minutes of chewing before your stomach signals your brain that you are full. To feel full and successfully lose weight on any weight loss program, you need to eat slowly for 20 minutes or longer.<br><br>2. Drinking 8 glasses of water a day is important to your health, your normal diet and to help lose weight. Water is necessary for the metabolism of your stored fat. Weight loss cannot occur without an active metabolism which requires large quantities of water.<br><br>Another way to use water to lose weight is to drink a large glass of ice water just before meals. The cold causes your stomach to shrink slightly which will make you feel full faster.<br><br>3. The more positive your self-esteem, the better you feel about yourself, the faster and easier it will be for you to lose weight. When you are self-confident, you are better able to take charge of your life. It also means that after you lose weight, it will stay gone permanently.<br><br>4. When you go fat free or low fat, you also cut out much of the taste of the foods you eat. Add the flavor back with herbs and spices. Strong flavors such as vinegar, garlic, chili powder, cayenne, curry powder, rosemary and tarragon can be used to doctor up any food you are eating. For your low fat and fat free diets, experiment with different herbs and spices until you find some you like. Staying on your fat free or low fat diet will be easier and your weight loss will be speeded up.<br><br>5. Increase your metabolism by as much as 40% by using hot and spicy foods such as hot peppers of all varieties and mustards. Research shows these foods all increase your metabolism. For double duty, give up fat filled mayonnaise for mustard and add hot peppers to your food for greater flavor and increased metabolism.<br><br>6. Negative emotions will also interfere with your weight loss program. It's difficult to stay motivated to lose weight when you feel bad. Overeating often accompanies negative emotions such as depression, anxiety, fear, guilt and anger.<br><br>7. To lose weight faster, reduce your intake of caffeine. Caffeine leads to an increase of insulin in your body which retards the burning of your stored fat. This is a simple chemical reaction in your body that you can change. Reduce your caffeine intake by 50% and see what happens. Here is a rough guide to use when looking at the amount of caffeine you currently take in:<br>Brewed coffee (6 oz. cup) - 100mg; Instant coffee (6 oz.) - 70mg; Tea (6 oz.) - 50mg; Soft drinks (12oz.) - (Coke, Dr. Pepper, Mountain Dew) - 50mg; Dark chocolate (1 oz.) - 20mg Milk chocolate (1 oz.) - 6mg.<br><br>8. Increase your intake of fiber rich foods. They will help fill you up faster and will help all the food you eat pass through your digestive system more easily.<br><br>9. Exercise is probably the most important key to increasing your metabolism and burning off excess fat.<br><br>Research shows that you burn more stored fat for energy when you do aerobic exercises on an empty stomach than on a full stomach. Research also shows that you burn more stored fat when you exercise late in the day rather than in the morning. Put together, the best time to exercise to lose weight by burning your stored fat is in the late afternoon/early evening before dinner. Second best is in the morning before breakfast.<br><br>Our metabolism naturally starts to slow down about 8 hours after we wake up. Thirty minutes of aerobic exercises in the evening, before dinner, will not only burn off stored fat but it increases your metabolism for about two to three more hours just when it was starting to slow down. This produces a significant increase in fat burned off, even after the exercise is over.<br><br>10. To lose weight quickly, never skip a meal. Your first meal after waking starts your metabolism. Your metabolism then speeds up for about eight hours and then starts slowing down until you go to sleep when it goes to low until you wake and eat and start the cycle again.<br><br>Skip breakfast and your metabolism doesn't get started until lunch time. You've just missed three or four hours of fat burning time. When you skip meals during the day, your metabolism also slows down.<br><br>Weight loss through the burning of stored fat is all about eating enough of the right kinds of foods so you stay full and your metabolism stays as high as possible.<br><br>Remember, if you feel hungry, your metabolism slows down. Stay full with healthy, nonfattening foods and your metabolism will continue to burn your stored fat as fast as your body will allow.<br><br></div>

If you are going to an after hour party, you should eat early dinner before you go to the party or eat while you drink. The fructose in foods will help absorb alcohol.<br><br><strong>*Vitamins B &amp; C: </strong><br>Take vitamins B &amp; C. Alcohol will deplete nutrients from your body and the vitamins will help you replace what you lose from your body by drinking. Drinking orange juice, grapefruit juice, and grape juice will also help.<br><br><strong>*Drink Milk: </strong><br>Milk will help absorb alcohol slowly.<br><br><strong>*Do Not Take Aspirin: </strong><br>You may think it might be a good idea to take Aspirin before you get the worst headache, but it makes it even worse.<br><br><strong>*Know Your Body: </strong><br>If you had hangovers before, learn from your experience. Were you drinking dark liquor? Were you drinking different types of liquor all night? Were you drinking too fast? Try to analyze what your body can handle. Dark liquors (or colourless liquors) make some people feel sick. Some say drinking different types of liquors or liqueurs bring them headaches. However what you drink doesn't matter as much as how much you drink.<br><br><strong>*Do Not Drive: </strong><br>Do not drive a car to get to where you will be drinking unless you have somebody who can drive you back.<br><br><strong>While You Drink:</strong><br>*Drink Water: always order a cup of water when ordering an alcohol beverage. Water will help rehydrate your system. The more water you drink, the better solution after the night.<br><br><strong>*Eat while you drink: </strong><br>Try to eat while you drink if possible. Food will not only help absorb alcohol slowly, but also slow your drinking pitch down.<br><br><strong>*Order fruit cocktails: </strong><br>Fresh fruit juice will replace the vitamins that you lose from your body while drinking. If you know that you are not a big drinker, try cocktails with simple ingredients such as Rum and Orange Juice or Vodka and Cranberry Juice etc.<br><br><strong>*Watch Your Pace: </strong><br>Never drink too fast. Drink as slow as possible. When you feel fine (meaning when you can tell or cannot tell that alcohol starts changing your behavior, thinking, and sight etc.), you should stop drinking alcohol and drink water. If the party goes longer than you expected, order some fruit juice.<br><br><strong>After:<br>*Drink Water: </strong><br>before going to bed, drink water. Do not drink coffee. Coffee will help dehydration.<br><br><strong>*Vitamins B &amp; C: </strong><br>Take some vitamins before going to bed.<br><br><strong>*Sleep: </strong><br>sleeping may be difficult because your body temperature is higher than usual. If you can't go to sleep, drink more water. If you need to throw up, throw up. When you wake up, drink more water and eat some fruits and try to go back to sleep.<br><br>*Despite all the things that you could do to avoid a hangover before you drink and as you drink, if you still get a hangover, you are not trying enough. Think about what went wrong and learn from your experience. And remember, drinking is supposed to be fun! Not to throw up at the end of the night.<br></div>

Simmer, then stain out the chunks before using the broth to make the rest ! of the soup.<br><br>Thicken soup quickly by stirring or whisking in leftover mashed potatoes, they absolutely disappear and create a thick soup. You can even cook potatoes and mash them just to use as a thickening agent.<br><br>Half your soup can be whirled in the blender or with a hand blender, or you can add canned beans that have been blended to use as a thickener.<br><br>Make a roux of butter and flour to thicken your soup, cook it in a fryi! ng pan, then thin with some of the soup liquid and whisk into the pot ot soup.<br><br>Add shredded cabbage to a soup during the last 15 min. this will also thicken a soup, you can even use a bag of coleslaw cabbage.<br><br>Is your soup still too watery?  Stir in some instant rice, or some frozen veggies.<br><br>Bread crumbs, whole grain bread or white bread, the crusts dried and ground up in a food processor, can be used for thickening soup ! too, the crumbs just disappear into the soup.  This is an excellent way to use left over bread.  I like the whole grain breads best.<br><br>Fresh chopped parsley added in the last few minutes of cooking adds a wonderful fresh flavor to soups and stews.<br><br>Precook your pasta before adding it to the soup. It doesn't bring all the starch with it and can be added last so it doesn't get overcooked.  You can even use leftover pasta that you have stored in the fridge.<br><br>Add the vegetables to your soup in the order of the time it takes to cook them.  Carrots, onions and potatoes first, zucchini, fresh corn frozen peas, etc. during the last 10 minutes.<br><br>Fresh herbs have more flavor, try fresh dill, basil, parsley etc. in your soups added during the last 10 min. of cooking. You'll have 'gourmet soups'!<br><br>Try making soups with 'everything' in them, potatoes, barley, beans, lentils, rice, pasta, and lots of veggies too. (barley needs about 1 1/2 hr. to cook)<br><br>To make a cream soup without all the cream, for each qt. of cold water add 1/2 can of evaporated milk and approx. 2 c. of powdered milk. Do not boil, cook this type of soup in a double boiler.<br><br>Don't forget a dash or garlic, this is the 'vanilla' of soup making.<br><br>A pinch of red pepper flakes makes a a wonderful addition to most soups.<br><br>Freeze your soups in serving size jars, pails etc. to be ready as needed.<br><br>To make a good base for your soup, you can use any of the following:<br>-canned soups, such as tomato or mushroom or crm. of chicken<br>-canned tomatoes or tomato juice<br>-pot or pearl barley, makes a wonderfully flavored soup<br>-canned chicken broth<br>-homemade stocks<br>-commercial soup bases<br>-oxo type cubes or powders<br>-the addition of some bacon<br>-clam or seafood broth<br><br>Do use your leftovers in soups.  Have zip bags in your freezer and just keep adding scraps of veggies, meats etc., keep a different bag for each type of meat.<br><br>Add salt to your soup at the start and taste and adjust seasoning thought the cooking time.  Canned soups are highly salted.<br><br>For extra quick soups, used canned soups as a base, mushroom, tomato, chicken broth etc. which come in really large sizes, then create from there.<br><br>Restaurant Supply Places also have a huge variety of 'add water and stir' types of soups and also many frozen soups available. So if you are short on time or talent and have the money, that can be a really easy answer to a 'soup problem' for a large gathering.<br><br>Check your cupboards for 'secret ingredients' you just never know if a dash of this or that (bbq sauce, Worcestershire, soya sauce, vinegar, salsa etc. will be just the missing ingredient you've been looking for.)

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>How Tequila is made</strong></span><br><br>Tequila is a product that blends cultures. The process that derives it is also representative of an interrelation of the diverse productive processes that characterize the indigenous Prehispanic culture of Jalisco, Mexico and the introduction of the Spanish distillation process. This blend is present in all the aspects of Tequila, from its production means to its final consumption. Even though it cannot be affirmed whether the prehispanic culture distillated or not their beverages, it can be affirmed that they applied the fermentation process. Historically the fermentation practiced by the prehispanic tribes derived a kind of wine or beer. These beverages were mainly utilized for ceremonial and ritualistic purposes. Even though the fermentation process did not achieve complete compatibility with the existing industrial process, it did achieve positive results in relation to the curado. (A stage of fermentation ) The distillation process was introduced by the Spaniards on the 17th century. The distillation process was widely utilized in the territorial boundaries of the New Spain, formerly Mexico. It can be affirmed with certainty that the agave plant and the boiling process are by historical precedent, vernacular elements of the prehispanic culture of Tiquila. The traditional procedure was only affected at its final stage by the Spanish distillation process.<br><br>Referring to the distillation process, it can be affirmed that its existence was achieved through the intervention of the Moors in the territories of Andalucia, Espana. The Moors imported into Spain the Arabic process which would eventually reach the New Continent. By acknowledging the historical merge it can be stated that Tequila represents a beverage of mixed identities.<br><br>The Tequila as a distillate product received more intervention from Spain than from the vernacular prehispanic tribes. The reason stands in the fact that Spain intervened in the commercialization and land control of the New Spain.<br><br>By this time it is extremely important to understand the historical process that derives the beverage we enjoy today. The Tequila is the product obtained from the distillation and fermentation of the mezcal plant scientifically known as Xerofica-Agave-Tequilana (Member of the lily family). The two main types are the Agave-Azul and Agave-Xinguin. These species are cultivated in the states of Jalisco and Nayarit in Mexico. However, other species include: Moraneno, Mano Larga, Chino Azul, Bermejo, Singuin, Chato, Sopilote, and Pie de Mula. It is precisely the type of plant which gives the Tequila its original designation. The Agave or Xerofica-Tequilana requires ten years of complete development and three additional years for its production and manufacture. In order for the beverage to become classified as Tequila it requires 51 percent of fermented sugars extracted from the Agave-Azul also known as the Weber-Azul. If such condition is not established, then the beverage obtained is referred to as mezcal. Among the Tequila lineage the following types are the most recognized: Tequila-Blanco(White) or Plata (Silver), tequila-Reposado, and Tequila Anejo. Other types include the Tequila-Dorado (Its color is obtained through the use of caramel and other flavorings) and the Chinaco which rests on oak barrels for two to three months. The Tequila Anejo extends its maturation up to a year or more until it acquires an amber color.<br><br>The number of agave plants varies from 2,500 to 2,800 per hectare. The number of plants in relation to the cultivating field yield to a proper growth. Information disclosed by the state of Jalisco in Mexico revealed that by 1980, the cultivated area amounted to 30 and 35 thousand hectares. The same year the Tequila Industry classified objectively the existence of 33 distilleries. These distilleries employed 5830 people of the region from which 1,230 were employed in the distillery and 4,600 were employed in the cultivating field. The state of Nayarit had at the time 3 distilleries; However, 95 percent of the production was developed in the State of Jalisco.<br><br>The ideal conditions for the cultivation of the Blue-Agave is found on arid areas characterized by the presence of reddish clays and (siliza). These conditions are properly met by the state of Jalisco and Nayarit. However Jalisco has been officially recognized as the producer and manufacturer of the Tequila Weber Azul. The agave Weber-Azul requires a maturation of eight to ten years. During that time the Quiote or agave-flower flourishes. It is necessary to eventually discard the (germane) of the flower in order to condense the (savia). The (savia) is responsible for the sweet content of Tequila. The maturation process is necessary to reach the Jima. The Jima is the process in which the (pencas) are pulled from the ground. The process requires an experienced ability which becomes mastered through experience. The Jima is a preliminary stage that will eventually guide to a boiling stage by means of industrial kilns better known as Autoclaves. The Autoclaves have been the result of a technological evolution. Prior to their existence, the boiling process was conducted through conical holes dug underground. The upper part of the holes was faced upwards.<br><br>During the last years of the 19th century, the conical holes were substituted by a more efficient generation which permitted a faster boiling. After hours of direct fire exposure, the plants were (trituradas) in a processor known as Tahona. The Tahona is a circular space built with cantera stone in which a heavy stone shaped in the form of a wheel rotated upon its own axis. The main purpose of the stone was to moler (mash) the agave's extract in order to derive a type of paste diluted with water. Once the paste was obtained, it was deposited in containers for its fermentation. Eventually, the fermentation would be proceeded by the distillation that occurred in the Alambiques. The end result also known as the Mosto evaporated its alcoholic content and was eventually placed in the bottom of a steel deposit that was located in the upper part of the pot. The deposit was cooled by means of circulating water around its upper part. From this process, the vapor condensed and would reach a liquid state. The liquid obtained is the Tequila.<br><br>The technological evolution has aided the Tequila Industry by improving an optimum process which now enables better boiling capacities through the use of more efficient kilns and autoclaves. Even though these improvements have aided in the production process, the tequila Industry stands for the tradition and quality acquired only through experience.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>History of Tequila</strong></span><br><br>In order to understand with precision the origin of the Tequila, it is necessary to acknowledge its prehispanic roots. During the prehispanic era, the Tiquila tribe from Amatitlan, learned its essential process. The process utilized by them consisted of boiling and fermenting the agave plant in order to obtain a ritualistic beverage only consumed by religious authorities.<br><br>The beverage and its origin were unknown to the European continent until the arrival of conquistador Hernan Cortez. When Cortez arrived to what he believed to be the Indies, he discovered an enchanted world of resources and wide commercial practices. In his first letter to King Carlos V, Cortez denotes special interest to the existence of the mezcal:<br><br>"..They sell honey emanated from corn that are as sweet as the sugar obtained from a plant they call maguey, from these plants they make wine and sugar which they also sell."<br><br>With the influence of the religious world through the mission of spreading the word of God in the New Continent, the missionaries also discovered the presence of Indigenous products such as the maguey and the corn. Fray Francisco Ximenez, a Spanish monk, indicated the importance of the product diversity obtained from the maguey plant during the 16th century. In his observations he stated that the Mexcalmelt was one of the most utilized varieties of mezcal. However, the Tepemexcall was utilized more emphatically for religious practices.<br><br>In the year 1651, Jeronimo Hernandez, a Spanish doctor indicates that the Tequila beverage was strictly utilized for medicinal purposes. Among the uses were rheumatic cures achieved by rubbing tequila on the affected body parts.<br><br>The prehispanic realm conceived the importance of the products and rituals derived from the maguey and mezcal. However the history that founded the origins of the Tequila as a product initiate in 1758. In 1758 Jose Cuervo, a Spanish entrepreneur was given full cultivating rights on the vast territorial extensions of Villoslada, Jalisco. One year later Jose Maria Guadalupe Cuervo, was given by the king of Spain the rights on the production of Tequila. During the 1850's Jose Maria Castaneda established La Antigua, a mezcal and wine distillery.<br><br>La Antigua was then acquired by Cenobio Sauza on September first, 1873. During the same year Mr. Sauza exported eight barrels to the United States. In 1888 he changed the name to La Perseverancia.<br><br>La Perseverancia would eventually face changes in the development of the Industry. The political and socio-economic changes developing in Mexico affected the tequila industry in the 18th and 19th centuries. Tequila was became a taxed product The taxes were designated to the fund war against the remaining of emperor Maximilian.<br><br>Another significant change was the introduction of the Mexican rail system. The coming of the train as a means of transportation, enabled the tequila Industry to reach broader destinations.<br><br>The extra regional markets were conquered due to the solid development of Commercial systems. These commercial systems enabled the tequila market to participate internationally. From a national product, the tequila would become an international oriented market. The first exports were achieved by land into the United States by the second halve of the 19th century. The tequila industry achieved high commercial goals. Along with these achievements, technological improvements and optimum agricultural planning dictated the success of the Industry.<br><br>The industrialism that marked the shift from a semi-rural industry to a more mechanized one would enable a more sophisticated and efficient production capacity.<br><br>The transition of technologies and production capacities were a clear sign of the 20th century. The same shift geared a more active consumption that required further changes and adaptations that would be evident by the Second World War. During the peace time, the demand for tequila would increase miraculously. The Second World War increased the market for the product. By 1950 the number of agave fields increased to 5697. An increase of 110 percent in relation to 1940.<br><br>The sixties are representative of a trend in the national and international levels of consumption. 1965 marks a new period in the history of tequila. The tequila industry passed from being a traditional oriented industry to a more developed market. The decade that marked the sixties represented a considerable increase of national and international tequila consumption. The capital city of the state of Jalisco, Guadalajara became then imperative and essential in the administrative endeavors that were required for the market reform.<br><br>The new shift in the maneuver of the Industry lead to new control classes in which a traditional industry became open to investors. The reform itself, reorganized the producers into diverse classifications:<br><br>A). The societies in which international investment is involved.<br>B). The societies in which smaller national and local investors participate.<br>C). The societies formed by local families which best describe the traditional market."<br><br>With the existence of an international oriented market, the producers of tequila competed and reorganized their commercial strategies in order to capture the international client. The tequila industry invested considerable amounts of capital towards international advertisement. It is by the understanding of Tequila's past that we can now rejoice with one of the most popular drinks of our time and try a shot accompanied by all the historical richness that characterize it.<br><br>It only takes saying..... Salud, Tequila !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>10 ways to get your freezer to work for you</strong></span><br><br>1. Get a refrigerator/freezer thermometer to check the temperature. The closer to 0 F the better. Food kept at 0 F will last months longer than, say, 20 F or 31 F.<br><br>2. Trapped air causes freezer burn. Make sure you select a container small enough so the contents fill it. You can remove a great deal of the air from a freezer bag without a fancy vacuum-sealing machine. Seal all but enough space to slip in a drinking straw. Now inhale on that straw to pull all the air out of the bag. Quickly zip the last bit. Pop it into the freezer.<br><br>3. It takes a lot more electricity to keep an empty freezer at 0 F than it does a full one, so pack it as tightly as you can. If you don't have enough food to do that, fill empty milk cartons with water and freeze them. The square shape is better than round jugs because you can stack them like bricks. Bonus: You'll have plenty of fresh water in the event of a power outage.<br><br>4. The simplest way to preserve fresh tomatoes is to freeze them whole. Just rinse, dry and spread them out on a cookie sheet. Freeze overnight. When they're frozen, put in a freezer bag and return to the freezer. To use, remove them from the bag and thaw. When they're thawed, slip the skins off and use in your favorite recipes. They will not be like fresh tomatoes, but they're great for making sauces, chili, etc.<br><br>5. You can freeze fresh zucchini. Choose young squash with tender skin. Wash and cut them into 1/2-inch slices. Drop them into boiling water for three minutes. Cool promptly, drain and package in zipper-type bags or containers, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Seal and freeze.<br><br>6. With fresh herbs, wash, drain and pat them dry with paper towels. Wrap a few sprigs or leaves in wax paper. Seal in a freezer bag. Freeze. While they're still frozen, whack the bag on the countertop and the herbs will shatter. Chopped herbs in an instant! Use as you would fresh.<br><br>7. Onions: Chop and spread into a single layer on a cookie sheet. Freeze. Once frozen, pour them into zipper-type bags or containers and put back in freezer.<br><br>8. Cheese freezes well but changes consistency. Once it's frozen, you won't be able to slice it. Instead of freezing a large block, grate the cheese before freezing and freeze in smaller portions.<br><br>9. Inventory: The worst thing for your electricity bill is to keep opening the freezer. Post an inventory list on the door. When you use something, mark it off. Now you can "shop" the list, not stand there with the door open.<br><br>10. Before freezing bread and bakery items, slip a paper towel inside the bag to cover the item. Reseal, pressing out as much air as possible. It will be fresh months from now. I haven't a clue why this works, but it does.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>How to Get Rid of Fruit Flies With a Homemade Fruit Fly Trap </strong></span><br><br>Anyone who has ever left a few bananas sitting out or forgotten to change their garbage knows all too well the problem with fruit flies. It seems that once they've invaded your kitchen, you can't get rid of them. You can scrub, clean, remove tempting fruit and spray the garbage can with disinfectants, but they always come back. You can't help but cringe just looking at them.<br><br>We have always had problems with fruit flies, with one of the main reasons being that we live in an apartment and by law - must recycle. Because of where we live, we have to keep our recycling containers inside until they can be disposed of once a week. If the recyclables aren't cleaned well enough after being used, they make a perfect breeding ground for fruit flies. They love bits of rotting food remnants and seem to thrive in even the smallest amount. When fruit flies move in, they just don't want to leave and will lay eggs in and on anything they can find - fruits &amp; vegetables left on the counter, sink drains, garbage disposals, empty bottles &amp; cans, garbage bags, and even mops and rags.<br><br>A Few Fun Facts About Fruit Flies:<br><br>- Can lay up to 500 eggs at a time<br><br>- Their entire lifecycle is complete in about a week<br><br>- While considered mainly a pest, they have the potential to contaminate food with dangerous bacteria<br><br>We all know that removing the food, getting rid of the garbage &amp; cleaning up plays a big role, but we also know what it's like to move a piece of fruit and have a swarm of fruit flies fill the air only to escape your attempts at killing them. Where are they gonna go? Obviously the ones flying around can't be easily captured or killed, so they'll linger about until they find some other place to lay eggs and the whole cycle starts again.<br><br>In all my attempts, I found the best way to capture and remove the ones that escape is to create a simple trap using a jar, plastic wrap and a piece of food. Here's how it works:<br><br>1. Get a small jar you don't plan on using again ( like a baby food jar or something similar ) and wash it out well. Make sure it is not a jar with a funky smell such as a used pickle jar or anything that use to have strong spices. You want a clean, odorless jar.<br><br>2. Take a chunk of banana and place inside the jar. This is why you want a clean, odorless jar - so that the banana smell won't be overpowered by other not-so-tempting smells. Banana seems to work the best, but you can experiment.<br><br>3. Fit a piece of plastic wrap over the top of the jar, making sure that it fits tight and well sealed around the edges. Then take a pen or pencil and poke 4 to 5 holes in the plastic, just big enough for a fruit fly to fit into. Once a fruit fly crawls in, it can't get out. You would think they would just fly back out through the holes, but they won't!<br><br>4. Place the jar in an area where you have seen the most fruit flies. Depending on the amount of fruit flies you have, you can expect to start seeing the jar fill up within just a few hours. After 24 hours, you will discover just how bad your fruit fly problem is!<br><br>This simple, inexpensive &amp; safe method works perfectly and if you don't want the jar on public display, you can always slip it behind the garbage can, in the cupboard or even under the sink (Just don't forget about it!). You will want to empty the jar every 3-4 days before any eggs have a chance to hatch. While adult fruit flies can't easily escape through the holes, their maggots can very easily, and besides that - they are disgusting to see crawling around in the jar. You don't want to see these things crawling on your counter!<br><br>Cleaning out the jar shouldn't be a problem. If you have a kind heart, you can choose to let them go outside. Personally, I spray the little buggers with bug spray, wash out the jar and start the whole process over again if I think there are still some fruit flies left to capture.<br><br>For bad fruit fly problems, you will want to use this method for a good two weeks to make sure you've captured the majority of fruit flies. You might even want to use a few jars in different places. Before long, your kitchen will be back to normal.</div>

One medium lime equals approximately 1 1/2 to 2 tbsp. of juice, 1 1/2 tsp. grated peel, and 6 to 8 slices.<br><br>Another method that can be used to make limes easier to extract the juice is to freeze them for 24 hours and then thaw in the refrigerator before juicing.<br><br>To prevent lime wedges from squirting juice in unwanted areas, pierce the flesh of the lime wedge with a fork before squeezing.<br><br>Cut down on the amount of salt used on your food by adding lime instead to enhance the flavor of the food.<br><br>Lime juice can be used as a marinade to tenderize meat.<br><br>Do not use aluminum pans when cooking with limes because the acid in the limes reacts with the aluminum and affect the flavor and color of the food.<br></div>

Place in the freezer and use when needed in breads, muffins, cakes, and other recipes that call for mashed bananas.<br><br>Blend mashed bananas with ice cream to make a banana flavored shake.<br><br>Place unripe bananas in a paper bag with one ripe apple to speed ripening.<br><br>Place bananas that are the desired ripeness in the refrigerator to slow the ripening process. This will provide a few more days of use before they become overripe. The skins will turn brown but the flesh will not be affected. Keep up to 3 days in the refrigerator.<br><br></div>

Overmixing will make them tough.<br><br>Cook pancakes on medium high heat. If you donÂ’t have an electric griddle or skillet, test by dropping a few drops of water on the hot surface. When water sizzles and disappears almost immediately, youÂ’re ready to cook.<br><br>Turn pancakes only once. Pour batter onto griddle and cook until pancakes begin to dry around the edge - you can peek to see if the first side is brown. Turn and cook on other side.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SOME LOW FAT ALTERNATIVES   </strong><br><br>* For low-fat gravy, use a separator (from any kitchen wares store), cool the gravy so the fat rises to the top and pour the flavorful liquid from the spout at the bottom.<br><br>* Use half the amount of high-calorie ingredients like chocolate chips, but use the mini kind, or chop things small, so they go evenly throughout the dish.<br><br>* You can remove most of the fat from a can of soup by putting it in the freezer for 10 minutes and scooping the fat off the top.<br><br>* To flavor your next batch of rice, without adding lots of calories, cook it in broth.<br><br>* The three biggest dietary-fat culprits: salad dressing, margarine and cheese. Aim for low-fat versions of each.<br><br>* Peppers, chives, garlic and onions tend to satisfy your taste buds so you eat less.<br></div>
