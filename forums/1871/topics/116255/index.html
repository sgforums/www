There might be five hundred apples on<br>the tree, but each apple has just ten seeds.<br><br>That is still quite a lot of seeds per tree. We might ask, "Why<br>would you need so many seeds to grow just a few more apple trees?"<br><br>Nature has something to teach us here. It is telling us : "Not all<br>seeds grow. In life, most seeds never grow. So if you really want to<br>make something happen, you had better try more than once."<br><br>This might mean :<br>You will attend twenty interviews to get one job.<br>You will interview forty people to find one good employee.<br>You will talk to fifty people to sell one house, one car, one<br>vacuum cleaner, one insurance policy, or a business idea.<br>And you might meet a hundred acquaintances just to find one special<br>friend.<br><br>When we understand the "Law of the Seed", we do not get so<br>disappointed.<br><br>We stop feeling like victims. We learn how to deal with things that<br>happen to us.<br><br>Laws of nature are not things to take personally.<br><br>We just need to understand them - and work with them.<br><br>IN A NUTSHELL<br>Successful people fail more often. But they plant more seeds. When<br>things are beyond your control, here is something that you must NOT<br>DO so as to avoid misery in your life :<br><br>You must not decide how you think the world SHOULD be.<br>You must not make rules for how everyone SHOULD behave.<br>Then, when the world does not obey your rules, you get angry!<br>That is what miserable people do!<br><br>On the other hand, let us say you expect that :<br>Friends SHOULD return favours.<br>People SHOULD appreciate you.<br>Planes SHOULD arrive on time.<br>Everyone SHOULD be honest.<br>Your husband, your wife or best friend SHOULD remember your<br>birthday.<br><br>These expectations may sound reasonable.<br>But often, these things would not happen!<br>So you end up frustrated and disappointed.<br><br>There is a better strategy.<br>Demand less, and instead, have preferences!<br>For things that are beyond your control, tell yourself :<br><br>I WOULD PREFER "A", BUT IF "B" HAPPENS, IT IS OK TOO!"<br><br>This is really a change in mindset.<br>It is a shift in attitude, and it gives you more peace of mind....<br><br>You prefer that people are polite.... but when they are rude, it<br>does not ruin your day.<br><br>You prefer sunshine.... but if it rains, it is OK too!<br><br>To become happier, we either need to :<br>a) Change the world,or<br>b) Change our thinking.<br><br>It is easier to change our Thinking!<br><br>IN A NUTSHELL<br>It is not the problem that is the issue, but rather it is your<br>attitude attending to the problem that is the problem.<br>It is not what happens to you that determine your happiness.<br>It is how you think about what happens to you!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for sharing!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>This Law of the Seed is a good one, i will print it out to share with my children and i have this to share with u :<br><br>Failure is the ignition to all greatness. If we were successful at everything we tried, our lives would be shallow. We'd never have the opportunity to develop resiliency, perseverance, and character and experience the deep satisfaction that comes through the constant effort to improve.<br><br>As for the second part to yr post :<br><br>I would like to share wat S.Covey has to say :<br><br>everyone of us has our circle of concern and circle of influence.<br><br>as we look at those things within our circle of concern, it becomes apparent that there are some things over which we hv no real control and others that we can do something about.<br><br>Proactive ppl focus their efforts in the circle of influence. they work on the things they can do something about. The nature of their energy is positive, enlarging and magnifying, causing their circle of influence to increase.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote>You must not decide how you think the world SHOULD be.<br>You must not make rules for how everyone SHOULD behave.<br>Then, when the world does not obey your rules, you get angry!<br>That is what miserable people do!<br><br>On the other hand, let us say you expect that :<br>Friends SHOULD return favours.<br>People SHOULD appreciate you.<br>Planes SHOULD arrive on time.<br>Everyone SHOULD be honest.<br>Your husband, your wife or best friend SHOULD remember your<br>birthday.<br><br>These expectations may sound reasonable.<br>But often, these things would not happen!<br>So you end up frustrated and disappointed.<br><br>There is a better strategy.<br>Demand less, and instead, have preferences!<br>For things that are beyond your control, tell yourself :<br><br>I WOULD PREFER "A", BUT IF "B" HAPPENS, IT IS OK TOO!"<br><br>This is really a change in mindset.<br>It is a shift in attitude, and it gives you more peace of mind....<br><br>You prefer that people are polite.... but when they are rude, it<br>does not ruin your day.<br><br>You prefer sunshine.... but if it rains, it is OK too!<br><br>To become happier, we either need to :<br>a) Change the world,or<br>b) Change our thinking.<br><br>It is easier to change our Thinking!<br><br>IN A NUTSHELL<br>It is not the problem that is the issue, but rather it is your<br>attitude attending to the problem that is the problem.<br>It is not what happens to you that determine your happiness.<br>It is how you think about what happens to you![/b]</blockquote><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v331/ac_splash/bluemermaid.gif"></div>
