            <div class='col-md body'>John woke up one morning immensely aroused so he turned over to his wife's side of the bed. His wife, Heather, had already awakened though, and she was downstairs preparing breakfast in the kitchen. Afraid that he might spoil things by getting up, John called his little boy into the room and asked him to' Bring this note to your beautiful Mummy.' The note read:<br><br>The Tent Pole Is Up,<br>The Canvas Is Spread,<br>The Hell With Breakfast,<br>Come Back To Bed.<br><br>Heather, grinning, answered the note and then asked her son to 'Bring this to your silly Daddy.' The note read:<br><br>Take The Tent Pole Down,<br>Put The Canvas Away,<br>The Monkey Had A Hemorrhage,<br>No Circus Today.<br><br>John read the note and quickly scribbled a reply. Then, he asked his son to take it back to 'The lady in the kitchen'. The note read:<br><br>The Tent Pole's Still Up,<br>And The Canvas Still Spread,<br>So Drop What You're Doing,<br>And Come Give Me Some Head.<br><br>Laughing, Heather answered the note and then asked her son to 'Take this to the poor man upstairs'. The note read:<br><br>I'm Sure That Your Pole's<br>The Best In The Land.<br>But I'm Busy Right Now,<br>So Do It By Hand!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A woman decided to have a face lift for her birthday. She spent $5000 and felt really good about the results. On her way home she stopped at a dress shop to look around. As she was leaving, she said to the sales clerk, 'I hope you don't mind me asking, but how old do you think I am?' 'About 35,' was the reply. 'I'm actually 47,' the woman said, feeling really happy. After that she went into McDonalds for lunch and asked the order taker the same question. He replied, 'Oh, you look about 29.' 'I am actually 47!' she said, feeling really good. While standing at the bus stop she asked an old man the same question. He replied, 'I am 85 years old and my eyesight is going. But when I was young there was a sure way of telling a woman's age. If I put my hand up your skirt I will be able to tell your exact age. 'There was no one around, so the woman said, 'What the hell?' and let him slip his hand up her skirt. After feeling around for a while, the old man said, 'OK, You are 47.'Stunned, the woman said, 'That was brilliant! How did you do that?' The old man replied, 'I was behind you in line at McDonalds.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Three men were standing in line to get into heaven one day. Apparently it had been a pretty busy day, though, so Peter had to tell the first one, "Heaven's getting pretty close to full today, and I've been asked to admit only people who have had particularly horrible deaths.So what's your story?"<br><br>So the first man replies: "Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed.As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell -- but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the balcony."<br><br>"That sounds like a pretty bad day to me," said Peter, and let the man in.<br><br>The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story.<br><br>"It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. Just when I was thinking I was going to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me instantly, and now I'm here."<br><br>Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death.<br><br>The third man came to the front of the line, and again the whole process was repeated. Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his story.<br><br>"Picture this," says the third man, "I'm hiding naked inside a refrigerator..."</div>
