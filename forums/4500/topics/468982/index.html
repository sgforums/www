              <p>
              </p><p>I like to bring to everyone attention if you are thinking of making a career change to a wedding planner, there is currently a scam in town call the "DoWed" (http://www.dowed.com.sg/)where they are engage as wedding planner to help newly wed couple in their wedding. </p>
              <p>They also conduct course on wedding planner under the name "DoWed Academy", and the owner is Sherwin Lee the scamer at large. The fees he charges are high S$2600, in which he promise there will be a employment after completing the course, which he also make everyone of his students sign the employment letter, the course become a scam on the very first day we all started, to my surprise, there were no sales kit given as promise, instead he give us someone else wedding planner sales kits which to me is totally unethical to begin with. This is the wedding planner program we receive from him: http://www.willrichbridal.com/wedding-packages.html, and it is really unbelievable, a professional wedding planner company does not have their own wedding package, they use a link that belongs to another company. </p>
              <p>He is always giving excuses on a last minutes basic and reason to cancelled the classes, and his reasons are like ... my dog is sick, he is sick but when you see the things he uploaded to his facebook the activity, he didn't look sick but very well and alive and drinking like a horse ... https://www.facebook.com/sherwinl, other reasons, he give was office air-condition not working, office under renovation, meeting etc but he seem to have a lot of his time having long holidays trip to Japan and America. i believe the expense of his long and very expensive holiday trip are all from the course fees we all paid and not deliver.</p>
              <p>We all start the course last year, May 2012, and there is suppose to have an exam in Nov 2012, because he cancelled most of the classes, therefore, we can no longer is able to follow the timetable as set by him.</p>
              <p>He also promise that the class will be given a lists of listing for us to start with, which he also conveniently brush us aside saying that we do not deserve to be given because we are not committed. and he took the listing that belong to us and when away to work on it, what a scam!!!! </p>
              <p>Then he when on a super long holiday in the States without completely the course with us and this trip was make in early 2013, when he return, we question him about not being able to deliver what we pay for and promise, and to our surprise, he told us that there is nothing to learn from him and so the class just ended with out an examination ... what a scam!!!!!</p>
              <p>He took everyone for a ride in the up most unethical way to earn a living, lies after lies he has been telling and putting the blame on us for his self fish gains .... We are all at a lost as to what should we do with a man scam like this. But I believe we are not the only one, I did a check and found our that they were other victim in his earlier courses too ... sigh!</p>
              <p>He will be conducting another scam class soon by DoWed Academy in July 2013, I believe, that money that he is working toward is to up keep his high life and expensive lifestyle on the expense of the innocent people. I hope people who are like us thinking of making a career switch and want to spend our hard earn money on the right investment, just be very very aware about this company call "DoWed" and the owner is Sherwin Lee. </p>
              <p>Lastly, do spread the word around, S$2600 is not a lot of money to him but is a lot and lot of money to many of us. Even about to be wed couple, please stay far, far away from him and this company, trust me you will not be paying and getting what you want.</p>
