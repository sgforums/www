            <div class='col-md body'><p>well....i was circumcised when i was in pri 1 at age 6 in 2000. cause i had phimosis which meant i had a tight foreskin which could not retract. furthermore my pee was like always going all over the shop and my parents were getting tired of cleaning after me.<br><br>so one day my dad observed me peeing and decided that i should be cut as soon as possible during the june holls in kk hospital.<br><br>the op was performed without any kind of anastatic and i cried like siao... i was able to see my dick getting trimed and was in alot of pain (i think the doc used a gomco clamp). after the op i satyed for the night in a c class ward with few other boys who were also cut and we were able to see each other's dicks cuse we could not wear pants.<br><br>i hated circumcision for many years due to the pain but soon forgot about it, until recently during a school camp where many of us had to shower in openly and i got to see many of my friends dicks and realised that out of a class of 39 about 10 of my clasmates had dicks similar to mine. interestingly enough the topic came up when we were talking and i got to learn more about circumcision. now i think circumcision is good so long as the child consents and would like to know more about this topic.<br><br>so plese send in your experiences wether cut or uncut..........</p></div>
