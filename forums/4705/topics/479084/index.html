              are subsequently conducted on a monthly basis during the PTP/BMT
              phase. Special interviews are also granted upon request. Servicemen
              can highlight their difficulties during these interviews for
              assistance.<br> <br> <strong>Orientation Officers</strong> identify, assist and counsel
              BMT recruits with adjustment<br> and/or other personal problems.<br> <br> <strong>NS SAF Counselling Hotline</strong> is a 24-hour

              <p><em><strong>Being psychologically prepared is all about knowing
              what to expect and being prepared for it.</strong></em></p>
              <p>To be better prepared, you can participate in Total Defence
              activities and Open Houses organised by the SAF/SPF/SCDF.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you should also talk to your family members and friends
              who have lived the NS experience. The more you discuss with others,
              the more comfortable and mentally prepared you’ll become.</p>
              <p><strong>Because NS life is different from civilian life before
              enlistment, there are many adjustments you need to
              make.</strong></p>
              <p>A good way to cope is to get support from your buddy and fellow
              recruits. They are going through the same tough training as you, so
              talking to one another will help relieve some tension.</p>
              <p>In most evenings during your leisure time, you’ll also have some
              time to call your family or loved ones to talk. They can give you
              emotional support during NS.</p>
              <p>You can have a one-on-one interview sessions with your officer
              to highlight any problems you may have. If you have a personal or
              family problem that need to be addressed, do let the officer
              know—he may be able to give you some advice or time off to settle
              your problems.</p>
              <p>Life in NS revolves around structure, routine and discipline.
              This helps us stay united as a uniformed organisation as well as
              imparts the rigours necessary to protect our nation and
              citizens.</p>
              <p>This does not mean there is just work and no play. In fact,
              after a few weeks in NS and you’ll find new friends and new reasons
              to smile!</p>
              <p><strong>As a soldier, one of the biggest adjustments you’ll have
              to make quickly is in regimentation and discipline.</strong></p>
              <p>Being in a uniformed organisation, you’ll have to obey orders
              from your superiors. Thus some of you may feel a sudden lack of
              freedom to do what you want and you may find yourself having
              difficulties accepting authority initially.</p>
              <p>Regimentation and discipline build strong character and
              toughness, so that you’ll be tough enough to handle difficult
              combat, crime-fighting or rescue situations without giving up or
              breaking down.</p>
              <p>When you first enlist into NS, you may have concerns of being in
              a new territory, with new faces and new things to do. But don’t let
              this get to you. Just remember the saying that “when the going gets
              tough, the tough gets going”.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Following are some
              tips on what you can do to prepare yourself
              psychologically:</em></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Adopt a positive perception</li>
              <li>Build up physical stamina</li>
              <li>Develop good working attitude and habits</li>
              <li>Overcome psychological stress</li>
              <li>Adopt teamwork spirit</li>
              <li>Learn to be independent</li>
              <li>Set realistic expectations</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can also speak to your friends or family members who have
              been through NS. Ask them to share their stories. The sharing will
              help you reduce some of your fears, uncertainties and doubts.</p>
              <p><strong>During NS you’ll be living with different
              people.</strong></p>
              <p>Because these people come from different backgrounds, they may
              not think like you do or react to situations like you would.
              Instead of trying to select your type of people, you should cherish
              the diversity. This is a chance for you to learn more about your
              fellow mates and their cultures.</p>
              <p>You’ll find that you have many opportunities to absorb the
              different cultures—during training, eating, chatting or just seeing
              and listening. Take these opportunities and learn from people
              around you, you’ll have a much better appreciation of Singapore’s
              cultural diversity.</p>

              <p>The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) is a 2,000-bed acute
              tertiary psychiatric hospital situated on a 25-hectare
              campus at Buangkok Green Medical Park. Set amidst serene
              surroundings, IMH offers a comprehensive range of psychiatric,
              rehabilitative and counselling services for children, adolescents,
              adults, and the elderly.</p>
              <p>IMH’s tradition of care started in 1928. We were the first
              mental hospital in Singapore, starting with some 1,000 patients.
              Since then, many advances have been made in treatment, training,
              and research. Our treatment integrates evidence-based therapies,
              supported by the departments of clinical psychology, nursing,
              occupational therapy, and medical social work, to provide holistic
              care for our patients. IMH is equipped with modern facilities, with
              50 wards for inpatients and seven Specialist Outpatient
              Clinics.</p>
              <p>IMH was the first mental health institution in Asia to receive
              the Joint Commission International Accreditation in 2005, a highly
              coveted international accreditation for healthcare
              organisations. </p>
              <p>Over the years, IMH has gained a reputation for quality
              research. In 2008, the Ministry of Health,
              Singapore, entrusted IMH with a S$25 million research
              grant to implement translational and clinical research into the
              causes of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.</p>
              <p>IMH also plays a key role in training the next generation of
              mental health professionals in Singapore. We train psychiatrists
              and mental health professionals through the NHG-AHPL Residency
              Programme for psychiatry and through collaborations with the local
              tertiary institutions.</p>

              patients may have tried to take their own lives or showed signs of
              wanting to do so. Ms Lim also helps families cope when they have

              medical social workers, has received more than 15 awards. Last

              working in the emergency department years ago, I saw how a crisis,
              such as a life-threatening illness, a serious road traffic accident
              or an attempted suicide, can throw a family off balance.</span></p>

              that families with strong social support fare better in crises.

              physiological and emotional comfort.</span></p>

              <p><span>Officially unveiled on 11 Jun 2004, the SAF Military
              Medicine Institute (MMI) in the new DSO (Kent Ridge) Building aims
              to provide specialised health care and medical grading for
              servicemen. Billed as the Centre of Excellence in clinical military
              medicine, MMI promises professional treatment and quality service
              to sustain the fighting strength of the SAF.</span></p>
              <p>The conceptualisation of MMI started in 1995, with the Ministry
              of Health (MOH) and MINDEF seeking closer collaboration. The idea
              was to locate this facility together with a hospital to maximise
              expertise and resources.<br> <br> The SAF also recognised the need to provide secondary level medical
              care tailored to military vocation.<br> <br> "It was conceptualised this way, but obviously it couldn't start
              big at that time, so we started on a smaller scale at different
              locations," recalled Deputy Commander MMI, LTC (Dr) Fan Swee
              Weng.<br> <br> In the early days, the various clinics and services were operated
              from three different locations: Loewen Road Camp, Depot Road Camp
              and Alexandra Hospital.<br> <br> Last December, all these clinics and offices came under one roof at
              the DSO (Kent Ridge) Building - with the exception of in-patient
              care for psychiatric patients, which remains at Alexandra
              Hospital.<br> <br> "It was a great opportunity to maximise all our resources and put
              together all these capabilities to harness and maximise what each
              of these services can provide," LTC (Dr) Fan (left) enthused.<br> <br> MMI, a sub-unit of Headquarters, SAF Medical Corps (HQMC), is
              responsible for the provision of pre-deployment medical services,
              musculo skeletal injury care, psychological, trauma and stress
              support, visual care and performance enhancement, as well as
              cardio-pulmonary assessment.</p>

              <div><span>The <em>Military Medicine Institute (MMI)</em> was
              established in March 1998 to provide Specialist Medical and Dental
              services to the SAF personnel. In 1999, Medical Board Centre and
              SAF Ward came under the umbrella of MMI. In Dec 2003, Military
              Medicine Institute, together with Tanglin Physiotherapy Centre,
              relocated to DSO(Kent Ridge) Building.<br> <br> <strong>Our Vision</strong><br> To be the Centre of Excellence in Clinical Military Medicine.<br> <br> <strong>Our Mission</strong><br> To ensure efficient sustenance of SAF fighting strength through
              delivery of quality healthcare in areas of Specialist Medical and
              Dental Care, Medical Grading, and In-Patient Care.<br> <br> <strong>Our Roles</strong><br> Through the provision of specialised medical/dental services and
              in-patient care, MMI serves the SAF by optimising the treatment and
              recovery of servicemen with significant medical problems. This will
              translate to operational readiness of the SAF units as well as
              improved well-being of the individuals in the SAF.<br> <br> Timely medical grading of servicemen allows personnel to be
              deployed effectively in service while minimising impact on
              operational readiness and personal health.<br></span></div>
