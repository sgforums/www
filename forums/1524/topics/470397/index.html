               great man whose trademark appear in most of the solid high quaity 
              leaked nude photos of models here. Kudos for his great contribution for 
              making the forum alive. <br><br>Without him, all of us will not get to 
              see all the widespread juicy pictures of some models in Singapore in our
               lives. How much efforts he spent and how much money he <br><br>paid to 
              all these models to make them do all these marvellous poses, we might 
              not know, but one thing for sure, he is changing his trademark now since
               he has stopped <br><br>doing lingerie shoots (enough fun already?). <br><br>https://www.facebook.com/derrick.dpgrapher<br>http://www.modelmayhem.com/1381209 / http://www.modelmayhem.com/DPgrapher15763 <br>https://secure.flickr.com/photos/dpg...81/8609171346/</p>
              <p>14) Wonder Ming aka Lim Kah Ming<br><br>SUpposed
               to be taught by Joe Chan Guo Qiang for photography but went into bad 
              blood after spreading rumour that his "teacher" got spy cam installed in
               his home studio <br><br>during the peak period of Liu She Ying.<br><br>Got
               himself in trouble as well after exposed by Sasuke Erochi from Modxnet 
              for molesting a young model called Luna as well as beaten up incident in
               pub. Juicy <br><br>conversation is posted in Sasuke Erochi's own 
              Facebook group. Ironic part is Sasuke is the one organizing all the 
              sleazy photoshoots. So we can say that it is indeed <br><br>the pot 
              calling the kettle black. Little information is known about Sasuke 
              Erochi but one thing for sure, he is able to make models do daring 
              exposing poses. <br><br>https://www.facebook.com/wonder.ming.5<br>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Wonde...16922128463422<br>https://www.facebook.com/Modxnet<br>http://instagram.com/modxnet<br>https://www.facebook.com/groups/188295091219410/ (Sg Eventz Club)<br>https://www.facebook.com/sasuke.erochi.1<br>http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/ea...l#post74126745<br>https://www.facebook.com/LunAphroditee<br><br>15) Mike S aka Candieghost aka Tan Choon How<br><br>Mr Roy Chuang's "best friend"<br>Got famous when nude pictures of model Eileen Yap taken on St John's Island appeared as well as shaving incident for model.<br><br>www.candleghost.net/<br>www.flickr.com/photos/candleghost<br>http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/ea...r-3694721.html<br>http://www.asiaone.com/print/News/La...24-341720.html<br><br></p>
