In this society, all employer care is.. which JC you came from. Graduating from RJC will put you in good stead. Frankly, i do not think Science stream is your calling. Common, do not be decieved by your secondary teachers that the most glamarous thing is to merely get into the science stream. That is a load of bull.<br><br>Go RJC Arts.. then go take up a business admin degree. Thats the way to go. Science / Engineering degrees in SG. well not so much future in it. Life science is worse, as when you graduate, you will be made to wash test tubes all day, all night.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In reply to your questions:<br><br><blockquote>1) Does taking psychology in uni (local and overseas) require me to be in arts or science?</blockquote>It doesn't matter. Psychology is under the Faculty of Arts and Social Science.<br><br><blockquote>2) is geog like econs? </blockquote>No. Not at all.<br><br><blockquote>3) How long do i have to study for psychology?</blockquote>It depends on which university. In Singapore, it's 3 years for Bachelor without honours, 4 for honours.<br><br><blockquote>4) For arts, is it still possible to do clinical psychology</blockquote>Can't answer that, sorry. But you might want to be aware that psychology is merely a "social science" major. You are not allowed to practice "medicine" through this major and you are not allowed to give patients prescription unless you go on to a phd level (doctorate). Basically, many students who took psychology as a major and didn't further their studies after 3 or 4 years, don't find much opportunities to make use of their degree later unless they take on jobs related to social work.<br><br>Further comments:<br><br><blockquote>poly also can go uni. But at the end of the day, some degree holders can mug but cannot work, what's the point.</blockquote>Although it's true that not all graduates is as capable at her job as he/she was in school, I still feel that it isn't easy getting good grades in a country like Singapore. If he/she was able to do really well in school, it does show her ability and potential to some extent.<br><br>And believe it or not, academical theories are underrated. It is more useful in life than just helping you to achieve good grades in school.<br><br>On another hand, I also dislike it when underachievers in school make comments like work experience is a lot more important than having a good degree. Personally, I used to be below average when I was in school but I do appreciate other people's intelligence, determination and hard work. And many top scorers are not just "muggers", they actually do have the intelligence to help them achieve further in life when they come out to work.</div>
