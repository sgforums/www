              <p>I would preferably go to a JC but with these kind of results, I get only manage IJC,YJC and perhaps SRJC. However, I prefer JC as I think its a better environment as its the environment I've become accustomed to for the past 10 years. But I'm afraid I might not be able to cope in a JC.</p>
              <p>If I do go to Poly, I would do business related courses but the more prestigious courses are quite out of my reach. In addition, I'm afraid I'll lose interest midway through the course</p>
              <p>Where do you guys think I should go?</p>

              <p>Dont look down on poly route... JC route might not always be the best...</p>
              <p>I was once in your shoes... able to go JC (L1R5 of 17 pts), but in the end i decided on going to poly.My mind was set on going to JC, even after i got my o level results. I only decided to change my mind at the very last moment.</p>
              <p>And, I have never regretted going to poly. In fact poly was the best years of my life. Playing, studying having a group of fantastic friends etc. 3 years of excellent life!!!</p>
              <p>I got excellent results in poly and I am now studying in a local Uni. So, do not be afraid to consider poly. You will find that poly life is in fact a fun filled experience for you. Have a bit of discipline and you will be able to do well for you studies as well.</p>
              <p>The best part of Poly is of course you do not need to wear anymore uniforms!!!</p>

              <p>actually poly IS the BEST route ONLY IF u can get into uni... poly and jc study the same amount of yrs when gone into jc.... also poly gives u more knowledge useful when working... HOWEVER, poly need to be really the best to get into uni... jc easier... summore jc de subjects is good for our growth of brain... this can really help us in our life... i am not saying poly cannot train ur brain or wat... just that jc really help alot compared to poly subjects... <br><br>so to summarize, poly and jc both are good only if u get in uni... uni is the most impt thing, trust me.</p>

              <p>if you are afraid of losing interest in poly halfway, den may i suggest you go JC first, take the 2 years to find out what you really want, no hurry. meanwhile your 10years experience serve you well in JC (i.e. how to siam teacher when late, how to give excuse when nv hand in work, etc) =PpP</p>
              <p>if you do go poly, make sure you choose something you have definite interest in. if halfway give up den gg.</p>
