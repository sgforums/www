              <p>Eh... your chances of appealing practically ZERO...</p>
              <p>I would suggest if you are really interested in going to a poly (since you practically failed for the past 16-17 years based on your results), then please work harder and retake your O level. It would be hard since no one is tutoring you, but if you still remember what your teachers taught you and then work on from there by yourself, put in maximum effort, keep practicing and practicing, you will be able to make it. You can study in ITE and revise for your O levels simultaneously, if you put in effort.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, you can go to ITE NITEC and then work hard from there. Going to ITE does not means its the end. ITE in fact has many outstanding students and some of them are just as successful as those from poly and uni, and maybe even more successful. IF your results are good, then from ITE, you can move to Poly and then to Uni. The only turn off of this route is that you take longer than others. But it is still a route for you, and if your are determine enough, you can still succeed.</p>
              <p>Therefore, since you now probably regret on not studying for your O levels, and getting this type of shitty results, I seriously hope that you would reflect on your past actions and think about what have you achieved in life so far. Do you really think that all the playing and fooling around in the past is worth it given the situation that you are in now? If you have seriously understand, then I hope that you will buck up and start working hard now. It is never too late to start working hard. You can do it, you have to help yourself!!</p>

              <p>I also got a D7 for my english when i took my O levels for the first time.</p>
              <p>Personally i knew that i am not someone who is bad in english and i also knew that if i tried a bit harder with a different learning style i can pass it.</p>
              <p>I studied full time at home with a private tutor and with some very good assesment books. With no teacher breathing down my neck forcing me to do unnecessary homework,  i actually found myself doing better. I studied because i wanted to and not because i had to.</p>
              <p>I more that passed my english and now i have already graduated  from Ngee Ann Polytechic with a diploma in Accountancy.</p>
              <p>Your O level is one of those things that determinds your life so if you personally know you can do better that try again and get into the course you really want to go to next year.</p>
              <p>Going into ITE and studing for O level at the same time is not a good idea in my opinion. Most of my friends who did that got so tired and worn out that they end up failing O levels again</p>
              <p>Btw, i think joining a toastmasters club is an excellent way to improve your english speaking and writing. The speakers usually have excellent storys to share which you can use for your composition later. Even if you are underage you should go and just sit in every month</p>
