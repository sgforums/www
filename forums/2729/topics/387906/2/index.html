              <p>No matter course of action you decide to take (i.e. which school to go to, or retake as private candidate if you wish) I think you'd better start taking school seriously... You can say for all you want that you can live with it, you know it's your fault but you're ok with it etc., but you know one day you will not be able to stand the pain and you will have a very deep hole to dig yourself out of.</p>
              <p>I don't know how you can look at that and still say life is not over... The situation is that serious. You are looking at a lifetime of having no job/ working as a cleaner, no money, the worst living conditions in Singapore. When you meet your old friends from school in 30 years some may be top executives and earning in the hundreds of thousands per year. What will you say when they ask you what you're working as?</p>

              <p>yeah..i understand.</p>
              <p>My families want me to continue my studies instead of army, they believe that i will lose the motivation to retake Os.</p>
              <p>But the problem is i never have any motivation to study, i try to pass my exams due to my pride and face. But now i know what i want. That is to go army and either retake while training or after the army. I know my result will improve if i pay to hire tutor (u will take things seriously if u "PAY" for it)</p>

              <p>I see you dun understand how i have planned my future and simply put me to immature catagory because i love game...what if i love games and score all subject A1...will u still said i'm immature? Then what the point of listening to music? you wun gain anything. immature vary from people to people. I wun see people who choose games over studies as immature, plus i didn't gaming my entire life away. I like to read life story and learn from their experience...i love to hear life stories to understand how complicated humans are. Who doesn't know studying is important so they can be laywer or doctor...but reading self improvement books will not "improve" me to study. The fact that i study for 3 weeks is already my best...(i truly care about O level).</p>
              <p>maybe most of us will..3 WEEKS? all in my entire life studying is lesser than the 3 weeks. And i think and planned a lot to choose army over ITE.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Because i know i only nid to retake 2 or three subject out of the 2 years in army and even if i fail to retake Os or fail to pass, i can retake after i done with my army.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. advantages to retake O after army and private candidate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>.   I can use the money i earn in army for tuition (some money issue in home, and i hate to ask for money from parents.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>.   More freedom on time (family rules, etc etc )</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. And the best reason is..if i choose higher nitec, the time spend to university=7 yrs. While army will be 5 yrs or 6 yrs if i can't retake or fail o level.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. If i somehow score well for Os, i might go Jc, spend time=4 yrs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why i'm so confident about retaking in army and to score pass or better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. I score 8/100 and E8(40-44) for O even though i only study for 1 weeks for math in my entire sec life (I never do hw since sec 1, cuz the teacher also...=.=dun care).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. I got good memory. I score A2 for combined human...somehow the particular word or phrase can trigger my memory and cause me to write continously.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, i'm not boasting or arrogant (maybe a little). If u think carefully, u will see that the choice i made maybe stupid, impossible and hard. But it is the shortest and the easiest routh for now.</p>

              <p>I see you dun understand how i have planned my future and simply put me to immature catagory because i love game...what if i love games and score all subject A1...will u still said i'm immature? Then what the point of listening to music? you wun gain anything. immature vary from people to people. I wun see people who choose games over studies as immature, plus i didn't gaming my entire life away. I like to read life story and learn from their experience...i love to hear life stories to understand how complicated humans are. Who doesn't know studying is important so they can be laywer or doctor...but reading self improvement books will not "improve" me to study. The fact that i study for 3 weeks is already my best...(i truly care about O level).</p>
              <p>maybe most of us will..3 WEEKS? all in my entire life studying is lesser than the 3 weeks. And i think and planned a lot to choose army over ITE.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Because i know i only nid to retake 2 or three subject out of the 2 years in army and even if i fail to retake Os or fail to pass, i can retake after i done with my army.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. advantages to retake O after army and private candidate.</p>

              <p>O.O</p>
              <p>Seriosuly, if i'm not disciplined..then what the point of retaking as private or goint ITE.. i will most likely slack.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And is reality really harsh? i dun think so..because now i got choices...in fact there 4 choices right in front of me. And because of my happy go lucky attitude, one day i might suffer the consequences. Like i say before..it ok even if i can't retake Os or fail Os in army...because my aim is to retake Os and go poly or even JC.</p>
              <p>Army routh has more better choices and harsher consequences. If i retake as private NOW...(reasons stated before)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After amry will give me the time and money and freedom of handling time. And yes i will lose motivation (as if i have any motivation) but i will still study because i know i need to, not because i want to. After and before army will provide me better choices and thus. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I didn't see the world as beautiful but everyone seem to be trying their best to be kind and helpful. Sometime even hurtful comment are "kindness". Right now u r not satisfied with the decison i made but u still gave me advices and tell me what you believe..so is this world really so bad? </p>

              <p>Don't worry, there is no need for you to retake your "O"-lvl. Since you enter via JAE, you are quite safe as long as you don't go about failing your modules left and right.</p>
              <p>Just to let you know, for those who enter via DAE because their "O"-lvl english grade is not good enough, they will be made to go through an English proficiency course, which they have to pass for them to graduate.  </p>
              <p>Since you haven't heard anything about this course, it is likely that you do not need to go for it, so no worries.</p>
