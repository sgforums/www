              <p> </p>
              <p>2. If i decide to go army first (The letter came &gt;.&lt;) can i retake Os and do my ns altogether?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. ITE is fine but i don't want to waste another 1 or 2 yrs studying.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, don't flame me. I have already prepare for this day since i choose to study for 3 weeks out of 5 years.</p>

              <p>This was the advice I gave my niece once. Why shun ITE? This can be your options</p>
              <p>1. Go ITE and hopefully something that you wish to study</p>
              <p>2. Retake your "O" level as a pte candidate. This being so, alot will be your commitment to how much effort you are putting in.</p>
              <p>3. After the next year result, if you do well, you can get into a poly too</p>
              <p>4. If not, just continue with your ITE and you can still go poly if your ITE result is good.</p>
              <p>My niece did her ITE and retook her "O". she did better that year but was still not good enough to go to her course she desire although poly gave her another course of another subject. I told her to concentrate on her ITE instead and finally her result in ITE was good enough to gave her entry to the course she wanted. It took her 2 years more but the end result is the same.</p>
              <p>Asked yourself, are you going to put the effort for it? How commited are you?</p>

              <p>I think if you want to go poly, retake your O's. Provided you have the right mentality that you want to do well this time. No point retaking if you still don't want to study. Failure is alright, it's learning the lesson from it that is more important and assessing yourself what you really want to do and what you can do. And 1 year isn't a long time at all.</p>
              <p>I don't think you should go NS first and then do O levels again because by then when you ORD whatever energy or zest would have dried up and trust me, you probably wouldn't want to revisit stuff that you did 2-3 years ago.</p>
              <p>All the best!</p>

              <p>Hi Coldweeliang,</p>
              <p>Please kindly pardon me for saying so, but you have been relaxing a bit too much...</p>
              <p>Having goals is a good thing, but if you are not going to put in ample effort, it is unlikely that your results will improve.</p>
              <p>As for your queries, whether you will have time to study in the army or not depends a lot on your vocation and your unit. It is almost certain that you will enter a mono-intake unit unless you get selected for SCDF or SPF, thus I will say that it is unlikely that you will have enough time to study.</p>
              <p>If you are to retake your "O"-level examinations in the army, you will have to take leave/off while hoping that the examinations do not fall on dates where major exercises are being conducted which involve your unit. Whether your superior will approve your leave/off is another question too.</p>
              <p>As for the Syllabus, I do not think there will be any major changes to it. However, it is best to seek the help of a junior, and perhaps even your secondary school teachers, if possible.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>ITE has better campus facilities now. I think the government is also trying to increase the rankings in terms of education for ITE. So its not the end yet....as long as you're willing to try i don't really see how much it can affect you. Its your determination that is important, not exactly much of the school. The school's name is the prestige that's all.</p>
              <p>If you're reconsidering retaking O's, then you should put in more effort this time. Most probably you'll have to retake it as a private student or you can approach certain secondary schools who may offer to take you in for the next O's but the chances are rather low from what i know of.</p>
              <p>Whatever decision you choose just know that ultimately you have to work harder for it now. </p>

              <p>You get L1R4 27 points (before minusing out CCA) right?<br>Advise to you is to apply DAE and take the course which which are 25 and 26 pointer courses also can since you scored well for it. Apply RP thruogh DAE, you have high chance to succeed, but depends on the vacancy provided.</p>

              <p><br>Apply for DAE. High chance for you to succeed. If minusing out your CCA points, there will be many courses suitable for you. Just take Communication related or Health Science courses since you scored well for the English.</p>
              <p>But your condition is to retake the 'O' Level important subjects which you do not pass until you get a pass.</p>

              <p>the key is not just polythenic, but what you are going to read and whether it is what you really want to do. At the end of the day, you may really lose it if you become disinterest in the course you are doing.</p>
              <p>Also, remember that it may be something you are going to do for a living for the next 40 years or so. choose wisely</p>

              <p>My advices are-</p>
              <p>1. I will only retake 3 subject which is science, math and english. Is it allow to study in ns? will there be sufficient time?</p>
              <p>You are allow to study only are your free time. However, there are many distractions which exist in NS (extra training, recall,NS friends influences)</p>
              <p>2. Will there be any holiday or weekend holiday? will i be granted days for O level examination?</p>
              <p>The armed forces still follows the public holiday</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. will the sallybus remain the same? (can i apply for 2009 syallbus?)</p>
              <p>The syllabus will remain almost the same. You can check MOE websit for the 2010 syllabus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, my personal advice is that you should re-take your O levels. There are many schools which offered O levels courses which can assist you in your NS deferment</p>

              <p>Actually I'm fine with going Ite. But the thoughts of ITE&gt;POLY (adding two years in my study journey) is very "sian". Retaking and going army seem to be the only better choices for me. My plan is to go army&gt;retake 3 O subjects&gt;poly,JC&gt;uni and either work or have fun.
