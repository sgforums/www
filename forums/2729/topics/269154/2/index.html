            <div class='col-md body'>i also thought how a level life can be tougher than o level life... i was dead wrong.<br><br>time really flies in jc. reach home about 5. finish homework and all sometimes until about 10. if u wana do some revision still can do abit. add project work into the equation, you just realize that time is never enough.<br><br>while you dont have to be extremely intelligent to be in a JC, you need to be extremely hardworking. certain topics taught a few months ago can be forgotten easily if concept isnt very well grasped, almost all topics are linked for all subject, partial fractions to integration to differentiation, and differentiation links to maclaurin's series, graphs, and so on.<br><br>you cannot set your own pace, cannot catch up, you lose. that is what is happening to my h1 chem and h2 phys now. been flunking this 2 subjects quite badly.<br><br>especially project work(assume its your first year in college, where PW and MT are a must, unless u have HMT for O levels then MT can be excluded), it is very time consuming. there was a period of time i slept at 4, woke up at 6.30 and go to school everyday for 1 whole week. I consume 7 servings of coffee everyday for that week.<br><br>just recently my friend went sleepless for 1 whole day, did not sleep and report to school.<br><br>and if you do not have pure sci/amaths background, its generally not to aim for the 'better' jcs. go to the jcs where the tutors will give the students special attentions should the need arise.<br><br>i don't know about others, but don't be like me who end up choosing going to a jc because i have no idea what i want to study further.. sure regret.<br><br>i don't really see myself staying in a jc should i repeat.</div>

My CCA was computer club though. Really shiok. Every time go play online games or stuff. Sometimes learn programming.

            <div class='col-md body'>overall, i think both JC and poly are easy.<br><br>Poly only needs GPA of 2.0 and above to graduate. Anyone can do it right as long as they come to sch often. The problem for poly is not easy to get into university.<br><br>As for JC, you have to make it to uni for sure because the A level cert is useless. I have seen friends scoring C, C, C and D7 in GP and they still get in university. So it is not that hard either.<br><br>Overall, i would say poly is harder because you have to study hard to be the top 20% of the cohort so you stand a higher chance to get into uni.<br>For JC, 90% can get in so you can just enjoy life. Even if fail, repeat another year, most likely can get in uni within 3 years.</div>

Just do a good presentation at the end of the day and the grades are yours, at least this is what they say. To learn or not to learn is your business.<br><br>There are two type of assessment in RP:<br><br>1) Daily grades<br><br>2) Understanding Test(UT).<br><br>The way to calculate module grade is <span style="font-style: italic;">best 14 out of 16 daily grades</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">3 out of 4 best UT</span>.<br><br>It's the most easiest to get high GPA in RP out of the other 4 polytechnics. From what I see, most of the students are able to get GPA 3.0 and above. You can hardly see someone with less than 3.0. That's the point.<br><br>In contrast to other polytechnics, students study extremely hard in order to get good grades. There is a considerable learning there. And the exam system is there, so you can really see who's studying and who's not. However, this is very different case in RP.<br><br>The 'facilitators' assess student based on their participation, contribution, and powerpoint presentation on a daily basis. Which means to say, you might need to be a good actor in order to get good grade. One must know how to act like he/she is participating in class.<br><br>Also moderation for the Understanding Tests are unbelievable lax when in Year 1. A student can have a raw mark of 5 out of 30, and yet still score 'A' for that particular module test. I am utterly disgusted by what I've seen.<br><br>In my opinion, what you learn in RP using the Problem-Based Learning system does not reflect deep learning and memorizing. The learning is there for a short period of time, and it's gone after that. Though the saying that induced learning by asking question helps learning, but I don't see the benefits of this over long terms. Students simply abuse this to get good grades in RP.<br><br>As students advance from Year 1 to Year 2 and 3, it's harder to abuse the system as compared to when in Year 1. However the exploiting still takes place even in their Year 3.<br><br>At the end of the day, I still feel that examinations is the best way to grade students.</div>
