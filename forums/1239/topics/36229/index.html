            <div class='col-md body'>knoe some of u all out there might have read it when i post on sggirls...but would like it in my forums...<br><br>A guy and a girl can be just friends...<br>but at one point or another one of them will fall for the other, maybe temporarily, maybe at the wrong time, maybe too late or maybe,<br>just maybe...forever....<br><br>As I sat there in english class, I stared at the girl next to me.<br>She was my so called 'best friend'. I stared at her long, silky hair, and<br>wished she was mine. But she didn't notice me like that, and I knew<br>it.<br>After class, she walked up to me and asked me for the notes she had missed the day before.<br>I handed them to her. She said thanks' and gave me a<br>kiss on the cheek.<br>I want to tell her, I want her to know that I dont want to be<br>just friends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and I dont know why.<br><br>11th grade<br><br>The phone rang. On the other end, it was her. She was in tears,<br>mumbling on and on about how her love had broke her heart.<br>She asked me to come over because she didn't want to be alone,<br>so I did. As I sat next to her on the sofa,<br>I stared at her soft eyes, wishing she was mine.<br>After 2 hours, one Drew Barrymore movie, and three bags of chips, she decided to go to sleep. She looked at me, said 'thanks'.<br>I love her but I'm just too shy, and I dont know why.<br><br>Senior year<br>The day before prom she walked to my locker. "My date is sick"<br>she said, he's not gonna go" well, I didn't have a date, and in 7th grade, we made a promise that if neither of us had dates,<br>we would go together- just as 'best friends'.<br>So we did.<br>Prom night, after everything was over,<br>I was standing at her front door step. I stared at her as she smiled at me and stared at me with her crystal eyes.<br>Then she said- "I had the best time, thanks!" and gave me a kiss on the cheek.<br>I want to tell her, I want her to know that I dont want to be just friends but I'm just too shy.<br><br>A day passed, then a week, then a month. Before I could blink, it<br>was graduation day. I watched as her perfect body floated like an<br>angle up on stage to get her diploma. Before everyone went home, she came to<br>me in her smock and hat, and cried as i hugged her. Then she lifted her head from my shoulder and said-'you're my best friend, thanks'<br>and gave me a kiss on the cheek.<br><br>Now I sit in the pews of the church. That girl is getting<br>married. That girl is getting married now. I watched her say 'i do' and drive<br>off to her new life, married to another man. I wanted her to be mine,<br>but she didn't see me like that, and I knew it. But before she drove<br>away, she came to me and said 'you came!'. She said 'thanks' and kissed me on the cheek.<br><br>Years passed, I looked down at the coffin of a girl who used to<br>be my 'best friend'. At the service, they read diary entry she had<br>wrote in her high school years. This is what it read: I stare at him wishing<br>he was mine; but he doesn't notice me like that, and I know it. I want to tell him,<br>I want him to know that I don't want to be just friends, I<br>love him but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why. I wish he would tell me he loved me! 'I wish I did too...'<br>I thought to my self, and i cried.<br><br></div>
