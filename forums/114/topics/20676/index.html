I got your email when I went thru your website and it was a great website with Lots of wonderful information.<br><br>My name is Chester Teo Tai Ting, and I am a part time trainer with CAL Computer Training Centre for the period of March 01 to March 02.<br><br>I would like to commend on the Excellency of Informatics Internal procedures / processes.<br><br>Firstly, the contract agreement system that your company had incorporate, it states that we will be paid at the end of the month if the class ends before the 15th of the month, if not it will be the following month. It has let me take time off to visit your centre time every month end just to expect the collection of my pay. This routine of visiting your centre has has certainly given me the chance to get to know the centre surrounding as well as getting acquainted with your staff. The term "To be a global leader in quality lifelong learning services" finally makes more sense to me now. Learning thru experience.<br><br>Secondly, it had even provided me with a good excuse to slim down by not being able to bank in my pay despite consistently trusting your management about my pay months after months. This show that you really STRETCHED your GOALS, Â“We set Stretched Goals to Exploit every market opportunity to maximize the shareholdersÂ’ returnÂ”<br><br>Thirdly, it provides me a chance to save money by delaying my pay months after months. It had also given me the chance to dream what am I going to do with the savings that you all had helped me saved. Informing me that a new Director (High Position) is in and will definitely help us (The Trainers) solve the matter fast. Her swift action finally is seen by after 2 month plus of waiting. I received a call from the HR to say that my full pay is ready for collection. And of cos this shows us one of your core value, SPEED, "We manifest Speed in every one of our actions, making it our competitive advantage."<br><br>Next, it strengthens my heart and the dare to fail strength in me by shattering my dreams. When I went to the main office expecting a Full payment, it ended up paying me only around 70% of my total pay.<br>Last but not least, I would also like to feedback that you had really achieved your Mission Statement Â“By exceeding customers' expectations, the Informatics Group will become a global leader in providing quality learning servicesÂ”<br><br>You really exceeded my expectation as a internal customer, especially when there is a changed in management, none of them had called since then (Especially the New Director) to update me the status or apologizing for the delay or whatsoever. I can still hear from one the previous manager, asking about the status of my pay even after his departure from the company, he even offered to help me find out the status. After that the junior staff (Would not want to state their name) would call and apologized for the delay and you can see and hear from them that they are doing their best.<br><br>Today marks the coming of 3rd months after my last class that will shortly be the 4th, I do have a small request that you would feedback to me when is the final date of payment which I am still anticipating, as it is within your company policy to pay me at the month end if my class ends before the 15th of the month, if not it will be paid the next month end.<br>Thank you for your time in reading my long mail and you can be sure that I will do my utmost best to tell my friends about the wonderful procedures / processes of my payment.<br></div>
