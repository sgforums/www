            <div class='col-md body'>There is something i noticed. Some players, really good players tend to perform exceptionally well and just suffer a down form the following season. Example Yoann Gourcuff. Bought him on my first season, his form was nothing short of special. Second season, sold Walcott bought Podolski, his form fell tremendously although i did not change my tactics. I think that it's because he cannot work well with Podolski, i kept him for a season, now third season, his form still suck. I plan to sell him off as many top clubs are chasing his signature thus i accepted all offers during transfer window, but! The most frustrating thing is that every time i accepted an offer from another club, he rejected that club's contract and say he wanted to stay.
