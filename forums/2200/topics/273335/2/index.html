            <div class='col-md body'>fast tempo goes with short passing... just imagine it in your mind lah<br>according to FMwiki the stats of players required for fast tempo short passing game are the most demanding because it gives your team the best chances!<br><br>conversely long passing is for noob players who cant even string together 5 passes.<br><br>but hey, dont quote me on anything.<br><br>Btw I'm really suffering from the "second season slump" syndrome, except that I'm in the 5th season. The AI of the domestic teams have completely broken all my favourite tactics and I can't think of any good ones. As a result I am struggling to even beat lousy teams, it makes me sick! I hope this "autobalancing" features get worked on in fm2008  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> the game engine is making me crazzzeee</div>

What I have gathered from online sources is that the game pre-assigns every team a score out of 100. Teams with a higher score than you will play lousier against you and vice-versa. Every season that score is updated. also the AI always finds ways to break your formation. Why would I say so? In my 5th season at Barcelona, every team would use the same formation(4 2 3 1) against me but switch back to their normal tactics when playing against each other.<br><br>I would like to say that I'm no pro however, so that might have caused my teams to lose also <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
