I sold one of my DL regen to wigan who later went to chelsea to become a wonderkid for a mere.. 1.2m.. WTF?!!??!<br><br>Anyone care to share their wonderkids stories? I have more potential kids in my reserves and under 18s but i'll see what they turn out to be. btw im at my 5th season in 7.0.2</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my wonderkids who excelled and either went straight into my first team or on the verge of breaking in were:<br><br>Sherman Cardenas (was already my regular first team starter during the 07-08 season)<br><br>Nicolas Millan (he's 19, got english citizenship and i'm still loaning him out to gain more first team exp.)<br><br>Okaka (loan him out for four seasons, came back and developed into a wonderful player - first team starter paired with rooney as first-choice strike-pair)<br><br>Micah Richards (first-team regular after i sold Gary Neville)<br><br>Vanden Borre (first team player, backup to micah richards)<br><br>Bojan (on the verge of breaking into the 1st team)<br><br>Vela (still out on loan, unhappy as i couldn't give him any first team action)<br><br>Pique (first choice defender always after 4 seasons out on loan which includes Barcelona where he really blossomed, wanted to leave when Barca bid for him but i rejected outright and guaranteed him a 1st-team place)<br><br>Nuri Sahin (loaned him out for 3 seasons which includes Barca after i bought him for 17m [now value's worth 25m] from Bayer Leverkusen, excellent playmaker. first-team player who replaced Carrick and now Carrick's playing backup to Sahin)<br><br>Magnus Wolff Eikrem (on the verge of breaking into the first team squad once i sell Carrick, would be playing backup to Sahin; future Scholes)<br><br>Corrie Evans once broke into my first team squad when i needed a playmaker as Carrick and Wolff Eikrem was injured wtih Sahin out on loan (decided not to recall him). But he didn't reach my expectations so i sold him to promoted Preston for 6m.<br><br>Ritchie Jones (may break into my squad, has got the potential)<br><br>David Jones  (played a couple of games before i sold him)<br><br>To be honest, I can't find any really extremely promising hot prospects that are academy players who are able to break into my first team squad, much less a first-xi starter. They do not possess enough quality. The most they can be is a backup squad player.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
