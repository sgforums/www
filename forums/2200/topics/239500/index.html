            <div class='col-md body'>after having bought Bale and Foti regardless of my scout's report, that they would not be a worthwhile signing, Bale and Foti actually flourished and Foti scored 24 goals in 32 games and Bale's match rating is 8 or above for most of the time.

            <div class='col-md body'>Gareth Bale is actually not bad, just that he won't be a world-class player and have spectacular performances.<br><br>Scouts' results are generally useful but it's rather hard for them to really pick out the true potential world-class players and inform you about it.<br><br>Just like real life, scouts can be right and can be wrong. If you want the truth about the players you are interested in, download something call FM Genie Scout. It tells you exactly how good a player is, based on the data in the game, so that is 100% correct.<br><br>But of course, if you think that's cheating then dun use it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes it depends on how good your scouts are. If they're good in judging potential ability, ability etc etc, then I believe their reports should be accurate.<br><br>Then agian, I never rely too much on my scouts; I always keep an eye on the player myself for a few months or a number of games that he has played and judge for myself whether he is worth it or not. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>whenever you get scouts make sure they at least habve a 16-17 judging potential ability and current ability.... send your scouts out.. if one of them finds a six or seven star player, send another scout to monitor the player. if both the reports are good, then what they've reported to you is normally correct..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think if you got yourself an excellent scout (18-20 in their judging attributes), they are pretty accurate. however i find that the accuracy is max at 75%. regarding their report, theres a need to also read thoroughly, for example who are they comparing with in your squad. sometimes the position compared is not what you are looking for (when you are looking for a DC, the scout compares it with the best SW you have in the squad) thus the ratings will be misleading.<br><br>another thing i wonder is what is the maximum rating (stars). for me i got a max of 7 stars, the scout considered the player a purchase whatever the price is.<br><br>any higher?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As much as the scout report card comes quickly by the next turn, send out your scouts to see the player for say 1 or 2 matches instead. If u are unsure still, send another scout to see the player's matches.<br><br>Take note also what scouting knowledge the scout is strong at. The higher the scout's knowledge is at his best country, the better reports there is.<br><br>Sometimes, a player is probably gng thru a lean spell, just recovered from injuries and such... so his ratings may not be favourable.
