It's a huge loss for this football club.<br><br>'Ray had the world at his feet and he will be sorely missed by everyone connected to Queens Park Rangers.<br><br>'Our thoughts at this time are with his family and friends and we will be doing everything we can to help them through this terrible time.'<br><br>As a result of the tragedy, Rangers' Coca-Cola Championship match at Burnley today has been postponed.<br><br>Police have confirmed Jones was one of five occupants of a black Volkswagen Golf which collided with a double-decker bus at approximately 12.20am in High Street, East Ham.<br><br>Jones and a fellow occupant were pronounced dead at the scene, while a third victim died after being taken to hospital.<br><br>The two remaining occupants were also taken to hospital, where one is in a serious condition and the other is described as walking wounded.<br><br>Police, who have appealed for any witnesses to the accident, are awaiting details on whether anyone on the bus was injured.<br><br>Jones joined QPR aged 15 and, after making his professional debut against Watford in April 2006, he went on to make 35 appearances in all competitions last term - scoring six goals.<br><br>He signed a three-and-a-half year deal in January, ending speculation about his future, while Rangers also rejected a Â£200,000 bid from Colchester at the end of last season.<br><br>Jones had yet to feature this term because of a foot injury and had not been due to play this afternoon.<br><br>Despite today's postponement, the Clarets will hold an open training session at Turf Moor at 3pm as a mark of respect to Jones.<br><br>The session will be free to all supporters, but there will be collection points inside the ground for fans to make a donation to a nominated charity of QPR's choice.<br><br>Burnley said in a statement: 'Deepest sympathies goes out to both the player's family and the club from everyone at Burnley Football Club.'<br><br>The Football League, who agreed today's postponement, also expressed their condolences.<br><br>Head of communications John Nagle said: 'This is tragic news. Ray Jones was just at the start of his playing career but he had already shown tremendous potential.<br><br>'The thoughts of everyone at the Football League and its member clubs are with Ray's family and friends, as well as all his colleagues at QPR.'<br><br>Jones' death is the second tragedy to hit QPR recently.<br><br>Last year saw youth team player Kiyan Prince stabbed to death outside his school at the age of 15.</blockquote><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=456611&amp;cc=4716" rel="nofollow">http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=456611&amp;cc=4716</a><br><br>Considering how I once wanted to buy him in FM07, he's worth a mention.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Let us mourn the loss of a talent.</div>
