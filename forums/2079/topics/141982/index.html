            <div class='col-md body'>Charlton Athletic manager Alan Curbishley is poised to sign Gonzalo Sorondo after the defender was granted a work permit at a London tribunal.<br>The Addicks are set to land the 25-year-old Uruguay centre-back on a one-year loan deal from Inter Milan, with an option to sign him on a permanent basis once the year is up.<br><br>Stipulations rule that Sorondo had to be out of the country at the time of the hearing but the player is due to sign and link up with his new team-mates when he returns to England later this week.<br><br>Sorondo made 20 appearances for Crystal Palace last season, including an outing against Charlton in the EaglesÂ’ 2-1 Carling Cup victory at The Valley in October.<br><br>Addicks boss Alan Curbishley told his clubÂ’s official website www.cafc.co.uk: Â“IÂ’m delighted we look set to secure the services of Gonzalo.<br><br>Â“He showed while playing for Palace last year that he is well equipped to perform in the Premiership and now he has the opportunity to play in it again with us.<br><br>Â“We have signed him on a one-year loan from Inter and as he is already acclimatised to the Premiership through his time at Palace last year, we are looking forward to him joining up with the squad.Â”<br><br>Sorondo missed the last game of the Barclays Premiership season between the south London rivals - a 2-2 draw - due to suspension, which will also see him miss the opening three first-team games of 2005/06.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Former England defender Chris Powell has spoken of his surprise after completing a shock return to Charlton Athletic from West Ham United on Monday.<br>Powell has signed a one-year deal with the Addicks, the club he left for Upton Park in September last year when boss Alan Curbishley could no longer guarantee him first-team football.<br><br>The 35-year-old - who won five England caps - made 44 appearances for West Ham last season, helping them reclaim a place in the Barclays Premiership with victory in the play-offs.<br><br>He had expected to finish his career with the Hammers but their decision to offer him reduced terms prompted his exit - just six days after former understudy Paul Konchesky moved in the opposite direction.<br><br>Powell said: Â“IÂ’m delighted the opportunity arose for me to return to Charlton but itÂ’s a very weird one to be truthful.<br><br>Â“I was trying to negotiate a deal but was actually offered less than the previous year and I didnÂ’t feel that was right after the season IÂ’d had.<br><br>Â“I feel I played a significant part in helping West Ham win promotion but things didnÂ’t work out and I became a free agent.<br><br>Â“It feels very strange pulling the Charlton training kit on again. A lot of people thought I was just on loan at West Ham but I was a West Ham player and looking forward to building on what we achieved last season.<br><br>Â“I know I couldnÂ’t have left on a better note but I didnÂ’t think that the play-off final would be my last for West Ham.Â”<br><br>FansÂ’ favourite Powell has discussed a move into coaching with Curbishley who has offered the veteran left-back an opportunity to realise his backroom ambitions.<br><br>Powell said: Â“First and foremost IÂ’m here as a player, but IÂ’m looking to the future now as well and coaching is something IÂ’m interested in. Alan has mentioned getting the coaching going and IÂ’m keen to develop it.Â”<br><br>Curbishley was quick to welcome back the Â£825,000 signing from Derby and believes his presence will prove invaluable to younger players at the club.<br><br>He said: Â“WeÂ’re delighted to have Chris back with us. I only let him go in the first place so he could get some first-team football.<br><br>Â“He comes back to compete for the left back position and it will be great for everyone - especially the younger lads - to have Chris around the place and in the dressing room because he has a wealth of experience.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Full-back Jonathan Spector has joined Charlton Athletic on a season-long loan from Manchester United.<br>The young American made eight first-team appearances for the Red Devils last season including his first Barclays Premiership start against Blackburn Rovers in August.<br><br>However, the arrival of Gabriel Heinze from Paris St Germain halted the progress of the 20-year-old former Chicago Sockers defender and, with John OÂ’Shea, Phil Neville and Quinton Fortune also able to play on the left side, Sir Alex Ferguson has allowed Spector to spend next year at The Valley to further his development.<br><br>"He's a defender who can play anywhere across the back four," Addicks boss Alan Curbishley told official club website www.cafc.co.uk.<br><br>"He made his debut for Manchester United at left-back, and like a lot of defenders sees himself as centre-back. He can play right-back as well.<br><br>"That's what I like about him, his versatility. He's very quick, is two-footed and can pass the ball very well. He gets tight to forwards and is a very good athlete."<br><br>Curbishley added: "He's a bit like Kieran Richardson in the sense he has limited opportunities; he's had a few games but was finding it hard to break in.<br><br>"I think we beat off some competition in the end - there's a few clubs that would have liked him. He's come in here desperate to get in the first team to show everybody what he can do."<br><br></div>
