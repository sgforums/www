            <div class='col-md body'><strong>REDKNAPP COMPLETES PORTSMOUTH RETURN</strong><br><br>Harry Redknapp has become Portsmouth manager for the second time, signing a contract until the end of the season in a bid to save Pompey from relegation from the Barclays Premiership.<br><br>Redknapp praised Portsmouth chairman Milan Mandaric for giving him a second chance to manage the club - a year and 13 days after a major row between the two forced him out of Fratton Park.<br><br>Mandaric said Redknapp's brother-in-law, Frank Lampard senior, had played a major role in getting them together again and making Redknapp's mind up to leave Southampton.<br><br>Mandaric said: Â“As soon as I knew Harry was interested in coming back there was only one person I wanted and now I have got him.<br><br>Â“We had our disagreements but we are above and beyond that now and are looking at the bigger picture.<br><br>"We have a huge, huge challenge on our hands. 10 points from 15 games says it all.Â”<br><br>Redknapp took Portsmouth to promotion in his first season in charge and then kept the club in the top flight before leaving when Velimir Zajec was brought in above him as director of football.<br><br>Redknapp said: Â“Milan has taken a big gamble in getting me back and the fact he wanted me was the key to the whole thing.<br><br>Â“It was a massive mistake leaving Portsmouth and I am looking forward to starting again. All that matters is staying in the Premiership.<br><br>Â“I had the best couple of years of my football life here and there was not a day when I did not regret leaving.<br><br>Â“No disrespect to Southampton, their fans were great but I never felt wanted. There were always things going on behind the scenes and I was not comfortable.<br><br>Â“I had no problem with Sir Clive Woodward. There were other problems.Â”<br><br>Redknapp has signed a contract until the end of the season and will review his position when Pompey's fate is known.<br><br>He continued: Â“I would love to be here for three or four years but who knows in football. The first job is to stay up.Â”<br><br>Lampard, father of the Chelsea and England midfielder, first alerted Redknapp to Pompey's possible interest in taking him back when he went to watch his son at Fratton Park.<br><br>The 58-year-old continued: Â“I told Frank I did not think it was on but it went from there.<br><br>Â“I hope we can turn things around and keep the club in the Premiership. We have to make teams fear coming here as they used to do.<br><br>Â“It was not a money situation. I wanted to come back and sign a blank contract.<br><br>Â“When Milan came in for me I could not say no. He has shown fantastic courage.Â”<br><br>Redknapp leads Portsmouth at Tottenham on Monday and the new manager added: Â“Half a team that was here when I was in charge have gone so I have a lot to learn in a short time.<br><br>Â“It's going to be a huge job.Â” - premierleague.com<br></div>
