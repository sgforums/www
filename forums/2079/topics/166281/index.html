            <div class='col-md body'><strong>JEWELL 'SURPRISED' AT MAGPIES LINK</strong><br><br>Wigan Athletic manager Paul Jewell has laughed off speculation linking him with the vacant job at Newcastle United.<br><br>Jewell is preparing his side for Sunday's Carling Cup final against Manchester United at the Millennium Stadium.<br><br>The Magpies are currently managerless following the sacking of Graeme Souness, although under caretaker Glenn Roeder have won three and drawn one of their four matches.<br><br>"I'm surprised, but I've a job to do at Wigan. I enjoy my job here," Jewell told Radio Five Live from his hotel base near Cardiff.<br><br>"There are all sorts of rumours flying around linking different people, but I tend to take no notice of rumours because that's all they are."<br><br>There are suggestions Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd held tentative talks with Wigan supremo Dave Whelan while playing golf in Barbados this week.<br><br>"I spoke to my chairman two days ago, and he is in Barbados, but he never mentioned playing golf with anyone from Newcastle," said Jewell.<br><br>Whelan has previously made it clear he would only allow Jewell to leave if one of the 'big three' clubs came calling - Manchester United, Arsenal or Liverpool.<br><br>Jewell, who concedes to 'over-achieving' this season with Wigan, is ambitious.<br><br>"I have said I would like to be the manager of a team that is challenging for the top honours," added Jewell.<br><br>"Yet here I am at Wigan playing for one of the big three trophies in English football.<br><br>"Of course, you want to achieve what you can in football and if you said I could achieve what Alex Ferguson has achieved, that would be fantastic."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ROONEY CELEBRATES CUP WIN</strong><br><br>Wayne Rooney reflected on 'the best feeling ever' after his own sensational performance delivered the Carling Cup to Manchester United.<br><br>The England striker scored twice as United romped to a 4-0 win over Wigan Athletic at the Millennium Stadium.<br><br>Just as he did in the FA Cup final last season, Rooney collected man-of-the-match honours, but this time he was able to leave Cardiff with a winnersÂ’ medal - and he is hoping the collection might expand even further before the season is done.<br><br>Â“I am absolutely delighted,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“To win any trophy gives you a big buzz and this is the best feeling I have ever had.<br><br>Â“It is so long since I won anything, you can probably understand why I feel the way I do. Hopefully it will be two medals this season because we are going to the World Cup with England looking to win it.Â”<br><br>United boss Sir Alex Ferguson promised to present Alan Smith with a winnersÂ’ medal after his players lifted the seasonÂ’s first trophy in t-shirts bearing the slogan Â“For You SmudgeÂ”.<br><br>Smith was forced to watch the game at home on television after an operation to repair his badly broken leg last week.<br><br>Ferguson said: Â“It was the playersÂ’ idea to wear the t-shirts. The message was appropriate. He deserved that. He had a bad injury just a week before the final.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t know how many medals we get but, if we need to apply for another one for him, we will.<br><br>Â“He showed unbelievable courage last week. He took courage to a whole new level as far as IÂ’m concerned and thatÂ’s what convinces me he will be okay.Â”<br><br>Smith broke his leg against Liverpool, eight days before the final, and Ferguson had to ask Ryan Giggs and John OÂ’Shea to play in central midfield against Wigan.<br><br>Ferguson said: Â“Wayne Rooney got man of the match but Ryan Giggs was absolutely fantastic. It was a mature and controlled performance.<br><br>Â“We needed the experience Ryan can give. No player has gone up and down that line in the Premier League like Ryan has. HeÂ’s done it for 13 years. No player is anywhere near that.Â”<br><br>Rooney scored twice and Louis Saha and Cristiano Ronaldo were also on target for United, who left top scorer Ruud van Nistelrooy on the bench.<br><br>Ferguson said: Â“I explained to Ruud that Louis Saha deserved his chance in the final. Ruud really only came into the competition in the second leg of the semi-final.<br><br>Â“I preferred to play with two up and preferred to have Rooney as the one who drops in behind.<br><br>Â“Van Nistelrooy is the top scorer in the league but itÂ’s been Louis Saha in the League Cup. ThatÂ’s six goals. ThatÂ’s some record.<br><br>Â“Ruud seemed fine in the dressing room. He had no problems with that.Â”<br><br>Wigan boss Paul Jewell insisted his side's adventure will continue after his side were swept away at the Millennium Stadium.<br><br>Â“WeÂ’ve come a long way but weÂ’re fed-up of losing 4-0 to Manchester United," Jewell said.<br><br>Â“The players gave everything they had. It wasnÂ’t enough. First half we did okay, but we were up against a better team than us. They are one of the best teams in Europe. We had to play to our optimum, and they had to have a bad day.<br><br>Â“I canÂ’t be critical of my players. IÂ’m disappointed but IÂ’m proud of my team and my staff and the supporters.<br><br>"It has been one wonderful adventure, and we want to continue improving and getting as many points as we can.<br><br>Â“I hate losing. But in the grand scheme of things Wigan Athletic this season have won - whatever they do.Â”<br><br></div>
