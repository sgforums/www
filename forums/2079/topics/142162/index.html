            <div class='col-md body'>Bolton will start the new season with some silverware on the sideboard after El-Hadji Diouf's penalty 12 minutes from time gave Sam Allardyce's side victory over Thailand in the final of the FA Premier League Asia Trophy in Bangkok.<br>Despite being outplayed for much of the match by an impressive and energetic Thai side which had the majority of the goalscoring opportunities, it was the UEFA Cup qualifiers who emerged victorious from the four-team tournament.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s the first trophy in 50 years, never mind this season,Â” said Allardyce after Bolton picked up the silver salver on offer.<br><br>Â“We are very happy to have completed a very competitive tournament.<br><br>Â“The Asia Cup has been, in our eyes, very successful for more than one reason. For obviously the football, but also for the hospitality and also for taking the trip down to Phuket.<br><br>Â“Myself and some of the players to see some of the people down there and how they are striving to get back on their feet [after the tsunami].<br><br>Â“WeÂ’ve had no injuries as well. The lads have looked after themselves and been fantastically behaved.<br><br>Â“We have really enjoyed the football and we have really enjoyed winning.Â”<br><br>Bolton were awarded the spot-kick after Henrik PedersenÂ’s long throw bounced up onto defender Keatprawut SaiwaewÂ’s arm.<br><br>Diouf stroked the ball home to give Bolton the win against a Thai side that had dominated but were unable to find a way past WanderersÂ’ keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen.<br><br>BOLTON TRIUMPH IN ASIA TROPHY<br><br>Â“I think today the Thai side were fairly sharp and technically very good and caused us quite a few problems and we had to cope with that for quite a while,Â” added Allardyce.<br><br>Â“But as the second half came to fruition, after five or 10 minutes we started to take real control of the game and our superior fitness in the end came through.<br><br>Â“Then we restored our ability to create lots of chances to finish them off before we got the penalty. It wasnÂ’t to be, but we got the penalty and DioufÂ’s tucked it away.Â”<br><br>Despite the defeat in front of the home fans, Thailand coach Chanvit Polchivin was satisfied with his young teamÂ’s performance.<br><br>Â“We cannot compare because Bolton are professionals and we are at a low level, like a youth team, but my players still played very well and weÂ’re happy,Â” said Chanvit, Asian coach of the year in 1994.<br><br>Â“We had problems in both games against Everton and Bolton with the high ball and Asian players canÂ’t play like this.Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ALLARDYCE: SUCCESS IS A HAZARD FOR BOLTON</strong><br>August 30, 2005<br><br>SAM Allardyce is worried Bolton's success last season could prove to be their undoing this term.<br><br>Bolton claimed a Uefa Cup spot after finishing sixth in the Premiership last season and yesterday's 2-1 win at West Ham - their second in four days - took them to third in the table after four matches.<br><br>Bolton also have a Uefa Cup tie against Lokomotiv Plovdiv to look forward to on 29 Sept, but Allardyce is concerned the number of fixtures may weaken his team.<br><br>He said: 'The players gave a magnificent effort for the team yesterday - but it was a concern seeing how tired they were after the game.<br><br>'They were tired because of the energy they had used in the 2-0 win over Newcastle last Wednesday.<br><br>'We're going to have to face that situation week in and week out if we get into the group stages of the Uefa Cup.<br><br>'I'm worried that we'll come across a better side than West Ham on a Sunday after we've played on a Thursday and lose the game because of fatigue.'<br><br>Goals from Kevin Nolan and substitute Ivan Campo gave Bolton the win against a West Ham team that created plenty in attack but were let down by wasteful finishing.<br><br>Teddy Sheringham scored a late penalty for Alan Pardew's West Ham team, but it was not enough to prevent the east Londoners slipping to their first defeat of the campaign.<br><br>Allardyce is confident though, that West Ham can avoid relegation in their first season back in the Premiership after a two-year absence.<br><br>He said: 'I see enough in West Ham to stay up this year, and to be comfortably clear of the bottom three. Even though they will be disappointed with yesterday's result, a win and a draw from their first two games is a great beginning.'<br><br>Pardew, meanwhile, remains keen to improve his squad. His main summer signings - goalkeeper Roy Carroll, defenders Danny Gabbidon and Paul Konchesky and winger Yossi Benayoun - all impressed in patches.<br><br>But the lack of a top-class striker was painfully evident.<br><br>Pardew said: 'It would be nice to add another player to this squad - even though we look competitive now.' - PA Sport.<br><br></div>
