'I can only repeat what has been said on several occasions, and that is that JJ is not for sale.<br><br>'He is a very important member of our squad and we see his future as being with Newcastle United at St James' Park.'<br><br>Jenas arrived on Tyneside as one of the English game's most promising talents, and he fulfilled that expectation to such an extent that he has become a regular in Sven-Goran Eriksson's England squad.<br><br>However, there are those who believe his development has slowed under Souness, and the addition of Scott Parker and Emre - the Scot confirmed today that the 24-year-old has completed his move from Inter Milan - will increase competition for places further.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Hands off Anelka</strong><br>July 21, 2005<br><br>FENERBAHCE have issued a strong 'hands-off' warning to Newcastle, who are lining up a multi-million pound swoop for Nicolas Anelka.<br><br>Anelka only joined the Turkish side on the final day of the January transfer window, with Fenerbahce paying Manchester City 7 million for his services.<br><br>But Magpies manager Graeme Souness is understood to be chasing the former French international striker as he looks to strengthen his frontline options with the start of the new season less than four weeks away.<br><br>He could be the right man to partner skipper Alan Shearer in his final season.<br><br>Souness needs a new striker to replace Craig Bellamy and Patrick Kluivert, who have left for Blackburn and Valencia respectively during the pre-season.<br><br>GOOD TERMS<br><br>Anelka had spells with Arsenal, City and Liverpool in the Premiership, and has also played abroad for Real Madrid and Paris St Germain.<br><br>But he has rarely left a club on good terms.<br><br>It appears to be a different scenario in Turkey.<br><br>Fenerbahce vice-president Nihat Ozdemir has told Newcastle they would be wasting their time making an offer.<br><br>'No offer has been made to the player or ourselves,' said Ozdemir.<br><br>'We didn't buy him to sell him.<br><br>'We're going to reach many big successes in Europe with Anelka.<br><br>'We constantly aim to improve our squad and we won't sell Anelka.<br><br>'Whatever the offer, we won't let him go.'<br>- PA Sport.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fulham have rejected Newcastle's undisclosed bid for Luis Boa Morte.<br><br>The north-east club, who are stepping up their search for strikers following the departure of Craig Bellamy and Patrick Kluivert, have also made an offer to Turkish club Fenerbahce for former Manchester City frontman Nicolas Anelka.<br><br>Magpies chairman Freddy Shepherd told the club's website: 'We have made an offer to Fulham for Luis Boa Morte, and we've also tabled a bid with Fenerbahce for Nicolas Anelka.'<br><br>However, a spokesman for Fulham confirmed the bid for Boa Morte had been unsuccessful.<br><br>Manager Graeme Souness has switched attention to strengthening his striking options after landing midfield targets Scott Parker and Emre.<br><br>Meanwhile Hugo Viana looks to be joining the exodus from St James' Park.<br><br>Viana is training with the Magpies having returned from a season-long loan deal with Sporting Lisbon but will not figure in Saturday's Intertoto Cup game with FK ZTS Dubnica following talks with Souness.<br><br>Last week Fulham boss Chris Coleman demanded 'a hell of a lot of money' to part with the Portuguese striker.<br><br>Boa Morte is rated highly by Newcastle boss Graeme Souness who is eager to bolster his strikeforce before the new season begins.<br><br>But Fulham were quick to react and dismissed the offer for Boa Morte, who cost Â£1.7million when he joined from Southampton four years ago.<br><br>A brief statement confirmed: 'Fulham Football Club can confirm that an official bid for Portugal international midfielder Luis Boa Morte has been received from Newcastle United FC. The bid has been rejected.'<br><br>Coleman's stance last weekend was blunt and an apparent attempt to dissuade Newcastle from making an approach.<br><br>'If Luis wants to join Newcastle and Newcastle want to buy Luis Boa Morte then they are going to have to pay a hell of a lot of money for him,' he said.<br><br>'And if they don't pay a lot of money for him then he will be playing for us, it's as simple as that.<br><br>'If they pay the money - and it will be a lot of money because I don't know if there is another Luis Boa Morte - then fine.<br><br>'If not, he's staying. If people think it is little Fulham, the nice little club down by the river and that they can pick their best players without paying what they are worth then they are wrong.<br><br>'I'm sick of all the talk in all honesty, that Newcastle are bidding Â£3million. You won't even get his boots for that.<br><br>'We can't let clubs keep coming in and nicking our best players because if we let him go for Â£3million that's what it would be.<br><br>'They need to put their money on the table. Otherwise they have got to shut up and let us get on with the season.'<br><br>Speaking on Saturday, Coleman also set Newcastle a seven-day deadline to complete the deal and allow Fulham to address the challenge of finding a replacement.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Newcastle in middle of takeover drama</strong><br>A 'Malaysian connection' among three parties set to make bid for club<br><br>July 27, 2005<br>The Straits Times<br><br>LONDON - NEWCASTLE United could become the subject of a fierce takeover battle after a Â£20 million (S$58 million) bid was lodged for club president John Hall's stake on Monday night.<br><br>Hall owns 28.5 per cent of the club's shares, and has yet to confirm whether he will sell his stake.<br><br>But, if the mystery buyers succeed, they will be close to the 30 per cent stake that automatically requires a full-scale takeover.<br><br>That would throw the club into a period of uncertainty behind the scenes, from chairman Freddy Shepherd to manager Graeme Souness who, even before this, was named by bookmakers William Hill as the favourite to become the first to be sacked next season.<br><br>Speculation as to the identity of the buyer ranges from a 'cash-rich British entrepreneur' who wants former manager Kevin Keegan back at the club, to a consortium involving Ray Ranson - the former Newcastle player who played under Keegan - to a 'Malaysian connection'.<br><br>The existence of a potential buyer was revealed on Monday in a statement to the stock market by Hall, after an 18 per cent rise in the club's share price, taking it to its highest level for more than four years.<br><br>The club are now valued at Â£75.6 million. This is up from Â£65 million but still below the Â£193 million when they were floated on the stock market in April 1997, reported The Independent.<br><br>Newcastle are Europe's 11th biggest club in revenue terms, according to Deloitte &amp; Touche, with sales of 137 million euros (S$274 million) in 2003-04.<br><br>The British entrepreneur is rumoured to be Graham Wylie, whose wealth from software and horse racing is estimated at Â£180 million. He is said to be the 20th richest man in the country.<br><br>He allegedly has had a bid for the Hall family's shares in the club rejected on a previous occasion. The Malaysians, it is said, wish to develop existing plans for a casino and leisure complex at St James' Park.<br><br>Any takeover deal will probably need the blessing of Freddy Shepherd, the chairman, who owns 27 per cent of the club.<br><br>But he has said that he would welcome finding a 'Geordie Roman Abramovich' who could pump millions into the club like the Chelsea owner, and both he and Hall would be glad to hand over the reins after so much bad publicity during their reign.<br><br>Shepherd and Hall's son Douglas, who owns another 12.8 per cent, were infamously caught boasting of ripping off fans and calling Newcastle women 'dogs' in a tabloid sting operation during a 1998 visit to a bordello in Marbella.<br><br>Last season, Newcastle were rocked by a series of bad-boy antics, including an on-field punch up between team-mates Kieron Dyer and Lee Bowyer, the war of words between Souness and Craig Bellamy and the vocal unhappiness of winger Lauren Robert.<br><br>Bellamy and Robert have since left the club.<br></div>
