            <div class='col-md body'>But Kevin Keegan has a knack for ressurecting clubs that have been relegated. He brought Fulham from Division III to Division I in the three years following Mohammed Al-Fayed's takeover. Manchester City's swift return to the top flight in 2002 was also largely his work. Also if you remember, Newcastle were promoted within one season of hiring Keegan as the head coach.<br><br>If I had the wealth of Roman Abramovic, I'd buy Sheffield Wednesday and hire Keegan as coach.

James Milner also felt the full force of a challenge from Aldo Duscher and later required stitches for a cut near the eye.<br><br>But Deportivo soon began to assert themselves and looked the more composed team throughout the first half.<br><br>Their first chance came after just two minutes when the dangerous Pedro Munitis broke clear down the right and pulled the ball back towards goal but Jean-Alain Boumsong cleared.<br><br>Newcastle failed to heed the warning and Munitis exposed their weakness down the same flank to create the opening goal eight minutes later.<br><br>Steven Taylor was caught flat-footed as Munitis broke into the box and squared for Ruben to sidefoot home from six yards.<br><br>For a short spell it looked as if the Magpies might fold under the pressure as Ruben scuffed another shot in front of goal and Munitis fired straight at Shay Given.<br><br>Newcastle showed more composure as the half wore on but they were unable to convert their increased possession into opportunities.<br><br>They were almost caught out again just before the interval as the ubiquitous Munitis found space outside the area and sent another shot narrowly wide.<br><br>Newcastle finally started to show some attacking intent as the second half began and were instantly rewarded as they won a corner and claimed a superb 48th-minute equaliser through Bowyer.<br><br>Stephen CarrÂ’s cross was cleared only as far as the edge of the area by Deportivo and the ball fell perfectly for Bowyer, who connected with a sweet left-foot volley that flew into the top corner.<br><br>The game became scrappy after that with referee Serge Gumienny frequently blowing for free-kicks but, stirred back into life by the equaliser, Deportivo lifted their game.<br><br>Newcastle were back on level terms for just 10 minutes as Andrade ran unchallenged into the box from the halfway line and curled a superb finish past Given.<br><br>The visitors then appeared to be hanging on as Ruben volleyed just wide with an acrobatic effort and Given needed to be alert to keep out a deflected Munitis cross.<br><br>The Newcastle wall then did its job as the Spaniards won two free-kicks outside the area but failed to test Given.<br><br>Munitis again caused a few flutters in the box as the clock ran down but, despite riding their luck on occasions, Newcastle held on for a result their determination deserved.<br><br></div>

I've got my UEFA Â‘BÂ’ licence, and I'm half way through my Â‘AÂ’ licence.<br><br>Â“But I'm registered as a player, and who knows what may happen if there are injuries of suspensions.Â”<br><br>He added: Â“I played in the top flight last season, I'm 33 in October and I still feel I have a couple of years left in me. I'll certainly be ready if the opportunity comes along to step into the first team.<br><br>Â“I've signed a short-term deal initially, but hopefully I'll be able to extend that.Â”<br><br>Clark made 195 appearances for his hometown club before a transfer to local rivals Sunderland in 1997.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alan Shearer would love to be paired again with former England colleague Michael Owen in Newcastle United's attack, but fears that will be tough to achieve.<br>The Magpies have admitted their interest in Owen but Shearer believes there will still be plenty of offers made for the Real Madrid striker.<br><br>Shearer said: Â“Michael Owen would be an improvement to any club in this league, and that includes Newcastle. I would enjoy playing alongside him again.<br><br>Â“I have made no secret of the fact that I think he is a top, top player and his record suggests that.<br><br>Â“Anyone who wants to score goals should look no further than Michael Owen. Our manager would love him and he would be a great asset but I feel Michael will have a few options.<br><br>Â“I had great times with him for England and he can score goals in any league in the world. He has done it in the Premier League and La Liga, but there will be a few after his signature despite one or two denials.Â”<br><br>And Shearer believes that the long list of clubs denying an interest is just a smoke screen.<br><br>Shearer, speaking on BBC Radio 5 LiveÂ’s Sportsweek programme, said: Â“Everyone knows what football is like. People are not prepared to say they are after him.<br><br>Â“He says heÂ’s talked to three or four clubs and they could be the three or four who can win the title, who knows?Â”<br><br>On NewcastleÂ’s targets for the season, Shearer added: Â“We have got to get into the top six. ThereÂ’s no European football, which is disappointing, but if we are honest that could work in our favour. Last season we did not have the squad to play so many games and get through them.<br><br>Â“Playing Thursday, Sunday, Thursday, Sunday was tough. We have to finish higher than we did because last season wasnÂ’t good enough for a club of this size.<br><br>Â“Everyone knows we will need more additions, six or so went out in the summer and we have only had three arrive which doesnÂ’t add up.Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kieron Dyer has signed a new four-year contract with Newcastle United.<br>The England midfielder has completed an impressive turn-around in his fortunes on Tyneside after his Newcastle career looked as though it could be over nearly a year ago.<br><br>Dyer, 26, confirmed last weekend he had agreed a new deal with the Magpies after winning over the St JamesÂ’ Park crowd last season.<br><br>He told www.stellargroup.co.uk: Â“The club wanted me to stay and I wanted to stay. It didn't take long for my agent and the club to agree everything.<br><br>Â“I am delighted it has all been sorted out so quickly.<br><br>Â“This is a really important season for the club and for me personally. We have to improve on our showing last year and I'm sure we will.<br><br>Â“There is an excellent spirit here and we are all looking forward to the start of the Premiership.<br><br>Â“I hope to stay fit and play in as many games as I can and hopefully there will be a place at the World Cup waiting for me at the end of the season.Â”<br><br></div>
