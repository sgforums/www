            <div class='col-md body'>from premierleague.<br><br>SHEPHERD BIDING HIS TIME<br><br>Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd insists he is yet to approach anyone over the vacant manager's job at St James' Park amid a frenzy of speculation over Graeme Souness' successor.<br>Â“LetÂ’s be absolutely clear about this; we have made no approach to anyone at this moment in time,Â” Shepherd told the clubÂ’s official website, www.nufc.co.uk.<br><br>Â“Graeme left the club on Thursday, and for the next 48 hours, all that concerned everyone at the club was getting behind Glenn Roeder as caretaker manager and beating Portsmouth.<br><br>Â“We did that and now we look to start moving forward again. At the minute, all the papers are full of speculation about who might, or who might not, be coming to Newcastle United.<br><br>Â“The guessing games have already started and thatÂ’s inevitable whenever there is a vacancy. But I can only repeat that we have made no approach to anyone at this point.<br><br>Â“We will sit down and consider all the options available, and we will take however long is necessary to ensure we make the right appointment.Â”<br><br>Academy manager Glenn Roeder and skipper Alan Shearer, who have both ruled themselves out for the job on a permanent basis, took charge for the 2-0 win over Portsmouth, a first league victory in seven attempts.<br><br>There has been speculation, especially in the wake of ShepherdÂ’s revelation that he wants to keep Shearer at the club beyond the expiry of his playing contract at the end of the season, that he will use the next few weeks to persuade him to take the post after all.<br><br>But he looks to have a tough task with the 35-year-old adamant he will not accept such a high-profile job until he is ready for it.<br><br>Barclays Premiership rules mean Roeder and Shearer can remain in charge for only 12 weeks because neither has a UEFA Pro Licence, although reserve team coach Tommy Craig does and his involvement could allow the club to extend their search to the end of the season and beyond.<br><br>In the meantime, Roeder will attempt to build on SaturdayÂ’s victory against Aston Villa this weekend, for which he will have to take a decision over Â£9.5million signing Albert Luque.<br><br>The 27-year-old Spain international was allowed to go home after discovering he was not in the 16 for the Pompey game, but held talks with the caretaker boss, with Nolberto Solano translating, after his return to training.<br><br>Â“HeÂ’s fine,Â” said Roeder. Â“We sat down and had a chat after training and it was good for me and good for Albert. It was a private chat, but a good chat. He told me his views on a few things, which was good.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t know how long I will be here for but while I am here I have to be able to work with the players in the best way possible way, and the best approach in most cases is to sit down and talk.<br><br>Â“I have seen him play since he signed in the summer and I have seen him playing in Spain. We also know what he is capable of from what he does in training.<br><br>Â“He is a typical Spanish player, very skilful. His English continues to improve and now we have to find a way of getting the best out of him.Â”<br></div>
