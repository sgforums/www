            <div class='col-md body'>David Beckham was sent off as England beat Austria 1-0 but again failed to shine at Old Trafford in Saturday's World Cup qualification match.<br><br>The England captain was dismissed for two over-zealous bookings in two minutes, but Sven Goran Eriksson's side managed to hold onto their narrow lead courtesy of Frank Lampard's first half penalty.<br><br>Austria had hit the bar just before Beckham's dismissal, and soon after being reduced to ten-men injury was added to England's insult with Sol Campbell limping off to be replaced by Rio Ferdinand.<br><br>Shorn of the suspended Wayne Rooney, England had showed intent but little incision in a pacey throughout, even before being reduced to ten men.<br><br>Jurgen Macho had made a hash of an early David Beckham corner and was grateful when Michael Owen's alert header was blocked.<br><br>At the other end Markus Kiesenebner had an effort tipped over by Paul Robinson, and Owen was denied a clear route to goal by Paul Scharner's well-timed tackle after Peter Crouch's through ball.<br><br>Crouch was denied his first England goal soon after when Gerrard's astute through ball found Owen and his weak shot was parried into the path of the tall striker only for Rene Aufhaser to dive in and toe the ball away.<br><br>If England's fans were wondering where a goal would come form, they were soon given an answer when an innocuous tug from Scharner on Owen was adjudged to be a penalty, allowing new taker Lampard to step up and slot confidently home.<br><br>It should have been a bigger lead; Crouch failing to get the power into a header after Gerrard's cross and then a yard behind Joe Cole's square ball after a fine run from the Chelsea man.<br><br>Kisenebner had Robinson scrambling across his goal with another rising drive, this time off target, but England should have had a second penalty.<br><br>Owen's reactions drove him onto a lose ball into the penalty area, and as he was clumsily upended by Andreas Dober only for referee Luis Cantalejo to wave away appeals.<br><br>The second half started with England failing to take another opportunity, Macho out quickly to save from Owen after Lampard's turn and incisive pass had put the England forward through.<br><br>Again, Austria took up the invitation to control the pace, and Andreas Ivanschitz and Roland Linz looked dangerous.<br><br>Crouch drew a save from macho after a Beckham free-kick, but England had an enormous let-off when Linz lobbed the ball over a despairing Robinson, but watched the ball strike the face of the bar.<br><br>Beckham then picked up a harsh booking for a raised arm on an aerial challenge on Andreas Ibertsberger, and just a minute later dived into a tackle on the same player that left Cantalejo holding aloft a second yellow card that saw the captain sent off, even though contact was minimal.<br><br>The first caution had already ensured that Beckham would miss the Poland game and, as he trailed disconsolately off, Eriksson was forced into a major reshuffle, bringing on Ledley King and Rio Ferdinand as Campbell pulled up soon after holding his hamstring.<br><br>Lampard nearly made it safe with a free-kick that Macho did well to stop, but it was England that were put under increasing pressure by the newly buoyant Austrians, although they largely restricted them to shots from range.<br><br>Owen made way for Kieron Richardson and Gerrard took the burden of responsibility and the armband.<br><br>Lampard tested Macho in injury time, but 2-0 would have not have been a fair reflection that will be dominated by Beckham's dismissal but also brought a fine performance by the visitors that kept this misfiring England side looking far from the World Cup contenders they would like to be.<br><br>BAsket the referee sibei kayu..luan luan lai one..Anyway England was poor again..Crouch as usual quite threatening but not lethal.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>england dun deserve to win at all, austria was controlling the game all along. just that luck allowed them to take that penalty.<br><br>but the 2nd yellow for Beckham was rubbish. just some stumbling and he was shown his yellow card. if you watch the refree he seemed to hesitate for a while before deciding for the 2nd yellow.<br><br>poor austria. their long balls were damn precise and there's good understanding between the players. unlike the england players who played to impress.<br><br>towards the final min the austrian players were desperate and took long pot shots at the england goal, they shd have been a little more reserved and play some passing to confuse the england players and get a little closer to score.<br><br>couch? he's a big dumbo. slow, lazy, and always waiting for the ball to get to him instead of him getting to the balls. could never understand why sven got owen out instead of him. never was he impressive at all, and bent/defoe could better take his place</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Among the team, England's midfield is the MOST suspect. You can see Gerrard and Lampard getting each other's way. Joe Cole, with due respect is a good player but his crosses from the left is way off the mark. There were gd runnings from Owen &amp; Crouch but where's the decent crosses from the left?<br><br>And dear Beckham loves to drifts from the right to centre and sumtimes the left as well... no Thank you, pls stick to the left pretty boy. England is at it's most purposeful when the pretty boy is on the right, spraying the diagonal passes. And one that got to Crouch who laid off to Owen for that one and only penalty and goal.<br><br>The pair up upfront looked promising but services from the flanks are dodgy and would have resulted in more goals if it's better.</div>
