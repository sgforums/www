            <div class='col-md body'>Young snubs Â£9.65million move to West Ham<br><br>Ashley Young is believed to have today rejected the chance to join West Ham after Watford accepted an offer worth up to Â£9.65million for their star forward.<br><br>The Hammers had made no secret of their interest in Young, and saw a Â£7m bid for the England Under-21 international turned down last week.<br><br>But West Ham - whose revised offer was thought to have been Â£8m, with a possible Â£1.65m in add-ons - are now likely to have to turn their attention elsewhere because Young, 21, is understood to have snubbed the opportunity to discuss terms with the Upton Park club.<br><br>Aston Villa are still believed to be keen on Young, while Tottenham, whose interest has cooled recently, could also come back into the frame.<br><br>With Watford virtual certainties for relegation from the Barclays Premiership - Saturday's home defeat by Liverpool leaving them rooted to the bottom of the table 10 points adrift of safety - it appears they have finally decided to cash in on Young.<br><br>Manager Adrian Boothroyd has said repeatedly that his star player, who has scored four goals in 23 appearances this season, would leave only if he asked the 35-year-old boss to do so.<br><br>Earlier in the month, Spurs were prepared to offer defender Calum Davenport and winger Wayne Routledge as part of a deal to bring Young to White Hart Lane.<br><br>But those negotiations stalled because neither Davenport nor Routledge - currently on loan at Fulham - was keen to move to Watford.<br><br>Recently, Villa boss Martin O'Neill said: 'I am hoping we can bring in somebody but you are never sure until someone signs.<br><br>'There is no point in saying `we are doing this, this and this' if one thing doesn't materialise for one reason or another.<br><br>'But what we are trying to find is quality players who would find the challenge exciting - not just now but in the next couple of seasons.<br><br>'I don't want to be held to ransom but equally you don't cut off your nose to spite your face. We need some help and I don't mind (paying) a little bit over the odds for a player who is going to be a help to us.<br><br>'But I don't want to pay out extortionate prices if I can avoid it just because it is January.'<br><br>Boothroyd, meanwhile, has been resolute in his desire to fetch the best possible price for Young.<br><br>The Vicarage Road chief revealed last week that seven Premiership clubs had enquired about him - with West Ham, Spurs, Villa, Everton and Sheffield United all known to have expressed an interest.<br><br>Boothroyd said last week: 'There are players out there who have gone for Â£8m-plus who do not have what he has.<br><br>'Ashley is the trump card in the Premiership. There are not many players outside the top four clubs who are better than him.'<br><strong></strong></div>
