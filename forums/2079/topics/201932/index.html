            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Magnusson 'to succeed' at Hammers</strong><br>By John Sinnott<br><br>Eggert Magnusson, the head of the Icelandic consortium expected to take over West Ham this week, has been backed to revive the Upton Park club.<br><br>"Eggert will make West Ham successful," Icelandic lawyer and agent Olafur Gardarsson, who has known Magnusson for nine years, told BBC Sport.<br><br>"He's enthusiastic, powerful, and tells you his meaning straight to your face.<br><br>"Whatever he does he is usually successful and it's difficult to stop him if he gets involved in a project."<br><br>Magnusson, the president of the Icelandic Football Association and a member of Uefa's executive committee, is set to replace Terry Brown as chairman at Upton Park.<br><br>Under Magnusson the Icelandic Football Association has run a surplus in its accounts each year, testament to his financial acumen, says Gardarsson.<br><br>"It's a stable organisation and even when they've had less TV revenue from a bad European Championship or World Cup qualifying group they'd have money put aside from previous years to help."<br><br>Gardasson has also been impressed by Magnusson's negotiation and organisation skills in his dealings with the Icelandic government, Fifa and Uefa.<br><br>"Six years ago Iceland didn't have any indoor football halls - now we've got up to six," said Gardasson. "They are used all the time as well as in the evening.<br><br>"The Icelandic FA has also built up to up to 100 small artificial grounds for children to play in.<br><br>"This was a response to parents complaining there were no spaces for their kids to play due to the housing development that has gone on in Iceland, which has reduced the number of green spaces.<br><br>"The Icelandic government spoke to Fifa and the government and together they have made a start to improve this problem.<br><br>"Under Magnusson, again with Fifa and the Icelandic government's help, the national stadium has also been improved, with the building of a second stand.<br><br>"I know within Uefa he's well known and well respected."<br><br>Gardarsson believes billionaire financier Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, who is chairman of the Icelandic bank Landsbanki and is backing the Magnusson consortium, will be an important figure at Upton Park.<br><br>"I have known Gudmundsson for over 15 years," said Gardasson.<br><br>"He was chairman of Icelandic club KR for many years. He is clever, successful and an extremely likeable gentleman.<br><br>"From what I understand he would be a quiet partner, but it is a strength to have him in the background.<br><br>"Despite his wealth he treats everyone the same way whatever their status. He is a good people person."<br><br>Gardasson added: "There are always more dangers taking over a football club rather than an ordinary business.<br><br>"But Iceland is not far from you and I think we are similar peoples.<br><br>"We have watched English football avidly since 1965 and hundreds of people travel each weekend from Iceland to watch English clubs.<br><br>"West Ham is a big name with a long history. You only have to think of Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters.<br><br>"There are possibilites with a name like that, you don't have to build from scratch. It is known all round the world."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>MAGNUSSON SET FOR WRIGHT-PHILLIPS TALKS</strong><br><br>New West Ham United owner Eggert Magnusson is to discuss the possible signing of Shaun Wright-Phillips with Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon.<br><br>Magnusson, who has completed an Â£85million takeover of the Upton Park club, has promised manager Alan Pardew money to spend in the January transfer window.<br><br>Winger Wright-Phillips, who has started just 15 of 51 appearances for the Blues following his Â£21million move from Manchester City in the summer of 2005, is understood to be top of the wanted list.<br><br>"He has not been playing regularly at Chelsea but he's a good player and he has great possibilities to do well," said Magnusson on BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme.<br><br>"Alan has told me he has already asked Chelsea about him. It came out of Chelsea that we have shown an interest but it has not gone any further.<br><br>KENYON CONFIRMS WRIGHT-PHILLIPS INTEREST<br><br>"I know Peter Kenyon well and I think we will sit down and try to find the right fee, whatever that might be."<br><br>WEST HAM UNITED 1-0 SHEFFIELD UNITED<br><br>The Hammers have also been linked with David Beckham, who is struggling to command a regular place at Real Madrid under coach Fabio Capello.<br><br>However, Magnusson added: "This is the first I have heard about him linked with West Ham.<br><br>"The way he has played at Manchester United and Real Madrid, he is a great player, and it's an honour he has been linked to West Ham.<br><br>"I might be the incoming chairman at West Ham but the manager is the one who changes the team.<br><br>"It's his responsibility to build that team. You just can't build a football team with superstars."<br><br>The futures of Javier Mascherano and Carlos Tevez are also unclear.<br><br>The Argentinia duo were surprisingly signed on transfer deadline day from Corinthians, yet their contracts are owned by a third party.<br><br>"That's another discussion I'll have with the manager this week," said Magnusson.<br><br>"We will try to sort out the situation with them but it's not easy to come to England when you don't speak the language.<br><br>"It's a totally different mentality but it's up to the manager. He has to decide what to do with them.<br><br>"But they have the ability to succeed in England. We will tackle the problem."<br><br>Magnusson has also confirmed his aim to move to the Olympic Stadium following the 2012 Games.<br><br>"That's my dream at the moment," said Magnusson.<br><br>"But we have to start discussions and see what can be done.<br><br>"We know we have to keep to the athletics legacy that has been promised after the Olympics.<br><br>"Look at the Stade de France, which is a great venue, and you can compare it very well.<br><br>"I know we bought West Ham with where they are now, at the Boleyn Ground, but looking at the future this is definitely the way we want to go."<br><br></div>
