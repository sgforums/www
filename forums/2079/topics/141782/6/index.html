Although he will not be a direct replacement for the Irishman, Carrick's passing skills will provide them with an outlet they have lacked since Keane left the club.<br><br>Carrick's loss will still be a major blow for Spurs coach Martin Jol who helped the 25-year-old force his way into Sven-Goran Eriksson's World Cup squad.<br><br>The Dutch coach had hoped that Carrick would repay the club's loyalty by staying at White Hart Lane but Spurs would not agree to the player's wage demands - reported to be around Â£50,000-a-week.<br><br>Carrick had two years left on his Tottenham deal but had rejected a new contract offer in the wake of United's persistent interest.<br><br>Tottenham's determination to hold out for a fee which closely matched their Â£20million valuation of the player means has given them more transfer cash to spend but Jol will not need to buy a replacement for Carrick.<br><br>Tottenham have already signed 22-year-old Benoit Assou-Ekotto from Lens and spent Â£10.9m on Bulgarian striker Dimitar Berbatov but missed out on Chelsea's left-winger Damien Duff.<br><br>But the summer signing of Ivory Coast international Didier Zokora will make Carrick's departure somewhat less painful for Jol, who can now continue his search for a left-sided midfielder in earnest.<br><br>Carrick will become United's fifth most expensive signing behind Rio Ferdinand, Juan Sebastian Veron, Wayne Rooney and Van Nistelrooy.<br><br>United visit Amsterdam next week where they are due to play both Porto and Ajax and Carrick is expected to be part of the squad.</div>
