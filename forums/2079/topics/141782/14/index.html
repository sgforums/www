We want to go one better than we did last year,' said Chimbonda.<br><br>'We know what we have to do.<br><br>'It hurt us a lot to lose to them last season. We were winning 2-0 at home in the first leg and they got it back to 2-2 and we ended up losing the second leg.<br><br>'But we have learned from what happened and it will be different this time. We can win the trophy this season. We can achieve anything when we perform like we did against Manchester City.'<br><br>Spurs became the first team to win at Eastlands when they recorded their 2-0 win on Tuesday, and Arsenal have also been impressive at home so far.<br><br>'We would love to be the first team to beat them at the Emirates this season,' said Chimbonda.<br><br>Chelsea defeated Liverpool to set up a semi-final against Everton, with the two-legged ties getting played next month.<br><br>The three quarter-finals held this week all featured red cards for reckless challenges.<br><br>After Tottenham's Didier Zokora and Arsenal midfielder Denilson were dismissed last night, Peter Crouch was given a straight red at Stamford Bridge for his lunge at Mikel John Obi tonight.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Arsenal v Tottenham: Preview</strong><br><br>Juande Ramos believes he has won his first major battle as Tottenham manager by alleviating the 'despondency' he found on his arrival at White Hart Lane.<br><br>The Spaniard took charge of Spurs in October following the disastrous start to the season overseen by his predecessor Martin Jol.<br><br>And he admits he was faced with a depressed dressing room when he began his new job with the north Londoners.<br><br>'I was taking charge of a great club but there was a despondency and a tremendous lack of motivation,' Ramos told The Sun. 'There was no hope or ambition.<br><br>'There was so much self-doubt in the dressing room. That was the most critical thing we had to change.<br><br>'I noted an air of abandonment and resignation like it didn't really matter. It was a worrying situation as I realised my players were resigned to losing and to disaster.<br><br>'They got used to defeats and looked to be in a daze. This alarmed me enormously as we had to change it radically.'<br><br>Ramos appears to have succeeded in his bid to lift the players and they have lost just once under his leadership to sit comfortably in mid-table, while they will also face today's opponents Arsenal in the semi-finals of the Carling Cup.<br><br>But the former Sevilla boss has revealed his ambitions go far further and he insists that, given time, he can turn Tottenham into a competitive force at the highest level.<br><br>'Our club deserves to fight against the best and challenge for the Premier League and the Champions League. That's what I will try to do with all my energy and strength,' he added.<br><br>'We have the potential to do it. But it doesn't just depend on one person, it's not all about the coach. The manager has to have the collaboration and the support of the club.'<br><br>Meanwhile, Robin van Persie is determined to send Arsenal's fans into the festive season with victory over north London rivals Tottenham.<br><br>Van Persie is well aware that during Arsene Wenger's time at the helm, Spurs have registered just one win in 26 meetings between the two sides.<br><br>But local bragging rights still mean so much to Arsenal supporters and Van Persie is well aware of it.<br><br>He said: 'When I see the fans in the street, they tell me that the Tottenham game is the one they want us to win.<br><br>'It means so much for these people, whether they are at the training ground, or when I am out shopping. It doesn't matter where, everyone speaks about this game. It means a lot.<br><br>'You can sense there is a special atmosphere. It is similar to the games against Chelsea and Manchester United in terms of atmosphere and that's what I like the most.<br><br>'I just love to play those games when the fans are on top of it, they are loving it and every single piece of action in the game gets the fans involved. It's great to be a part of it.'<br><br>Van Persie has played in six derby clashes against Spurs but has yet to register a goal against them.<br><br>He added: 'I know it is a big game for the fans and it is for us as well. But there are big games every week - last weekend it was Chelsea and we were very happy because we played well. Spurs is massive but we have to win every game in the Premier League, not just against Spurs, if we want to be champions.'<br><br>Arsenal will go into the derby with just one major doubt - England's teenage winger Theo Walcott.<br><br>Walcott has not trained after suffering from a flu virus but otherwise Arsenal have a clean bill of health ahead of the lunchtime clash.<br><br>Wenger said: 'The injury news is quite good compared to last week. The only one who is problematic is Theo Walcott. He is not fit to practice. He has had flu and has not recovered completely. Everybody else is available.'<br><br>Tottenham striker Robbie Keane returns from suspension but midfielder Didier Zokora starts a three-match ban.<br><br>Darren Bent (hip), Ricardo Rocha (thigh), Michael Dawson (migraine) and Jermaine Jenas (ankle) require late checks.<br><br>Ledley King has a picked up a thigh strain while recovering from knee surgery and Anthony Gardner (ankle), Gareth Bale (foot) and Benoit Assou-Ekotto (knee) remain sidelined.</div>
