It was our first meeting but I realised that he's a very special man."<br><br>"I'm glad I'll have the chance to work with him... many people have told me he is a brilliant manager."<br><br>The striker, handed the number nine shirt at White Hart Lane, also told a news conference he is keen to show that he is worth the money Spurs are paying for him.<br><br>"I'm looking forward to succeeding at Tottenham, which is a club everyone has spoken highly of," said Berbatov.<br><br>"The club made a great effort to sign me and I hope to return that effort playing for them. I've had the chance to see some Spurs matches and I really like their style of play. They are trying to play attractive football."<br><br>Berbatov, who has been on top form for Leverkusen in recent seasons and was second-top scorer in the Bundesliga last term, has become the most expensive Bulgarian player.<br><br>His national team mate Valeri Bozhinov joined Fiorentina from Lecce last year for a reported 13 million euros.<br><br>"I spent five unforgettable years in Leverkusen but I've got no doubts that joining Tottenham is a step ahead in my career," said Berbatov, who is due to link up with Spurs on July 1.<br><br>The three-times Bulgarian Footballer of the Year is confident Tottenham will soon be playing in the Champions League despite having to settle for a UEFA Cup place next season.<br><br>"I want to play in the Champions League and I'm sure I'll do it as a Spurs player," said Berbatov, who helped Leverkusen to the 2002 final a year after joining the club from CSKA Sofia.<br><br>Tottenham missed out on a place in the Champions League qualifying round after being pipped to fourth spot in the Premier League by Arsenal on the last day of the season.<br><br>"I watched their final game against West Ham and it was very emotional because I felt like a Spurs fan," said Berbatov, after a Tottenham squad hit by illness lost 2-1 at Upton Park.<br><br>Berbatov scored 69 goals in 154 matches in his five-year Bundesliga spell, having missed only two games in the last three seasons. He has also scored 31 goals in 50 full internationals.<br><br>He will become the third Bulgarian in the English Premier League, joining Charlton Athletic defender Radostin Kishishev and Portsmouth striker Svetoslav Todorov.</div>

He has agreed personal terms at Spurs, reportedly worth Â£48,000 a week.<br><br>He said: 'Tottenham are a club building something special. The squad has some terrific young players, an excellent manager and coaching staff and I am looking forward to playing my part.'<br><br>Berbatov continued on Sky Sports News: 'I looked at the team, the players and the coach Martin Jol is very good and that is the most important thing to me - the coach being good with the player.<br><br>'And I've seen the games. From year to year Tottenham are getting better and better and when I get here I hope we can play in the Champions League next year.'<br><br>Berbatov also revealed he had been monitored for some time by the north London club.<br><br>'They looked at me in many games. Tottenham were the club who stood by me for six months and they wanted to buy me.<br><br>'This is important to me when somebody wants you and Martin Jol said `I know you can do good here, you can do well here.'<br><br>'I will try my best. Tottenham are trying to do something special and I want to be part of this club.'<br><br>Berbatov has also had a prolific international career, scoring 31 goals in 50 senior internationals, and has been voted Bulgarian player of the year for the past four years.<br><br>However, he is coming to Tottenham against the advice of Bayer Leverkusen's director of sport who believes he should be joining 'a top club.'<br><br>Former German international striker Voller said: 'He should play another year for us and wait for an offer from a top club. I have nothing against Tottenham but a player should wait a bit until he gets an offer from a top three club.<br><br>'But Tottenham are ready to pay the fee and so it is up to Dimitar.'<br><br>Tottenham were one of the busiest in last summer's European transfer market and Berbatov's arrival will not be the last for Jol.<br><br>With veteran Edgar Davids another possible departure after just one season and Jermain Defoe's future uncertain following interest from Liverpool, Jol needs another midfielder and striker as well as cover in defence to cope with the extra demands of the UEFA Cup.<br><br>Mido, who scored twice on his Spurs debut against Portsmouth in February last year, notched 11 goals in 23 starts for Tottenham last term and terrorised defences with his strength in the air - a perfect foil for wingers Aaron Lennon and Wayne Routledge.<br><br>But after returning from the African Nations Cup where he spearheaded the hosts' triumph despite a series of disciplinary clashes, he missed the vital last few weeks of the season with groin and knee injuries.<br><br>Spurs are already Mido's eighth professional club at the age of 23 while Berbatov has been with Leverkusen for the last five years.<br><br>Berbatov made his debut for CSKA Sofia at 18 but he started to make his name the following season when he scored 14 goals in 27 league games.<br><br>A run of nine goals in 11 games in 2000-01 was enough to persuade Leverkusen to sign Berbatov in June 2001 and he appeared in the Champions League final against Real Madrid at the end of that season.<br><br>He was still only 18 when he made his international debut in November 1999 and scored with his first touch in a competitive game, a World Cup qualifier against Denmark, a year later.<br><br>Liverpool and Valencia made inquiries about him last summer but the Anfield club settled instead on Â£7million Peter Crouch.<br><br>Tottenham's sporting director Damien Comolli said: 'There were a number of clubs interested in signing Dimitar, clubs from France, Spain and the Premiership. We are delighted he has chosen to join us.<br><br>'He is not only a player with a proven track record for being able to finish but also for creating scoring opportunities for team-mates.'</div>

They have already had two bids rejected by Wigan but are set to return with an improved offer.<br><br>Former France international Roger Boli, now a partner of Chimbonda's agent Willie McKay, believes the defender should not be castigated for his decision to move on.<br><br>Chimbonda stunned manager Paul Jewell by handing him a written transfer request just moments after their final game of the season, against Arsenal at Highbury.<br><br>Boli said: 'I don't know why Pascal now has a bad reputation in England.<br><br>'He has been very nice to Wigan and he is appreciated by his team-mates. He went there for a small fee and gave everything for the club.<br><br>'Pascal doesn't have any problems with Wigan - he's just ambitious, it's normal.<br><br>'Every football player wants to know big clubs, they want to taste it.<br><br>'Jimmy Bullard has gone to Fulham, so Pascal's case is similar, it is just football.'</div>

'We are building a team, not dismantling one. 'We have had no contact about him and we don't expect, or want, any.'<br><br>Spurs boss Martin Jol has worked hard to assemble a squad of young players, and the spine of his team is English. Last summer he managed to prise Jermaine Jenas away from Boro's derby rivals Newcastle with a Â£7million bid in August.<br><br>However, he had earlier failed in a bold attempt to capture Downing, whose emergence during the previous campaign had been little short of spectacular.<br><br>Boro's determination to hang on to him was as unequivocal then as it is now as they rebuffed Tottenham's advance.<br><br>'We have had an approach from Tottenham regarding Stewart Downing,' Lamb said in July last year. 'They did make an unsolicited offer.<br><br>'We rejected the offer immediately and told Tottenham that Stewart is not for sale, that we are not interested and that they should not pursue the matter any further.<br><br>'As a consequence, Tottenham have told us they have no further interest in Stewart.'<br><br>Downing suffered a frustrating, injury-blighted campaign after damaging his knee while on senior international duty in America 12 months ago.<br><br>However, he battled hard for fitness and form after returning to action in the New Year and turned in a superb display in the 4-2 UEFA Cup semi-final fightback against Steaua Bucharest to serve a timely reminder of his ability.<br><br>With Spurs having just missed out on Champions League qualification, they have already strengthened with the addition of Â£10.9million Bulgarian striker Dimitar Berbatov.<br><br>But if Jol is determined to add Downing to his armoury, he faces a major battle to persuade Boro, even though the Teessiders cannot offer him European football next season.<br><br>Boro's new manager - an appointment is not expected until next week at the earliest with chairman Steve Gibson still awaiting an answer from Terry Venables - is unlikely to want to part with one of his most promising players, and involvement in the World Cup finals would simply reinforce that.<br><br>Meanwhile, Lamb has hinted 34-year-old striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink could yet have a future at the Riverside Stadium.<br><br>The Dutchman is out of contract and his agent Humphry Nijman has claimed he has already received approaches from several clubs.<br><br>But Lamb said: 'We will consider our options regarding Jimmy when we have appointed a new manager.<br><br>'In the meantime, his agent has promised to keep us fully in the picture.'<br><br>Hasselbaink is confident he still has two good years left in him and, having finished last season with 18 goals despite initially finding himself sidelined by Â£7.5million newcomer Aiyegbeni Yakubu, believes there are more to come.</div>

He missed the last four games of last season and Tottenham agreed a deal to sign Â£10.9million Bulgarian Dimitar Berbatov from Bayer Leverkusen as a replacement.<br><br>Tottenham have also decided to release Serbia and Montenegro centre-back Goran Bunjevcevic, who was signed by former manager Glenn Hoddle in May 2001, while veteran Morocco defender Noureddine Naybet also departs.<br><br>Naybet was recruited two years ago from Deportivo La Coruna.</div>

We believe he comes to us with enormous potential for the future.'<br><br>Jol insists there are more new faces set to arrive at White Hart Lane this summer.<br><br>Spurs have spent Â£10.9million on Bulgaria striker Dimitar Berbatov and been linked with a host of other players including a renewed move for Chelsea left-back Wayne Bridge and Lyon's teenage winger Hatem Ben Arfa.<br><br>Jol, currently preparing to do some work for the BBC during the course of the World Cup, said the arrival of Berbatov was only the beginning of their transfer activity.<br><br>Jol said: 'We need to improve our strength in depth because next season we will hopefully progress in the cups and we will also be playing in Europe.<br><br>'We constantly assess the situation and we know exactly what we have to do, so now the question is whether we can get the players we want.<br><br>'I think the club had a tremendous stature in the past and we deserve it again, that is what we are getting towards now.<br><br>'That is why Edgar Davids came to the club last summer and we will continue to try and bring in top players.<br><br>'It is important that top players want to come to the club and that is what we are seeing with Berbatov. He has an amazing goalscoring record with Bulgaria and in the German league.<br><br>'The chairman, Daniel Levy, is backing us all the way. If we can find the right targets, through scouting and identifying them and everything is spot on, then we know things can happen.'<br><br>Jol has already enjoyed a short break in Spain and will be in Germany for the first week of the World Cup.<br><br>While the Dutch coach hopes that Holland do well in the tournament, he is also looking forward to seeing Michael Carrick or Aaron Lennon making an impact.<br><br>However, he remains disappointed centre-back Ledley King missed out through a foot injury and striker Jermain Defoe looks set to come home now Wayne Rooney is fit.<br><br>Jol added: 'Ledley was doing extremely well and I am so disappointed for him with his injury.<br><br>'I feel exactly the same for Jermain, he has been selected for the last two years and now all of a sudden he isn't. For me it is very strange that Jermain isn't in the squad.<br><br>'But if Michael plays in the World Cup it will be another step in his development and the same for Aaron or Jermaine Jenas.<br><br>'I am hoping for Holland to do well but I am also really hoping that some of my Spurs players play and do well for England because it is important that they make the next step.'</div>
