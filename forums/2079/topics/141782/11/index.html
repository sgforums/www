            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Berbatov happy to stay at Spurs... for now</strong><br><br>Dimitar Berbatov has revealed he is happy to stay at Tottenham 'at least for now' but has hinted that Manchester United may make a move for him in the future.<br><br>'I think this is unlikely for two reasons, ' he told Bulgarian publication Futbol. 'Firstly, no-one from United has talked to either me or my agent and secondly my club hasn't received any official transfer request. So I think there is nothing to discuss on this subject.<br><br>'I chose Tottenham and I stay at Tottenham. I alone chose to play at Tottenham last season and I remain in Tottenham on my own bidding, at least for now, while my contract is in force.'<br><br>Asked if he thought United's reported interest in him was genuine, he replied: 'This is something different. No-one said that United are not interested in me at all or in the price they need to pay for me, but what is known is that there won't be any transfer this fall (autumn).'<br><br>Berbatov went desperately close to scoring against United three times during Spurs' 1-0 defeat at Manchester United, which added to the pressure on under-fire manager Martin Jol.<br><br>Spurs chairman Daniel Levy publicly backed Jol last week after the club came in for criticism following reports that a delegation met Sevilla boss Juande Ramos and, according to Ramos, offered the Spaniard Jol's job.<br><br>Levy attempted to portray the meeting as a fact-finding mission aimed at tapping into Ramos' recent success but Spurs fans rallied strongly behind Jol during the 4-0 win over Derby and the 1-0 loss to United.<br><br>Berbatov claimed that 'because of the media saga Jol firmed up his place as a manager of Tottenham', and added that the speculation over his future had led to a salary hike.<br><br>'The club board decided to raise my weekly salary, not by much, but there is a raise,' he said.<br><br>Jol is '100% convinced' Dimitar Berbatov will remain at White Hart Lane.<br><br>Berbatov's agent Emil Dantchev has claimed he is due to have talks with the Spurs hierarchy later this week about renewed interest from Manchester United.<br><br>However, Jol remains determined to keep the former Bayer Leverkusen star, who scored 23 times in his debut campaign with the north London club, and is optimistic he will succeed.<br><br>'I said on Friday that I would rather die than sell Berbatov,' said Jol. 'Hopefully, I won't die. I am 100% convinced he will stay at the club.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Defiant Jol happy to battle it out</strong><br><br>Under-fire Tottenham manager Martin Jol underlined his determination to battle on after a 1-0 defeat against Manchester United at Old Trafford.<br><br>Spurs, who had two penalty appeals turned down and missed a string of presentable chances, have just one win to their name from the opening four games.<br><br>Another loss was the last thing the Dutchman needed at the end of a week which saw a club delegation meet Seville boss Juande Ramos and, according to Ramos, offered him Jol's job.<br><br>Spurs chairman Daniel Levy, who portrayed the meeting as a fact-finding mission aimed at tapping into the Spaniard's recent success, has since offered public backing for Jol who, in turn, insists he feels secure.<br><br>'I always feel well, otherwise you would be gone,' he said. 'If you feel well and happy you stay at the club.<br><br>'It doesn't depend on one or two people. I am here for the players and the fans and, of course, one or two board members are happy with me.'<br><br>Turning his thoughts to the players, Jol added: 'Every Spurs player will give 100% all the time. It is a terrific club.<br><br>'Some of them love the club. They want to win. They want to do well for the shirt and the supporters and hopefully for us as well.'<br><br>Although they lost Spurs produced arguably their best performance of the campaign so far against United.<br><br>One particular highlight for Spurs was the confident display from 18-year-old debutant Gareth Bale, who slotted in effortlessly on the left side of midfield.<br><br>'I feel Gareth is a wonderful talent,' Jol said. 'I have heard that people at Manchester United wanted him.<br><br>'I still feel he is a left-back who is very good at going forward.<br><br>'There is a lot to come from him. He has a fantastic left-foot. He can take excellent free-kicks. That is what I was hoping to see.<br><br>'It was his first game for a couple of months. I had to take the gamble.<br><br>'Bale has not played for us before. He did ever so well for us.'</div>

'He has looked sharp and the priority is that he puts himself in a position to play for us.<br><br>'There are players that you rule out completely that will not be involved, we haven't ruled him out.

Hughton also wants Defoe to sign a new deal.<br><br>'He is very much a part of the squad we have,' he said. 'He is a quality player and an integral part of what we are trying to achieve here.

            <div class='col-md body'>Tottenham v Anorthosis Famagusta: Preview<br><br>Martin Jol is unlikely to make radical changes to his starting XI as he looks for UEFA Cup victory against Anorthosis Famagusta to kick-start Tottenham's season.<br><br>The first-round clash at White Hart Lane against the unfancied Cypriots would normally offer the chance to rotate his squad, but defeat is unthinkable for Jol after one win this season.<br><br>The Dutchman also hopes that Dimitar Berbatov can use the European platform as he did last season and spark a goalscoring run to turn Spurs' season around.<br><br>``It could be an opportunity to change the team but I can't gamble because we still have to work as a team and gel together,'' said the Spurs boss.<br><br>``So you can't take big gambles and pick players for the fun of it.<br><br>``For us it is too important to reach the next round, so most of my regulars are going to play.<br><br>``I feel we are favourites but still have to do it because we have not won many games in the league. If you want to change things and get some confidence out of games you have to do it now.''<br><br>Jol has appeared as a man under pressure but Spurs have an identical record to the start of last season when they recovered to finish fifth in the Premier League - the difference this campaign being the expectation to compete for a top-four place.<br><br>It was victory against Slavia Prague at this stage last season that started a two-month unbeaten run, this time around they face the team coached by former Newcastle favourite Temuri Ketsbaia.<br><br>``It's simple. If you win games you always feel better so we need some confidence again,'' Jol said.<br><br>``I know we played Man United, Fulham away and Arsenal which is never easy but we have to come up with the goods now.''<br><br>Berbatov has netted just once this season but has shown his usual flashes of class.<br><br>``After the last season, you could say he (Berbatov) is a slow starter,'' said Jol.<br><br>``After scoring he is always different. You need a bit of success, as a player and as a team.<br><br>``He is a quiet lad but has confidence and shows it every day.''<br><br>Poor finishing by all of Jol's strikers has contributed to four points and four defeats so far.<br><br>Jol added: ``If you have quality up front they have to make the difference. If they don't it's not a problem if the other one scores or if the midfielders and defenders score.<br><br>``If you miss at crucial moments it could be a problem.''<br><br>Fielding a strong line-up means all eyes will be on Jermain Defoe again after the England striker failed to make the match-day squad for the Arsenal defeat at the weekend, although he appears willing to wait for his chance.<br><br>Spurs chairman Daniel Levy wants Defoe to sign a new contract to avoid him leaving for nothing at the end of the season.<br><br>``There is no issue,'' said Jol.<br><br>``Last year he didn't want to sign his contract and he had more starts than any other striker. He had more league starts than Robbie Keane.<br><br>``Daniel Levy is the man. They offered him a new contract. It's not about offering, it's about signing.''<br><br>Keeping four strikers happy is part of Jol's plan to take Spurs to the next level after reaching the UEFA Cup quarter-finals last season.<br><br>The Dutchman is hoping that reaching the group stages again will help the club and its progression, although the competition is about the team developing rather than profits.<br><br>``If you make a fortune on profits, you want to make a fortune the next year as well,'' he said.<br><br>``I think it is important but it is not crucial and there is more to gain from the Champions League than the UEFA Cup.<br><br>``But you play in the league to get in Europe. It's like the icing on the cake. It's so important for us or we've done all the work for nothing.''</div>

He is always good to me, always backing me.'<br><br>As well as Mourinho, Sevilla coach Juande Ramos has been linked to the job.<br><br>Ramos talked of an 'offer' last month but Tottenham consistently denied being in negotiations with anyone to replace Jol, whose position is still clearly shaky after another unconvincing performance at Bolton.<br><br>It followed the 3-1 home defeat by Arsenal and even a 6-1 trouncing of UEFA Cup minnows Anorthosis Famagusta on Thursday has done little to stabilise matters.<br><br>Tottenham are still in the Barclays Premier League's bottom three, having won just once in their first seven games.<br><br>Yesterday they lost the chance of a vital three points with another goal conceded from a set piece after Robbie Keane had put them ahead at the Reebok.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Jol eyes glory, defends Defoe subbing</strong><br><br>Tottenham boss Martin Jol set his sights on silverware following Carling Cup victory over Middlesbrough - but defiantly added he has already brought his club success in the last two years.<br><br>Jol has appeared undermined by his board this season, after Spurs officials met Sevilla coach Juande Ramos with a view to making him a replacement for the Dutchman.<br><br>Jol nonetheless tried to put things in perspective, after fifth-placed finishes in his first full Premier League seasons.<br><br>Last night's 2-0 win over Boro will not be enough to lift the gloom at White Hart Lane.<br><br>But Jol said: 'I am in a very good position here, and that is what I deserve; I gave them a bit of success over the last couple of years - no-one could have done better.'<br><br>The substitution of Jermain Defoe in the second half was greeted with jeers from Spurs fans - but the decision was vindicated when Robbie Keane, his replacement, set up Gareth Bale to open the scoring.<br><br>'I don't think it's about booing me - because a minute later they are singing my name,' said Jol.<br><br>'I'm not someone to fear things. They say in Holland 'have no fear, `Jolly' is here'.<br><br>'You can leave it and wait or make a decision. I've had around 150 games, maybe 170 - and they normally come off. Maybe a couple of them didn't.<br><br>'I make brave decisions all the time, because I want to win.<br><br>'Everyone will be involved - that's what I tell them.'<br><br>Defoe reacted angrily to being taken off, and Jol added: 'He's a human being. I always say if you come off you have to show respect for your team-mates.'<br><br>Tom Huddlestone sealed the win in the 75th minute.<br><br>But Boro boss Gareth Southgate was still raging, because Aaron Lennon appeared to be in an offside position for Bale's opener.<br><br>Goalkeeper coach Paul Barron was sent to the stands for leaving the technical area during the protests.<br><br>'We are well aware that Bale was onside - but we do feel Lennon was interfering. He was standing five yards from Bale and let the ball run,' said Southgate.<br><br>'Our covering defender has to go around Lennon.<br><br>'Maybe I have to go on another course! It's difficult for the linesman, but the flag should have gone up.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Jol: Spurs have become attractive proposition</strong><br><br>Tottenham boss Martin Jol believes the progress of the past three years means the club can now attract the finest available young talent to White Hart Lane.<br><br>Gareth Bale and Younes Kaboul have made impressive starts to their Premier League careers despite Spurs' dismal start to the season which sees them in the bottom three ahead of Monday's clash against Aston Villa.<br><br>Spurs recruited young players in the summer and Darren Bent is off the mark already, while Kevin-Prince Boateng and Adel Taarabt are pushing for a run of games.<br><br>Each signing saw Spurs beat other clubs to secure their youngster, with Taarabt attracting attention while on loan last season.<br><br>'Adel was very attractive to a lot of other clubs in Europe, Bent in England, Bale, (Dimitar) Berbatov, Boateng,' Jol said. 'I can mention five or six players.<br><br>'I feel it is more a matter of examples. If they see Tom Huddlestone, Aaron Lennon and Michael Dawson playing. I had the same last season and we still had 60 points. I have to combine the results with the development. Even at Arsenal that is not the case.<br><br>'I feel we have more talented players than any other club. Maybe Arsenal have the same. (Abou) Diaby and Denilson come on when things are going well or in the Carling Cup.<br><br>'For us it's still different, because of Ledley King being out we needed cover. We could go for (Cristian) Chivu, (Sylvain) Distin or Kaboul. We felt in the long term Kaboul will be a better player than the others.'<br><br>Blending development with victories has proved a problem in the opening seven league games of the season, with just one win so far.<br><br>Jol has been under intense pressure but has suggested getting rid of him would be a backward step for the club and feels his board understand the progress made in the last three years.<br><br>His view is backed up by chairman Daniel Levy who this week denied a package being agreed for Jol's departure, although there has been a lingering suspicion of the Dutchman keeping the seat warm since Spurs officials met Sevilla coach Juande Ramos last month.<br><br>Spurs were also linked with Jose Mourinho after the Portuguese coach left Chelsea, yet Jol is confident that his consecutive fifth-placed Premier League finishes have been recognised.<br><br>'The fans know how difficult it is if they change management again, they know you could easily go back for years,' Jol said on BBC Radio Five Live. 'I hope people are realistic - you can get anyone in the world to come, but to do better you must finish fourth.'<br><br>He added: 'There's football people at our board and I think they realise it otherwise they probably would have made a decision.<br><br>'I feel top five was probably more than we would have expected when I started.'</div>
