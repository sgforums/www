            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Spurs stewards given police award for bravery</strong><br><br>LONDON, May 13 (Reuters) - More than 20 stewards who protected Tottenham Hotspur fans from Spanish police during a UEFA Cup match against Sevilla last month will be presented with awards for bravery on Sunday.<br><br>The commendation is usually given for acts of bravery by Metropolitan Police officers and is rarely awarded to civilians. It has never been given to football stewards.<br><br>The awards will be presented to the group of 22 stewards at halftime when Tottenham play Manchester City in their final match of the season at White Hart Lane.<br><br>Police superintendent Simon O'Brien said in a statement: 'I witnessed what I can only describe as selfless, brave conduct from the Spurs stewards.<br><br>'They consistently acted as go-betweens in an escalating confrontation, I saw them physically protecting fans and being injured themselves. I never saw them flinch in a lengthy violent confrontation - they were a fluorescent protective cushion in the middle of a melee.<br><br>'I have no doubt that but for the presence of Spurs stewards we could have experienced far more violence that night.'<br><br>The trouble started during the match in Spain on April 5 following a peaceful day in which Sevilla and Spurs fans had mingled together in the town.<br><br>The violence came one day after similar trouble between Manchester United fans and Italian police in Rome during a Champions League match.<br><br>In a statement, Spurs said: 'As Spanish police confronted travelling Tottenham fans with batons and shields, 22 stewards and officials from the club placed themselves between police and fans as they tried to restore calm.'<br><br>Tottenham press officer Philip Dorward added: 'UEFA should take notice of this commendation for the way English clubs help police their fans in Europe. The situation could have been far far worse and UEFA should be aware of the steps we take to prevent trouble.'<br><br>Sevilla beat Spurs 2-1 in Seville and then drew 2-2 at Tottenham in the second leg a week later to reach the semi-finals where they beat Osasuna. They will meet Espanyol in an all-Spanish UEFA Cup final in Glasgow on Wednesday.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Spurs new-boy Bale reveals top flight ambition</strong><br><br>Tottenham have continued with their plan to recruit the best homegrown talent by signing Wales left-back Gareth Bale from Southampton.<br><br>The 17-year-old has arrived at White Hart Lane in a deal worth up to Â£10million, although the details of his contract have not been announced.<br><br>Bale joins a club with a host of British players, including six in the England B squad to face Albania last night. They also have Republic of Ireland striker Robbie Keane.<br><br>He told Southampton's club website: 'I really want to play in the Premiership. That is very important to me and it is a fantastic opportunity.<br><br>'I have thought long and hard about it and I feel the time is right to move on.<br><br>'Now the season is finished I have taken stock and decided to move on.<br><br>'It is not about money in any way. This is purely a footballing decision and (about) the chance to play regularly in the Premiership.'<br><br>Boss Martin Jol did not bring homegrown talent to the club last summer, but later admitted that was due to the climate of the transfer market.<br><br>Bale, who was also linked with Manchester United and Arsenal, came close to signing in the January transfer window but stayed at St Mary's to help them reach the play-offs.<br><br>Sporting director Damien Comolli said: 'We have been following Gareth for a long time now and have been very tenacious, so we are absolutely delighted to get him here.<br><br>'He is a player of great quality and, as we always say, our aim in each window is to improve the quality of the squad.<br><br>'Gareth has great physical attributes, he is tall, good in the air and has a fantastic left foot. He is very good on set pieces, he is clever on the ball and his passing selection is excellent.<br><br>'He has the ideal combination to become a top, top player and he is only 17.'<br><br>Bale put himself in the spotlight at the start of the season with a stunning free-kick against Derby, followed up with another set-piece against Coventry three days later.<br><br>He is the youngest player to be capped by Wales and despite being deployed at full-back so far in his fledgling career, has been tipped to emulate Ryan Giggs if he is developed into a winger.<br><br>Jol is looking to strengthen the left flank of his team, so Bale could be played in defence or midfield.</div>

'It was not enough, so we turned it down.<br><br>'We have accepted the offer from England and now the club and the player must reach an agreement.'<br><br>Boateng admits he was preparing himself for a move to Spain, but concedes that Sevilla's capture of Lens midfielder Seydou Keita, coupled with Tottenham's interest, has prompted a rethink.<br><br>'We were quite advanced with Sevilla,' Boateng told the Berliner Zeitung newspaper.<br><br>'I have heard that (Seydou) Keita is joining, so I don't know if that has any effect on me.<br><br>'The Premier League is actually my dream league and now I am thinking about Tottenham.'<br><br>Boateng has made 43 first-team appearances in two years as a professional with Hertha, scoring four goals, and earned his first cap for Germany's Under-21s against England last October.</div>

The club concerned would not sell and it remains that way,' Ferguson told XFM.<br><br>'With a week to the transfer deadline, it would be impossible to get anyone else in now.'<br><br>Earlier, manager Martin Jol, whose relationship with Berbatov has been questioned, claimed he had no problem with the former Bayer Leverkusen man and had absolutely no interest in getting rid of him.<br><br>'Berbatov loves me,' said Jol.<br><br>'If he is playing well he gets all the praise and if he is not doing well I have to tell him.<br><br>'I had one approach and I said `I'd rather die than sell him.'</div>
