            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Jol hails Bale and predicts great things</strong><br><br>Gareth Bale has been tipped to emulate countryman Ryan Giggs on the wing but Tottenham boss Martin Jol feels the Wales youngster will eventually settle at left-back.<br><br>Jol has been impressed after testing Bale as a midfielder, and he believes the 18-year-old is learning the responsibilities of being a defender.<br><br>He was given a chance at left-back against Middlesbrough last week and scored again, his third in three starts.<br><br>'That was the first time that he played left-back so there will be a lot of progress,' Jol said.<br><br>'But he did well, just 18, scored three goals, made an impact against Boro and before. That is why we bought him.<br><br>'He can play as a wide player but his best position would be as a wing-back in a 3-5-2, what he does with Wales, but we play 4-4-2.<br><br>'In the win last week he showed me that he listens but he has great potential.'<br><br>Jol feels Bale is still a work in progress but the Â£10million deal Spurs agreed with Southampton in the summer looks a good investment at the moment.<br><br>It was at Southampton where Bale stepped into the limelight by scoring two free-kicks at the start of last season, and he showed his accuracy against Arsenal two weeks ago.<br><br>'I feel that was his biggest strength with Southampton, his free-kicks, but as a full-back you have to do different things and I feel that he could be one of the best in the Premier League,' said Jol.<br><br>'We've got to work on a few things as with other young players but what he did so far was good.'<br><br>Jol first spotted Bale two years ago playing for Southampton's reserves alongside Theo Walcott, with the pair earning big-money moves to north London.<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson was interested in bringing Bale to Manchester United to team up with Giggs but conceded in January that Spurs were ahead of them in the race. Bale waited until the summer before signing for Spurs.<br><br>'It was him who decided which club he was going to,' Jol said.<br><br>'If you buy players, especially the young players, you've got to play them. That is very important.<br><br>'And I promised his mum as well that he would have a few starts, and we would develop him into a good player.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Relieved Jol hails resilient Tottenham comeback</strong><br><br>Martin Jol saluted the resilience of his Tottenham players after storming back from 4-1 down against Aston Villa to avoid an 'unthinkable' defeat on the club's 125th anniversary.<br><br>The hosts were cruising when Craig Gardner scored their fourth just before the hour mark, only for Spurs to rescue a point in stoppage time.<br><br>Managers continue to be linked with Jol's position and Spurs are still in the bottom three of the Barclays Premier League but the Dutchman was pleased with the determination of his players.<br><br>'At half-time we said we have to play for he shirt and give everything - they did that,' he said.<br><br>'It was relief in the end. A win would have been better. 'I don't even want to think about it if would have lost.'<br><br>Even a draw will not stop managers getting linked with Jol's position.<br><br>'I thought about my future for the last six weeks so that's nothing new. I think about my future because I want to be better and better.<br><br>As for his position being under threat, he said: 'I don't know. It's not up to me.'<br><br>Spurs paraded their legends before the game but it was not until they fell 4-1 down that the current side gave the stars of previous eras anything to cheer about.<br><br>Jol added: 'It was a night about football. I don't want to think about negative things. It's not about results or the league, it's about the celebration.<br><br>'We spoiled that, that was awful to concede the goals like we did before.<br><br>'But my family are all in the marines and a commander never leaves his troops. If he does that he's lost. I kept my head cool and they have to do it. The only thing I can do is make substitutions.<br><br>'I'm happy for the supporters that there was a sort of celebration.<br><br>Dimitar Berbatov opened the scoring with a header from a corner before Martin Laursen embarrassed England goalkeeper Paul Robinson twice.<br><br>Robinson dropped a corner for the first and Laursen's finish went through him for the second.<br><br>'He said 'it's my mistake, I'll hold my hands up',' said Jol.<br><br>Gabriel Agbonlahor and Gardner added to the scoring before Spurs staged their comeback.<br><br>Pascal Chimbonda gave them a glimmer of hope by following-up after Jermain Defoe hit the post, then Robbie Keane tucked away a penalty after Marlon Harewood brought down Darren Bent.<br><br>Then came Younes Kaboul's stoppage-time equaliser, lashing into the roof of the net, although Defoe appeared to be offside when the ball bounced off him back to the French youngster.<br><br>Villa boss Martin O'Neill was upbeat despite the defeat, although he felt Defoe was clearly offside in the build-up to Kaboul's dramatic leveller.<br><br>'Defoe was about offside about 15 times in the last minute,' he joked. 'The linesman has missed it, he can only play what he sees.'<br><br>Even at 4-1, O'Neill never felt the job was done.<br><br>'I would never think it's all over,' he said. 'We knew Tottenham would throw absolutely everything, with nothing to lose.<br><br>'At 4-2, it seemed that we saw off that part of the storm but I've seen it happen before.<br><br>'Naturally, we're disappointed. We could have gone fifth and it was a nice incentive but I hope we learn from it. I'm upbeat but disappointed for the travelling fans.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Out of favour Defoe lends Jol support</strong><br><br>Jermain Defoe has been struggling for a run of games in the Tottenham starting XI but even he has come out in support of boss Martin Jol.<br><br>Jol's position has been subject to intense scrutiny during Spurs' dismal start to the season and it does not get any easier with a trip to face Liverpool on Sunday.<br><br>It was suggested after the defeat to Arsenal three weeks ago that Jol had until the international break to save his job, and Spurs have been unbeaten since with just the Premier League trip to Anfield to go.<br><br>Defoe said: 'Everyone is behind the manager. Everyone.<br><br>'People realise what the manager has done for the football club. It's been amazing. Since he came to the club, he has done a great job, so why would anyone want to change this?<br><br>'At the end of the day, it is obviously up to the players to perform. Speak to any of the players and we all believe he should stay.'<br><br>Spurs want to progress to the next level after consecutive fifth-placed finishes but their season started with defeats to Sunderland and Everton in the opening week.<br><br>The club's infamous meeting with Sevilla coach Juande Ramos led to Jol's position looking increasingly insecure, although Ramos appears set to stay in Spain for the time being.<br><br>Defoe has also been involved in the mess at White Hart Lane, with Jol accused of failing to keep the England striker happy, while chairman Daniel Levy wants the player to sign a new contract to avoid losing him for nothing at the end of next season.<br><br>'Obviously I want to play,' Defoe added. 'It's not just the forwards like me and Darren (Bent). It's the other players as well who cannot get into the team, but that's natural.<br><br>'We want to get into the Champions League. We want to make that happen and I still think we can do it.'<br><br>Spurs head into the weekend in the bottom three of the Premier League and looking for just their second league win of the season.<br><br>'It's a massive game,' Defoe added. 'We need the points. We are too good to be in this position.<br><br>'Sometimes, it happens in football. We have to move on, there are a lot of games to be played and I think we will be all right.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Jol demands judgement be reseved until May</strong><br><br>Martin Jol proved bookmakers wrong by remaining as Tottenham manager this far into the campaign - and he believes he can only be judged at the end of the season.<br><br>The Dutchman has defied the odds to keep his job at White Hart Lane, although they will stay in the bottom three of the Premier League if they do not pick up a point or more at Newcastle tomorrow.<br><br>Spurs appeared set to change their manager after the infamous meeting with Juande Ramos, then after defeat to Arsenal it was widely reported Jol's position would be reviewed during the international break.<br><br>They have not been defeated since their rivals beat them, and it is Jose Mourinho and Sammy Lee who have been the managerial casualties in the top flight so far. The international break last week passed with Jol doing his usual work at Spurs Lodge.<br><br>'Everybody was wrong,' said Jol. 'I'm not someone who doubts. It's confidence but it's to do with what happened in the past - the results.<br><br>'We are in the last 16 of the Carling Cup, we are in the UEFA Cup and there are a lot of clubs who would like to do the same.'<br><br>He added: 'There are peaks and troughs, one day you are marvellous the next day look at Robbie Keane (getting criticised) with Ireland, look at Steve McClaren, look at me.'<br><br>Jol's confidence stems from consecutive top-five finishes. He feels Spurs are an example to teams like Newcastle.<br><br>Sam Allardyce has been brought to St James' Park from Bolton to get the club back in Europe, which is why Jol disagrees with comparing the two clubs.<br><br>'We had European football for the last two years and they didn't,' Jol said. 'Why would be in the same boat? It would be fantastic for them if they were in the first six or seven, playing European football next season would be a good achievement for them.<br><br>'We already did that twice so it's different. We are in the group stages of the UEFA Cup and they would love to do that as well.'<br><br>Jol added: 'It's always about the end of the season. We finished above all the other teams including Bolton.<br><br>'The only conclusion you can make over the last couple of years is that teams like Aston Villa, Manchester City - they would be delighted to be in the top six.'<br><br>Allardyce had a decent record against Spurs when he was at Bolton, but Jol feels there is now the burden of expectation from a club starved of success.<br><br>'Sam always seems to create strong teams, and at Newcastle you have the resources as well,' Jol said. 'You have to live up to the expectations. He's capable of doing that.<br><br>'They always seem to have good players but to attract the players they have got, you need success.<br><br>'You see their strikeforce - (Obafemi) Martins is awesome, (Mark) Viduka is one of the most skilful number nines in the league, (Alan) Smith is suspended but the best finisher is still probably Michael Owen.<br><br>'Their home form is good, they did well and have a game in hand as well. They need to win their home games and they are pretty strong.'<br><br>Striker Dimitar Berbatov took a knock during international week but Jol is hopeful the Bulgaria striker will be fit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Ramos wants Tottenham to win with 'panache'</strong><br><br>Juande Ramos' opening match at Tottenham ended in a stuttering victory over Blackpool - but the new head coach wants to win with 'panache' when they have turned the corner.<br><br>Goals from Robbie Keane and Pascal Chimbonda earned a 2-0 win and a place in the Carling Cup quarter-finals last night, ensuring Ramos got off to a winning start at White Hart Lane.<br><br>However, it was hardly a convincing performance against Championship opposition and Ramos has demanded improvement throughout his team, after which he will impose his own style on the side.<br><br>'Tottenham people desire a distinctive style of football and winning alone is not enough,' he wrote in his first programme notes. 'It must be achieved with a certain panache.<br><br>'This is one of the fundamental reasons why I chose to come here because this is also something I desire from my team.'<br><br>The first task for Ramos is getting out of the bottom three of the Premier League by beating Middlesbrough at the weekend.<br><br>Ramos saw enough against Blackpool to encourage him but his defenders were nervous and prone to panic when the visitors put the ball in the penalty area.<br><br>'The team has to improve in all areas, attack and defence, but this is a squad of great professionals,' Ramos said. 'I hope that the team improves quickly but, with so many competitions going on at the same time, it's a tough call.'<br><br>Blackpool made the early running and David Fox hit the side-netting when he was sent through following mistake by Younes Kaboul.<br><br>Keane opened the scoring in the 18th minute - it was a route-one goal but his delicate finish had 'panache' about it. The Republic of Ireland striker had scored the first goal under Martin Jol and repeated the trick following the Dutchman's departure and Ramos' appointment.<br><br>Blackpool stayed in the game and rattled Spurs after the break, Gary Taylor-Fletcher hitting the crossbar with a header then forcing a stunning save from Paul Robinson.<br><br>'That was the difference,' said Blackpool boss Simon Grayson. 'We had opportunities to get in front or back into the game, but we couldn't take them.<br><br>'We gave a good account of ourselves, but they took their chances and we didn't.'<br><br>Chimbonda sealed the win with a header from Steed Malbranque's corner just before the hour mark, giving Ramos time to look at his substitutes.<br><br>Kaboul was subbed after his series of mistakes, while Dimitar Berbatov looked his usual moody self when he was taken off. Keane got a standing ovation and embraced the new manager.<br><br>'The most important thing here was the victory, the result,' said Ramos. 'With this result, we can look forward to the next round.<br><br>'On the positive side,the team showed great willing to play this evening. They fought very hard, physically very hard, as the victory just three days after their last game.<br><br>'On the negative side, the opportunities they gave to Blackpool.'</div>

Of course as a club you want to win competitions and that's what the management team will be focused on.<br><br>'I had dinner with them on Tuesday night and they know exactly what they are going to do, they had a real sense of purpose.<br><br>'For them to get themselves established is going to need weeks and months but Daniel and the rest of the board are very confident.'<br><br>Jol was sacked in controversial circumstances. First board members - not including Mills, a non-executive director - were pictured meeting Ramos in a Seville hotel, leading to accusations they had undermined the Dutchman.<br><br>Then, Jol finally got the sack some weeks later immediately after the UEFA Cup defeat by Getafe but not before news of his dismissal had spread through the crowd first.<br><br>Mills admitted: 'Of course it could have been handled better but when you are dealing with change in any organisation it is complex and often painful.<br><br>'I'm sure everyone regrets the media coverage we have had for the last couple of months but you just do not make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.<br><br>'We needed to move on as a club, that's now behind us.'</div>
