            <div class='col-md body'>Portsmouth have beaten Bolton Wanderers to the signing of Zambia international striker Collins Mbesuma on a three-year deal, subject to a work permit.<br>Mbesuma is rated as one of the hottest properties in African football, with Real Madrid, Chelsea and Aston Villa among other clubs linked to the 21-year-old.<br><br>Mbesuma was close to joining Bolton but boss Sam Allardyce wanted a few days to look at the Zambian, who last season scored 35 goals for South African champions Kaizer Chiefs.<br><br>The playerÂ’s agent, Mike Makab, told PortsmouthÂ’s official website, www.pompeyfc.co.uk: Â“There were no hard feelings with Bolton and the manager was great - but they just wanted to look at Collins for a three or four days.<br><br>Â“There was enough interest from other clubs for Collins however and what with his record and the DVDs that they had there was enough of his talent on show to simply do a deal.<br><br>Â“I think Pompey's gain will be a few other clubs' loss.Â”<br><br>The striker is currently in the country on a visa and goes back to Zambia tomorrow, although the club hope he will be back with them early next week.<br><br>When he is back, Pompey will apply for the work permit and if that is granted the player will be applying for permission for his family to come to England.<br><br>The deal for Mbesuma goes some way to addressing the need to replace Aiyegbeni Yakubu, Pompey's top scorer for the past two seasons who recently completed a Â£7.5million move to Middlesbrough.<br><br>Manager Alain Perrin completed a deal for former Liverpool defender Gregory Vignal earlier on Tuesday.<br><br>Vignal has signed a two-year deal at Fratton Park and joins Newcastle pair Laurent Robert and Andy O'Brien and Colombian midfielder John Viafara among Perrin's new captures.<br><br>Vignal arrives on a free transfer but Liverpool, who loaned him last season to Scottish champions Rangers, are likely to be due a payment if the left-back makes an agreed number of Premiership appearances. - premierleague.com<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Portsmouth are set to complete the signing of Gregory Vignal after agreeing terms with the French defender.<br>Vignal will sign a two-year contract after passing a medical on Monday.<br><br>The 23-year-old utility player was on loan at Rangers last season from Liverpool, who released him earlier this summer.<br><br>The Scottish champions were keen to retain him permanently but Vignal rejected their offer in favour of a return to England with Pompey.<br><br>Chairman Milan Mandaric told the clubÂ’s official website, www.pompeyfc.co.uk: Â“We are very pleased that another quality signing is set to join the club and who can be an asset to us in a number of positions.<br><br>Â“He has shown his worth at Rangers last season and the competition for places at Pompey will be that much healthier.Â”<br><br>Vignal, who can play at full-back or in midfield, cost Liverpool Â£500,000 from Montpellier but was also sent on loan to Espanyol and Rennes before a season-long loan at Ibrox.<br><br>Portsmouth chief executive Peter Storrie said: Â“Gregory is a versatile player who can play in a number of positions.<br><br>Â“When his chance came at Rangers he showed what a fine all-round player he is and though he is a defender he likes to get forward.<br><br>Â“He is the sort of player who will fit in well.Â”<br></div>
