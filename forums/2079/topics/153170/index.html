            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Dynamic Dinamo maul Everton</strong><br>Thursday, 15 September 2005<br><br>After running Villarreal CF so close in the final UEFA Champions League qualifying round, Everton FC's hopes of progressing in the UEFA Cup also appear to be over after they were humbled 5-1 by FC Dinamo Bucuresti in Romania.<br><br>Yobo effort<br>Everton were actually the more threatening side in the early stages, but fell apart later and conceded four goals in the second half. Joseph Yobo almost put the English side ahead after 18 minutes when he skipped passed Ianis Zicu and rattled in a shot which Uladzimir Hayeu did well to turn around the post. A swift counterattack in the 27th minute put paid to the visitors' early endeavour, though, as Claudiu Niculescu bundled the ball over the line from Florentin Petre's flick.<br><br>Emphatic response<br>Everton's response was emphatic - drawing level three minutes later with what at the time looked to be a priceless away goal as Yobo headed Simon Davies' cross down and into the goal to make it 1-1. Dinamo remained full of running and Nigel Martyn did well to claw away a delicate chip from Zicu, although the Everton goalkeeper could do little to deny a rampant home team after the break.<br><br>Stunning second<br>The Romanian side regained the lead with a stunning second in the 52nd minute, Zicu expertly flicking the ball across Martyn and into the net from Niculescu's superb curling cross from the left. Zicu then picked out substitute Florin Bratu and he burst past Yobo only for Martyn to clear with his feet. Dinamo added a third in the 71st minute with a superb strike from Petre as the Merseyside club began to buckle under a wave of attacks.<br><br>Group stage beckons<br>Everton's problems increased in the 75th minute when Dinamo struck yet another spectacular goal, Bratu beating Martyn with an unstoppable shot. The same player completed the scoring on the stroke of full time to leave Dinamo on the cusp of a place in the group stage, and Everton facing further disappointment.<br><br>Â©Press Association 2001-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Middlesbrough survive Xanthi scare</strong><br>Thursday, 15 September 2005<br>by Andrew Haslam<br>from Riverside stadium<br><br>Goals in each half from George Boateng and Mark Viduka proved enough to give Middlesbrough FC a hard-earned win against Xanthi FC in the UEFA Cup first round in a closely-fought encounter.<br><br>Even encounter<br>Middlesbrough reached the last 32 of the competition on their European debut last season and controlled much of the game tonight, although the visitors also created a number of presentable opportunities. In the event, however, it was the home side who took their chances to leave themselves well-placed ahead of the return fixture at the Xanthis stadium in a fortnight.<br><br>Big names rested<br>Lacking Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Gaizka Mendieta and Stewart Downing through injury and with Gareth Southgate, Franck Queudrue and Yakubu Ayegbeni all on the bench, it was perhaps little surprise that the home side found it hard to establish a rhythm in the early stages. Indeed, with both teams making only their second UEFA Cup appearances, neither settled quickly although Massimo Maccarone might have put Middlesbrough in front, pouncing on Ioannis Papadimitriou's short back-pass and rounding goalkeeper Petr PiÂžanowski only to take the ball out of play.<br><br>Boateng opener<br>With former Middlesbrough man Emerson prompting from midfield, although too deep to cause the home team genuine concern, the visitors seemed content to stifle their opponents. The gameplan worked initially, but came unstuck two minutes before the half-hour mark as the Greek side fell behind. Viduka, who had increasingly dropped deeper in search of possession, created the initial chance with a clever lobbed pass that set Maccarone clear and, although PiÂžanowski blocked the striker's shot, Boateng was on hand to tuck the rebound into the unguarded net.<br><br>Middlesbrough threat<br>Both Maccarone and Adam Johnson had half-chances as the Premiership team threatened to take command. That impression was reinforced in the opening seconds of the second period as Boateng had an effort blocked, but instead Xanthi Â– who conceded four goals at S.S. Lazio in the 2002/03 UEFA Cup first round, their only other away game in the competition Â– rallied strongly.<br><br>Clinching second<br>Both Stavros Labriakos and Levan Maghradze missed the target having cleverly worked space in front of goal before Maghradze raced away down the right to prod a shot that Mark Schwarzer gathered at the second attempt. The Greek team were made to regret those misses with seven minutes left, Viduka's left-foot shot deflecting off Jacques Paviot and looping into the corner of the net to double the English side's advantage.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Buga strike floors Feyenoord</strong><br>Thursday, 29 September 2005<br><br>AFC Rapid Bucharesti booked their place in the group stages of the UEFA Cup with a final 2-1 aggregate win against Feyenoord. Mugurel Buga was the hero, heading the decisive goal after 12 minutes of the second leg in the Romanian capital.<br><br>Wasteful Dutch<br>Rapid put themselves in a strong position with a 1-1 draw in the Netherlands two weeks ago and proved too organised for Feyenoord on home soil. Erwin Koeman's side enjoyed the lion's share of possession at the Giulesti stadium but were continually wasteful in the final third. Rapid held on to seal a superb 1-0 win on the night and advance past a team who currently sit top of the Eredivisie.<br><br>Buga header<br>Netherlands striker Dirk Kuijt signalled the visitors' intentions with a stinging early drive which sailed over the bar from 20 metres as Feyenoord dominated. But just 12 minutes into the game Buga stopped the visitors in their tracks, finding enough space in the area to plant his header past goalkeeper Patrick Lodewijks.<br><br>Inspired Coman<br>Shinji Ono responded almost immediately for the Dutch side but could find no way past an inspired Danut Coman in the Rapid goal. Kuijt and Ono were the home side's chief tormentors during a one-sided first half but they failed to match neat build-up play with the killer touch, and Coman produced a string of fine stops.<br><br>Kuijt miss<br>Buga, Valentin Badoi and Nicolae Constantin had chances to extend the home side's lead as Feyenoord struggled to get going after the break. Kuijt squandered a headed chance eight minutes from time, and when Coman held Romeo Castelen's late strike the Romanian side knew they were going through.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sampdoria grateful for Gasbarroni goal</strong><br>Thursday, 29 September 2005<br><br>UC Sampdoria made sure of their place in the group stage of the UEFA Cup with a narrow win against VitÃ³ria FC that completed a 2-1 aggregate victory.<br><br>Sampdoria intent<br>Andrea Gasbarroni got the decisive goal in the ninth minute, but the home side were made to work for their win in the face of a determined SetÃºbal display. With the tie all square at 1-1 after the first leg, a goalless draw would have ensured Sampdoria's progress, but Walter Novellino's side nevertheless attacked from the outset.<br><br>Gasbarroni goal<br>Their early pressure paid off when Gasbarroni's well-taken volley flew into the top corner after nine minutes. The Sampdoria No7 settled himself well before connecting sweetly with Aimo Diana's cross, giving goalkeeper Moretto no chance. However, having broken through so early the home side then seemed to invite pressure and SetÃºbal duly obliged as Dias Auri and Janicio began to link up to good effect on the right.<br><br>Nandinho misfortune<br>The visitors knew the importance of an away goal and their work began to pay off when the Portuguese side's first opportunity fell to Bruno Ribeiro on 37 minutes, but his attempt was gathered easily by Francesco Antonioli in the Sampdoria goal. Nandinho's curling free-kick then came back off the post and Oumar Tchomogo's effort from the rebound was deflected for a corner.<br><br>Fonte denied<br>The visitors continued to take the game to the home side and another gilt-edged chance went begging when JosÃ© Fonte's close-range effort was instinctively parried by Antonioli. Substitute Francesco Flachi quickly found his feet following his half-time introduction and almost grabbed a second with his first touch only to be denied by Moretto, but Sampdoria carefully played out the closing stages knowing their path to the group stage was clear.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Fernandez sees OM mature</strong><br>Friday, 21 October 2005<br>by Christian ChÃ¢telet<br>from Paris<br><br>With Paris Saint-Germain FC and AJ Auxerre having succumbed to respective 2-0 and 4-0 losses at the Dinamo stadium last season, Olympique de Marseille restored French pride in Russia as they defeated the UEFA Cup holders PFC CSKA Moskva 2-0 in their opening Group F fixture.<br><br>Tactical switch<br>The victory, which also helped to erase memories of Marseille's 3-0 1999 UEFA Cup final loss to AS Roma in the Russian capital, owed much to the tinkering of coach Jean Fernandez, who deployed Lorik Cana in central defence and Habib Beye in midfield when the reverse usually applies. It was a switch which worked wonders, as the Albanian and Senegalese settled seamlessly into their roles to lay the foundations for a fine success.<br><br>Great start<br>Cana, part of the PSG team beaten by CSKA in the UEFA Champions League last season, said beforehand that "playing this tie in Moscow rather than Marseille suits our tactics better", and he was not wrong. Sabri Lamouchi (23) and Mamadou Niang (3<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> scored the goals, leaving coach Fernandez to reflect: "We played a good first half, creating many opportunities. Players were aware that a good result here could set us up to win the group."<br><br>On top<br>The pool winners will play a third-placed team from another group, and Marseille are already leading the way after FC Dinamo Bucuresti and SC Heerenveen drew 0-0, while PFC Levski Sofia sat out the opening round of matches. Marseille are also bang in form, having recovered from an inauspicious start which saw them propping up Ligue 1 in September to win six of their last eight games. "A team is forming," said Fernandez. "We're not a good team yet but we're certainly improving."<br><br>Penalty save<br>CSKA coach Valeri Gazzaev was not so enthusiastic, dismissing the southern French side as "a mid-table team who were saved by Fabien Barthez". Indeed, Le Divin Chauve - the divine bald - was the star performer on only his second game back from a six-month ban for spitting at a referee, notably when denying Sergei Ignashevich from the penalty spot in the 48th minute. "That saved us a lot of pressure for the rest of the game," said Fernandez.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005. All rights reserved.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>BeÂºiktaÂº denied by Borgetti</strong><br>Thursday, 20 October 2005<br><br>BeÂºiktaÂº JK were held to a 1-1 draw by English visitors Bolton Wanderers FC as Jared Borgetti cancelled out a strike of equal brilliance from the Turkish side's Brazilian forward Ailton.<br><br>Seven changes<br>With Bolton having been humbled 5-1 at Premiership leaders Chelsea FC on Saturday, manager Sam Allardyce responded by making seven changes. One of those was the introduction of Borgetti, the Mexican who scored his first UEFA Cup Group H goal in the 29th minute with a rasping finish from El-Hadji Diouf's cross. The portly Ailton had broken the deadlock on seven minutes with an exquisite flicked finish with the outside of his left boot.<br><br>Unstoppable shot<br>The opener arrived after Tal Ben Haim's poor pass put Joey O'Brien under pressure and the Bolton defender lost possession to TÃ¼mer Metin. The BeÂºiktaÂº midfield player immediately released Ailton and the Brazilian thumped an unstoppable shot into the top corner beyond goalkeeper Ian Walker. The visitors, playing in their first UEFA Cup campaign, refused to buckle and were soon on the attack in search of an immediate leveller.<br><br>Fadiga effort<br>They almost worked a chance from a set-piece in the 15th minute. Khalilou Fadiga, making his first start of the season, tried to pick up Radhi Jaidi at the back post but goalkeeper Ã“scar CÃ³rdoba made the interception. Senegalese midfielder Fadiga also went close to pulling them level in the 20th minute with a powerful 18-metre effort which Colombian CÃ³rdoba did well to tip over the top.<br><br>Great cross<br>Bolton restored parity just before the half-hour as Diouf teased his way into the right-hand side of the area and whipped in a low cross which deceived the home defence but not Borgetti who raced in at the far post and drilled a superb shot inside the near post. From then on the game ebbed and flowed, with Ibrahim Akin firing a shot just over the crossbar soon after the interval.<br><br>Kleberson chance<br>Hidetoshi Nakata then broke clear for Bolton and tried to pick out Borgetti, only to overhit his pass. Fadiga had to be alert to block Ibrahim's shot before Diouf saw a 70th-minute effort wiped out for offside. Subsequent chances were all of the half variety, although another of BeÂºiktaÂº's Brazilians, Kleberson, did waste the best of them when in space inside the area a minute from time.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Viduka double downs Dnipro</strong><br>Thursday, 3 November 2005<br>by Andrew Haslam<br>from Riverside stadium<br><br>Mark Viduka scored a swift double early in the second half to add to Yakubu Ayegbeni's first-half strike and help Middlesbrough FC record a second successive victory in UEFA Cup Group D at the expense of FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk.<br><br>Decisive spell<br>The home side initially struggled to break down a disciplined Dnipro defence, but never looked back after Yakubu opened the scoring following an incisive move shortly before the interval. Viduka made certain of the points in the early stages of the second period, doubling the lead with a powerful strike and then sweeping in a third moments later.<br><br>Formation retained<br>Middlesbrough manager Steve McClaren kept faith with the 3-5-2 formation that had proved so effective in Saturday's 4-1 defeat of Manchester United FC although he opted to introduce Doriva, James Morrison and Viduka. Dnipro coach Vadim Tishenko was able to welcome back Serhiy Nazarenko after a minor injury, although fellow midfielder Konstyantyn Kravchenko was only fit enough for the bench.<br><br>Slick opener<br>Given that the visitors kicked off without a recognised striker in their lineup, it was perhaps no surprise that Middlesbrough made the early running, Gaizka Mendieta twice and Franck Queudrue trying their luck from range. With both teams packing the midfield, space was at a premium, but the English side finally found a way through nine minutes before half-time as Yakubu cut in from the left and played a slick one-two with Mendieta before slotting a low shot past Artem Kusliy at his near post. Mendieta almost added a swift second, but this time the Dnipro goalkeeper beat out his swerving attempt.<br><br>Viduka double<br>Middlesbrough picked up where they had left off as the second half got under way, and trebled their advantage within eleven minutes. Mendieta was again involved in the second as he picked up possession on the left and, althoug he was tackled, the loose ball rolled to Viduka. A swift turn gave the Australian space on the edge of the area, and he duly found the top corner with a thumping shot. James Morrison then expertly controlled a high ball and, although Kusliy kept out his powerful strike, the Dnipro goalkeeper was helpless as the rebound drop perfectly for Viduka to roll into the unguarded net.<br><br>AZ engagement<br>With the win assured, Middlesbrough eased off but had already done enough to secure first place in the section having defeated Grasshopper-Club on Matchday 1. The English side next travel to AZ Alkmaar on 30 November when Dnipro, still without a point, face PFC Litex Lovech.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005. All rights reserved.<br></div>

Denmark striker Jon Dahl Tomasson produced the next shot on goal but his effort from outside the area went wide of the post.<br><br>Fernandinho strikes<br>Tiffert and Danijel Ljuboja both had attempts on goal as the German side established a firm foothold in the game but neither forced a save from Shutkov. The away team then took an unexpected lead on the half-hour, Fernandinho getting on the end of a Darijo Srna cross and placing his header past Stuttgart goalkeeper Dirk Heinen.<br><br>Attacking intent<br>Stuttgart coach Giovanni Trapattoni signalled his intent by bringing on striker Cacau at the interval for the more defence-minded Christian Gentner, although they struggled to fashion any meaningful opportunities.

The same player gave JÃ¤Ã¤skelÃ¤inen an even sterner test after 57 minutes, drawing a fine save from the goalkeeper with a fierce shot.<br><br>Under pressure<br>As Bolton came under pressure, Diouf came on for Mexican srtriker Jared Borgetti. The visitors looked more lively, with Stylianos Giannakopoulos receiving a fine ball from Okocha after 76 minutes only to see his shot blocked by diving GuimarÃ£es goalkeeper Paiva.<br><br>Grandstand finish<br>However, when Saganowski ghosted beyond the last defender to head Targino's floated cross from the left past the stranded JÃ¤Ã¤skelÃ¤inen it seemed to be all over for Bolton. But it was Vaz TÃ©, returning to his home country, who was to have the final say as his fine finish rescued a point for the visitors.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005. All rights reserved.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Monaco make positive strides</strong><br>Thursday, 24 November 2005<br><br>AS Monaco FC got their Group A campaign back on track as a goal at the end of each half proved enough to defeat ten-man Hamburger SV at the Stade Louis II to give the French side their first UEFA Cup points of the season.<br><br>Adebayor strike<br>Having lost their opening Group A fixture at Viking FK on Matchday 1, it was vital Monaco picked up three points from their first home match in the section, and Togolese striker Emmanuel Adebayor got the Ligue 1 outfit on their way with the opening goal a minute before half-time. Hamburg pressed for an equaliser in the second period, but had defender Khalid Boulahrouz sent off in the final minute before substitute Olivier Veigneau rounded off an impressive victory.<br><br>Midfield tussle<br>The first effort on goal took only five minutes to arrive, Monaco midfielder Olivier Sorlin striking a long-range effort that flew past the post. Jaroslav PlaÂšil also tried his luck from distance soon after, but Stefan WÃ¤chter remained untroubled in the Hamburg goal and enjoyed a restful opening half-hour as both teams sought to close down any space in a congested midfield.<br><br>Gradual pressure<br>Their determination to give nothing away resulted in a spate of free-kicks but it was not until David JarolÃ­m tested Monaco goalkeeper Guillaume Warmuz on 33 minutes that they were fully exploited. It was the home side that gradually began to take the initiative though, and after a patient build-up their pressure told just before half-time when Camel Meriem teed up Adebayor to rifle in.<br><br>Veigneau joy<br>The Togolese striker almost doubled the advantage early in the second half, but WÃ¤chter was equal to his shot from the edge of the box. At the other end, Boulahrouz had a shot blocked and his frustration came to a head in added time when he was dismissed for a foul on Warmuz. Veigneau then turned in Olivier Sorlin's pass to secure the victory that lifts his side off the foot of Group A while despite the defeat Hamburg remain top on six points.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Maoulida moves Monaco to brink</strong><br>Wednesday, 30 November 2005<br><br>Toifilou Maoulida scored twice as AS Monaco FC sidled alongside Hamburger SV at the Group A summit after an impressive 2-0 win at SK Slavia Praha, which leaves them on the brink of a place in the UEFA Cup knockout rounds.<br><br>Hard-fought victory<br>The French striker broke the deadlock after just eleven minutes, slotting in from ten metres after a rapid counterattack led by Patrice Evra. Monaco relinquished a one-goal lead to Olympique de Marseille at the weekend, and came under intense scrutiny again in the Czech capital as Slavia surged forward in search of an equaliser. But Maoulida clinched a hard-fought victory with a clinical finish 19 minutes from time.<br><br>Slavia surge<br>The three points leave the Ligue 1 outfit at the top of the section with one match remaining and should they avoid a heavy defeat by PFC CSKA Sofia on Matchday 5, they will be assured of qualification. But the result looked improbable as the home side made a blistering start at the Evzena RoÂšickÃ©ho stadium. Pavel FoÃ¸t threatened as early as the second minute, although after weathering the early storm the visitors hit back in some style through Maoulida.<br><br>Missed headers<br>Slavia immediately went in search of an equaliser, with TomÃ¡Âš HrdliÃ¨ka heading LukÃ¡Âš JarolÃ­m's cross just over. Martin Latka and DuÂšan ÂŠvento had further opportunities but both spurned headers from close range as the home side's aerial prowess began to tell. The lively JarolÃ­m then forced a sharp save from Guillaume Warmuz but just as a goal looked likely for the Czech outfit, Monaco struck at the other end.<br><br>Tough task<br>Nicolas Maurice-Belay found space on the left and slid a pass into the path of Maoulida, who rifled in to calm coach Francesco Guidolin's nerves. It will be a bitter loss for Slavia, who now need to win their last game against Bundesliga high-fliers Hamburg on 15 December to be assured of a coveted top-three spot in Group A.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

There was still time for Antonio Cassano to miss a penalty for injury-blighted Roma, for whom a draw would have been enough to ensure their progress.<br><br>Last-day pressure<br>Roma may now need to win their final Group E game at home against FC Basel 1893 to ensure their place in the last 32. Crvena Zvezda, meanwhile, can potentially complete a remarkable comeback after losing both of their opening group stage games with a win at already-qualified RC Strasbourg in their final group game.<br><br>Nonda strikes<br>ÂŽigiÃ¦ set the tone for what eventually became a frantic first half when he tried to lob Gianluca Curci in the opening exchanges. Nenad KovaceviÃ¦ drilled wide from range but the action quietened down until the rejuvenated Cassano fed Nonda, who swept the ball home left-footed to put Roma ahead.<br><br>ÂŽigiÃ¦ dominant<br>Alberto Aquilani then saw his 25-metre effort blocked but otherwise it was all Crvena Zvezda and ÂŽigiÃ¦ for the rest of the half. The giant striker had shot straight at Curci, and then forced an outstanding stop from the keeper, who tipped his strike round the post following Aleksandar LukoviÃ¦'s corner.<br><br>Equalising goal<br>Ardian Djokaj blazed another LukoviÃ¦ corner over the bar but the hosts finally got the goal they deserved when ÂŽigiÃ¦ swept in BoÂško JankoviÃ¦'s left-wing cross. KovaceviÃ¦ twice came close to putting Crvena Zvezda ahead, but his long-range attempt and 20-metre free-kick were both off-target.<br><br>Ragged Roma<br>Although without injured strikers Francesco Totti and Vincenzo Montella, Roma nevertheless came out with much more purpose in the second half, Daniele De Rossi seeing his shot blocked before Cassano volleyed Aquilani's cross straight at Vladimir StojkoviÃ¦. Houssine Kharja then brought the best out of the goalkeeper with a free-kick before his corner was met by Philippe Mexes who volleyed wide from six metres.<br><br>Dramatic finale<br>But suddenly Crvena Zvezda were on the offensive and Dragan MladenoviÃ¦ missed twice before feeding PuroviÃ¦, who unleashed a brilliant strike that flew into the top corner. ÂŽigiÃ¦ looked to have put the game beyond Roma when he scored from similar range but there was still time for Cassano to see his penalty saved by StojkoviÃ¦ after Nonda had been brought down.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Bolton draw home comfort</strong><br>Wednesday, 14 December 2005<br>by Tim Dykes<br><br>Sevilla FC striker Adriano Correia cancelled out Bruno N'gotty's opener to deny Bolton Wanderers FC top spot in UEFA Cup Group H - but a share of the spoils was nevertheless enough for the English side to join the visitors in the Round of 32.<br><br>Eight changes<br>Sevilla, making their first competitive appearance in England, showed eight changes from the side which lost 2-1 against Primera DivisiÃ³n front-runners FC Barcelona at the weekend. And with the visitors already safely through to the last 32 and Bolton needing only a point to secure their place, it was perhaps no surprise that the game began slowly.<br><br>Early pressure<br>The early chances all fell Bolton's way, each one sailing over the crossbar. El Hadji Diouf tried his luck first, cutting in from the right flank and ghosting past two defenders on eight minutes, but neither he nor Radhi Jaidi seven minutes later were able to hit the target. Jay-Jay Okocha deserved more after a neat dummy on the edge of the Sevilla area, but his goalbound toe-poke was deflected over.<br><br>Woodwork struck<br>Diouf had a penalty appeal turned down after an untidy challenge from Sevilla debutant JosÃ© Angel Crespo Rincon but the visitors were demonstrating why they boast the meanest defensive record in the Primera DivisiÃ³n and could easily have gone ahead before half-time. Luis Fabiano, the Sevilla striker with only one goal from his last 27 appearances, clipped the ball over the head of Tal Ben Haim but saw his rasping drive rebound off the foot of the far post.<br><br>Quick reply<br>Bolton manager Sam Allardyce opted to use all three of his substitutions early and the tactic seemed to have paid off when Khalilou Fadiga's corner dropped to replacement N'gotty, who thrashed it into the Sevilla net from close range to give the home side a 65th-minute lead. But it took Sevilla just nine minutes to restore parity, Adriano bursting into the Bolton area before tucking an angled finish past Ian Walker.<br><br>Nakata suspension<br>Hidetoshi Nakata, whose first-half booking will rule him out of Bolton's Round of 32 first leg, missed a chance to pinch all three points five minutes from time when he was crowded out eight metres from goal. Both sides, however, already looked content with the point that ensured both progressed to February's knockout stages.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005. All rights reserved.<br></div>
