            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Lethal Lyon dismantle Madrid</strong><br>Tuesday, 13 September 2005<br>by Matthew Spiro<br>from Stade Gerland<br><br>Olympique Lyonnais started their UEFA Champions League campaign in superb fashion as an impressive first-half display earned a 3-0 Group F success against Real Madrid CF.<br><br>Devastating display<br>Quarter-finalists for the last two years, Lyon have high hopes of going even further this season, and on the basis of this performance they have every reason to feel optimistic. GÃ©rard Houllier's team showed great skill and determination, sealing the victory with three goals in a devastating first 45 minutes. John Carew opened the scoring before strikes from Juninho Pernambucano and Sylvain Wiltord took the game away from Madrid, who also suffered a 3-0 reverse at Bayer 04 Leverkusen on Matchday 1 last term.<br><br>Beckham boost<br>Lyon centre-half Cris passed a late fitness test to take his place alongside Claudio CaÃ§apa at the back, while Tiago was preferred to BenoÃ®t Pedretti in midfield. Carew began as a lone forward, flanked by Wiltord and Florent Malouda. The visitors also received a fitness boost, with David Beckham recovering from a thigh problem. Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldo were missing through injury and suspension respectively, so Julio CÃ©sar Baptista stepped into the playmaker role behind strikers RaÃºl GonzÃ¡lez and Robinho.<br><br>Frenetic pace<br>The match kicked off at a frantic pace and Lyon were quickly on the attack, Carew running at the Madrid defence before seeing his shot blocked by IvÃ¡n Helguera. The Spanish side were soon in the game, however, and twice threatened from free-kicks in the opening eight minutes. While the first effort from Beckham grazed GrÃ©gory Coupet's right-hand post, Roberto Carlos's strike then flashed slightly wider of the same upright.<br><br>Carew breakthrough<br>As Madrid controlled possession, Lyon seemed content to defend in numbers and pick their moment to counterattack. Roberto Carlos saw another long-range attempt well saved by Coupet, but when the breakthrough came, it was at the other end. Set-piece specialist Juninho curled a wicked free-kick towards goal and Carew's glancing header was enough to beat Iker Casillas, who could only push the ball into the roof of the net.<br><br>Deadly Juninho<br>Madrid almost silenced the stadium moments later as Baptista deflected a Roberto Carlos shot on to the post, then RaÃºl headed the rebound straight at Coupet. Before the visitors had time for regret, they were two down. Again Juninho did the damage, this time the Brazilian firing a free-kick directly into Casillas's bottom right-hand corner on 26 minutes.<br><br>Rampant Lyon<br>Lyon were rampant and scored a third five minutes later, as Wiltord exchanged passes with Anthony RÃ©veillÃ¨re on the right before volleying emphatically past Casillas. The French champions should have extended their lead further but Juninho, after being fouled in the area by MÃ­chel Salgado, saw his spot-kick blocked by Casillas. Madrid came close to pulling a goal back before half-time through Robinho, but Coupet produced an exceptional stop to tip the Brazilian's low shot wide.<br><br>Coupet called upon<br>Madrid started the second period with a more offensive formation, as Baptista moved into attack and Roberto Carlos and Salgado switched to wing-backs. Coupet was soon in the thick of the action, catching Baptista's volley, then parrying Roberto Carlos's stinging drive. The France custodian saved his team again on the hour, blocking RaÃºl's attempt after the striker had been played through by Robinho.<br><br>Stout defending<br>Coupet's assurance seemed to filter through to his team-mates and, after impressive approach work, Juninho burst into the right side of the Madrid box and drew a fine save from Casillas with a low shot. Madrid continued to press, but Cris and CaÃ§apa were in determined mood and Lyon ultimately held firm without any real alarm.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005. All rights reserved.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Liverpool savour flying start</strong><br>Tuesday, 13 September 2005<br>by Simon Hart<br>from Estadio Manuel Ruiz de Lopera<br><br>A blistering start by Liverpool FC ensured they took all three points from their opening UEFA Champions League Group G game away to Real Betis BalompiÃ©, goals inside the first quarter-hour from Florent Sinama-Pongolle and Luis GarcÃ­a earning the holders a 2-1 win.<br><br>Daunting start<br>Although the Spanish side fought back with a 51st-minute goal from Arzu, they were unable to complete the comeback. Facing the European champions on their tournament debut was a daunting beginning for a team whose starting XI included only one player, Marcos AssunÃ§Ã£o, with previous Champions League experience, and they could not have got off to a worse start.<br><br>Early goal<br>By the second minute they were already a goal behind as Sinama-Pongolle struck. Jamie Carragher lofted a high ball towards Peter Crouch and with the tall target man distracting the home defence, Sinama-Pongolle took advantage to lift a delightful lob over Antonio Doblas from the edge of the box.<br><br>Swarming forward<br>Eyebrows were raised when Rafael BenÃ­tez spent upwards of Â€10m on Crouch in the summer but in the opening stages of his Champions League bow the 24-year-old gave some indication of his worth. For much of last season Liverpool struggled on their travels yet here Crouch provided an important outlet, holding the ball up while the trio of GarcÃ­a, Boudewijn Zenden and Sinama-Pongolle swarmed forward around him.<br><br>GarcÃ­a goal<br>Three of those players were involved in the Reds' second goal on 14 minutes. Crouch slipped a pass through to Zenden who, breaking down the inside-left channel, crossed low to GarcÃ­a. The Spaniard got there ahead of David Rivas and directed a first-time shot inside Doblas's near post. Having made their way through three qualifying rounds, Liverpool had begun the competition proper like the European champions they are - and this with Steven Gerrard on the bench.<br><br>Reina involved<br>Suddenly it was very quiet inside the Estadio Manuel Ruiz de Lopera but Betis kept at it. Fernando had already missed one presentable opportunity at 1-0 down - delaying his shot in front of JosÃ© Manuel Reina, allowing Djimi TraorÃ© time to make a sliding block - and further chances followed. In the 21st minute, the Brazilian Ricardo Oliveira skipped past Sami HyypiÃ¤ and tested Reina with a low shot. Then, following a half-cleared corner, Oliveira crossed back into the danger zone where Reina saved bravely at the feet of Juanito GutiÃ©rrez.<br><br>Ferrer change<br>On 35 minutes Betis coach Llorenc Serra Ferrer sent on another striker, the talismanic Dani, in place of Fernando and moments later the Andalusians created another opening, Arzu slipping the ball through to Fernando Varela but again Reina was there to make the stop. After a nightmare start to the first period, Betis gave themselves hope six minutes into the second when Arzu struck, flicking the ball through Reina's legs after Dani's pass had put him through.<br><br>Uncomfortable spell<br>It was now all Betis and Liverpool had to survive an uncomfortable spell as the hosts pressed for a second. Survive they did, albeit without displaying any of the attacking threat they had shown before the break. Indeed, despite the visitors' introduction of Djibril CissÃ©, John Arne Riise and Gerrard, one scuffed effort by Riise was all Doblas had to contend with in the second half.<br><br>Dead-ball specialist<br>Betis, for their part, were creating only half-chances. Reina tipped one Oliveira header over the bar, then JoaquÃ­n SÃ¡nchez scuffed a shot wide before the Spain winger weaved his way past three red shirts and crossed to the far post where, with the angle tight, substitute Xisco MuÃ±oz fired into the side-netting. One further scare followed for Liverpool when dead-ball specialist AssunÃ§Ã£o lined up a free-kick 20 metres from goal but Reina saved comfortably.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Rangers hold off Porto push</strong><br>Tuesday, 13 September 2005<br>by Alex O'Henley<br>from Ibrox<br><br>Rangers FC got their Group H campaign off to a winning start with an exhilarating 3-2 success against 2004 UEFA Champions League winners FC Porto in Glasgow.<br><br>Kyrgiakos decisive<br>Portuguese defender Pepe appeared to have given Porto a share of the spoils with two goals after Peter LÃ¸venkrands and Dado PrÂšo had twice put the home side ahead, but Sotirios Kyrgiakos gave Rangers maximum points with a headed goal five minutes from time.<br><br>Three changes<br>After a disappointing 1-1 draw with Falkirk FC at the weekend, Rangers manager Alex McLeish made three changes: former Newcastle United FC left-back Olivier Bernard made his debut, Francis Jeffers started for the first time since his loan move from Charlton Athletic FC, and LÃ¸venkrands began on the left of midfield. Porto coach Co Adriaanse kept faith with his favoured 4-3-3 formation, and it was the visitors who were the quicker into their stride.<br><br>Porto pressure<br>Brazilian forwards Alan and Jorginho threatened in the first five minutes with the latter forcing goalkeeper Ronald Waterreus to punch a corner off his line. The home team initially struggled for possession as Diego dictated the tempo for the visitors, although Jeffers almost opened the scoring on 14 minutes when he collected a LÃ¸venkrands cross, only for a heavy first touch to allow Porto captain Pedro Emanuel to clear the danger.<br><br>PrÂšo opportunity<br>At the other end, Ricardo Costa passed up another good opportunity after he got on the end of CÃ©sar Peixoto's left-wing centre, the full-back lifting his shot wastefully over. Alan went close again on 21 minutes, drifting past two defenders before firing in a shot that required a last-minute block to divert the ball for a corner. PrÂšo was then presented with a chance after Porto goalkeeper VÃ­tor BaÃ­a misjudged a clearance, but the Croatian was unable to capitalise.<br><br>LÃ¸venkrands opener<br>Jorginho seemed certain to break the deadlock just before the half-hour when he surged into the box only to be denied by a well-judged challenge from Waterreus. Ten minutes before half-time, a goal did arrive Â– and, against the run of play, it was Rangers that registered. LÃ¸venkrands reacted quickest to a long ball from Fernando Ricksen and kept his head to fire past VÃ­tor BaÃ­a. Porto suffered another blow before the break when Emanuel was substituted following a clash of heads with PrÂšo.<br><br>Rangers revival<br>The goal seemed to settle the hosts but they found themselves pegged back two minutes into the second half. Hamed Namouchi conceded a corner and when the ball was swung in, Pepe rose highest to head past Waterreus. The visitors should have been ahead six minutes later when Tomislav ÂŠokota pounced on a loose ball but again the Dutch keeper smothered his effort. Instead Rangers broke to the other end and promptly regained their advantage. Ricksen crossed from the right, Kyrgiakos and Namouchi combined to turn the ball back across goal and PrÂšo bundled it over the line.<br><br>Late drama<br>Adriaanse made a double substitution as the game entered the final quarter and one of the replacements, Ricardo Quaresma, almost scored after a defensive mix-up from a corner. It was a warning Rangers failed to heed and with 19 minutes remaining, Pepe capitalised on more hesitant defending to usher the ball into the net. Just as it seemed both sides would have to settle for one point, however, Kyrgiakos's clever back-header evaded VÃ­tor BaÃ­a and finally settled an eventful encounter in the home team's favour.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>PSV shackle Schalke fightback</strong><br>Tuesday, 13 September 2005<br>by Derek Brookman<br>from Philips stadium<br><br>PSV Eindhoven did enough to indicate that last year's run to the UEFA Champions League semi-finals was no fluke, with a hard-fought victory over FC Schalke 04 in the Netherlands.<br><br>Schalke struggle<br>Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink headed the only goal of the Group E encounter in the 33rd minute, meeting DaMarcus Beasley's in-swinging corner with a powerful back-post header that left goalkeeper Frank Rost helpless. The Dutch side had opportunities to double the lead before Schalke came back strongly in the second half but couldn't break PSV down.<br><br>Attacking intent<br>PSV, with Theo Lucius and Eric Addo slotting into a reorganised defence, started with 19-year old Ibrahim Afellay on the right of midfield, while Vennegoor of Hesselink was used as a lone striker. Schalke's lineup looked more adventurous, with Lincoln occupying a floating role in front of a four-man midfield, behind forwards Ebbe Sand and Kevin Kuranyi.<br><br>Rost roused<br>The game nevertheless began conservatively, with both teams keen to give nothing away; defending in numbers and building steadily. Indeed, 15 minutes had gone by the time a cross-cum-shot from PSV's Belgian international Timmy Simons forced Schalke custodian Rost into his first save, tipping over at the expense of a corner. Two minutes later Jefferson FarfÃ¡n shot weakly at Rost from a good position.<br><br>Deadlock broken<br>The chances awakened PSV, who started to push forward more, but the final ball continually let them down, their lack of incisiveness allowing Schalke to soak up the pressure. But the deadlock was broken just after the half-hour, and like so often during PSV's 2004/05 campaign, it came from a dead ball.<br><br>Schalke fightback<br>PSV began piling on the pressure. Beasley almost made it two but his free-kick was touched over by Rost, and the keeper then had to clear hastily as Vennegoor of Hesselink homed in on a loose pass. Five minutes before half-time Phillip Cocu hit the side-netting with a long-range effort and having survived until the interval only a goal down, Schalke kicked off the second half firmly on the front foot.<br><br>Defensive error<br>Lincoln fired a 49th-minute free-kick just over but it took an error from the hosts for Schalke to really threaten an equaliser, as Marcelo Bordon seized on a lax back-pass from Michael Reiziger to feed Ebbe Sand who headed over from close range. Strike partner Kuranyi volleyed high and wide a few minutes later as the visitors upped the ante.<br><br>Gomes troubled<br>Schalke brought on SÃ¸ren Larsen for fellow Dane Sand in the 71st minute and he almost made an immediate impact, setting Kuranyi clear but the German international was denied by the onrushing Heurelho Gomes. The Brazilian keeper then pushed away a drive by Hamit Altintop at full stretch, and at the other end, Afellay had a wonderful opportunity to seal victory with seven minutes remaining but dithered and his poorly-struck attempt was easily stopped by Rost.<br><br>Larsen header<br>Larsen almost headed a late leveller but, under pressure, he could not direct his effort on target as PSV held on to open their Group E campaign with a hard-fought success.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Juve start in familiar fashion</strong><br>Wednesday, 14 September 2005<br>by David Minton<br>from Jan Breydel Stadion<br><br>Italian champions Juventus FC began their UEFA Champions League Group A campaign in fine fashion with a 2-1 win at Club Brugge KV.<br><br>Second-half strikes<br>The visitors created enough opportunities to have won more comfortably, but in the event Pavel NedvÃ¬d's free-kick and David Trezeguet's exquisite lob - his 100th strike for the Bianconeri - proved sufficient. Fabio Capello's side were made to sweat late on though, as Jeanvion Yulu-Matondo pulled a goal back and Patrick Vieira was sent off.<br><br>Three changes<br>The hosts made three changes to the team that overcame K. Sint Truidense VV on Saturday. Joos Valgaeren, Yulu-Matondo and GÃ¼nther Vanaudenaerde came into the side as coach Jan Ceulemans opted for a 3-4-3 system. Juventus, who brought in Manuele Blasi at full-back in place of the injured Gianluca Pessotto, were intent on getting numbers forward from the off.<br><br>Stijnen confidence<br>Indeed they started brightly: NedvÃ¬d shooting centimetres over Stijn Stijnen's crossbar and the same player's volley forcing a fine save from a goalkeeper showing no sign of nerves on his Champions League debut. Stijnen barely had time to compose himself before denying Trezeguet from close range. The chances continued to come for the away team, summer signing Vieira having an effort cleared off the line in the 17th minute. Club Brugge's best hope seemed to lie in set-pieces, Olivier De Cock heading wide from a corner as the Belgian champions threatened for the first time.<br><br>Portillo opening<br>That opening helped Club Brugge grow in confidence and after Juventus's Christian Abbiati had failed to claim a 31st-minute corner, they would have taken the lead against the run of play had Javier Portillo been able to control the loose ball at the far post. There were now opportunities at either end, and Trezeguet went close to breaking the deadlock when, after a clever near-post run enabled him to reach Blasi's right-wing delivery, his attempt came back off the upright. Stijnen then produced two more fine stops from the Frenchman to keep the half-time score blank.<br><br>NedvÃ¬d brilliance<br>As the second period began the Jan Breydel Stadion found its voice and the home side enjoyed increasing amounts of possession, Sven Vermant drilling a low shot fractionally wide. Jonathan Blondel, on for Portillo, and Yulu-Matondo assumed more defensive responsibilities as Club Brugge switched to 3-6-1, reverting to their starting template on the break. Just as they started to look more secure, however, they fell behind to a fine NedvÃ¬d set-piece six minutes past the hour. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was fouled by Valgaeren outside the area, and the former Czech international curled a low effort round the wall and just inside Stijnen's left-hand post.<br><br>Exquisite finish<br>The youngster was involved again five minutes later, saving with his feet from Ibrahimovic. There was nothing Stijnen could do, though, as Trezeguet doubled Juve's lead in the 75th minute. Mauro Camoranesi was the architect, producing a perfectly-weighted chip for the striker's diagonal run, which Trezeguet matched with a superb lob. Ibrahimovic, who could have had a hat-trick, then thumped a shot that Stijnen did well to parry at the near post.<br><br>Late hope<br>That save looked crucial five minutes from time when Blondel's mis-kick, after Juventus had failed to deal with a corner, proved to be the perfect cross for Yulu-Matondo to mark his debut with a headed goal that renewed Club Brugge hope. That was further boosted a minute from time as Vieira was sent off for a second bookable offence, but the visitors held firm for a fine win.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sneijder laughs last for Ajax</strong><br>Wednesday, 14 September 2005<br>by Sam Beckwith<br>from Sparta stadium<br><br>Wesley Sneijder's strike a minute into added time cancelled out Miroslav MatuÂšoviÃ¨'s opener to earn AFC Ajax a draw at AC Sparta Praha in the opening round of fixtures in UEFA Champions League Group B.<br><br>Spectacular strikes<br>Sparta substitute MatuÂšoviÃ¨ seemed to have punished the Dutch visitors for their failure to capitalise on a string of first-half opportunities when he put the Czech side ahead with a blistering shot six minutes past the hour. Just as the points appeared to be within Sparta's reach, however, Sneijder ruined the party with an equally spectacular equaliser.<br><br>Familiar faces<br>Ajax coach Danny Blind fielded an unchanged team, the visitors lining up in an attacking 4-3-3 formation which featured the Czech contingent, TomÃ¡Âš GalÃ¡sek and ZdenÃ¬k Grygera, facing several international team-mates. Sparta coach Jaroslav HrebÃ­k went for a 4-3-2-1, spearheaded by lone forward Miroslav SlepiÃ¨ka. Steven Pienaar's clever interplay with Swedish international Markus Rosenberg caused immediate concern for Sparta, while at the other end SlepiÃ¨ka failed to connect with Karol Kisel's dangerous centre from the right.<br><br>Ajax on top<br>Sneijder had the first sight of goal, forcing JaromÃ­r BlaÂžek into action to keep out his powerful effort from the left, the Sparta custodian reacting smartly to prevent the predatory Pienaar from turning in the rebound. Ajax continued to pose Sparta problems as the half progressed, with Dutch international Sneijder's lively presence providing a potent threat and young striker Ryan Babel showing occasional flashes of brilliance.<br><br>Rosenborg denied<br>Ajax's threat kept on growing and Rosenberg was a whisker away from securing the advantage as he narrowly failed to touch in Pienaar's deft right-wing delivery. Sparta, increasingly pinned back in their own half, struggled to contain the Eredivisie outfit's effervescent attack and their own forays into Ajax territory became infrequent, causing frustration among the home fans.<br><br>Sparta fight back<br>However, in one of those rare incursions, Karel PoborskÃ½ created a half-chance for LukÃ¡Âš Zelenka but the curly-haired midfielder powered the ball over the bar. The best openings carried on coming Ajax's way, though, and minutes later, Sneijder found Rosenberg in space on the left. The Swede, cutting in, fired just wide of BlaÂžek's post. As the interval approached, Sparta finally imposed themselves, breaking up Ajax's fluent play and drawing their sting in midfield. Three minutes after the restart, Sparta replaced SlepiÃ¨ka with MatuÂšoviÃ¨, a switch that was to prove significant.<br><br>MatuÂšoviÃ¨ goes close<br>Shortly after, Sparta were nearly caught out by a speculative ball from Ajax's defence that forced BlaÂžek to head half-clear from the edge of his box, with Sneijder subsequently shooting narrowly wide. Yet that was an isolated incident, as Sparta looked the more dangerous team and went close to taking the lead when MatuÂšoviÃ¨'s long-range effort bounced off the foot of the post and was scrambled away by Hans Vonk.<br><br>Long-range efforts<br>Suitably encouraged, Sparta pushed forward and were in front within seconds. Ajax failed to clear a corner and the ball fell to MatuÂšoviÃ¨ on the right of the area, and his 25-metre drive screamed into the top corner. Babel almost levelled for Ajax, his shot from outside the box beating BlaÂžek but crashing against a post.<br><br>Last-gasp leveller<br>Spurred into action, Blind threw on Greece striker Angelos Charisteas and the positive approach brought reward in added time. Sneijder had been finding his range all evening, but finally produced a telling attempt when it mattered most, his powerful strike from 20 metres evading BlaÂžek's clutches and rescuing a point for the visitors.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Iaquinta gives Udinese dream debut</strong><br>Wednesday, 14 September 2005<br>by Richard Aikman<br>from Udine<br><br>A hat-trick by Vincenzo Iaquinta gave Udinese Calcio a perfect start to their debut UEFA Champions League campaign with a convincing win against Panathinaikos FC at the Friuli stadium.<br><br>Vidigal in<br>The Italian international scored once in the first half and twice in the second to put Serse Cosmi's side top of Group C after one game. Cosmi made one change from the team that overcame AS Roma in Serie A on Sunday, reverting from the three-pronged attack deployed at the Stadio Olimpico to a 4-4-2 formation with midfielder Vidigal included at the expense of forward Davide Di Michele.<br><br>Key absences<br>Panathinaikos adopted an even more cautious approach as coach Alberto Malesani sought to cope with key absences from his side. Suspension and injury had claimed the services of Dimitrios Papadopoulos, Emmanuel Olisadebe and Flavio ConceiÃ§Ã£o so the Italian opted for five in midfield and SÃ¡ndor Torghelle alone up front.<br><br>Fans' welcome<br>Udinese were greeted on to the pitch by a cleverly-choreographed Curva Nord, holding aloft thousands of placards of Champions League footballs to symbolise both their arrival on the ultimate football stage and their home colours of black and white.<br><br>Spurned chances<br>The hosts' first chance to take the lead came on the quarter-hour when the excellent Antonio Di Natale put Iaquinta through with a lofted pass. Iaquinta's first touch was poor, forcing him left and his attempted lob was easily taken by goalkeeper Mario Galinović. Four minutes later, the 25-year-old spurned another opening, heading over Vincent Candela's swerving cross.<br><br>Firm header<br>In the 28th minute it was third time lucky for Iaquinta. In a sweeping move Di Natale released Damiano Zenoni down the left wing and his centre was met with a firm header by the powerful striker.<br><br>Neat passing<br>Although they passed the ball neatly, with Constantinos Charalambides, Ezequiel GonzÃ¡lez and Nordin Wooter combining well, the Greek side struggled with the final ball and only really threatened at set-pieces. Indeed, GonzÃ¡lez clipped a post from a free-kick with Morgan De Sanctis beaten.<br><br>Mazy run<br>But it was De Sanctis's opposite number who was the busier of the two keepers. Di Natale was denied after 36 minutes when his mazy run resulted in a fine stop by Galinović. Vidigal's snapshot was also repelled by the Croatian.<br><br>Attacking approach<br>After the break the visitors came out with more attacking intent as they sought to get back into the match. Wooter turned Felipe outside the area before forcing a save from De Sanctis. Torghelle then tried his luck from 18 metres following a quickly taken free-kick but failed to direct his shot.<br><br>Full advantage<br>As Malesani's men pressed forward, so they became exposed at the back and it was Iaquinta who took full advantage. The balance of the game turned decisively in favour of Udinese in the 73rd minute when Iaquinta raced on to another Di Natale pass with the Greeks caught looking for offside. He took the ball around Galinović and rolled it into an empty net.<br><br>Treble completed<br>Two minutes later, Iaquinta celebrated a dream start to his Champions League career, turning to steer a fierce drive past Galinović. In fact, the last ten minutes witnessed a complete siege of the visitors' goal and only a desperate clearance by Panathinaikos captain Ioannis Goumas prevented Iaquinta registering a fourth.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Villarreal make solid start</strong><br>Wednesday, 14 September 2005<br>by Graham Hunter<br>from El Madrigal<br><br>Villarreal CF made a solid debut in the UEFA Champions League by holding their vastly more experienced Group D rivals Manchester United FC to an entertaining, but goalless, draw.<br><br>Rooney off<br>The home team could even have taken all three points against opponents who played the last 26 minutes with ten men following the dismissal of Wayne Rooney for two yellow cards in quick succession. Villarreal pressed the visitors back for much of the final 20 minutes, but eventually had to settle for a stalemate.<br><br>Riquelme ruled out<br>Villarreal coach Manuel Luis Pellegrini chose not to gamble on Juan RomÃ¡n Riquelme's ankle ligament strain, instead opting for HÃ©ctor Font on the right of midfield and the Spaniard took to the task with relish, causing the visitors difficulties in and around Edwin van der Sar's penalty area throughout the first period. United, meanwhile, opted to play with only three in midfield - Paul Scholes, Darren Fletcher and Alan Smith Â– plus three forwards. Inevitably the game was extremely open as a result and kept the capacity crowd enthused throughout.<br><br>Early opportunities<br>However, Sir Alex Ferguson's side showed their experience and while Villarreal pushed forward consistently, it was United who looked more likely to score first in the early exchanges. An eleventh-minute deflection off Marcos Senna's boot left the ball tantalisingly in the path of Cristiano Ronaldo, restored to the team after a family bereavement, but Mario SebastiÃ¡n Viera rushed out to smother. The Uruguayan goalkeeper then produced a fine diving save to keep out MikaÃ«l Silvestre's downward header from Scholes's corner.<br><br>Crucial clearance<br>Ten minutes later United had to make their first change when Gabriel Heinze, who had been carrying an ankle injury, collided with Jan Kromkamp. Kieran Richardson replaced him and instantly created danger, winning a free-kick from Gonzalo RodrÃ­guez. Viera failed to gather the ensuing set-piece and, with the keeper helpless, Ruud van Nistelrooij looked certain to register Â– only for Gonzalo to clear centimetres in front of an unguarded net with an acrobatic overhead kick.<br><br>Superb stop<br>If United could count themselves unlucky on that occasion, Van der Sar had already been forced into a world-class stop to keep the scores blank. Antonio Guayre's run and clever cross was ingeniously flicked on by Juan Pablo SorÃ­n's heel and Rodolfo Arruabarrena's firm volley looked destined for the back of the net, only for the Dutch international to spring across his goal and prevent his team falling behind.<br><br>Viera excellence<br>Against his former club, Villarreal striker Diego ForlÃ¡n was starved of clear chances but from SorÃ­n's 50th-minute pass he curved a right-footed effort narrowly wide. Then the engaging duel between Viera and Van Nistelrooij had its second episode when, from Ronaldo's header, the Dutchman swivelled and shot from four metres out but the custodian again blocked superbly.<br><br>Rooney sees red<br>The match was becoming increasingly fractious, with a flurry of fouls and yellow cards breaking up the play. The period culminated in the dismissal of Rooney four minutes past the hour. The English international was shown a yellow card for fouling Quique Ã�lvarez and reacted by sarcastically applauding the referee's decision, which brought a second booking.<br><br>Fortunate escape<br>The home side strove to make the numerical advantage count in the closing stages and came closest when Senna's free-kick was deflected against his own crossbar by Rio Ferdinand. Although they were unable to fashion a breakthrough, Villarreal still have every reason to be satisfied with their night's work.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005. All rights reserved.<br></div>

Roy Makaay, Michael Ballack and JosÃ© Paolo Guerrero all failed to convert good chances to double the lead.<br><br>Guerrero partners Makaay<br>With Owen Hargreaves, Ali Karimi and Claudio Pizarro sidelined, Bayern coach Felix Magath had to shuffle his pack. Young Peruvian Guerrero partnered Makaay up front, while Roque Santa Cruz claimed a place among the substitutes despite being dogged by injury.<br><br>Midfield congestion<br>Club Brugge coach Jan Ceulemans also had injury concerns with Michael Klukowski, GÃ¼nther Vanaudenaerde and Joos Valgaeren ruled out. Croatian forward BoÂško Balaban shouldered the bulk of the goalscoring burden, as a change from a 4-3-3 to a 3-4-3 formation forced on-loan striker Javier Portillo on to the bench.<br><br>Crowd lift Bayern<br>Bayern struggled to find any rhythm early on due to Club Brugge flooding the midfield, often with six players in the centre as the wingers tracked back diligently. Home defender ValÃ©rien IsmaÃ«l had the first opportunity, heading centimetres wide yet succeeding in increasing the volume in an already cacophonous MÃ¼nchen Arena.<br><br>Kahn reflexes<br>Balaban could have shocked Magath's men moments later, though. The forward was played in by Ivan Leko's precise cross from the left and IsmaÃ«l's slip, but failed to put enough power on the shot and allowed Oliver Kahn to deny him with a smart save. At the other end, Ballack's free-kick had Club Brugge hearts in mouths, but bent just wide with goalkeeper Tomislav Butina a spectator.<br><br>Demichelis opener<br>Inspired by ZÃ© Roberto on the left wing, the hosts increased the pressure, before Demichelis gave Bayern supporters genuine reason to raise the roof just after the half-hour. The Argentinian reacted quickest when Butina missed ZÃ© Roberto's corner, flicking out his right boot to fire into the roof of the net from close range, despite being surrounded by defenders.<br><br>Ballack finds range<br>After the break, the Bundesliga leaders continued to attack and seemed eager to make the points safe. Ballack began to exert more influence, seeing more of the ball and bringing his colleagues into play, and shot narrowly wide from the edge of the box on 48 minutes.<br><br>Defensive reshuffle<br>Shortly afterwards, Mehmet Scholl replaced the injured Bixente Lizarazu, taking up a midfield position while Bastian Schweinsteiger slotted into the Frenchman's left-back role. The reorganisation may have caused some unusually slack Bayern defending, as Balaban went close again by firing just wide.<br><br>Scholl influence<br>Scholl quickly made his presence felt, curling a peach of a free-kick towards the top-left corner from 25 metres, only to see Butina claw it brilliantly away. Yet the visitors continued to trouble Bayern with their counterattacking play, and Ballack and Willy Sagnol were booked trying to break up Club Brugge raids.<br><br>Tempo slowed<br>But the Belgian side never really looked like scoring, and Bayern successfully slowed the game in a pedestrian final ten minutes. They share top spot with next opponents Juventus FC on six points, while Club Brugge and Matchday 3 rivals SK Rapid Wien have yet to get off the mark.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

Markus Rosenberg pulled a goal back almost immediately, but ArsÃ¨ne Wenger's team survived the final 19 minutes for a victory which gives them a three-point cushion at the top of the table.<br><br>Key absentees<br>Arsenal went into the game with question marks over their scoring ability with Dennis Bergkamp and Thierry Henry sidelined and Robin van Persie suspended. Wenger therefore opted for the experimental pairing of JosÃ© Antonio Reyes and Ljungberg, and within two minutes of kick-off, the ploy had paid off.<br><br>Rapid attack<br>Matthieu Flamini capitalised on some hesitancy in the Ajax back line to feed Reyes, whose first-time pass found Ljungberg in space. The Swedish international had only the goalkeeper to beat and did so with typical aplomb, adroitly chipping Hans Vonk to register Arsenal's 100th Champions League goal. It was the worst possible start for a makeshift home side, for whom Wesley Sneijder had become the latest addition to a lengthy injury list with a hamstring problem. In the absence of their fulcrum, Ajax's three-man midfield struggled to impose themselves.<br><br>Three-pronged attack<br>Instead, the onus fell on the three-pronged attack of Ryan Babel, Nourdin Boukhari and Angelos Charisteas, but although all worked early openings, only the third-named forced a save from Manuel Almunia, deputising for the suspended Jens Lehmann in the Arsenal goal. Wenger's men sat back, content to strike on the break, and only poor control prevented the nimble Ljungberg from making the most of more tentative defending from Thomas Vermaelen.<br><br>Bridging the past<br>Vermaelen typified his team's gauche first-half performance as he failed to assert himself against the canny visitors. It was announced last week that 12 bridges in a new park around Ajax's former De Meer home will be named after the side that monopolised the European Champion Clubs' Cup from 1971-73. On the early evidence here, it could be some time before the bridges that snake the River Amstel outside the ArenA carry the identities of the current squad.<br><br>Ajax ascendancy<br>Steven Pienaar ventured forward as the half wore on, but missed a gilt-edged chance on the stroke of half-time after good work from Boukhari. The striker ghosted past Ashley Cole, drew Almunia and squared to Pienaar but with the goal at his mercy, the South African blazed over. It was nevertheless a welcome lift, and Ajax started the second period firmly on the front foot.<br><br>Narrow misses<br>Babel and Nigel de Jong flashed efforts wide but, just as they were beginning to threaten, the Eredivisie team lost their rhythm when Charisteas was forced off after colliding with Kolo TourÃ©, and were soon further behind. Nine minutes past the hour, Arsenal won possession on halfway and Flamini sent Reyes clear, the Spaniard rounding Vonk only to be upended. PirÃ¨s duly placed the spot-kick past the Ajax goalkeeper.<br><br>Rosenberg riposte<br>The two-goal cushion lasted only two minutes, however, as Almunia brilliantly tipped TomÃ¡Âš GalÃ¡sek's long-range strike on to a post, only for the rebound to fall perfectly for Rosenberg to tap in. Both sides had openings in the final 15 minutes, but Ajax were unable to find an equaliser to leave Arsenal sitting pretty.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005. All rights reserved.<br></div>

Once the home talisman had restored the lead, however, there was no way back for the Italian side and Ronaldinho completed the scoring from the spot, by which time Deco had also converted a stunning set-piece and Vidigal had seen red for Udinese.<br><br>Brave start<br>Rested at the weekend along with Deco, Ronaldinho marked his return in style, curling a delightful free-kick past Morgan De Sanctis in the Udinese goal from 22 metres. Udinese's display in the opening minutes had belied their status as Champions League debutants as they looked confident both in defence and attack. The visitors earned their reward when Valerio Bertotto's corner was met at the far post by Felipe who volleyed in from close range.<br><br>Ronaldinho importance<br>Udinese had not, however, counted on Ronaldinho hitting such superb form and the forward again underlined his importance to the BarÃ§a cause by stroking them back in front with a well-taken second goal after 31 minutes. After Felipe was too casual in possession, Lionel Messi stepped in to steal the ball and release Samuel Eto'o down the right. The Cameroonian broke to the by-line and delivered a cross which evaded the goalkeeper and two defenders and fell invitingly for Ronaldinho to side-foot into the far corner.<br><br>Deco strikes<br>Although the Udinese defence looked strong in open play, Barcelona once more showed their ability from set-pieces five minutes before the break. Another free-kick was won on the edge of the area, although this time Ronaldinho left it for Deco and looked on in delight as the Portuguese international lifted his shot over the wall and beyond De Sanctis. The home crowd and team were obviously buoyant, the atmosphere bringing the best out of Messi on his first start for the Blaugrana this term.<br><br>Messi involved<br>The Argentinian prodigy, who gained Spanish citizenship the day before the game, demonstrated why he is so highly regarded at Camp Nou by embarking on two powerful runs and displaying a number of neat touches as the Spanish champions swarmed forward. Udinese's Portuguese midfielder Vidigal had been booked for a 12th-minute foul on the 18-year-old and saw red three minutes after the restart for upending Juliano Belletti.<br><br>Great atmosphere<br>The reduction in numbers forced Udinese coach Serse Cosmi to make his second change of the night, replacing striker Antonio Di Natale with Stefano Mauri, with the substitute dropping into midfield. Irrespective of the scoreline, the massed ranks of visiting fans were vociferous from the upper echelons of this famous stadium, creating an impressive atmosphere. Driven on by that support, the Italian side held firm and limited BarÃ§a to shots from outside the box while even managing a few counterattacks themselves after breaking down home raids.<br><br>Cosmi present<br>The final word, though, went to Ronaldinho as he won a penalty after being fouled by Felipe, picked himself up and confidently beat De Sanctis from the spot. As the Brazilian left the field to rapturous applause, Cosmi was waiting to collect his shirt and keep a promise to his son.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005. All rights reserved.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>United save their best until last</strong><br>Tuesday, 27 September 2005<br>by Simon Hart<br>from Old Trafford<br><br>Ruud van Nistelrooij struck a late winner as Manchester United FC overcame a tough challenge from Portuguese champions SL Benfica to go top of Group D with a 2-1 victory at Old Trafford.<br><br>Call answered<br>There were five minutes remaining when the Dutchman turned the ball in at the far post after Ryan Giggs's corner had ricocheted his way via Rio Ferdinand's head and Nuno Gomes's midriff. In doing so, the striker answered manager Sir Alex Ferguson's pre-match call for United's experienced attackers to make the difference on a night where they took the field with a decimated-looking defence.<br><br>Benfica unlucky<br>The absence of key players and a lack of confidence mean the 'Theatre of Dreams' may not be the place of opposition nightmares it used to be, but Van Nistelrooij's goal shows some things do not change. Prior to that, Benfica had looked destined for a draw after SimÃ£o's strike cancelled out Giggs's first-half free-kick on a night that served to underline the current uncertainties facing Sir Alex's side.<br><br>Warning shot<br>Benfica coach Ronald Koeman had suggested beforehand that United were "not at their best" and certainly injuries meant a makeshift look to their back line in which two 20-year-olds, Phil Bardsley and Kieran Richardson, filled the full-back positions. Koeman's men did not take long to threaten Edwin van der Sar's goal. First, Manuel Fernandes picked out Fabrizio Miccoli on the edge of the box and the Italian, stepping outside Ferdinand, rolled a warning shot wide.<br><br>Van der Sar busy<br>Miccoli did not have to wait long for his next opportunity, testing Van der Sar's fingertips with a strike across goal after John O'Shea had clumsily allowed Nuno Gomes's pass to slip through his legs. From the ensuing corner, the Dutch custodian was called into action again to keep out Ricardo Rocha's diving header. When these clubs met in the 1968 final at Wembley, they managed 42 shots between them and while a repeat here was never likely, Benfica were certainly enjoying more sights on goal than most visitors to Old Trafford.<br><br>Rooney suspended<br>SimÃ£o, after exchanging passes with Nuno Gomes, screwed an effort wide in the 21st minute, while United were struggling to make things happen without the suspended Wayne Rooney. Still, on 14 minutes the woodwork came to Benfica's rescue when Van Nistelrooij turned on Bardsley's low centre and flashed a right-footed drive which beat JosÃ© Moreira but not the bar.<br><br>Deflected goal<br>Benfica, save for one or two timely LuisÃ£o interceptions, looked comfortable until the 39th minute and Giggs's opener. If United had reason to curse their misfortune with injuries, they certainly enjoyed a slice of luck here as the Welshman's free-kick deflected off the wall and flew past the wrong-footed Moreira.<br><br>Lovely cross<br>The second half opened with Cristiano Ronaldo sending a lovely cross into the danger zone which Van Nistelrooij just failed to reach, and the striker then saw a Giggs delivery bounce to safety off his heel after Moreira had missed the ball completely. If that offered United encouragement, they were left stunned when SimÃ£o fired Benfica level shortly before the hour with an exquisite free-kick after the Portuguese international had been felled by Alan Smith.<br><br>Late chances<br>Both sides saw a chance to win the match before Van Nistelrooij did just that. LuisÃ£o's careless header across the box landed at the feet of Ronaldo whose resulting shot struck the angle of the post and crossbar via Moreira's fingertips. At the other end, Van der Sar made a low scrambling save from SimÃ£o, although it was the keeper's countryman who had the final say.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005. All rights reserved.<br></div>

Both sides were evenly matched after that but the drama unfolded again after the break when substitute Altintop annulled Shevchenko's header with an arcing effort from distance.<br><br>Schalke unchanged<br>Schalke coach Ralf Rangnick looked to the same eleven that defeated Hannover 96 2-0 on Saturday, leaving captain Ebbe Sand, who has recovered from a back injury, on the bench. Rangnick's opposite number Carlo Ancelotti made two changes to the team that scored two unanswered goals against Treviso FC on Sunday. Cafu returned at right-back for Jaap Stam with Kakha Kaladze replacing Serginho on the other flank.<br><br>Seedorf strike<br>The tie could not have begun in more disappointing fashion for Schalke and their experienced goalkeeper Frank Rost. With 25 seconds on the clock, Alberto Gildardino found Seedorf in space and the Dutch international immediately released a low, curling shot from 23 metres to beat Rost, who let the ball slip under the palm of his hand.<br><br>Larsen equaliser<br>It was the third-fastest goal in Champions League history, but Schalke seemed unfazed and quickly regrouped to bounce back. Kevin Kuranyi flicked into the path of Lincoln and the Brazilian saw his strike deflect off Alessandro Nesta and fall kindly for Larsen, who was left with an easy header to beat Dida and level matters.<br><br>Further chances<br>Both sides continued to look lively and the visitors came close to renewing their advantage on ten minutes. KakÃ¡'s free-kick found Paolo Maldini but his header went wide of the target and dropped just beyond the reach of Shevchenko's desperate lunge. Schalke countered immediately but Kuranyi's aim too was slightly askew.<br><br>Lincoln effort<br>The 23-year-old striker was the hosts' most potent outlet and almost scored after showing excellent control 12 minutes from half-time, but he fired wide and Lincoln could do no better with a free-kick four minutes later. It had been a lively first half and neither coach saw any reason to make changes at the interval - though the opening minutes of the second period tailed off significantly.<br><br>Shevchenko header<br>Schalke often overdid the trickery when attacking, while Milan seemed reluctant to threaten the home defence until their second goal arrived on 59 minutes. Maldini exploited space on the left wing and delivered a right-footed cross for Shevchenko, who beat Rost with a powerful header.<br><br>Altintop impact<br>With his team trailing again, Rangnick decided to make his first change, introducing Altintop for Fabian Ernst in midfield. And the Turkish international made a rapid impact, taking just two minutes before releasing a blistering shot that left Dida rooted to the spot.<br><br>Dida save<br>After twice coming from behind, Schalke almost stole all three points in the closing stages. Another Larsen header brought the best out of Dida, who turned the Danish international's effort around the post at full stretch, although in truth neither side deserved to lose on a memorable evening.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Substitute Soldado spares Madrid</strong><br>Wednesday, 28 September 2005<br>by Andy Hall<br>from Santiago BernabÃ©u<br><br>A late header from substitute Roberto Soldado earned Real Madrid CF a valuable, but narrow, UEFA Champions League victory against a valiant Olympiacos CFP in the Spanish capital.<br><br>RaÃºl record<br>The Greek visitors appeared to have earned a point as Pantelis Kafes scored three minutes into the second period, the Olympiacos midfielder cancelling out RaÃºl GonzÃ¡lez's ninth-minute effort. The Madrid forward's header made him the first player to register 50 goals in the European Champion Clubs' Cup - yet only looked good enough for a point until Soldado struck.<br><br>Attacking approaches<br>With both sides having lost their opening Group F fixtures a fortnight ago, to Olympique Lyonnais and Rosenborg BK respectively, their coaches opted for attacking 4-3-3 formations. Madrid's Vanderlei Luxemburgo was forced to improvise with Zinedine Zidane still nursing a groin strain and Ronaldo completing a two-match ban, so deployed Pablo GarcÃ­a as a holding midfielder while Robinho, Julio Baptista and RaÃºl formed a three-pronged attack. Olympiacos counterpart Trond Sollied, meanwhile, dropped Haruna Babangida to the bench and brought Kafes into midfield.<br><br>Scoring milestone<br>Madrid drove into the visitors' penalty area straight from kick-off, RaÃºl and Baptista having early glimpses of goal. RaÃºl began the evening level with another Santiago BernabÃ©u idol, Alfredo Di StÃ©fano, on 49 European Cup goals, but on nine minutes glanced in David Beckham's right-wing set-piece to become the competition's all-time top scorer in his own right.<br><br>Revelling Rivaldo<br>Iker Casillas was then tested at the opposite end, the Madrid goalkeeper diving full length to keep out a Rivaldo free-kick to an almighty groan of disappointment from the away supporters. Rivaldo, on his return to Spain following five seasons with FC Barcelona, looked keen to make an impact and another thunderous effort forced Casillas to block. Olympiacos's Antonios Nikopolidis was kept busy too, racing out of his area to head clear before palming another Baptista shot wide.<br><br>Kafes curler<br>The hosts were pegged back three minutes into the second half, however, as Olympiacos levelled. Kafes collected possession on the edge of the box after his initial effort had been blocked and unleashed a terrific strike that curved away from Casillas and went in off the keeper's left-hand post. The goal was a severe blow for Madrid, while inspiring the Greek side to defend fiercely as a vital away point seemed within reach.<br><br>Mounting pressure<br>A lack of ideas in attack did not help the home team's predicament, although Robinho met a Roberto Carlos centre on the hour but powered his header over. Baptista then launched himself at another Beckham cross but failed to connect properly. As the minutes ticked away, Madrid's desperation to regain the lead increased and Baptista's flying header, which crashed against the bar on 77 minutes, seemed to sum up their frustration.<br><br>Soldado to the rescue<br>Luxemburgo swapped Baptista for striker Soldado with eleven minutes remaining and then immediately replaced MÃ­chel Salgado for attacking midfielder Carlos Diogo. Olympiacos were four minutes away from claiming a point when Beckham's delivery was met by Soldado and, although Nikopolidis blocked his first header, the substitute reacted smartly to nod in the winner. It was the 20-year-old's first Champions League goal, and was celebrated with the same gusto as RaÃºl's 50th, although Madrid's night ended on a sour note as Sergio Ramos was sent off in added time for reacting to Ioannis Okkas's challenge.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Holders held in tense tussle</strong><br>Wednesday, 28 September 2005<br>by Alex O'Henley<br>from Anfield<br><br>Liverpool FC and Chelsea FC fought out a scoreless draw in Group G as last season's winners and losing semi-finalists shared the spoils at Anfield. The London club had arrived on Merseyside intent on avenging their semi-final defeat last May but in the end Jose Mourinho's side were happy to leave with a point in a match that Liverpool dominated without creating too many clear-cut chances.<br><br>Lampard lively<br>Rafael BenÃ­tez opted for an attacking formation with Djibril CissÃ© joining Peter Crouch up front while Didier Drogba led the Chelsea line in preference to HernÃ¡n Crespo. The Liverpool supporters taunted the visitors with chants of "champions of Europe" before kick-off, but it was Chelsea who threatened first from a Frank Lampard free-kick on seven minutes after Xabi Alonso had been booked for a tug on Michael Essien. Lampard's strike from 30 metres brought a one-handed save from JosÃ© Manuel Reina low to his right, but the Spanish goalkeeper completely missed Damien Duff's subsequent corner and was relieved to see the ball fly out for a goal-kick.<br><br>HyypiÃ¤ close<br>Crouch's height was causing problems for the Chelsea defence from set-pieces and with 19 minutes on the clock the England striker rose above John Terry to nod the ball back across the five-metre line. The onrushing Sami HyypiÃ¤ stretched as he sought to prod home only for Drogba to get there a fraction earlier and clear the danger.<br><br>Robben foiled<br>This was a good spell for the home side but Chelsea were dangerous on the counterattack, as Arjen Robben demonstrated just after the half-hour mark. The Netherlands winger turned HyypiÃ¤ inside out before unleashing a venomous left-foot shot which brought a good save from Reina. With half-time approaching Chelsea created another opening when Duff slipped past Djimi TraorÃ© before sending a tempting ball across the face of goal. However, Drogba failed to read the Irishman's intentions and the chance was gone.<br><br>Liverpool on top<br>Liverpool started brightly after the interval and Luis GarcÃ­a almost made the breakthrough after 47 minutes. Again Crouch was instrumental in the build-up, flicking a long ball into the path of the Spanish midfielder who darted between Paulo Ferreira and Ricardo Carvalho, but Petr Cech saw the danger and raced off his line to smother the ball before GarcÃ­a could convert. At the other end Drogba went close, rising to head a Ferreira cross from the right just over the bar.<br><br>Pressure builds<br>Jamie Carragher then threatened the Chelsea goal with a header from a corner that required a last-ditch intervention from William Gallas. The pressure from the home team was building and Drogba needed to be alert to clear a free-kick from Gerrard.<br><br>Duff chance<br>As the game entered the final quarter, Mourinho introduced Shaun Wright-Phillips for Robben but Liverpool still looked the more likely scorers and Cech was called into action to pluck Gerrard's cross out of the air before it could reach GarcÃ­a. Duff then raced through on goal but Reina cleared before the winger could capitalise. It proved to be the Irishman's last contribution as he was replaced by Crespo shortly afterwards.<br><br>Alonso effort<br>Liverpool substitute Florent Sinama-Pongolle then caused panic in the Chelsea rearguard when he escaped to the by-line with six minutes remaining before delivering a cross that was cleared only as far as Alonso, but the Spaniard's long-range drive was held comfortably by Cech.<br><br>Repeat meeting<br>The sides meet again in the Premiership on Sunday but for now both will be content with a point which leaves them joint top of Group G, one point clear of Real Betis BalompiÃ©.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Artmedia stage incredible fightback</strong><br>Wednesday, 28 September 2005<br>by Duncan White<br><br>Another night of high European adventure for FC Artmedia Bratislava as they staged an incredible comeback from two goals down against FC Porto at the EstÃ¡dio do DragÃ£o to win 3-2 and secure their first points of the group stage.<br><br>Inspiring comeback<br>Porto had eased into a two-goal lead in the first half through Lucho GonzÃ¡lez and Diego but Peter PetrÃ¡Âš began the fightback just before half-time. After the break JÃ¡n KozÃ¡k finished off a counterattack and BalÃ¡zs BorbÃ©ly converted from close range to give the Slovakian champions a famous victory against the side that won this competition two seasons ago.<br><br>Fine form<br>Porto have been in fine domestic form and came into the game off the back of a 2-0 win against CF Os Belenenses on Saturday. Coach Co Adriaanse kept faith with that team and made no changes to his attack-minded 4-3-3 formation. In contrast, Artmedia coach Vladimir Weiss decided to be cautious, recalling Branislav Fodrek to midfield and dropping striker Juraj HalenÃ¡r to the bench to make room for defensive player Ondrej DebnÃ¡r.<br><br>Bright start<br>Porto started brightly, playing crisp passing football and searching out gaps through their creative midfielders. The hosts were playing at their own pace, with the tempo being dictated by the outstanding playmaker Diego.<br><br>Diego class<br>Indeed, the Brazilian came close with an early volley, while Artmedia goalkeeper Juraj Čobej struggled to keep out a long-range effort from Lucho GonzÃ¡lez. With half an hour gone, Porto should have opened the scoring but Bosingwa ignored the unmarked Benni McCarthy and instead tried to pick out Jorginho. Čobej dived at the Brazilian's feet.<br><br>Opening goal<br>Adriaanse's side were not in any hurry though and their patience was rewarded on 32 minutes when Lucho GonzÃ¡lez broke the deadlock. Jorginho had flicked the ball over his man and had a near-post shot saved. The ball broke to Ricardo Quaresma and the Portuguese international's cross was perfect for Porto's Argentinian midfielder to nod in.<br><br>Diego strikes<br>The second was not long coming. Indeed, only seven minutes had elapsed when Porto launched a counterattack after Artmedia had over-committed in their search for an equaliser. DebnÃ¡r backed off from Diego and the Brazilian did not need a second invitation, shooting firmly into the bottom corner at the near post.<br><br>Artmedia defiant<br>Artmedia were not about to roll over, however. With Porto's defence not getting tight enough, PetrÃ¡Âš cut inside the challenge of Ricardo Costa and fired low at the near post. The ball went through Bruno Alves's legs and in at VÃ­tor BaÃ­a's near post.<br><br>KozÃ¡k levels<br>Weiss decided to take the game to the home team after the break, bringing on HalenÃ¡r for Peter BurÃ¡k. The change paid dividends as Artmedia equalised with a text-book counterattack on 54 minutes. After a Porto corner had been cleared, the substitute sent in a fine crossfield ball to JÃ¡n KozÃ¡k on the left. He skipped around VÃ­tor BaÃ­a and stroked the ball calmly around the backtracking Quaresma.<br><br>McCarthy chance<br>Porto dominated possession as the game drew to a close and kept creating chances. From a Quaresma free-kick, McCarthy beat the offside trap and was free in front of goal. A poor touch allowed Čobej to rush out and block.<br><br>Dramatic winner<br>Yet it was Artmedia who scored the winner with 16 minutes remaining. A rare foray into Porto territory yielded a free-kick on the left flank. KozÃ¡k jogged up take it and his whipped cross was met by BorbÃ©ly, who had got in front of Ricardo Costa to side-foot into the net.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005. All rights reserved.<br></div>

But French full-backs Bixente Lizarazu and Willy Sagnol recovered from injuries to play, along with Deisler, who shook off a knock sustained in the weekend draw at FC Schalke 04.<br><br>Del Piero dropped<br>Patrick Vieira's groin problem made him a notable absentee for the visitors, who were also missing Jonathan Zebina. Giuliano Giannichedda and Manuele Blasi stepped in for that French duo, while coach Fabio Capello dropped Alessandro Del Piero to the bench alongside Bayern old boy Robert KovaÃ¨, favouring David Trezeguet and IbrahimoviÃ¦ up front.<br><br>Early chances<br>Bayern began in an unexpectedly offensive fashion and could have had their opponents in trouble with two clear chances inside four minutes. But Roque Santa Cruz's header and a decent Roy Makaay shot missed the target, and moments later Juventus goalkeeper Christian Abbiati was able to parry Michael Ballack's 18-metre free-kick to safety.<br><br>NedvÃ¬d outmuscled<br>The Bianconeri, sporting an all-yellow change strip, had no midfield space to get into the game, with Pavel NedvÃ¬d and company being outmuscled by Demichelis in the centre. As their confidence grew, Bayern edged closer to breaking the deadlock but Abbiati kept the game goalless with a spectacular save from Makaay's free-kick.<br><br>Deisler decisive<br>Magath's men continued to press and Deisler delivered the opener just after the half-hour when the German international stepped up the pace on the right wing, and with Abbiati expecting a cross, surprised the keeper with a shot at goal that he could only deflect into his own net. Deisler turned provider for the second goal seven minutes later, Demichelis doubling the advantage with a perfect header from a pinpoint corner.<br><br>Bianconeri changes<br>Capello had seen enough and brought on Del Piero and Giorgio Chiellini for Mauro Camoranesi and Blasi after the break. But the hosts continued to dominate thanks to a strong left flank manned by ZÃ© Roberto and Bastian Schweinsteiger, who replaced the once-again injured Lizarazu.<br><br>Substitute denied<br>It took almost an hour before Juventus mustered their first clear-cut opportunity. Some 66,000 spectators watched Oliver Kahn comfortably stop Del Piero's free-kick from just outside the area. But with a third goal in the offing, it was brilliant Bayern who went closest as Makaay's volley from inside the box flashed past Abbiati's woodwork.<br><br>Intentions clear<br>Just seconds later, Trezeguet failed to hit the target from a tight angle despite being unmarked. But besides IbrahimoviÃ¦'s late consolation, it was the home team's centre-halves, Lucio and ValÃ©rien IsmaÃ«l, who came to the fore in the latter stages as Bayern closed out victory to make their intentions in Europe clear.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

He made an early comeback here as a 15th-minute substitute, however, and struck a spectacular opener within six minutes of his arrival before adding a second in the closing stages - making him Arsenal's record scorer with 186 goals in all competitions - to leave the Londoners with a five-point lead in the section, and Sparta ruing missed opportunities.<br><br>Three changes<br>Sparta coach Stanislav Griga made two changes to the team that beat FK Chmel BlÂšany 5-2 at the weekend, bringing in a defender and a forward in Pavel Pergl and Miroslav Slepička. For their part, Arsenal FC made three alterations having lost 2-1 at West Bromwich Albion FC on Saturday, with Philippe Senderos, Fredrik Ljungberg and Dennis Bergkamp making way for Pascal Cygan, Gilberto - who also took over as captain - and Robin van Persie.<br><br>Early introduction<br>Despite sections of Sparta's stadium being closed as a punishment for racist chanting during the Matchday 1 game against AFC Ajax, both sets of fans were in good voice. Within ten minutes, Zdeněk Pospěch had gone close for the home side, connecting with a cross in the area but failing to get any power in his shot. Arsenal manager ArsÃ¨ne Wenger had surprisingly included Henry on the bench, announcing his intention to introduce the striker for the final half-hour. In the event, JosÃ© Antonio Reyes was forced off on the quarter-hour after two heavy tackles, allowing Henry to come on to the delight of Arsenal's travelling support.<br><br>Quick reminder<br>His pace and vision soon began to unsettle the home defence, and he quickly reminded everyone of his undoubted class, deftly controlling a long pass from Kolo TourÃ©, turning and curving the ball beyond Sparta goalkeeper JaromÃ­r BlaÂžek from the edge of the area with the outside of his right foot.<br><br>Sparta threat<br>The visitors then started to drop deeper, but despite some well-organised Arsenal defending, Sparta's pressure occasionally looked like paying off. Pospěch connected with another left-wing cross but failed to find the target. Slepička tested Jens Lehmann - returning from a two-match suspension - with a clever back-flick from LukÃ¡Âš Zelenka's corner, but the Arsenal No1 dealt easily with the threat.<br><br>Counterattack chance<br>Sparta continued to push for an equaliser as the second period kicked off, Slovakian international Karol Kisel forcing Lehmann to tip a long-range effort over the crossbar. As the half unfolded, though, Griga's men were increasingly frustrated while remaining vulnerable on the break thanks to the pace and stealth of Henry. Arsenal's occasional forays into opposition territory carried an air of genuine menace, Henry's incisive ball into the Sparta area setting up Cesc Fabregas for a shot BlaÂžek did well to block.<br><br>Clinical second<br>Attempting to reinvigorate his attack, Griga withdrew defender Pergl in favour of the more attack-minded Miroslav MatuÂšovič. Almost immediately, though, Henry effectively settled the contest, latching on to a sweeping Robert PirÃ¨s pass and shooting nervelessly past BlaÂžek. Wenger will be delighted his gamble was so handsomely rewarded, while Sparta remain bottom of the table.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005. All rights reserved.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Barcelona blunted in Athens</strong><br>Tuesday, 18 October 2005<br>by Paul Saffer<br>from Athens Olympic stadium<br><br>Panathinaikos FC blunted the three-man attack of FC Barcelona with, in the end, some comfort to secure a UEFA Champions League Group C draw which will not harm either side's chances of reaching the next stage.<br><br>Visitors frustrated<br>Only occasionally were the two goalkeepers called into action, as Ronaldinho in particular had a night of increasing Â– and rare Â– frustration. However, when Panathinaikos come to the Camp Nou for Barcelona's 100th UEFA Champions League game in a fortnight, they will be hard-pressed to hold out in this style again.<br><br>Surprise selection<br>The big surprise in the Panathinaikos lineup was the selection of Igor BiÂšÃ¦an in defence in place of usual captain Ioannis Goumas, while Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard opted for the experience of Henrik Larsson over the prodigious brilliance of Lionel Messi. It was goalkeeper VÃ­ctor ValdÃ©s who was first into action, though, pouncing on the ball when Mikael Nilsson and Evagelos Mantzios broke down the left and fed SÃ¡ndor Torghelle.<br><br>BarÃ§a rhythm<br>However, Barcelona soon found their rhythm, Samuel Eto'o the spearhead supported by Larsson and Ronaldinho, who supplied an early crossfield ball to the Swede that bamboozled the home defence, though Eto'o's subsequent shot did not trouble home goalkeeper Mario GalinoviÃ¦. A clever Deco free-kick past the blind side of the wall then found Giovanni van Bronckhorst, who sent the ball past the far post.<br><br>Mantzios denied<br>Panathinaikos were clearly more wary of Barcelona than their bullish pre-match demeanour had suggested, Ronaldinho and Deco seeming to force slips from their opponents through sheer presence. But there may have been strained Catalan nerves at the other end when the lively Torghelle's through-ball sent Mantzios one-on-one with ValdÃ©s 20 minutes in, only for the shot to go straight at the grateful custodian.<br><br>Home side settle<br>Still, that incident reminded Barcelona of their own vulnerability, and Panathinaikos were finally allowed to settle, their midfield often hitting threatening balls over the top of the visiting defence, though full-backs Loukas Vintra and Filippos Darlas offered alternative attacking options through overlaps. In contrast to their early dominance, it was Barcelona who were perhaps happier to end the half at 0-0, having switched Eto'o and Ronaldinho within their front three in an attempt to rediscover lost verve.<br><br>Eto'o efforts<br>The break seemed to refresh Barcelona, who showed the same guile as in the first 20 minutes. Xavi HernÃ¡ndez's precise pass into the path of Ronaldinho set up Eto'o, denied by GalinoviÃ¦, and the striker was then stopped by Naisef Morris's nerveless sliding tackle. Thiago Motta now replaced Mark van Bommel, but the Italian's first act was to concede a free-kick nearly 30 metres out, Vintra's strong shot forcing ValdÃ©s to dive and save.<br><br>Tactical change<br>Panathinaikos coach Alberto Malesani decided on a change himself just before the hour, Torghelle withdrawn and Sotirios Leontiou coming into midfield, Mantzios now a lone forward supported by Ezequiel GonzÃ¡lez. The central midfield was becoming a crowded place, and Rijkaard chose, with a stalemate beginning to emerge, to unleash Messi for Larsson, though Van Bronckhorst's snap shot did force GalinoviÃ¦ into action just before the substitution.<br><br>BiÂšÃ¦an intervention<br>AndrÃ©s Iniesta too was tried, and Dimitrios Papadopoulos made his bow in this season's group stage for the final 15 minutes. Not long after, Eto'o broke through the Panathinaikos defence and rounded GalinoviÃ¦, but to his amazement his strike from a tight angle was deflected off target by BiÂšÃ¦an's leg. Then the Cameroonian was sent through but the goalkeeper dived at his feet. It summed up Barcelona's night.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005. All rights reserved.<br></div>

Scholes will miss the clubs' next encounter in Paris on 2 November, along with Ryan Giggs who was withdrawn after breaking his cheekbone, although United at least retain first place in the group after Villarreal CF and SL Benfica drew.<br><br>Few chances<br>Lille, with just one out-and-out striker in Peter Odemwingie, offered United few gaps to exploit in a cagey opening period. Just past the ten-minute mark, however, slack defending could have brought the first goal. Efstathios Tavlaridis fluffed a clearance, allowing Cristiano Ronaldo to race clear down the left and whip in a low cross which Tony Sylva was forced to deal with after unconvincing defending.<br><br>Odemwingie fall<br>Moments later came a scare for United as Odemwingie found himself clean through on Edwin van der Sar's goal. As he looked to round the goalkeeper, the Nigerian international tumbled over under minimal contact from the custodian and saw his penalty claims ignored by referee Stefano Farina. Save for two Milenko AÃ¨imoviÃ¨ shots from distance, that was the sum total of Lille's first-half threat.<br><br>Scholes shot<br>The Ligue 1 team were neat in possession but it was United who had the better chances. One sweetly-worked free-kick routine after 16 minutes saw Giggs, out on the right, play a short ball infield to Phil Bardsley whose floated centre was flicked on by Rio Ferdinand to Scholes, and the flame-haired midfielder burnt Sylva's fingertips with a volleyed effort across goal. Shortly afterwards Sylva was called into action again to save low from Ruud van Nistelrooij.<br><br>Giggs threat<br>One or two heavy challenges raised the temperature inside Old Trafford but the game continued to flow towards Lille's goal. The visitors breathed a sigh of relief shortly after the half-hour when the lively Giggs, a set-piece scorer against Benfica, was denied by the woodwork after his free-kick had beaten both the wall and Sylva.<br><br>Momentum fades<br>United started the second half brightly, and Ronaldo had a headed opportunity from a corner but nodded straight at Sylva. However, a degree of sloppiness began to creep into their play and that early momentum faded. Instead the next goal attempt of note came from Lille substitute Geoffrey Dernis who, seconds after replacing AÃ¨imoviÃ¨, had Van der Sar scrambling across his goal.<br><br>Chances spurned<br>United's prospects dimmed further when Scholes, booked in the first half, collected a second caution for a late challenge on Jean Makoun four minutes past the hour. Still, despite being a man down, United sought the winner to the end. Sylva did well to turn away Ronaldo's deflected cross while Giggs had a free-kick deflected over and Ferdinand headed straight at Sylva from the resulting corner. Van Nistelrooij was then denied a late chance by the offside flag, and Lille had their point.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005. All rights reserved.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>No way through in Milan</strong><br>Wednesday, 19 October 2005<br>by Ivan Carvalho<br>from San Siro<br><br>AC Milan were denied three points as determined PSV Eindhoven held them to a goalless draw in their UEFA Champions League Group E tie at the San Siro.<br><br>Great goalkeeping<br>The visitors endured a ferocious onslaught from last season's runners-up as the Rossoneri monopolised possession throughout. But despite creating a string of half-chances, Milan were unable to find a way past PSV goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes.<br><br>Gilardino dropped<br>True to his word, Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti stuck with his new rotation policy, making five changes to the side that won on Sunday against Cagliari Calcio. Alberto Gilardino was dropped for Christian Vieri up front, while Filippo Inzaghi Â– just back from a five-month lay-off Â– began the night on the bench.<br><br>FarfÃ¡n fit<br>PSV coach Guus Hiddink, meanwhile, breathed easier with the news that Jefferson FarfÃ¡n passed a late fitness test. The Peruvian was paired opposite DaMarcus Beasley in the channels, with Robert spearheading the Dutch team's three-man attack.<br><br>Vieri chance<br>An eager-to-impress Vieri, still searching for his first goal in Rossoneri colours, nearly got on the scoresheet after just 120 seconds. The former FC Internazionale Milano marksman raced on to a Clarence Seedorf pass only to send his half-volley blazing over the crossbar.<br><br>Ooijer experience<br>In the opening period, PSV's striking options were stifled as they found themselves unable to release their lightning-quick forwards into space. But at the other end, the PSV back line did well to keep out Milan, exemplified by AndrÃ© Ooijer's ability to read the runs of Milan's front men.<br><br>Playmaker Pirlo<br>With the hosts controlling play, an opening goal seemed close at hand and Andriy Shevchenko should have done better when Andrea Pirlo set him up with a raking long pass. But the Ukrainian turned the wrong way after trapping the ball and his subsequent shot was directed almost straight at Gomes.<br><br>Double save<br>Milan ended the half with several more chances as a galloping KakÃ¡ tested Gomes with a powerful blast that forced the Brazilian into a double save. Then Pirlo dribbled his way into space and unloaded a right-footed effort that dipped just over the crossbar.<br><br>Inzaghi returns<br>No sooner had the second half started than Milan went into overdrive looking to break the deadlock. Straight from the kick-off, Seedorf drove a low ball at Gomes which the goalkeeper nearly spilled. Next, with Shevchenko clearly in discomfort, Ancelotti brought on Inzaghi in his place.<br><br>Kaladze cracker<br>The return of 'Pippo', who had already earned the lion's share of applause when introduced before kick-off, energised the locals. Team-mate Kakha Kaladze heeded the call to pour forward and fired a bullet at Gomes to herald a 20-minute spell that saw the PSV goal under siege.<br><br>Gomes grace<br>Clearly not pleased with his earlier efforts, Seedorf again was the protagonist as he found room on the right and let fly a deflected shot which Gomes blocked. It was an impressive one-man display of grace under fire as the Brazilian fended off wave after wave of Milan incursions into his area.<br><br>Tactical switch<br>In order to stop the continuous barrage, Hiddink replaced Robert with IsmaÃ¯l Aisatti to break up the tempo. The coach seemed content to emerge with a well-deserved point and stay close to Milan at the top of the group - and despite four minutes of added time, his disciplined team held firm.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Madrid fightback flattens Rosenborg</strong><br>Wednesday, 19 October 2005<br>by Andy Hall<br>from Santiago BernabÃ©u<br><br>Real Madrid CF were forced to come from behind to defeat Norwegian visitors Rosenborg BK 4-1 in UEFA Champions League Group F and found inspiration in the unlikeliest of sources as Jonathan Woodgate's equalising header paved the way to victory.<br><br>Debut dream<br>Woodgate, whose only previous goals in a Madrid shirt had gone into his own net, cancelled out Roar Strand's first-half strike three minutes into the second period as Madrid returned rejuvenated after a testing opening 45 minutes. RaÃºl GonzÃ¡lez, IvÃ¡n Helguera and David Beckham added further goals as the Spanish side moved into second place in the section with this second successive win.<br><br>Notable absentees<br>Both coaches were able to field their usual 4-3-3 formations, albeit with several changes. Madrid's Vanderlei Luxemburgo was deprived of MÃ­chel Salgado, Sergio Ramos and Ronaldo so opted to introduce Carlos Diogo and Woodgate in defence while Robinho moved into a central attacking role flanked by Julio Baptista and RaÃºl. Zinedine Zidane, now fully recovered from a groin strain, started his first Group F game at Guti's expense.<br><br>Tactical reshuffle<br>For the visitors, Ã˜rjan Berg failed a late fitness test, forcing coach Per-Mathias HÃ¸gmo to deploy Per Ciljan Skjelbred in the middle of midfield, while Christer Basma stepped in at right-back to push captain Strand into a more advanced position. Despite the reshuffle, the visitors defended solidly in the opening stages, their organisation and discipline leaving few spaces for the hosts, who looked quite stifled in attack.<br><br>Madrid danger<br>Madrid nevertheless managed to fashion a number of attempts on Espen Johnsen's goal, RaÃºl firing straight into the goalkeeper's hands in the opening minute before Woodgate, up front for a corner, headed over. Efforts from Baptista and Robinho likewise ended in the stands, before the Rosenborg keeper brilliantly smothered RaÃºl's audacious back-heel.<br><br>Johnsen excellence<br>Chances for Rosenborg were at a premium and home goalkeeper Iker Casillas was relatively untroubled, although he did punch clear an Ã˜yvind Storflor free-kick. The Spanish international then watched his opposite number react superbly to tip a toe-poke from Baptista on to the crossbar.<br><br>Strand strikes<br>However, as Luxemburgo had warned, the Norwegian outfit are masters of the counterattack and caught out Madrid against the run of play just before half-time. Storflor's centre escaped Helguera, leaving Strand Â– who scored Rosenborg's opener in a 2-0 win against Madrid in Trondheim in the 1997/98 UEFA Champions League - to calmly slip his shot past Casillas.<br><br>Madrid revived<br>Luxemburgo responded by swapping Baptista for Guti at half-time, and the switch brought instant results as Madrid turned the game on its head within seven minutes of the restart. First, Woodgate met Beckham's raking cross to direct a powerful header under the crossbar, and soon after, RaÃºl put the home team ahead following a dazzling display of skill from Robinho. The Brazilian's run created the opportunity for Madrid's captain to show some fast footwork of his own, controlling the ball with his left and slotting it in with his right.<br><br>Helguera header<br>Confidence restored, Madrid began to dominate and extended their advantage on 68 minutes when Helguera connected with a Beckham free-kick to nod inside the near post. The pressure was relentless, RaÃºl and Robinho both going close as the final whistle approached but it was Beckham who crowned a fine performance by curling a signature set-piece into the top corner. Madrid will be full of confidence for the return match in two weeks, although Pablo GarcÃ­a will be suspended after collecting a yellow card.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>CissÃ© adds to Anderlecht agony</strong><br>Wednesday, 19 October 2005<br>by David Minton<br>from Constant Vanden Stock<br><br>Liverpool FC's second away win in UEFA Champions League Group G has kept the holders on course for the knockout phase. Striker Djibril CissÃ©'s 20th-minute volley condemned RSC Anderlecht to their third 1-0 defeat in the section, while extending the hosts' unwanted record at this stage of the competition to ten straight losses.<br><br>Changes made<br>Rafael BenÃ­tez handed Sami HyypiÃ¤ a 53rd consecutive European start as he opted for a seemingly conservative 4-5-1 formation with CissÃ© the lone striker. Anderlecht, for their part, made three changes. Hannu Tihinen's recovery from illness consigned Lamine TraorÃ© to the bench while Bart Goor and PÃ¤r Zetterberg replaced Fabrice Ehret and Walter Baseggio respectively.<br><br>Goor denied<br>Goor was immediately in the action, played through on goal by Christian Wilhelmsson after a flowing move, but JosÃ© Manuel Reina came sharply off his line to save with his legs.<br><br>Riise to the fore<br>Gradually the visitors found their stride with Dietmar Hamann shooting narrowly wide before Luis GarcÃ­a missed a golden chance in the 13th minute, firing over from in front of goal from John Arne Riise's perfectly weighted pull-back. Finding space on the left, Riise was becoming ever more involved. The Norwegian's curled effort with his less-favoured right foot was brilliantly turned behind by Silvio Proto.<br><br>CissÃ© strike<br>That was the precursor to the goal as the ensuing corner, swung in by Hamann, was brilliantly volleyed home by CissÃ© for his ninth goal of the season.<br><br>Chances spurned<br>A second almost followed in similar fashion. Again a corner caused problems for the home defence, but this time goalkeeper Proto made an outstanding point-blank save from Djimi TraorÃ©. Goor spurned Anderlecht's best opportunity to equalise before the break, collecting Mbo Mpenza's controlled header but skewing the ball off target.<br><br>Riise rocket<br>Riise, continuing to venture down the left flank to great effect, flashed a thunderous volley centimetres wide as the second half got under way. Anderlecht replied with Anthony Vanden Borre's poked attempt forcing Reina into action.<br><br>Wilhelmsson threatens<br>The action became stretched as Anderlecht desperately chased their first goal of the group stage, seeking to exploit the room left by Riise's forays forward. A sign of coach Frank Vercauteren's intent saw holding midfielder Yves Vanderhaeghe replaced by Baseggio. They had a penalty appeal refused when Wilhelmsson's cross was blocked by Jamie Carragher, and the Swedish midfielder then shot across goal as the fightback gathered momentum.<br><br>CissÃ© chance<br>But Liverpoool were breaking dangerously and CissÃ© held his head in his hands after dragging a left-foot effort just wide from yet another opening created by the indefatigable Riise.<br><br>Changes made<br>Anderlecht were unbowed, although another Vanden Borre miss at the far post left the home supporters frustrated. With fifteen minutes remaining the coaches made contrasting substitutions. Harry Kewell made his first appearance since May's UEFA Champions League final, on for CissÃ©, while Anderlecht switched to three at the back with forward Akin Serhat replacing Olivier Deschacht.<br><br>Proto brilliance<br>A wonderful Proto save with his feet prevented Mohamed Sissoko adding a second for Liverpool, who continued to threaten on the break with GarcÃ­a denied by another fine stop in the dying minutes. However, Liverpool were content with the solitary strike which keeps them alongside Chelsea FC at the top of Group G on seven points, four above Real Betis BalompiÃ© with Anderlecht looking doomed to a fight for a UEFA Cup place at best.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Porto back from the brink</strong><br>Wednesday, 19 October 2005<br><br>After a nightmare start to their UEFA Champions League campaign, FC Porto resurrected their hopes of progress from Group H with an impressive win against FC Internazionale Milano. There was an element of fortune about both goals, but inspired by the brilliant Ricardo Quaresma, they outclassed their illustrious visitors who dropped their first points.<br><br>Porto revival<br>The Portuguese side, European champions in 2004, had started with consecutive 3-2 defeats by Rangers FC and FC Artmedia and had looked on the brink of elimination. However, they are now back in the hunt for qualification, thanks to Marco Materazzi's own goal and a Benni McCarthy volley that deflected heavily off Juan SebastiÃ¡n VerÃ³n. Lucky perhaps, but this was a much-improved performance from Co Adriaanse's team.<br><br>Tactical reshuffle<br>Following those opening losses, Adriaanse attempted to avert the slide with a raft of changes. Striker Lisandro LÃ³pez and defender Bruno Alves were injured and the Dutch coach made four further alterations to the side beaten 2-0 by SL Benfica at the weekend.<br><br>Adriano left out<br>Adriaanse's Inter counterpart, Roberto Mancini, decided against recalling Adriano after the forward returned late from international duty with Brazil. But winger LuÃ­s Figo, back on home soil, was given a starting place. David Pizarro was also added to the team that thrashed AS Livorno Calcio 5-0 on Sunday Â– Alvaro Recoba and ZÃ© Maria dropping to the bench.<br><br>Strong start<br>Inter began the stronger, with a Materazzi header being deflected over from close range and Julio Cruz going one-on-one with VÃ­tor BaÃ­a, only for the veteran goalkeeper to save with his right boot.<br><br>Own goal<br>It was Porto who took the lead, though, in bizarre circumstances on 22 minutes. Right-back Bosingwa curled in an awkward cross from deep and Walter Samuel was unable to head clear. The ball's flight caught Materazzi by surprise and it ricocheted off his knee and beyond a stunned JÃºlio CÃ©sar.<br><br>McCarthy on mark<br>McCarthy doubled the advantage 12 minutes later, making amends after missing a great early opportunity. When VerÃ³n tripped Jorginho on the edge of the box, McCarthy opted to shoot from the ensuing free-kick. His first effort was blocked but the ball dropped straight back to him on the volley and he struck it into the bottom corner with the help of a deflection off VerÃ³n.<br><br>Quaresma inspired<br>The inspiration for Porto's impressive showing was the recalled Quaresma. Inter had no answer to the forward's pace and poise, with acting Inter captain IvÃ¡n CÃ³rdoba forced into fouling him five times before the interval.<br><br>Cambiasso chances<br>Esteban Cambiasso twice had the chance to reduce the deficit in the early stages of the second half. The Inter midfielder fired over from eight metres after VÃ­tor BaÃ­a had done well to parry a Santiago Solari shot, and then from substitute Recoba's corner, he nodded against Pepe and over from just two metres.<br><br>Porto fortune<br>Fortune certainly seemed to be favouring the hosts. On 62 minutes Recoba's cross deceived VÃ­tor BaÃ­a, who could only palm against the far post. The ball bounced on to Figo, back on to the woodwork and then to safety. Recoba was at the heart of everything, his centres deserving better finishes from fellow substitute Adriano and the hard-working Cruz. Then Cambiasso squandered the easiest opportunity of the lot in added time. It was simply not Inter's night.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005. All rights reserved.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>FarfÃ¡n fanfare lifts PSV top</strong><br>Tuesday, 1 November 2005<br>by Derek Brookman<br>from Philips Stadion<br><br>PSV Eindhoven defeated AC Milan in a home UEFA Champions League encounter for the second time this year. But unlike last season's ultimately futile semi-final victory, this 1-0 win gives them an excellent chance of progressing as Group E winners.<br><br>Teenage kicks<br>The result was definitely a triumph for youth over the Milan old guard, with the home side fielding two teenagers and the winner coming from 21-year old Jefferson FarfÃ¡n. Indeed, the biggest surprise in PSV's starting lineup was the inclusion of midfielder IsmaÃ¯l Aisatti, Guus Hiddink staying true to his pre-match statement that he would not hesitate to hand the 17-year-old his full debut if the situation demanded it.<br><br>Stam dismissed<br>Experienced defender Michael Reiziger, fleetingly a Milan player, dropped to the bench as the coach fielded an attacking XI, while Alberto Gilardino partnered Christian Vieri in attack for the visitors. Former PSV favourite Jaap Stam started at right-back for the Rossoneri, but ended with a premature exit after collecting a second yellow card in the 84th minute.<br><br>Brisk start<br>The game started briskly with the first clear opening arriving as early as the first minute, Dida saving a Phillip Cocu header. Less than 60 seconds later, Vieri shot straight at Heurelho Gomes from the edge of the box following a mistake by Cocu. Both teams continued to play at a high tempo, pushing forward at every opportunity, and it was no surprise when PSV took the lead after eleven minutes. Kakha Kaladze only succeeded in heading a speculative clearance by Gomes into the path of FarfÃ¡n, leaving the Peruvian international to stride into the area and smash a low drive in off Dida's near post.<br><br>Instinctive block<br>Milan playmaker Andrea Pirlo curled a free-kick narrowly over soon after, but it was only Dida's instinctive block after 20 minutes that prevented fellow Brazilian Alex doubling PSV's advantage with a powerful header. Last season's UEFA Champions League runners-up were determined to pull level, and came within centimetres of doing so as a powerful long-range effort from Clarence Seedorf whistled past Gomes's right-hand post just after the half-hour mark. The keeper was almost embarrassed after 37 minutes, recovering to knock the ball behind after almost punching Seedorf's corner into his net.<br><br>Succession of corners<br>As the half drew to an end, the visitors pushed deeper into PSV territory, forcing a succession of corners. Gomes had to get down smartly to parry a Vieri snap-shot, and the same player buzzed another effort just wide moments before the break. Milan coach Fabio Capello responded by adding width to his left flank by bringing on Serginho and Marek Jankulovski for Gennaro Gattuso and Kaladze, yet DaMarcus Beasley carved out the first real chance, evading two challenges and cutting in from the left before drilling in a low attempt that Dida turned behind.<br><br>PSV hold firm<br>A deflected Seedorf strike then almost sneaked in under the bar before Hiddink substituted midfielder Ibrahim Afellay for full-back Reiziger, a sign that his side were content to defend their lead. However, Cocu kept Dida busy with a stinging low shot seconds later, while Milan were finding it difficult to break PSV down aside from Paolo Maldini heading Pirlo's free-kick over.<br><br>Shevchenko chance<br>Ancelotti took a final gamble by introducing Andriy Shevchenko in the 74th minute, and within 60 seconds the fit-again Ukrainian unleashed a spectacular free-kick which produced a save of equal merit from Gomes. Milan's task got even more difficult when Stam, booked in the 45th minute, picked up another caution for hauling down Beasley. It said much for PSV's performance that Aisatti went closest to scoring late on, firing an effort from outside the area just over. Still, it was a debut to remember.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.
