            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Lyon roar into last 16</strong><br>Tuesday, 1 November 2005<br>by John Atkin<br><br>Olympique Lyonnais sealed their place in the last 16 of the UEFA Champions League as they scored four goals in 16 minutes either side of half-time to claim a comeback victory at Olympiacos CFP.<br><br>Carew double<br>Needing to win to keep their own hopes of escaping Group F alive, Haruna Babangida gave the home side the perfect start at the Georgios Karaiskakis stadium with a goal inside the first three minutes to spark off an earnest spell of Olympiacos pressure. Lyon weathered the early storm, however, and Juninho Pernambucano equalised four minutes before the interval with a trademark free-kick. John Carew added another second before the half-time whistle and by the time the Norwegian striker scored his second on 57 minutes, Lyon were coasting to a healthy victory.<br><br>Babangida breakthrough<br>Sidney Govou earned Lyon a last-gasp 2-1 win in the reverse fixture at the Stade Gerland a fortnight ago, and GÃ©rard Houllier opted to recall him tonight in place of Sylvain Wiltord. But it was a striking change for Olympiacos that made the more immediate impression when Babangida, only included because of a thigh injury to Mihalis Konstantinou, broke the deadlock in the first real attacking move of the game. The Nigerian striker coolly drilled a shot over the sprawling GrÃ©gory Coupet after latching on to Pantelis Kafes's perfectly-weighted through-ball.<br><br>Olympiacos dominance<br>Only two sides in UEFA Champions League history have reached the knockout stages after losing their first three games but Olympiacos appeared determined to make it three as they dominated a fractious opening period, punctuated by a number of fouls. One by Coupet almost proved costly on 15 minutes when he raced out of his goal to challenge Predrag DjordjeviÃ¦ by his right-hand corner flag, but only contrived to trip the effervescent winger.<br><br>Dead-ball danger<br>A past master from dead-ball situations, Rivaldo is not as potent as he once was, and failed to provide a testing cross into a packed Lyon area as the home side looked to capitalise on their dominance. Rivaldo's mantle as Brazil's best free-kick taker has passed to Juninho, who scored a stunning free-kick in the game between these sides a fortnight ago. The Greek team were clearly stung by that and although the Lyon playmaker's first effort was tame, goalkeeper Kleopas Giannou Â– playing in place of the ill Antonios Nikopolidis Â– opted to punch clear.<br><br>Juninho free-kick<br>Juninho struck another limp effort midway through the half but finally found his range four minutes before half-time, firing up and over the wall and low to Giannou's left. It was by far the most sweetly-executed free-kick he took tonight, and the goalkeeper's reaction reflected his thoughts on who was to blame, but he could do nothing three minutes later when Carew made it 2-1. The Norwegian striker collected a loose ball on the edge of the Olympiacos area, powered through a static back line and struck an unstoppable shot low to Giannou's left.<br><br>Top-two place<br>The goal left the home side shell-shocked and even the half-time break failed to revive them as Govou spurned two openings inside five minutes after the restart. Mahamadou Diarra was more clinical on 55 minutes, however, tapping into an empty net after the hapless Giannou had parried Carew's effort into his path. Carew added his second of the game two minutes later when he headed Juninho's arcing free-kick in via a deflection off the head of Ioannis Okkas. It was the killer blow for the home side and with Real Madrid CF defeating Rosenberg BK in Trondheim, Lyon are assured of a top-two finish.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005. All rights reserved.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Betis buoyed by Dani strike</strong><br>Tuesday, 1 November 2005<br>by John Spencer<br>from Estadio Manuel RuÃ­z de Lopera<br><br>Real Betis BalompiÃ© ended Chelsea FC's unbeaten UEFA Champions League record and revived their own hopes of progressing from Group G with a goal from substitute Dani midway through the first half of a hard-fought match in Seville.<br><br>No repeat<br>Betis lost 4-0 at Stamford Bridge in the reverse fixture two weeks ago but there was never any likelihood of a repeat as Betis produced a gritty performance for their second win in four UEFA Champions League games. The result left the home team on six points, one less than Chelsea who are now three behind leaders Liverpool FC.<br><br>Drogba dropped<br>Betis coach LlorenÃ§ Serra Ferrer welcomed back Melli and JoaquÃ­n SÃ¡nchez from domestic suspensions while Capi was preferred to Xisco MuÃ±oz alongside Ricardo Oliveira in attack. Chelsea manager JosÃ© Mourinho brought in Paulo Ferreira and Eidur Gudjohnsen in preference to Asier Del Horno and Didier Drogba, but it was the hosts who started more confidently with JoaquÃ­n and Edu particularly prominent. The former created Betis's first chance, tricking Claude Makelele with a neat step-over before advancing and playing in Arzu GarcÃ­a, but he ran out of space.<br><br>Injury blows<br>However, that early momentum was threatened by a double injury blow after 20 minutes. First Nano was stretchered off with an apparent hamstring strain and replaced by Paolo Castellini, then Ricardo Oliveira followed him down the tunnel after falling awkwardly following a tackle by Ricardo Carvalho. The striker, who had hit Betis's winner at RSC Anderlecht on Matchday 2, was substituted by Dani and the shaven-headed forward made an immediate impact by scoring within three minutes of his introduction.<br><br>Dani delight<br>Capi played in a low cross from the left and Edu stepped over the ball, allowing it to arrive at the feet of Dani. He appeared to have wasted his opportunity by lingering too long, but managed to hold off William Gallas and slot past Petr Čech to end the only perfect defensive record in this season's UEFA Champions League.<br><br>Chelsea response<br>The English champions inevitably responded with determination. Joe Cole found himself free in the area after an excellent pass by Gudjohnsen but shot too close to Pedro Contreras. Then Gudjohnsen was put clear, but blazed over under pressure from Juanito GutiÃ©rrez. Yet Betis almost doubled their lead ahead of the interval and again it was Dani who caused the danger. Čech saved from Edu and the ball rebounded to the substitute who sent his half-volley wide.<br><br>Chelsea changes<br>Mourinho reacted to the half-time deficit by bringing on Shaun Wright-Phillips and Drogba for Cole and Gudjohnsen. The Ivorian international added strength to the visitors' attack, but they were still struggling against an inspired Betis. After 65 minutes Damien Duff came on for Arjen Robben to make his first appearance in three weeks, and the Republic of Ireland winger almost inspired an equaliser.<br><br>No way through<br>He surged down the left and sent in a wicked cross that evaded Drogba. Wright-Phillips was on hand to send it back in from the right and tee up Michael Essien, who shot as he fell and watched his effort hit the left-hand post, roll agonisingly across the goalline and strike the other upright before rebounding into the arms of the grateful Contreras. Chelsea pressed forward relentlessly in the last ten minutes but could find no way past a resolute home defence and therefore drop to second place in the group.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Cruz control revives Inter</strong><br>Tuesday, 1 November 2005<br>by Adam Szreter<br>from Giuseppe Meazza<br><br>FC Internazionale Milano's blushes, and those of their besieged coach Roberto Mancini, were spared by two late goals from substitute Julio Cruz, the first a penalty, but FC Porto will wonder how this UEFA Champions League Group H game got away.<br><br>Eerily silent<br>Inter laboured all evening in an eerily silent stadium, but whether the indiscretion of their fans last season was to blame for their plight was immaterial in the end and now they are strong favourites to progress to the knockout stage.<br><br>Trio absent<br>Inter, looking to put a recent mini-slump behind them, were without the injured IvÃ¡n CÃ³rdoba while neither Esteban Cambiasso nor Javier Zanetti were fit enough to start. The 24-year-old Argentinian NicolÃ¡s Burdisso made his first start of the season at right-back and Chilean David Pizarro was given another chance alongside Juan SebastiÃ¡n VerÃ³n in midfield.<br><br>McCarthy benched<br>Porto coach Co Adriaanse stuck to the side that drew with Portuguese Cup holders VitÃ³ria FC at the weekend which meant no place for Benni McCarthy in attack and, even more surprisingly, no place on the bench for fellow striker Lisandro LÃ³pez.<br><br>Few openings<br>Inter struggled to find any rhythm at all and it was not long before they were made to pay in the most spectacular fashion when, direct from a free-kick 30 metres out, Hugo Almeida justified his selection ahead of McCarthy with a thunderbolt that flew past Julio CÃ©sar into the top corner of the Inter net. As perfect a strike as will be seen all season.<br><br>Squandered chances<br>Adriano, attempting to return the compliment from a similar distance, hit the massed ranks of empty seats 15 rows back. The big Brazilian went a little closer with a near-post header moments later, and was then denied by Marek Ãˆech's intervention after good work by Obafemi Martins. LuÃ­s Figo later fired one past the post from the edge of the Porto area, but Inter were flattering to deceive.<br><br>Robust back line<br>Martins managed to get his head to a subsequent Figo cross but only succeeded in directing the ball straight into VÃ­tor BaÃ­a's arms, while Adriano looked a touch slow to react when he found space inside the area and Pepe got the block on his shot. There was scant encouragement for Mancini by half-time.<br><br>Brief break<br>Whatever he said to them at the interval, the Inter coach kept it brief as the Nerazzurri players were back out ahead of their opponents, who sent on RaÃºl Meireles in place of Alan. For Inter it was not long before Cambiasso joined the fray in place of Pierre WomÃ©, with Figo switching to the left and VerÃ³n to the right.<br><br>Martins miss<br>Adriano, plagued by a persistent shoulder injury, soon gave way to Cruz and SiniÂša MihajloviÃ¦ made his second appearance of the season in place of Walter Samuel, but all the changes made little difference.<br><br>Penalty decision<br>Just when it was getting hard to see a way back for Inter, Porto captain Pedro Emanuel mistimed a tackle on Pizarro just inside the Porto area and referee Manuel Enrique Mejuto GonzÃ¡lez, who took charge of last May's epic final in Istanbul, had no hesitation in pointing to the spot. Cruz dispatched the penalty with aplomb.<br><br>Cruz crucial<br>VÃ­tor BaÃ­a then did well to turn over a fierce free-kick from MihajloviÃ¦ but Inter, and Cruz in particular, were in the ascendancy and the Argentinian's 82nd-minute header from MihajloviÃ¦'s corner crept in past Meireles, standing guard on the post, to provide victory, and relief, for Mancini's Inter.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Trezeguet strike blunts Bayern</strong><br>Wednesday, 2 November 2005<br>by Richard Aikman<br>from Stadio Delle Alpi<br><br>David Trezeguet scored an 85th-minute winner as Juventus claimed a narrow victory against FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen to move alongside the Bundesliga outfit at the UEFA Champions League Group A summit.<br><br>Dramatic finale<br>The French striker had broken the deadlock just after the hour with a typically predatory goal. Sebastian Deisler levelled with a sweeping free-kick that evaded everybody five minutes later and that looked enough to earn Bayern a draw until Trezeguet struck his second late on, adroitly slotting in after cushioning Patrick Vieira's clever chip. There was still time for Zlatan Ibrahimovic to see red after receiving a second yellow card to take some of the gloss off Juve's success.<br><br>New-look Juve<br>Fabio Capello made several changes to the side defeated 3-1 by AC Milan at the weekend. Alessandro Del Piero made a rare UEFA Champions League start behind the front two of Ibrahimovic and Trezeguet in an unfamiliar 3-4-1-2. Robert KovaÃ¨ joined Lilian Thuram and Fabio Cannavaro at the back while Gianluca Zambrotta and Giorgio Chiellini flanked Vieira and Emerson.<br><br>Rough diamond<br>The visitors made two alterations of their own following their 2-1 triumph over the Bianconeri at the FuÃŸball Arena MÃ¼nchen a fortnight ago. The injured Bixente Lizarazu and Roque Santa Cruz made way for Bastian Schweinsteiger and Claudio Pizarro. Deployed in a 4-4-2 formation with Martin Demichelis at the base of a combative midfield diamond, Bayern looked set to defend their three-point lead at the top of the section.<br><br>Lively start<br>The game got off to a lively start when Trezeguet almost scored at both ends in the space of a minute. First he forced Christian Abbiati to tip over the bar after glancing ZÃ© Roberto's well-flighted free-kick dangerously goalwards, before quickly making amends by firing a fierce shot from distance which Oliver Kahn punched clear. Bayern should have taken the lead on 12 minutes, though, when Emerson lost possession to Roy Makaay but the Dutchman's poor connection was that of a striker struggling for form.<br><br>Ballack header<br>Trezeguet was similarly wasteful three minutes later when he applied a heavy boot to Zambrotta's near-post cross, when only a deft glance was required. Capello would have been disappointed by that, and still more when his team committed a flurry of fouls just outside their area against opponents he had labelled "the best side in Europe at set-pieces". The visitors failed to capitalise, however, Michael Ballack going closest when he guided Deisler's cross just over.<br><br>NedvÃ¬d introduction<br>The game became scrappy before the break, with bookings and poor passing making for a disjointed affair, but the introduction of Pavel NedvÃ¬d for Del Piero immediately breathed new life into the Bianconeri after the restart. The Czech midfielder exchanged passes with Ibrahimovic on the edge of the box only for Chiellini to curl a shot well over the woodwork in the 47th minute. The two combined again shortly after only for Willy Sagnol to block the Swede's goal-bound effort.<br><br>Trezeguet opener<br>It was the energetic NedvÃ¬d who forced the opener on 62 minutes. His strong run was eventually halted by Lucio's desperate challenge inside the area, and Trezeguet pounced on the loose ball to slot past Kahn. The advantage was fleeting, though, and five minutes later Bayern were level from one of those set-pieces so dreaded by Capello. Deisler's arcing delivery from all of 30 metres evaded everybody, including Abbiati, before dropping inside the far post. It looked to have earned Bayern a point until Trezeguet struck again.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005. All rights reserved.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Arsenal sweep into knockout stages</strong><br>Wednesday, 2 November 2005<br>by Timothy Collings<br>from Highbury<br><br>Arsenal FC secured their place in the knockout stages of the UEFA Champions League with a fourth successive Group B victory, Thierry Henry's goal and a late double from his second-half substitute Robin van Persie proving sufficient to defeat AC Sparta Praha.<br><br>Fine finishes<br>Henry, who played with great verve and invention for 66 minutes before being replaced, struck after 23 minutes with a swerving shot from just outside the penalty area. ArsÃ¨ne Wenger's side were always in command but did not wrap up the points - and their place in the last 16 - until eight minutes from time when Van Persie curled in a fine second, before adding gloss to the win with a third four minutes from time.<br><br>Slick surface<br>After several hours of steady rain, the surface at Highbury was invitingly fast and slippery. Arsenal, seeking victory to seal their progress, enjoyed all the early possession with Henry, recalled after missing last Saturday's English Premiership draw at Tottenham Hotspur FC, prominent with his running and energy.<br><br>Arsenal on top<br>Despite their dominance, however, Arsenal did not create a clear opening until the 15th minute when, after a slick combination between Henry and Dennis Bergkamp, Robert PirÃ¨s crossed low from the right and the Dutchman guided a stabbed left-foot volley against the bar. Arsenal then began to flow forward freely, but Sparta showed their threat on the break when LukÃ¡Âš Zelenka forced Manuel Almunia - playing in place of Jens Lehmann who was a late withdrawal with a back problem - to make a sprawling save.<br><br>Curling opener<br>The hosts continued to press and took the lead in the 23rd minute. A passing move involving several players swept from right to left, with JosÃ© Antonio Reyes back-heeling into the path of Henry, who curled a beautiful 20-metre shot low beyond JaromÃ­r BlaÂžek and inside the left-hand post. The goal made Sparta open up and move forward; having played almost entirely in their own half until Henry's strike, they began to push their midfielders into more advanced positions and in one attack Martin HaÂšek fired in a solid shot from the edge of the area that Almunia could only parry.<br><br>Henry excellence<br>As play became more stretched, Arsenal sought to exploit the extra room on the counterattack. Bergkamp ran from his own half for 40 metres before releasing Reyes for a left-foot effort that was pushed away by the diving Sparta goalkeeper. The effervescent Henry was providing the perfect reminder of what the Highbury faithful missed during his recent absence, drawing another diving stop from BlaÂžek with a free-kick as the second half unfolded. The Frenchman added incisiveness to Arsenal's midfield domination; PirÃ¨s and Reyes provided thrust on the flanks and in the centre Bergkamp offered guile, but only Henry had the pace and skill to cause real danger.<br><br>Van Persie salvo<br>Henry was finally withdrawn after 66 minutes, but Van Persie quickly announced his arrival with a well-taken set-piece that BlaÂžek turned away. Arsenal survived an almighty scare moments later as Adam PetrouÂš beat Almunia to a cross, only to watch his header drop on to the roof of the net, but the points were finally guaranteed in the 82nd minute as Van Persie collected a beautiful Bergkamp pass and bent in a shot from the edge of the box. Four minutes later another substitute, Emmanuel EbouÃ©, created the chance for the youngster to sweep in a crowning third.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005. All rights reserved.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Three for Eto'o in BarÃ§a romp</strong><br>Wednesday, 2 November 2005<br>by Lucas Brown<br>from Camp Nou<br><br>FC Barcelona overwhelmed Panathinaikos FC with a glittering display of attacking football to move within a point of the UEFA Champions League knockout stages.<br><br>Point needed<br>Any hope Panathinaikos had of a repeat of the first game between these sides - the goalless draw in Athens - was dashed inside the first minute as Mark van Bommel scored a scintillating opener. Samul Eto'o and Lionel Messi then took over, with the Cameroonian registering a hat-trick and the 18-year-old Argentinian capping a magnificent individual performance with BarÃ§a's third in the 34th minute. The Catalans now need just a point to win Group C while Panathinaikos are locked on four points with Werder Bremen and Udinese Calcio.<br><br>Scintillating opener<br>Frank Rijkaard's plan to strike early in order to open up the game worked perfectly as AndrÃ©s Iniesta collected the ball in midfield before lifting it over the head of Sotirios Leontiou for Van Bommel to run on to - the Dutchman supplied a sublime finish as he lobbed Mario Galinović from the edge of the area as the goalkeeper advanced.<br><br>Indifferent defending<br>With BarÃ§a in such irrepressible form a second goal was inevitable and it arrived after 13 minutes when Iniesta picked out Eto'o in the box with an accurate centre and the No9 rose unmarked to head into the top corner of the Panathinaikos net. Included in the starting XI as Ludovic Giuly was rested, Messi more than repaid his coach's faith as he struck the third on 33 minutes, albeit with the help of some indifferent defending.<br><br>Delightful flick<br>Filippos Darlas was the culprit, failing to find Galinović with a weak header under pressure from the starlet. Messi did the rest, shrugging off the defender before turning the ball in after delightfully flicking it over the goalkeeper's head from close range. Panathinaikos's best chance of the half came in the 38th minute as Anthony ÂŠeric's cross from the left was met by Flavio ConceiÃ§Ã£o, the former Real Madrid CF midfielder producing a fine save from VÃ­ctor ValdÃ©s.<br><br>Great move<br>Fresh from Saturday's 5-0 defeat of Real Sociedad de FÃºtbol, the Camp Nou crowd were being treated to another feast of attacking football, and they were on their feet again as the fourth arrived six minutes before the break. Messi was involved again, careering down the right before finding Ronaldinho on the edge of the area. The Brazilian looked up, and rolled the ball sideways to Eto'o who hammered in his second from eleven metres.<br><br>Messi influence<br>Rijkaard's tactical plan to make his midfield trio more attacking had worked perfectly as Xavi HernÃ¡ndez sat deep to allow Iniesta and Van Bommel to flourish. However, it was Messi who stole the show in a devastating opening 45 minutes, teasing Darlas continually and generally having a youthful hand in the majority of the Blaugrana's moves.<br><br>Superb goal<br>Indeed, Messi created the fifth and best goal in the 64th minute, breaking clear in midfield before cutting a reverse pass to Eto'o. The Cameroonian did the rest, racing forward and curling a brilliant shot from the edge of the box over Galinović and into the opposite corner. The second half was something of a damage limitation exercise for the visitors, although it would not have flattered Barcelona had Galinović not superbly saved Ronaldinho's 71st-minute free-kick.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>AÃ¨imoviÃ¨ goal gets Lille going</strong><br>Wednesday, 2 November 2005<br>by Matthew Spiro<br>from Stade de France<br><br>A first-half goal from Milenko AÃ¨imoviÃ¨ helped LOSC Lille MÃ©tropole secure a fine 1-0 victory over Manchester United FC on Wednesday, a result which brings the French side right into contention in UEFA Champions League Group D.<br><br>Level on points<br>The Slovenian's goal, which was Lille's first in the competition, came six minutes before the break in a tight, keenly-contested game at the Stade de France. Lille's first win of the campaign puts them level on five points with United, but ahead in second place with a better head-to-head record. Villarreal CF top the pool with six points after defeating SL Benfica, on four.<br><br>Attacking lineup<br>Lille lined up with a more attacking team than the one that gained a goalless draw at Old Trafford, as they looked to open their Champions League goal account in their fourth outing. Geoffrey Dernis replaced defender Milivoje VitakiÃ¦ to provide width on the left, while AÃ¨imoviÃ¨ played as a second forward just behind Matt Moussilou.<br><br>Moussilou effort<br>Claude Puel's selection almost bore fruit in the opening minutes, as Dernis broke goal-side of John O'Shea and delivered a low cross just too far in front of Mathieu Debuchy. AÃ¨imoviÃ¨ then flicked a pass cleverly to Moussilou who snatched at his shot and fired over. It was a confident start from Lille but the visitors, who conceded four against Middlesbrough FC at the weekend, held firm at the back.<br><br>Rooney's return<br>Perhaps with the intention of offering added protection to his defence, Sir Alex Ferguson brought Kieran Richardson into a three-man central midfield in the absence of the suspended Paul Scholes. Wayne Rooney was back from his ban, however, and he helped create United's first chance for Cristiano Ronaldo, who scuffed a shot straight at Tony Sylva.<br><br>Midfield battle<br>With much of the game being played in the central third, both sides struggled to find space. Lille did not hesitate to try their luck from distance but Mathieu Bodmer, Moussilou and Dernis all failed to keep their strikes down. Meanwhile, Ruud van Nistelrooij, United's captain for the evening, cut an isolated figure in attack.<br><br>Long-awaited breakthrough<br>The moment the Lille fans had been craving since the start of their team's European adventure arrived seven minutes before the interval. Captain GrÃ©gory Tafforeau was the inspiration, bursting out of defence and playing a low pass into the area from the left side. AÃ¨imoviÃ¨ ghosted between United's central defenders and side-footed a crisp shot past Edwin van der Sar.<br><br>Tafforeau strike<br>Their spirits visibly lifted by the goal, Lille started the second half in determined fashion and soon threatened to score again. After Alan Smith had brought AÃ¨imoviÃ¨ down on the edge of the box, Tafforeau fired a curling free-kick that was brilliantly tipped over by Van der Sar. Moments later, Wes Brown cut out Dernis's visionary pass at full stretch to deny Moussilou a clear opening.<br><br>Whisker away<br>Just as Lille were starting to dominate their more illustrious opponents, United came within a whisker of equalising. Rooney's left-wing corner was diverted on to the underside of the bar by a combination of Ronaldo and Van Nistelrooij before Dernis chested the ball off the line.<br><br>Park chance<br>Lille were content to soak up pressure and look to counterattack, a ploy which almost paid dividends on 71 minutes when Bodmer surged through midfield and found Debuchy whose cross was headed over by Moussilou. United had one golden opportunity to claim a valuable point towards the end, but substitute Ji-Sung Park drove wide after a rare lapse in the heart of the Lille defence.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Bayern burst into knockout stages</strong><br>Tuesday, 22 November 2005<br>by Andreas Alf<br>from FuÃŸball Arena MÃ¼nchen<br><br>FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen cruised to the top of UEFA Champions League Group A and into the knockout rounds with an impressive 4-0 demolition of Austrian champions SK Rapid Wien in snowy conditions.<br><br>Makaay double<br>Roy Makaay finally broke his UEFA Champions League duck this season with two second-half strikes in quick succession but Sebastian Deisler, who opened the scoring midway through the opening period, was Bayern's inspiration in the absence of the injured Michael Ballack and Mehmet Scholl. Stand-in playmaker Ali Karimi was also on target.<br><br>Early chances<br>Bayern's all-out attack failed to materialise initially and Rapid, without the suspended Andreas Dober and the injured Axel Lawaree and Marcin Adamski, had the first opportunity of note but Steffen Hofmann's long-range attempt was deflected wide. Bayern's early efforts amounted to a ValÃ©rien IsmaÃ«l downward header from a corner that flew askew and a Makaay free-kick that missed the target.<br><br>Deadly Deisler<br>Bayern upped the tempo thereafter with Deisler and ZÃ© Roberto to the fore. Deisler's excellent 40-metre pass found Makaay but the striker's ambitious close-range volley sailed over the crossbar. The same players combined to better effect for the breakthrough goal after 21 minutes. Makaay rolled the ball into Deisler's path along the edge of the penalty area and the midfielder arrowed a brilliantly-measured shot beyond Helge Payer and into the bottom corner.<br><br>Bayern denied<br>Duly buoyed, Bayern took command but failed to add to their lead. IsmaÃ«l looked set to do so after 30 minutes only for Martin Demichelis to get in his way as he prepared to head into the net while ZÃ© Roberto missed a simple chance three minutes later when he nodded wide after Makaay had shown great vision and technique to pick him out with a wonderful cross using the outside of his right foot.<br><br>Pizarro misses<br>Further profligacy came from Claudio Pizarro who flicked and headed wide in quick succession four minutes before the break. The Peruvian nodded over two minutes after the restart as Bayern continued to dominate. Bastian Schweinsteiger had been introduced for ZÃ© Roberto at half-time and the substitute was in the thick of the action after 54 minutes when his mazy run and subsequent shot earned a corner. He delivered the set-piece himself with the ball eluding everybody to fall perfectly for Karimi, who controlled on his chest before volleying home.<br><br>Lahm contribution<br>Bayern were sufficiently in the comfort zone to be able to give defender Philipp Lahm only his second appearance since sustaining a cruciate ligament injury in May, with Bixente Lizarazu making way after 63 minutes. Rapid responded with a rare attack but Muhammet AkagÃ¼ndÃ¼z was well wide with his effort.<br><br>Makaay makes mark<br>Normal service was resumed after 67 minutes but the normally accurate Makaay side-footed wide after more good work from Schweinsteiger. However, the No10 finally registered his first goal of the campaign after 72 minutes with a composed low finish after being put clear by another sublime Schweinsteiger pass.<br><br>Double delight<br>Makaay pounced again five minutes later, rounding Payer after being supplied by Demichelis. Rapid had chances in the final ten minutes through AkagÃ¼ndÃ¼z and Andreas Ivanschitz but never looked remotely like picking up a first win in 12 competition matches or even a first point in the group. Bayern, meanwhile, lead Juventus on goal difference after an imperious performance.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005. All rights reserved.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>De Jong ensures Ajax advance</strong><br>Tuesday, 22 November 2005<br>by Derek Brookman<br>from Amsterdam ArenA<br><br>Two opportunist strikes from substitute Nigel de Jong were enough to seal AFC Ajax's place in the knockout stages of the UEFA Champions League following a tightly-fought Group B contest with AC Sparta Praha.<br><br>De Jong double<br>De Jong converted Wesley Sneijder's clever cross in the 68th minute before slotting in a Steven Pienaar pass in the 89th minute to send Ajax into the last 16. Martin PetrÃ¡Âš gave Sparta late hope in the dying moments as he took advantage of some poor defending, but Ajax held on.<br><br>Cautious Sparta<br>Ajax started with Markus Rosenberg, a goalscoring substitute at the weekend, on the bench as Yannis Anastasiou took up the centre-forward role, flanked by Nourdin Boukhari on the left and Pienaar on the right. Thomas Vermaelen, the 20-year-old Belgian defender, was a surprise inclusion at the back. Sparta erred more on the side of caution, with the towering figure of Libor DoÂšek ploughing a lone furrow in attack.<br><br>Grygera gift<br>Sneijder was the first man to threaten either goal, his rasping effort from the edge of the area testing JaromÃ­r BlaÂžek but the Czech Republic goalkeeper was equal to the challenge. A minute later, Anastasiou's control let him down in a promising position. ZdenÃ¬k Grygera then almost presented his countrymen with the opening goal, slicing a clearance narrowly over his own crossbar, before Vermaelen headed Sneijder's excellent centre wastefully wide after 12 minutes.<br><br>Attacking verve<br>Most of the attacking impulses were being generated by the home team, with Sparta attempting to play on the counterattack but without any great purpose. The next half-chance fell to Boukhari, who worked a one-two with Anastasiou before firing well wide. Just after the half-hour Sparta made a promising break but, with a man spare, OndÃ¸ej HerzÃ¡n fell over the ball and the moment was lost.<br><br>Long balls<br>Too often Ajax ran out of ideas when confronted with Sparta's packed defence, although the hosts did their cause little good by regularly aiming high balls towards Pienaar, one of the smallest players on the pitch. The end of an error-strewn 45 minutes came with neither side seriously threatening to break the deadlock.<br><br>Inspired change<br>Both teams came out unchanged after the break, and within a minute Boukhari fashioned an opening for Anastasiou, but the big Greek missed the target with his low drive. With only seven minutes of the second half played, Ajax boss Danny Blind made his first change, bringing on De Jong for Olaf Lindenbergh. His arrival injected sparkle into the Ajax midfield, and it was not long before he sent a 20-metre effort fizzing narrowly over.<br><br>Deadlock broken<br>Ajax's second substitution on the hour saw Rosenberg replace the largely ineffectual Anastasiou. But it was De Jong who made the breakthrough after 68 minutes, rising unmarked to nod Sneijder's free-kick past BlaÂžek. Sparta responded immediately by swapping midfielder LukÃ¡Âš Zelenka for attacker Miroslav SlepiÃ¨ka.<br><br>Rosenberg chance<br>Rosenberg had a glorious opportunity to wrap up the points after 81 minutes but blazed over from ten metres when it looked easier to score. De Jong was more accurate moments later, however. Although the introduction of Jan ÂŠimÃ¡k inspired a belated Sparta rally from which PetrÃ¡Âš registered, that strike could not prevent the Czech team slipping to another defeat and they must now overcome FC Thun on Matchday 6 to qualify for the UEFA Cup.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

Employed in midfield against Westerlo, Vincent Kompany made his first start of the group stage at centre-half.<br><br>Early lead<br>Claude Makelele's knee injury gave Michael Essien a start as Chelsea's holding midfielder and William Gallas returned at right-back. JosÃ© Mourinho's decision to retain Crespo in attack in preference to Didier Drogba, available after domestic suspension, was vindicated as early as the eighth minute when the Argentine international fired Chelsea into the lead.<br><br>Mpenza chance<br>An English Premiership scorer against Newcastle United FC last weekend, Crespo read Lampard's left-wing cross perfectly before expertly side-footing a volley into the top corner. The goal was harsh on the hosts who had come close to taking a shock lead when Mpenza beat his marker to Christian Wilhelmsson's cutback but slid his shot wide of the post.<br><br>Double trouble<br>Again the Brussels club were left to rue their profligacy as Chelsea doubled their lead in the 15th minute after a Lampard corner. Crespo's flick-on found Carvalho unmarked at the back post and the Portugal international showed impressive control for a central defender to steer a volley inside Silvio Proto's left upright. Crespo again showcased Chelsea's volleying ability as his dipping effort just after the half-hour narrowly cleared the crossbar.<br><br>Impressive effort<br>Coach Frank Vercauteren made a tactical switch at half-time with Oleg Iachtchouk brought on for Vanderhaeghe in a bid to add greater energy to the midfield. The Ukrainian was deployed behind Mpenza as Anderlecht switched from 4-4-2 to 4-2-3-1 with Goor moving inside from the left to join Vanden Borre in central midfield.<br><br>Zetterberg chance<br>The home side began to enjoy greater possession without really testing Petr Cech in the Chelsea goal. When Mpenza made way for Par Zetterberg, Iachtchouk moved up to centre-forward. Anderlecht nearly fell further behind as they adapted to their new tactics when, under no discernible pressure, Olivier Deschacht nearly gifted Chelsea a third goal. The full-back's attempt to turn the ball behind almost resulted in an own goal.<br><br>Cruise control<br>Chelsea were content to play out the remaining minutes at their own tempo with a display of controlled possession football. Lampard came closest to a third when he struck a post and Crespo could have scored his second goal of the night, before being replaced by Carlton Cole.<br><br>End of the road<br>While victory secures Chelsea a place in the last 16 thanks to Liverpool's draw at home with Real Betis BalompiÃ©, the defeat ends any hopes the Belgium side had of qualifying for the UEFA Cup.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

Until then Porto had looked to have hoisted themselves off the foot of the table thanks to Lisandro's header, scored on the hour. The Portuguese side had completely dominated and, in an amazing final flurry, Rangers goalkeeper Ronald Waterreus did incredibly well to deny Paulo AssunÃ§Ã£o.<br><br>First appearance<br>Porto coach Co Adriaanse sprang something of a surprise by including Lisandro, with Hugo Almeida dropping down to the bench. Although the Argentinian striker had scored twice in the weekend win against A. AcadÃ©mica de Coimbra, he was making his first appearance in this season's Champions League. Two other changes from the Matchday 4 lineup saw both Diego and CÃ©sar Peixoto included.<br><br>McLeish pressure<br>A lengthy injury list, with star striker Dado PrÂšo the latest addition following a hamstring strain, forced five changes on Rangers manager Alex McLeish. Alex Rae and Marvin Andrews were starting a game for the first time in the group while Francis Jeffers, a far less imposing figure than PrÂšo, was deployed as the lone striker.<br><br>Early chance<br>With just three points to their name and starting the night at the foot of the table, the onus was on Porto to attack and they went hunting the opening goal from the first whistle with Ricardo Quaresma and Diego particularly strong influences. The former, a Portuguese Under-21 international, showed his trickery by immediately slipping the attentions of two defenders before curving a shot at Ronald Waterreus.<br><br>Lisandro header<br>It set the tone for a one-sided first half with Porto testing Rangers' resilience with cleverly angled balls aimed at the heart of the defence or by launching dangerous crosses from out wide. In the seventh minute Lisandro showed his eagerness to make an impact when he got ahead of Andrews to meet Bosingwa's centre but a twisting header flew over the top.<br><br>Slow reactions<br>Diego then worked a shooting chance for himself but Andrews was quickly in to block. The visiting support inside the stadium, so voluble at the start, was reduced to silence as their team desperately tried to hang on - and they could easily have fallen behind before the break had the Porto strikers reacted more quickly to hesitancy in the Rangers rearguard.<br><br>More venom<br>Adriaanse took off a defender, Pedro Emanuel, at the break to try and add more venom to the attack through the inclusion of Almeida. The siege continued and the Rangers defence had to endure one or two more sticky moments before the breakthrough arrived in the 60th minute. Almeida's height made him the obvious target for the high balls Porto love to drift over from the flanks but when Bosingwa sent one in at pace it was Lisandro who rose to meet it a fraction before Fernando Ricksen and tuck his header inside the left-hand post.<br><br>Key substitutions<br>Rangers had to come forward now and McLeish's substitutions reflected their need for goals. Ferguson shot badly off target but then Ricksen's high ball played on the run was met at the far post by Burke, another late replacement, and there was 19-year-old McCormack to guide it over the line.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

He added another shortly after half-time, and although he missed a gilt-edged chance soon after, he soon silenced the SÃ¼krÃ¼ SaraÃ§oglu stadium with two goals in six minutes midway through the half.<br><br>Fresh heart<br>FenerbahÃ§e coach Christoph Daum fielded a new-look formation to compensate for the three Brazilians he was missing through injury or suspension. He omitted a fourth, striker MÃ¡rcio Nobre, in favour of a reinforced midfield as he sought to compensate for the absence of suspended ball-winner Marco AurÃ©lio. Captain Ãœmit Ã–zat was switched from the heart of defence to central midfield and, with FÃ¡bio Luciano suspended, Daum opted for an untried centre-back pairing of Servet Ã‡etin and Deniz BariÂº.<br><br>Early efforts<br>Spearheaded by Alberto Gilardino and Shevchenko, Milan were quick to test the Turkish side's new-look back line. The visitors earned two early corners, and peppered the FenerbahÃ§e penalty area with a series of searching balls, but the home side stood up to the test and soon began to push forward themselves. Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti had also made defensive changes, with Serginho and Dario ÂŠimiÃ¦ replacing the suspended Jaap Stam and injured Cafu, and the pair were found wanting when Ãœmit drove an early shot just over the bar.<br><br>Seedorf surge<br>But just as a Stephen Appiah-inspired FenerbahÃ§e side were beginning to look threatening, Milan took the lead. Clarence Seedorf latched on to the ball in midfield and quickly slid it along the greasy surface into the path of Shevchenko. Servet tried in vain to catch the Ukrainian, who coolly slotted between goalkeeper Volkan Demirel's legs Â– his 50th goal in UEFA club competition. It could have been two six minutes later when a low Seedorf drive forced Volkan into a full-length save as Milan began to dominate.<br><br>Superb second<br>Seedorf was proving a constant menace to the Istanbul outfit's shaky defence, and was again the instigator just after the half-hour, knocking a perfectly-weighted pass into the path of Rui Costa. The Portuguese playmaker, on as a replacement after KakÃ¡ had hobbled off, blazed over with the goal at his mercy. Shevchenko demonstrated far more poise six minutes after the restart, feinting past the beleaguered Servet and firing a long-range shot beyond Volkan's despairing dive.<br><br>Shevchenko dominant<br>By this stage Dida was still relatively untested in the Milan goal, but FenerbahÃ§e defender Ã–nder Turaci finally forced a save soon after with a blistering strike. It was a brief respite for the home team, and the Rossoneri should have been 3-0 up on the hour when Shevchenko slipped past Servet with ease, but the striker delayed too long and his eventual effort was cleared off the line by Serkan Balci. He quickly made amends, and nine minutes later completed his hat-trick, drifting behind the defence to tap in Serginho's low left-wing cross.<br><br>Crisp finish<br>Shevchenko soon added a fourth, with a crisp finish after substitute Christian Vieri capitalised on a defensive misunderstanding as Milan climbed top of Group E. They must still win their final fixture at home to FC Schalke 04 to be assured of a knockout place, while the best FenerbahÃ§e can now hope for is a UEFA Cup berth.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Carew craftiness denies Madrid</strong><br>Wednesday, 23 November 2005<br>by Andy Hall<br>from Madrid<br><br>Olympique Lyonnais will go into the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League as group winners after securing a 1-1 draw against Real Madrid CF at the Santiago BernabÃ©u.<br><br>Cheeky Carew<br>An audacious backheel from John Carew after 72 minutes was enough to give Lyon the point they required from their visit to the Spanish capital to top Group F, having yet to lose a game. Madrid had earlier gone in with a half-time lead after Guti was in the right place at the right time to blast in the opening goal of the game following a David Beckham set-piece just before the break.<br><br>Confidence knocked<br>The home team went into the game still struggling to come to terms with the 3-0 reverse to FC Barcelona which not only dented morale but also claimed injury victims in Ronaldo (ankle) and RaÃºl GonzÃ¡lez (knee). With qualification to the knock-out stages secured, Madrid's intentions ahead of the game were to make up for that sorry weekend defeat by earning a three-goal win, which would keep them in contention to top the group.<br><br>Salgado rested<br>Coach Wanderley Luxemburgo made the surprise decision to hand centre-back Francisco PavÃ³n his first start in two months and pushed Sergio Ramos into midfield alongside Pablo GarcÃ­a. Carlos Diogo was deployed at right-back instead of MÃ­chel Salgado. Zinedine Zidane, flanked by David Beckham and stand-in captain Guti, supported lone striker Robinho. Visiting coach GÃ©rard Houllier also tweaked his defence, preferring the more defensively-minded Sylvian Monsoreau to JÃ©rÃ©my Berthold. In attack, Sidney Govou retained his place on the right wing to the detriment of Sylvian Wiltord.<br><br>Guti joy<br>The game started innocuously enough before Madrid fired the first warning shot. Robinho arrived just too late to connect with Beckham's raking cross on four minutes but the move immediately stirred their French counterparts, who responded with a low, angled shot from Carew which Iker Casillas comfortably blocked. Guti was denied twice, first by GrÃ©gory Coupet, who turned his low drive over, then Anthony RÃ©veillÃ¨re, who miraculously cleared a fierce header from the midfielder off the line. At the other end, free-kick specialist Juninho Pernambucano let fly a couple of set-pieces, though neither troubled Casillas. Guti's luck finally changed five minutes before half-time when Mahamadou Diarra deflected Beckham's free-kick into his path, leaving the Spanish international to fire home from the six-metre box.<br><br>End to end action<br>The second half started just as the first had ended with an exchange of chances at either end. Lyon missed a golden opportunity to level when Cris reacted to send a diving header just inches past the post and Carew did similarly, snapping at a loose ball but misdirecting his shot wide after outmuscling Ivan Helguera. For Madrid, Robinho arrived at the far post to lash a volley into the stands as the hour came up.<br><br>Lyon level<br>The visitors drew level with the hosts midway through the half with a crafty piece of invention from Carew. Receiving the ball from Sylvain Wiltord's cutback with his back to goal, the Norwegian forward back heeled the ball through the legs of Roberto Carlos as Casillas could only watch it trickle over the line. It could have got worse for the home team in the 83rd minute, when Pablo GarcÃ­a fouled Fred from 40 metres out and the resultant free-kick from Juninho whistled just past Casillas's right post. But it mattered little as Lyon did enough to earn their place as winners of Group F.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005. All rights reserved.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>KakÃ¡ ensures safe Milan passage</strong><br>Tuesday, 6 December 2005<br>by Ivan Carvalho<br>from San Siro<br><br>Two second-half goals from KakÃ¡ helped AC Milan squeeze into the UEFA Champions League knockout rounds with a hard-earned victory against FC Schalke 04 that secured first place in Group E.<br><br>KakÃ¡ crucial<br>The Italian side began the night in top spot, and needing a point - though not a high-scoring draw - to progress, looked on course for the last 16 when Andrea Pirlo curled in a spectacular free-kick shortly before half-time. Christian Poulsen levelled almost immediately, however, but a quick double from KakÃ¡ early in the second period put the home team in control, before Lincoln revived Schalke's hopes in the 66th minute and forced Milan to hang on.<br><br>Experience wins out<br>With qualification on the line, the stakes could not have been higher. Fortunately, both coaches could breathe easier knowing key defenders had passed late fitness tests as Milan's Paolo Maldini and Schalke's Marcelo Bordon were available to reinforce their back lines. Milan's 37-year-old captain joined Alessandro Nesta in central defence while Jaap Stam returned from suspension to fill the right-back slot. In attack, experience won over youth, as 32-year-old Filippo Inzaghi started alongside Andriy Shevchenko, in a strike force boasting an intimidating 101 European goals.<br><br>Altıntop opportunity<br>The early play was concentrated in the middle third of the pitch as possession was won and lost at breakneck speed until Schalke right-back Rafinha pushed forward to create the first chance of the evening for Kevin Kuranyi, but the German international's half-volley blazed high over Dida's goal. Intent on reaching the knockout phase for the first time, Schalke stepped up a gear as midfielder Hamit Altıntop robbed Maldini and charged down the right before unleashing a low drive that sailed wide of the far post. In racing back to challenge Altıntop, Maldini was injured and limped off to be replaced by Dario ÂŠimić.<br><br>Goal flurry<br>However, the odds immediately shifted back in the hosts' favour when KakÃ¡ was fouled outside the area, giving Pirlo a free-kick opportunity. The Italian international did not disappoint with a masterful right-footed effort that flew into the top corner and left Frank Rost rooted to the spot. No matter. Schalke drew level two minutes later as Lincoln curled in a set-piece of his own for midfielder Poulsen to head past Dida.<br><br>KakÃ¡ delight<br>The momentum switched back to Milan after the break, though, thanks mainly to the selfless work of Shevchenko. The 2004 European Footballer of the Year took the ball just inside the Schalke half and absorbed the attention of two defenders before laying off for KakÃ¡ on the edge of the box. The Brazilian did well to shake off his marker before thumping a shot past Rost. That effort was the cue for Milan to increase the pressure. Their third goal duly arrived when KakÃ¡ collected possession after Shevchenko had been unable to connect with Inzaghi's pass from the right, and poked in to secure a seemingly unassailable advantage.<br><br>Lincoln hope<br>Yet Schalke refused to go down quietly. Lincoln seized on a deflected strike to beat Dida in the 66th minute and resurrect German ambitions. Another goal would not come for the visitors, however, who had to settle for third position and a place in the UEFA Cup Round of 32.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005. All rights reserved.<br></div>

Rivaldo, a former FC Barcelona playmaker, had the final say, putting his old rivals to the sword three minutes from time when finishing from close range. It was the Greek champions' first victory in Group F, a pool they prop up with Rosenborg BK claiming the UEFA Cup berth.<br><br>Unfamiliar faces<br>The 42-year-old LÃ³pez Caro, promoted from the B team after Vanderlei Luxemburgo's sacking on Sunday, saw his charges fold after an impressive first half as their inexperience told. The visitors had an unfamiliar face in the dugout at the Georgios Karaiskakis stadium and several more on the pitch, with five players starting in the competition for the first time this season.<br><br>League leaders<br>Although the final Group F positions were settled before kick-off, both clubs had plenty to prove. Alpha Ethniki leaders Olympiacos, already condemned to finishing bottom, were desperate to show their true potential after collecting just a point from Matchdays 1-5.<br><br>Ramos header<br>One of few regulars in the Madrid lineup, former Sevilla FC defender Ramos took only seven minutes to open his goal account for the club he joined last summer, angling a back-post header beyond Antonios Nikopolidis after RaÃºl Bravo delivered an inswinging free-kick from the right.<br><br>Crossbar rattled<br>On 16 minutes, Julio Baptista came close to doubling the lead with a set-piece from the edge of the area that eluded the wall and Nikopolidis - but came crashing back off the crossbar. Despite enjoying vast amounts of possession early on, Olympiacos struggled to make inroads. Predrag DjordjeviÃ¦ and Rivaldo had opportunities to test Madrid's debutant goalkeeper Diego LÃ³pez, but both shot straight at him.<br><br>Bulut bullet<br>Three minutes into the second half, the Olympiacos fans were given a fine memento of their campaign in the shape of Bulut's equaliser. A Bravo clearance fell to the Turkish defender 20 metres from goal, and he volleyed emphatically into the left side of the net. Madrid lost their shape and composure, and a flurry of chances followed, with powerful midfielder Yaya TourÃ© particularly influential. He helped set up Pantelis Kafes for a close-range effort that was blocked, and fired narrowly off target with two attempts of his own.<br><br>Late winner<br>Little over 20 minutes remained when Rivaldo was presented with a golden opportunity to put his team in front. Substitute Ioannis Okkas turned his man and rolled a low cross to his unmarked team-mate, who contrived to shoot wide from four metres. Rivaldo nearly made spectacular amends a minute later, but his deft chip drifted to the right. Yet there was still time for the Brazilian to win it, finding the net from a few metres after another surge forward from TourÃ©.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005. All rights reserved.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Chelsea stalemate suits Liverpool</strong><br>Tuesday, 6 December 2005<br>by Trevor Haylett<br>from Stamford Bridge<br><br>Chelsea FC and Liverpool FC remained deadlocked at 0-0 for the third time in four UEFA Champions League meetings this year, leaving the European champions to claim top spot in Group G with Chelsea having to make do with second place.<br><br>Marvels of strength<br>As in last season's semi-final at Stamford Bridge, this was largely a tale of Chelsea pressure with Liverpool defending at their very best. At the back Jamie Carragher and Sami HyypiÃ¤ were marvels of strength and anticipation and they gave the home team no encouragement at all. Chelsea manager JosÃ© Mourinho will be disappointed his side could not take one of three decent second-half openings and that meant both teams completed their six group fixtures having conceded just one goal apiece.<br><br>Speculation<br>There had been speculation that key performers would be rested on either side but in the event both managers played a strong hand. Liverpool made just two alterations to the team that had clinched progress to the knockout rounds on Matchday 5, with Djimi TraorÃ© in at left-back and Luis GarcÃ­a, whose goal divided these clubs in last term's semi-final, preferred to Fernando Morientes.<br><br>Intense opening<br>Chelsea made three changes after injuries ruled out HernÃ¡n Crespo and Joe Cole. Asier Del Horno also dropped to the bench as Paulo Ferreira, Didier Drogba and Arjen Robben returned to the starting XI. The early exchanges made a nonsense of the theory that with qualification assured, the fixture would lack the intensity of previous meetings. It was fast and competitive, and once again the Liverpool defence demonstrated they were in no mood to be broken.<br><br>Gerrard chance<br>GarcÃ­a nearly put his colleagues in trouble early on with a loose pass which gave Chelsea possession just outside the penalty area. It eventually led to a Frank Lampard shot which JosÃ© Manuel Reina did well to beat away. The European champions responded to that alarm with positive intent and Steven Gerrard, taking over after Peter Crouch had laid the ball off, angled a drive beyond the far post.<br><br>Ãˆech save<br>Robben's attempt to find his man from deep in his half then had Chelsea flirting with danger and it required a show of strength from John Terry to hold off GarcÃ­a. Chelsea were shading possession but Liverpool carried genuine menace on the break. In the 31st minute they carved out the most promising chance to date when Gerrard, nominally stationed on the right flank but seizing every opportunity to drift infield, released John Arne Riise. The Norwegian had plenty of time to pick his spot but Petr Ãˆech was equal to it and kept out the shot with his right boot.<br><br>Clever footwork<br>Chelsea replaced Ferreira with Del Horno at the interval, while Liverpool's first substitution saw Riise make way for Harry Kewell just past the hour. By that time, two good opportunities had come and gone for the hosts who were lent strong impetus by the drive of Michael Essien and Robben's clever footwork.<br><br>Gudjohnsen chance<br>A long ball from William Gallas was chested down by Drogba at the far post and in came Robben to slice wide of the right-hand upright. The Dutchman was heavily involved again seven minutes later when Lampard drifted a corner outside the penalty box. Robben helped the ball on and Eidur Gudjohnsen, played onside, hooked over.<br><br>Pinned back<br>Liverpool saw less of the ball as Chelsea pinned them back and Gerrard's influence was not as marked, although the home side could not find the goal which would have won them the group.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

With the game between FC Artmedia and FC Porto finishing goalless in Bratislava, a point sufficed to secure entry to the last 16 for Alex McLeish's men.<br><br>Inter experiment<br>LÃ¸venkrands was a surprise selection as a lone Rangers striker with Thomas Buffel tucking in behind, while room was also found for winger Chris Burke and midfielder Bob Malcolm, making his UEFA Champions League debut alongside captain Barry Ferguson. With qualification assured, Internazionale coach Roberto Mancini took the opportunity to rest some star names with 19-year-old right-back Marco Andreolli given his first taste of the competition.<br><br>Mihajlović threat<br>There was little goalmouth action in the opening stages but Rangers created the first chance on 14 minutes when Burke escaped from NicolÃ¡s Burdisso down the right before picking out Hamed Namouchi at the back post. The Tunisian's header lacked power and conviction, however, allowing Andreolli to clear to safety. At the other end, SiniÂša Mihajlović was causing problems with his inswinging delivery from corners and Malcolm did well to head away under pressure after Andreolli's flick-on had caused panic in the home rearguard.<br><br>LÃ¸venkrands leveller<br>It was a warning that went unheeded and Rangers were duly punished on the half-hour. Mihajlović swung in another tempting ball and this time Adriano rose unchallenged to nod into the net through a ruck of players. Rangers came close to replying six minutes later when Burke's cut-back almost found Buffel in front of goal, but Francesco Toldo was alert and scampered off his line to kick the ball into touch. It was the encouragement McLeish's team needed and two minutes later they were level. Buffel did well to win possession in midfield before brilliantly sending LÃ¸venkrands through, and the Danish international held his nerve to slot past the advancing Toldo.<br><br>Inter reshuffle<br>Mancini responded by sacrificing captain Marco Materazzi for Matteo Momente, with the youngster inserted into left midfield and given the task of keeping an eye on the foraging runs of Burke. The change helped to restore composure to the Nerazzurri ranks and for the first time, striker Obafemi Martins started to threaten with some trademark runs. Rangers appeared content to counterattack at this point, but their sporadic attempts to break out were frustrated by poor distribution, while Inter had to make another substitution when captain Javier Zanetti replaced Andreolli, hurt in a clash with Namouchi.<br><br>Tense finale<br>David Pizarro was booked for a late challenge on Burke as the tension grew in the closing stages, and with three minutes remaining Cristiano Zanetti was dismissed having picked up a second yellow card. From Malcolm's ensuing free-kick, Namouchi headed just over but it mattered little. There was an anxious wait for the final score from Bratislava following the full-time whistle, but the news the crowd wanted duly arrived and the celebrations began in earnest.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

Ibrahimovic added a solo strike while Marek Kincl hit a second-half consolation for the hosts, who were unable to give coach Josef Hickersberger a winning send-off in his penultimate game before taking charge of Austria's national team in January.<br><br>Five new faces<br>Juventus made five changes, Manuele Blasi replacing the injured Emerson while Adrian Mutu, Federico Balzaretti, Robert KovaÃ¨ and Del Piero were given the chance to impress. Rapid, meanwhile, showed only one alteration from their weekend fixture, Sebastian MartÃ­nez making way for Peter Hlinka in central midfield. Despite the changes, Juve were quickly at ease and Patrick Vieira nearly found a way through in the eighth minute after exchanging passes with Ibrahimovic, but Rapid goalkeeper Helge Payer was quickly off his line to avert the danger. Juventus had ample opportunity to stream forward but, despite plenty of possession, there were few chances for Fabio Capello's men who appeared to miss David Trezeguet's ability to lead the line.<br><br>Ivanschitz chances<br>Rapid's Andreas Ivanschitz forced visiting goalkeeper Christian Abbiati into the first meaningful save with a dipping free-kick and had an even better opening just after the half-hour when Kincl's cross found him free but his downward header was palmed away by a sprawling Abbiati. Rapid had cause to regret that miss almost immediately as Del Piero's long-range free-kick left Payer helpless for the Italian club's landmark European Cup goal.<br><br>Juve take command<br>Their 301st came three minutes before the break as Ibrahimovic was quickest to a loose ball midway inside the Rapid half and advanced unchecked before calmly stroking a low shot inside Payer's right-hand post. The home side tried to rally and Kincl's back-heel gave GyÃ¶rgy KorsÃ³s a glimpse of goal but the midfielder aimed too high. Juve again made the Austrian team pay within seconds as Mauro Camoranesi's right-wing centre fell to Ibrahimovic, whose effort was diverted past Payer by Del Piero for his record-equalling strike.<br><br>Rapid response<br>Capello decided to withdraw Ibrahimovic for Marcelo Zalayeta at the start of the second half, but it was Rapid who threatened first through Ivanschitz, whose low drive was gathered by Abbiati. The encouragement the home crowd wanted did arrive in the 52nd minute, however, as Hlinka returned an Ivanschitz corner into the penalty area and Kincl slipped the ball under Abbiati for his second UEFA Champions League goal of the season.<br><br>Testing times<br>Muhammet AkagÃ¼ndÃ¼z tested Abbiati again at his near post as Rapid hinted at an unlikely recovery and Juventus sought to regain control by replacing Mutu with Gianluca Pessotto, but instead Rapid captain Steffen Hofmann saw a curling free-kick deflected just wide. Andreas Dober then found space to shoot in the 74th minute yet his attempt sailed high and wide, and from then on chances were rare for either team as Juve played out time safe in the knowledge of a job well done.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.

However, with both sides already through to the knockout rounds, there was no great cause for regret.<br><br>Youthful endeavour<br>Despite the 'dead rubber' nature of the occasion, the two coaches' selections ensured there would be plenty of youthful exuberance on display. Arsenal manager ArsÃ¨ne Wenger included only three players aged 25 or over in his lineup, Ajax coach Danny Blind only four. Commitment would not be a problem.<br><br>Grygera poleaxed<br>Indeed, Ajax centre-back Zdeněk Grygera took an early blow for his team when Henry fired a free-kick straight into the Czech international. Grygera bravely played on for 12 minutes before being replaced by Hatem Trabelsi, but this upset Ajax's rhythm. Chances were few and far between. Ajax probed, and Arsenal, without eight regulars, sought to respond.<br><br>Frustration<br>The hosts' first opportunity came when JosÃ© Antonio Reyes's corner from the right fell to Quincy Owusu-Abeyie in front of goal, but the 19-year-old Dutch forward was unable to swivel and connect. There were further signs of Arsenal frustration when two players were booked in four minutes, Mathieu Flamini and Aleksandr Hleb being cautioned for fouls. Hleb's late challenge on Hedwiges Maduro resulted in the midfielder limping off to be substituted by Nigel De Jong.<br><br>Arsenal chances<br>Ten minutes before the interval, though, Arsenal had a decent opening. Owusu-Abeyie robbed Thomas Vermaelen on the right, but rushed his pass and failed to find Henry, who was unmarked in the middle. Little had been seen of the French international, although shortly after he almost created a goal for Sebastian Larsson with a quick-thinking cross that the Swede volleyed wide.<br><br>Stekelenburg save<br>This encouragement for the home support was followed by a surging 50-metre run out of defence by Philippe Senderos. He supplied Henry, who in turn fed Owusu-Abeyie on the right. The teenager cut inside and fired a left-footed effort which was parried by Stekelenburg and cleared.<br><br>Ajax relief<br>It was three minutes into first-half stoppage time that Ajax could really breathe a sigh of relief, though. Reyes earned a penalty by going down under TomÃ¡Âš GalÃ¡sek's challenge, only for Henry to fluff his lines.<br><br>Tough tackle<br>The midfield stalemate continued in the opening phase of the second period, with both teams working hard without making tangible progress. Then Reyes, racing clear down the left, was brought down by a late Johnny Heitinga tackle that prompted the third yellow card of the night and forced the Spanish international to hobble off. It was the cue for Robin van Persie, formerly of Ajax's great rivals Feyenoord, to enter the fray.<br><br>Van Persie persistence<br>The latter made an instant impression and his persistence on the right of the area, brushing past two markers, produced Arsenal's best moment of the half as Stekelenburg had to make a fine save. At the other end a Senderos mistake let in Markus Rosenberg, but the Swedish international blazed over.<br><br>Happy ending<br>As the weather worsened, the two sides seemed content with the draw, marking Arsenal's first failure to win at Highbury in all competitions since February. However, with a last-16 place already confirmed, neither coach will mourn the loss of two points tonight.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005. All rights reserved.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>BarÃ§a favour sends Bremen through</strong><br>Wednesday, 7 December 2005<br>by Andreas Alf<br>from Weserstadion<br><br>Werder Bremen may have scored five goals of their own to comfortably defeat Panathinaikos FC, but it was a telling strike hundreds of kilometres away in Italy which ultimately sealed their passage to the first knockout round of the UEFA Champions League.<br><br>Packed house<br>Bremen entered Matchday 6 at the foot of Group C, yet knew they would advance with a win should FC Barcelona do likewise at Udinese Calcio. An early Johan Micoud penalty, two Nelson Valdez goals and further efforts from Miroslav Klose and Torsten Frings enabled Bremen to keep their half of the bargain, although supporters at the packed Weserstadion were only able to celebrate when news filtered through of BarÃ§a's late success.<br><br>Defensive rock<br>With Ivan KlasniÃ¦ failing to recover from his appendix operation and Tim Borowski missing with a groin injury, the Bundesliga side paired Valdez and Klose - playing with the aid of a protective mask - in attack to great effect. Jurica VranjeÂš deputised for Borowski while defensive rock Naldo was benched for the first time this season, sidelined literally by a pain in the neck. In came Leon Andreasen.<br><br>Defensive team<br>Needing a draw to reach the UEFA Cup ahead of their hosts, Alberto Malesani plumped for a defensive selection featuring SÃ¡ndor Torghelle as the lone striker in front of a five-man midfield. That quintet was supposed to act as a shield as well as counterattacking when the opportunity arose, but failed to do either as Bremen made a blistering start. With less than two minutes gone, Frings slipped a beautiful low ball through to Klose who was sent crashing to the turf by goalkeeper Mario GalinoviÃ¦.<br><br>Converted penalty<br>Having been shown a yellow card, GalinoviÃ¦'s next act was to pick the ball out of the net after Micoud cheekily sent him the wrong way with his penalty. Opposition playmaker Ezequiel GonzÃ¡lez was again his team's most creative performer, playing in Dimitrios Papadopoulos whose shot from a sharp angle flew the wrong side of the post.<br><br>Excellent goals<br>Within minutes, though, Panathinaikos were 3-0 down as the German club registered two excellent goals. The first owed much to fine teamwork and composure as Micoud brilliantly headed a Christian Schulz free-kick from the right into the path of Valdez. The Paraguayan had time to stoop and control before turning the ball in from five metres.<br><br>Perfect pass<br>He struck his second three minutes later with Micoud again involved. He found space in an advanced position before playing another perfect pass to Valdez who comfortably touched it beyond GalinoviÃ¦ from close range. The Greek visitors had every right to be crestfallen as they trudged off at half-time, yet they were surprisingly sprightly as play resumed, GonzÃ¡lez doing his best to trouble home goalkeeper Andreas Reinke.<br><br>Klose composed<br>When the fourth goal of the evening arrived, however, it went Bremen's way as Micoud sprayed a long ball forward for Klose to chase. The German international outstripped the last defender and had the nous to tempt GalinoviÃ¦ to ground before calmly slotting into an empty net. With the match over, as well as their European ambitions, Panathinaikos reduced arrears as Nasief Morris outjumped Valdez to nod in a Loukas Vintra corner.<br><br>Handsome victory<br>Valdez could have made amends soon after, only to head Klose's cross wide. Yet it was to have no bearing on the game, as the crowd rose as one to salute Santiago Ezquerro's 85th-minute strike for Barcelona. The Catalans had time to add another, as did Bremen as Frings capped a momentous night in added time.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005. All rights reserved.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>United undone by brilliant Benfica</strong><br>Wednesday, 7 December 2005<br>by Paul Saffer<br>from EstÃ¡dio da Luz<br><br>Goals from Geovanni and Beto stunned Manchester United FC and enabled SL Benfica to reach the UEFA Champions League knockout rounds for the first time since 1994/95.<br><br>No consolation<br>It meant United, who threw away an early lead achieved through Paul Scholes, failed to advance from the group stage for the first time in ten years, and by finishing bottom of Group D have not even a UEFA Cup place for consolation.<br><br>Neville role<br>In SimÃ£o's continued absence, one of a number of Benfica injuries, Ronald Koeman deployed Geovanni in the left-sided attacking role. In direct opposition was the man appointed United captain in Roy Keane's stead, Gary Neville. Keane's departure has also led Sir Alex Ferguson to give the 4-4-2 formation primacy, though from the start it was clear that local prodigy, and target for the Benfica fans' ire, Cristiano Ronaldo, had freedom to roam.<br><br>Scholes scores<br>Barely six minutes had elapsed when Neville performed wing duties to perfection. He darted free on the right following a clever Ryan Giggs ball and the skipper's cross was forced in by Scholes virtually on the line. It was a blow that stunned the home supporters, who had been in lusty voice long before kick-off, though Beto did immediately force Edwin van der Sar to save.<br><br>All square<br>Attack remained the watchword for both teams, and soon it was Benfica's turn to celebrate. NÃ©lson swung in a centre from the right and, spotting a gap, Geovanni produced a far-post diving header of geometric precision. Even these sides could not keep up the pace of that breathless start, and it was some 13 minutes before the next real opportunity, a looping Scholes effort tipped over by Quim. The resulting Giggs corner also caused Benfica momentary concern, but the overriding emotion was joy not long after.<br><br>Benfica ahead<br>A home attack was looking tentative when Beto opted to let fly from outside the area. The deflection off Scholes meant Van der Sar did not stand a chance, and the Luz stands shook with delight. Bottom of the provisional standings, United now required another goal, but it was Benfica who dominated until the break, revelling in their swift turnaround and counterattacking at speed.<br><br>Historic resonance<br>Half-time brought a presentation reuniting the stars of these clubs' famous 1960s meetings, including EusÃ©bio and Sir Bobby Charlton, and the event was given poignancy by George Best's recent death. The 5-1 United victory on their visit here in that era may have been on Benfica's minds when they emerged from the break; they began the second period determined not to allow their visitors to make the Luz their own again.<br><br>Ronaldo miss<br>LuisÃ£o in particular was a rock in defence, making a crucial saving tackle on Wayne Rooney and looking commanding in the air. Even when United did find an opening just before the hour thanks to a four-man passing move, Ronaldo slid the ball just past the far post. The introduction of Louis Saha and then Ji-Sung Park showed United's need to find new sources of attack, though a Rooney free-kick went close.<br><br>Swift counter<br>A crossed Rooney set-piece then troubled Benfica, before Koeman introduced JoÃ£o Pereira, whose first act was to turn a Nuno Gomes pass wide. Geovanni then made Van der Sar save in another swift counter, but of more importance was that Benfica repelled all a frustrated United had to offer and made it through on a night which started so unpromisingly for them.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2005.
