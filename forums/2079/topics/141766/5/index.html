We think it is a straight break."<br><br>Despite the problems with the pitch, Chelsea have yet to lose at Stamford Bridge this season.<br><br>"I'm certain the players would prefer to play on a pristine pitch," said the Chelsea spokesman.<br><br>"But hopefully they will benefit in the long term. Don't forget the pitch is the same for both teams and, let's face it, our football isn't suffering."<br></div>

When I was playing and it was 0-0 we would keep the ball and pass it around.<br><br>"That's why Ronaldinho is so good - he knows when to do the tricks and when to keep it simple.<br><br>"When it's 0-0, he concentrates on passing the ball. The time to do tricks is when the game is won."<br><br>Pele's comments echo those of Chelsea chief Jose Mourinho, who also accused Cole of being too flash<br></div>

Following Callum DavidsonÂ’s foul on Franck Queudrue, Stewart DowningÂ’s lofted free-kick picked out the Nigerian at the far post and his header had too much on it for former Boro keeper Carlo Nash to keep out.<br><br>David Nugent was a threat for Preston, particularly in the first half, but Boro held firm to clinch a 2-0 win and make it safely through to the last eight.<br><br></div>
