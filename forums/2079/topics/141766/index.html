            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho insists their Premiership rivals must improve if they hope to even challenge for the title.<br><br>The Blues coasted to their first league championship triumph in 50 years last season and also won the Carling Cup as Mourinho made the most of Roman Abramovich's financial backing.<br><br>And the Portuguese coach, who won the Champions League with Porto, said the emphasis is on Arsenal and Manchester United now to match the champions.<br><br>'This season other teams know how strong we are and they have to improve. If they are the same then they have no chance.<br><br>'We have to show the rest of the Premiership that they cannot win at Stamford Bridge. Every fortnight must be three points, three points, three points.<br><br>'At the start of the season, I wanted to win everything. I'm frustrated because we did not win everything last season,' Mourinho is quoted in The Sun.<br><br>'I don't want people here to remember me as the manager who won the Premiership after 50 years and then had five more seasons of resting on that.<br><br>'We know it will be harder for us this season but I always think the most difficult thing is to win the first trophy then defend it.'<br><br>Mourinho also admitted his surprise about fans' loyalty in Britain, highlighting the case of Sir Alex Ferguson's United, who were given a standing ovation at Old Trafford at the end of the season despite failing to win a trophy.<br><br>'I saw the Manchester United players and manager after their last home game go for a lap of honour after losing to us.<br><br>'If they had done that in Portugal they would have had bottles thrown at them,' said Mourinho.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jose Mourinho heads home to Portugal tomorrow for a high-profile friendly with Benfica needing to decide whether he should adjust his current transfer targets.<br><br>Mourinho is rapidly finding out not even Roman Abramovich's wealth can get him everything he wants.<br><br>After failing in his attempts to sign Steven Gerrard from Liverpool and having two massive bids for Lyon midfielder Michael Essien turned down, the Chelsea boss has now hit a brick wall in his attempts to lure Shaun Wright-Phillips to Stamford Bridge.<br><br>Bolstered by the belief Wright-Phillips has no major desire to leave the club, Manchester City chairman John Wardle almost instantly rejected a Â£20million offer from Chelsea last night and privately claimed it would take a significant increase in the bid just for it to be put to the 23-year-old for discussion.<br><br>It was a brave decision by a man whose club is Â£62million in debt but he backed up his words with actions by letting Wright-Phillips risk injury in a 45-minute appearance at Tranmere last night, the player having let acknowledgement of a bid pass straight over his head.<br><br>'I made him aware there was a bid, but he just passed it off and said `what time is kick-off',' said manager Stuart Pearce, who intends to play Wright-Phillips in today's friendly at Macclesfield and then to Thailand for next week's FA Premier League Asia Trophy.<br><br>'The kid wants to stay here,' added Pearce.<br><br>'He does not want to go anywhere, he wants to stay with me, the club and the supporters.'<br><br>With Chelsea due to depart for their United States tour on Tuesday, time is running out for Mourinho to get Wright-Phillips on board, although the initial suggests are he will be back with an increased offer.<br><br>There is also a suggestion that Arsenal, having just sold Patrick Vieira to Juventus for Â£13.7million, could also enter the market.<br><br>Gunners chief Arsene Wenger has stated his admiration of Wright-Phillips publicly and knows his club offers more sentimental attachment to the England man given the status his stepfather Ian Wright is afforded at Highbury.<br><br>Nevertheless, Wright-Phillips' bond with the Eastlands outfit is strong.<br><br>A product of the City academy, he has never forgotten how the club took him on after he was rejected by Nottingham Forest for being too small and only last night he was handing out prizes at Failsworth High School. His half-brother Bradley is also a team-mate.<br><br>The winger certainly did not look too concerned as he signed autographs prior to the game, beaming from ear-to-ear, even though he could be about to spurn the opportunity of expressing his talent on the Champions League stage.<br><br>Some City officials have been irritated by Chelsea's approach to the potential transfer, believing the Stamford Bridge outfit have been guilty of conducting their business through the media.<br><br>However, Pearce refused to condemn the London outfit.<br><br>'They are very keen on one of our players, who happens to be extremely talented,' he said.<br><br>'Every inquiry these days is blown out of all proportion, no matter who it involves, that is the nature of the game.<br><br>'The bottom line is we have received an offer for Shaun, just as we have received offers for other players this summer. So far, we have accepted one - Jon Macken - and rejected the rest.<br><br>'I have told Chelsea Shaun is not for sale, the chief executive has, the board have and most importantly, so has Shaun.'<br><br>chelsea has themselves to blame.  now everybody expects a massive fee for every player than try to sign.<br><br>this is crazy.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wright-Phillips asks to speak to Chelsea<br>Manchester City boss Stuart Pearce has warned Chelsea they will not get Shaun Wright-Phillips on the cheap.<br><br>Wright-Phillips: Looks to have played his last for City. (BrynLennon/GettyImages)<br>The England international dramatically telephoned City chairman John Wardle this afternoon and requested permission to speak with the Barclays Premiership champions, whose Â£20million bid for the 23-year-old was turned down last night.<br><br>Wright-Phillips made his move barely an hour after he had pulled out of today's 1-1 draw at Macclesfield with a stomach bug just 30 minutes before kick-off.<br><br>His call stunned Wardle, who sincerely believed the Londoner wished to stay at Eastlands, but Wright-Phillips has already been told he will not be allowed to speak to Chelsea until a fee between the clubs has been agreed.<br><br>Although Chelsea have not made any contact with City since yesterday's bid, it would appear virtually certain that confirmation it was still on the table would result in the transfer being pushed through prior to Pearce's side departing for the FA Premier League Asia Trophy in Thailand tomorrow evening.<br><br>The fear in the City camp is that Chelsea could reduce their bid as a result of Wright-Phillips' stunning move - although in that case, the winger, who has three years left on his contract, could yet find himself flying to Bangkok.<br><br>'What has happened today does not mean we will just cave in,' said Pearce.<br><br>'The bottom line is we want the going rate for a player of Shaun Wright-Phillips' ability.<br><br>'Whilst we are not in the position of keeping players who are unhappy, Shaun and his advisers need to be acutely aware we need to get our valuation for him.<br><br>'If we do not, he has rather a lengthy contract.'<br><br>Pearce said nothing would please him more than to see Wright-Phillips boarding the plane at Manchester Airport tomorrow, but realistically he knows it is only a matter of time before a deal is thrashed out.<br><br>Although club officials are seething at what they see as Wright-Phillips pressing them into a corner, Pearce refused to condemn the player, insisting he would be an asset to any team he played for.<br><br>'If Shaun leaves, I will shake his hand,' he said.<br><br>'He will always be welcome at our football club, except on match days when he is a member of the opposition team.<br><br>'I am a little bit frustrated with him but not annoyed. I know him inside out and he is a smashing player to manage.<br><br>'He will be a massive asset to any football club he represents whether that is Manchester City for another 10 years or somebody else.<br><br>'I don't think he is the finished article yet, he can only get better. As someone to work with, he is fantastic and my opinion on that is not going to change.'<br><br>The move just proves what pulling power Roman Abramovich has given Chelsea, although with Damien Duff, Arjen Robben and Joe Cole already at Stamford Bridge, Wright-Phillips will face a major test of his ability just trying to force his way into the starting line-up on a regular basis.<br><br>He will certainly hope to have more success than Scott Parker, whose international ambitions crumbled following his move across London from Charlton.<br><br>For City fans, the news will be a shattering body blow and Pearce will need to act fast to sustain the confidence generated by last season's superb eighth-placed finish.<br><br>With Jon Macken now at Crystal Palace and Robbie Fowler, Antoine Sibierski and, in all probability, Wright-Phillips all absent from the Thailand trip, Pearce has no senior striker available to him.<br><br>The club have been linked with Robbie Keane, Freddie Kanoute and Peter Crouch in recent weeks but so far, the only new signing has been the deal which saw Kiki Musampa's loan spell extended for a further season.<br><br>Defeat at Tranmere last night and a tame 1-1 draw at Moss Rose today, where Yasser Hussein levelled following John Parkin's early opener for the hosts, will not inspire any confidence and as he approaches his first full season in charge Pearce accepts he is facing a major test of his managerial abilities.<br><br>'If this deal does go through, it will be my job to re-ignite the players, get some new faces in and move the team on from there.'</div>

(BrynLennon/GettyImages)<br>A dramatic long weekend, which started with City boss Stuart Pearce insisting the 23-year-old wanted to stay at Eastlands, will end with Wright-Phillips agreeing personal terms, then passing a medical before heading across the Atlantic on Chelsea's pre-season tour of the United States.<br><br>In contrast, the City squad headed out to Thailand for the FA Premier League Asia Trophy tonight still shell-shocked by the loss of their talisman.<br><br>As recently as Friday night, when he signed autographs after what proved to be his final outing in a City shirt at Tranmere, club officials were convinced Wright-Phillips wanted to stay, a major factor behind their rejection of the Â£20million bid from Chelsea which had arrived hours earlier.<br><br>That bullishness evaporated within a 90 minutes on a sunny afternoon at Macclesfield yesterday, when Wright-Phillips pulled out of the Moss Rose friendly with a stomach bug - leaving the visitors team sheet with a blank space alongside the number seven shirt he had been allocated - before telephoning chairman John Wardle as he was being driven home to inform him of his desire to speak to Chelsea.<br><br>Wardle, still on his summer holiday, was devastated by the news but recognised the inevitability of the situation.<br><br>Although Wright-Phillips was initially refused permission to speak with the cash-rich Londoners, it was only to allow City chief executive Alistair Mackintosh to broker the best possible deal.<br><br>Mackintosh managed to prise an extra Â£1million out of Roman Abramovich's wallet, although it is not known whether he has managed to retain the Â£17million up front payment which formed part of the first offer.<br><br>'As a result of Shaun's request to speak to Chelsea we have conducted a series of complex negotiations with Chelsea,' explained communications chief, Paul Tyrrell.<br><br>'A fee for Shaun's transfer has been agreed and consequently we have granted his wish to talk to the other club.'<br><br>The fee far exceeds City's previous biggest sale, the Â£7million received from Fenerbahce for Nicolas Anelka in January, and will help cushion the blow of losing such a popular and brilliant player, who made 150 league and cup starts for the club following his debut in 1999.<br><br>Although Wright-Phillips has won just four caps, he is almost certain to be a member of Sven-Goran Eriksson's World Cup squad next summer.<br><br>It is thought Pearce will be given half the fee to spend on new recruits, with Robbie Keane, Freddie Kanoute, Peter Crouch and Andy Johnson among those being linked to a squad whose only recognised senior striker - Robbie Fowler - missed the flight to Bangkok with a back complaint.<br><br>Pearce had hoped to rush a deal through for former Manchester United forward Andy Cole to fly out with the City party but negotiations were not concluded in time and Mackintosh will stay behind to try to tie up the loose ends of that deal tomorrow.<br><br>Early indications suggest the arrival of Cole will not appease the long-suffering City support, who are fearing the worst for the new campaign - the loss of Wright-Phillips compounded a lacklustre defeat at Tranmere and a draw at League Two Macclesfield.<br><br>And Pearce, whose presence and drive did so much to ensure City finished last term in eighth place following the departure of Kevin Keegan, admits he is facing a major test of his managerial skills.<br><br>'It is my job to re-ignite the players, get some new faces in and move the team on from there,' said Pearce, who claimed he bore no animosity to Wright-Phillips over his conduct.<br><br>'He will always be welcome at our football club, except on matchdays when he is a member of the opposition team.<br><br>'I am a little bit frustrated with him but not annoyed. I know him inside out and he is a smashing player to manage.<br><br>'He will be a massive asset to any football club he represents and I don't think he is the finished article yet, he can only get better.<br><br>'As someone to work with, he is fantastic and my opinion on that is not going to change.'<br><br>seriously speaking i fear for swp career.i just hope he turned out to be a star and improve under jose mourinho rather den be another scott parker.</div>
