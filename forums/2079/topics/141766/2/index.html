Security net for their future .<br><br>Going to Chelsea is about striking JackPot .<br><br>I guess SWP is no exception .<br><br>If there's an option to triple his current wages , why not ?<br><br>It's good for rival clubs that Chelsea signed Stars after Stars , and bench Stars after Stars , and i'm sure in the near future , so said Future Stars are afraid of going to Chelsea and got benched !<br><br>Dunno la , so many wingers for what ?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Piersilvio Berlusconi, son of Milan owner Silvio, has played down the spat between Andrei Shevchenko and Carlo Ancelotti.<br><br>Milan's star striker, a long-term target for Chelsea, had a furious bust-up with his coach with the row caught on Sky Italia cameras.<br><br>Berlusconi did cheekily counter his comments by admitting he rubbished the idea of signing Christian Vieri from city rivals Internazionale recently, but the emphasis was to play down any likelihood of 'Sheva' departing for Stamford Bridge.<br><br>"Did we clinch his [Alberto Gilardino]'s signature? I really didn't know as I have been in my office until late on Monday," declared Berlusconi.<br><br>"Anyway, I'm happy because Gilardino is the player we needed to complete our squad and also a very good boy from a personal point of view.<br><br>"My job is television and I do not make decisions about Milan but I don't think Gilardino's arrival can be linked to Sheva's departure.<br><br>"In my opinion, he has been extraordinary since he joined in 1999 and his commitment to the club makes him a true Rossoneri legend.<br><br>"Anyway, that's the same thing I said when asked about the possibility of signing Vieri from Inter!"<br><br>Television pictures showed the Ukrainian hit-man arguing with Ancelotti, reportedly because the two disagree over the operation he had to undergo before the start of Milan's summer tour.<br><br>somehow i feel rather happy when i read this news..hehe..sheva the number 7 of chelsea is available....mind coming?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea 1-0 AC Milan<br>Chelsea looked in good shape for the forthcoming season as they beat a strong AC Milan side at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts.<br><br>Shaun Wright-Phillips shields the ball from Kakha Kaladze on his Chelsea debut. (BrianBahr/GettyImages)<br>Only a first-half Arjen Robben goal separated the two sides but that did not do justice to the Blues' superiority after Jose Mourinho's side created a host of good chances.<br><br>A succession of substitutions saw Chelsea lose their way a little late on in the second half but the Premiership champions were boosted by a promising display from Â£21million new boy Shaun Wright-Phillips in that period.<br><br>In front of just over 26,000 fans at the home of Super Bowl winners the New England Patriots, Chelsea started much brighter than Milan, beaten finalists in last season's Champions League.<br><br>Damien Duff had a shot from the edge of the area well saved by Greek international Dimitrios Eleftheropoulos after just seven minutes.<br><br>But the keeper could do nothing about a low left-foot strike from a similar position by Robben which went in off the post six minutes later.<br><br>Eleftheropoulos had to come off his line quickly to thwart a Duff break down the right and again did well to hold on to a shot from Frank Lampard as Chelsea piled on the pressure.<br><br>Brazilian full-back Cafu was causing the Blues some problems with his overlapping runs down the right flank but it was Chelsea who continued to look the more threatening.<br><br>Robben and Hernan Crespo combined superbly to set up Lampard but the England midfielder couldn't keep his shot down.<br><br>Robben's electric pace then created an opening for Crespo but the Argentinian striker also fired well over the bar when he should have done better.<br><br>Eidur Gudjohnsen had the ball in the back of the net again after 32 minutes but play had already been stopped for offside against Crespo.<br><br>Milan did almost draw level, however, after another surging run from Cafu led to Geremi deflecting the Brazilian's cross against Clarence Seedorf just a couple of metres out, only for the ball to bounce back into the grateful arms of Carlo Cudicini.<br><br>Chelsea made eight changes at the interval, with Mourinho introducing Petr Cech for Cudicini and electing to start the second half with a totally different back four and front three.<br><br>Glen Johnson, John Terry, Robert Huth and new signing Asier del Horno replaced Geremi, Ricardo Carvalho, William Gallas and Paulo Ferreira in defence, while Joe Cole, Carlton Cole and Wright-Phillips came in for Duff, Crespo and Robben up front.<br><br>The Blues' new line-up started just as brightly, though, with Carlton Cole connecting well with a header which unfortunately went straight at Eleftheropoulos.<br><br>Del Horno picked up a yellow card following a bit of push-and-shove with Cafu and Gudjohnsen made way for Tiago as the match went through a bit of a lull.<br><br>A bustling run by Carlton Cole gave Wright-Phillips the chance to make a dream debut but he screwed his shot wide despite Eleftheropoulos being well out of position.<br><br>The former Manchester City winger looked sharp when racing onto a Lampard through-ball, however, and showed several neat touches in an encouraging display.<br><br>Lampard was replaced by Didier Drogba with 65 minutes on the clock and the Ivory Coast striker should have made it 2-0 soon after when heading over the bar from eight yards out following a superb cross from Johnson.<br><br>Jiri Jarosik came on to replace Carlton Cole while Lassana Diara was given 10 minutes at the end in place of Claude Makelele.<br><br>Both had few chances to shine, though, as Milan enjoyed more of the possession while Chelsea sat back on their lead.<br><br>But there were few worrying moments for Chelsea to endure and the game ended on a low note when Milan midfielder Rino Gattuso was given a rather harsh straight red card for upending Joe Cole.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>YOU WANT MY JOB, ARSENE?</strong><br><br>Nov 1, 2005<br>The New Paper<br><br>ARSENE Wenger doesn't dislike Chelsea.<br><br>On the contrary, and if you accept what Jose Mourinho has to say, the Arsenal boss is in love with Chelsea.<br><br>In the aftermath of the Blues' 4-2 thumping of Blackburn in the Premiership, Mourinho took a dig at his nemesis from the other side of London.<br><br>Speaking in jest, of course, the Portuguese manager asked: 'What's with that guy?<br><br>'Poor chap. I don't know what is happening to him.<br><br>'He is always looking out for us. He is always thinking about us. He is always speaking about us.<br><br>'I don't know what to make out of it.<br><br>'Maybe he wants my job. Maybe he wants to leave Arsenal and come here.<br><br>'Come to think of it, maybe he is in love with Chelsea.'<br><br>Mourinho's broadside was in response to an interview given by Wenger after Chelsea crashed out of the Carling Cup.<br><br>In that interview, the Arsenal boss suggested Chelsea could be stuttering and sliding and that they were no more the invincible force they once were.<br><br>Naturally, it didn't sit well with Mourinho who had said nothing until after Saturday's matches where Arsenal drew and Chelsea won.<br><br>'What's his problem?' Mourinho insisted. 'Has he got something against me or is his problem with Chelsea?'<br><br>With tongue still firmly in cheek, he continued: 'I'm serious. Truly, that guy has a problem with us.'<br><br>Coming on the back of Chelsea's Carling Cup defeat, Wenger said he believed the Blues' aura of invincibility had started to slip.<br><br>The Arsenal manager went on to say he believed Chelsea's draw with Everton and the loss to Charlton had shown up chinks in the champions' armour that opponents can exploit.<br><br>'The big belief has gone.' said Wenger. 'They are like any team when you are performing a little bit less and the players are tired.<br><br>'They are vulnerable.<br><br>'The whole Premiership needs that hope. There is now something there.'<br><br>The Gunners boss also brushed off Mourinho's claims that, despite being knocked out by Charlton, the Blues have still not lost this season.<br><br>'When you are out of a Cup, no matter what is said, you lose.<br><br>'You can say you didn't actually lose but you are out and the train goes on without you,' said Wenger.<br><br>Of course it called for a response from Mourinho and it came after he watched his side throw away a two-goal first-half lead against Blackburn at Stamford Bridge on Saturday before storming back to record their 10th win in 11 Premiership games with two second-half strikes.<br><br>It was a stunning display in a match which also saw Blackburn manager Mark Hughes being sent to the stands by referee Mike Riley for kicking the physio's bag in disgust at a number of the official's decisions.<br><br>Hughes claims he was confused as to why he had been sent from the dugout.<br><br>Mourinho, again, had something to say about that.<br><br>The Portuguese insisted managers should act with more calmness even though he understands the pressures involved.<br><br>'We shouldn't lose our control,' Mourinho insisted. 'We are more experienced than the players. We are older than the players and we are an example for them.<br><br>'But we are also human beings and we can make those kind of mistakes.'<br><br>However, there was little diplomacy in the broadside he had reserved for Wenger.<br><br>'Maybe he should look after himself instead of worrying about us,' he said. 'Maybe he should stop envying us so much.'<br>- PA Sport.<br></div>
