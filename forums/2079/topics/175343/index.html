            <div class='col-md body'>England coach claims that corruption is rife in the Premiership<br><br>Jan 23, 2006<br>The Straits Times<br><br>LONDON - SVEN-GORAN Eriksson's future as England coach is once again being called into question after he claimed that the English Premier League is riddled with corruption.<br><br>His employer, the Football Association, had been expecting nothing more sinister in yesterday's News of the World revelations than some sexual tittle-tattle involving a former secretary, Faria Alam.<br><br>But it would have been shocked to the core by his allegations that managers in England's top league routinely take bungs, or kickbacks, reported The Telegraph.<br><br>The FA - and Eriksson - were in damage control last week, with the coach making grovelling apologies to his players and the FA presenting a supportive front.<br><br>The Swede, who made all the remarks to an undercover journalist disguised as a wealthy Arab, said last Friday that he was taking legal action against the British tabloid.<br><br>The 57-year-old had told the fake sheik that he would be interested in taking over as manager of Aston Villa if England win the World Cup.<br><br>He also made indiscreet remarks about several of his players.<br><br>He has not contested the paper's account of his remarks but claims they were distorted by being taken out of context.<br><br>The lawyers for Eriksson and his agent, Athole Still, will attempt to convince England's High Court that the newspaper had been guilty of an illegal 'breach of confidence'.<br><br>But a spokesman for the paper said then that it stood by the story 100 per cent and promised 'further revelations', which have now been published.<br><br>Eriksson's corruption claims are far more damaging and he is said to have named three prominent clubs.<br><br>The question on everyone's lips is: If he had such intimate knowledge of illegal transfer dealings, then did he not have a moral duty to pass on everything he knew to the FA?<br><br>And if he did so, why did the FA not launch an immediate, full-scale investigation into his claims?<br><br>Eriksson apparently named two 'corrupt' managers during his meeting with the reporter.<br><br>He described one, who appears regularly on television, as 'the worst', while his agent Still, is accused of describing another well-known manager as someone who pulled off a 'big scam'.<br><br>Asked whether managers always get involved with transfers, Eriksson is said to have answered: 'Yeah, they put money in their pockets.'<br><br>If he said nothing of this to the FA, then his position is surely untenable, even if England's hopes of winning the World Cup are severely damaged by his removal as coach.<br><br>And, if he can prove that he did tell his employer, then the FA would face serious questions about its suitability to run the national game.<br><br>The accusations could not have come at a worse time for English football, only a few days after Luton manager Mike Newell was summoned to the FA headquarters to substantiate his claims that bungs are rife in the game.<br><br>FA spokesman Adrian Bevington said on Saturday: 'There will be no comment tonight on any allegations that have been made. We will reflect on them and assess them again in the morning.'<br><br>The most relevant question to be asked of Eriksson is how he had such detailed information about the black market practices of club managers.<br><br>And why, with no evidence that he had passed it on to the authorities, did he do nothing to inform them or attempt to prevent it?<br><br>Following last week's revelations, the FA, while privately concerned by his conduct, made it clear his position was not under threat.<br><br>Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein, a member of the FA's international committee, said: 'There is no doubt that he probably regrets certain things that have happened over the years.<br><br>'But, in the end, we have to move on.'<br></div>
