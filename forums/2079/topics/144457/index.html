            <div class='col-md body'>Aston Villa manager David O'Leary has spelt out his desire for midfielder Gavin McCann and goalkeeper Thomas Sorensen to sign new long-term contracts at the club.<br>O'Leary signed the duo for a combined fee of Â£4million from Sunderland in the summer of 2003.<br><br>McCann and Sorensen are both starting the final year of their current deals and O'Leary is keen for the board of directors to open talks about extending their stays at Villa Park.<br><br>McCann has been a key figure in the centre of the park for Villa and was sorely missed during the second half of last season with a knee problem.<br><br>Sorensen had an outstanding first season for Villa and, although he was less impressive during the last campaign, O'Leary has faith in his ability.<br><br>O'Leary said: Â“I've said all along that in terms of value for money, Gavin and Thomas have been excellent signings for this club.<br><br>Â“Gavin is the kind of unsung hero that is sometimes only appreciated by the players. You sometimes don't realise what he contributes until he is missing from the team.<br><br>Â“Last season he had big problems with his knee but tried to carry on with virtually one leg until it got too bad for him to continue.<br><br>Â“Thomas did not quite show the same form last season as the year before and that sometimes happens to a player when they come back to their club after major championships like Euro 2004.<br><br>Â“But we all know his qualities as a goalkeeper and we want to keep him here.<br><br>Â“I've said to the board of directors that I want talks to start over new contracts because we all want them to stay at Aston Villa.Â”<br><br>McCann has returned to action during Villa's pre-season trip to Sweden and is a certainty to be in the starting line-up if he confirms his return to full fitness, but Sorensen will face competition from Stuart Taylor, who was signed last month from Arsenal.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aston Villa striker Darius Vassell is close to completing a move to Manchester City providing he passes a medical.<br>The England international has returned from the clubÂ’s pre-season tour of Sweden and the Barclays Premiership sides have agreed a fee for the player.<br><br>The 25-year-old has only one year remaining on his contract and the arrival of Kevin Phillips from Southampton increased competition for places, with Vassell told by Villa manager David OÂ’Leary he could go.<br><br>OÂ’Leary told the clubÂ’s official website, avfc.co.uk: Â“Darius was asked to go back to England and there was no reason to stop him.<br><br>"It all happened very quickly yesterday (Sunday) and we were able to get him on a flight.<br><br>"HeÂ’s gone back to have a medical and sign for Manchester City. I canÂ’t say at the moment what the exact fee is, but I think itÂ’s a fee that suits Aston Villa."<br><br>O'Leary insisted financial constraints had not forced the sale.<br><br>"It's not fair to say that I had to sell Darius to bring in money. That would be totally unfair on the club. This is a good deal.<br><br>"I've got a budget where I have to try and get players in, but that's nothing to do with the Darius deal.<br><br>"He had a year left on his contract, we've been offered good money by Manchester City, so it suits everybody all round as it stands.<br><br>"But who knows - the player could maybe go up there and fail to agree terms, so it's not done yet.''<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aston Villa defender Martin Laursen looks set to miss the start of the season after a recurrence of a long-term knee injury.<br>The Denmark centre-half has flown back from the clubÂ’s pre-season tour of Sweden and will have a scan.<br><br>Laursen endured a difficult first season after joining the Midlanders from AC Milan last summer as his problematic knee kept him out of action for most of the campaign.<br><br>Laursen returned to England over the weekend and will have a scan but Villa boss David OÂ’Leary is not optimistic about his chances of making the season curtain-raiser against Bolton Wanderers next month.<br><br>Â“HeÂ’s been sent back to England,Â” OÂ’Leary told the clubÂ’s official website, avfc.co.uk.<br><br>Â“HeÂ’s not happy with his knee and, by the time he got back, there was nothing much we could do over the weekend.<br><br>Â“So weÂ’ll get him scanned hopefully later today (Monday) or tomorrow and then weÂ’ll know how serious it is. But at the moment, he is looking very doubtful for the start of the season.Â”<br><br>The Villa Park chief has received better news from full-back Mark Delaney after revealing the Welshman will be ready for August 13.<br><br>Delaney also returned to Britain, on Friday, and a scan showed a knee injury suffered in training is not serious enough to rule him out long-term.<br><br>Â“Going by the medical people, the scan hasnÂ’t revealed anything to be worried about,Â” OÂ’Leary said.<br><br>Â“I think Mark will be out for a week or maybe 10 days, but thereÂ’s nothing there to concern us.Â”<br><br>Villa drew 1-1 with Jonkoping Sodra on Saturday, Nolberto Solano giving them a second-half lead, and travel to GAIS Gothenburg tomorrow.<br><br></div>
