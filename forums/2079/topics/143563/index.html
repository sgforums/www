            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Celtic snag Japan star Nakamura</strong><br>July 27, 2005<br><br>SCOTTISH giants Celtic have completed the signing of Japan's Shunsuke Nakamura on a three-year contract from Italian First Division club Reggina.<br><br>The Japan international has signed a three-year deal with the Glasgow club to become manager Gordon Strachan's seventh signing this summer.<br><br>The 27-year-old is expected to be in Glasgow shortly for a medical, which is expected to be a formality along with a successful application for a work permit.<br><br>Details of the transfer fee were not released but according to Japanese newspaper reports last week it was in the region of 3.5 million ($10.5m).<br><br>The Celtic Park manager was delighted with his latest acquisition.<br><br>Strachan said: 'Once he's out on the pitch, I'm sure our fans will realise very quickly why we were so keen to secure his signature. He's a very special talent.<br><br>'He's a player who can bring an extra dimension to any team, and, having done our homework on him and asked many people about his background and temperament, we are delighted the deal has been done.<br><br>'I've no doubt it's going to prove a great bit of business for Celtic, and I'm looking forward to him pulling on the hoops and showing our fans why we have worked so hard to bring him here.'<br><br>VALUED PLAYER<br><br>Nakamura, 27, moved to Reggina from Yokohama Marinos in July 2002 and scored 11 goals in 80 Serie A games.<br><br>Nakamura, who has scored 13 goals in 53 games for the Japanese national team, was named Most Valuable Player in last year's Asian Cup.<br><br>And he outshone golden boy Hidetoshi Nakata in the Confederations Cup last month in Germany.<br><br>The midfielder is a major star in his homeland but, after three years with Reggina, the Japanese international is relishing the opportunity of lining up in front of the Parkhead supporters.<br><br>Nakamura said: 'Celtic are obviously an enormous football club with an extremely passionate support.<br><br>'This was one of the main reasons I have signed and I can't wait to get started and show the fans what I can do.<br><br>'I'm confident of a successful season in Glasgow, both in the league and in Europe and look forward to meeting up with my new team-mates later this week.' - AFP.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Nice start, Nakamura</strong><br>August 30, 2005<br><br>JAPANESE midfielder Shunsuke Nakamura struck it right in Scotland.<br><br>He opened his Celtic account yesterday as Gordon Strachan's side bounced back from their Old Firm derby defeat last week with a 4-0 win against Dunfermline at East End Park.<br><br>Nakamura was on target in the 58th minute when he latched onto a pass from Maciej Zurawski before drilling a left-footed low drive into the right corner.<br><br>Despite the win, Strachan said his defenders still needed to improve.<br><br>'I was quite disappointed. It's been a hard week after last Saturday...physically and mentally,' said Strachan.<br><br>'We showed we could score goals but I felt we left the defending to individuals at times, which is disappointing for a manager.<br><br>'It was poor defending as a unit and we will have to work at that. I think the players got sloppy after going 2-0 up.'<br><br>Celtic, without suspended captain Neil Lennon and Alan Thompson after last week's 3-1 loss to Rangers, took just five minutes to break the deadlock.<br><br>Polish striker Zurawski netted the opener when he slalomed his way down the left flank, cut into the penalty-area before dispatching a low right footed shot in at the near post to put Celtic 1-0 up.<br><br>Dunfermline were punished five minutes later when Scott Thomson passed the ball to goalkeeper Bryn Halliwell, whose clearance as he slipped was deflected off Scott Wilson into the path of striker John Hartson.<br><br>The Wales international side-footed the ball into an empty goal from the edge of the box to give Celtic a 2-0 lead after only 10 minutes of play.<br><br>Dunfermline's dismal start looked all set to change for the better when they were awarded a penalty after Adam Virgo fouled Mark Burchill in the 27th minute.<br><br>But manager Jim Leishman watched on in disbelief as Burchill's low strike was tipped around the upright by goalkeeper Artur Boruc.<br><br>With their best opportunity of a recovery behind them, Dunfermline slipped further behind when Nakamura scored.<br><br>Zurawski then netted his second and Celtic's fourth in the 74th minute, when he rifled a low right-footed shot past Halliwell to extend the Glasgow giants' rout to 4-0. - Reuters.<br><br></div>
