            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United striker Alan Smith is confident the Old Trafford club will re-establish themselves as the best in the country next season.<br><br>Smith would sacrifice a place at next season's World Cup finals to help United topple Premiership champions Chelsea.<br><br>"We know we are good enough," Smith told The Sun. "In 12 months I will be saying 'I told you so'."<br><br>He added: "People like Giggsy and Scholesy, who have done it all, are still so enthusiastic and driven to win it this time. It's quite incredible to see.<br><br>"It inspires the rest of us and it is up to people like me, Rio Ferdinand and Wayne Rooney to take up the mantle. I have never won anything, so it's about time I did - and United is the place to do it."<br><br>Smith is not worrying about winning a place in Sven-Goran Eriksson's squad for next summer's World Cup finals in Germany should England qualify.<br><br>The United forward said: "This season is not about whether Alan Smith gets to the World Cup, it is about United and how we perform as a team.<br><br>"If I play every game for United, we win the big trophies and I don't get in the England World Cup squad, it won't bother me one bit.<br><br>"If England come along - and you would think it would if I had a good season - then that's great. But United is all I have on my mind."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I actually think of him as a better foil to either Rooney or RVN. He can hold the ball up, lay it off and head better than RVN and is more abrasive than Rooney. Bloody hardworking too.<br><br>If only theres a way to successfully find a place for them 3 in the team...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I still remember Alan Smith as a Leeds rookie back in 1999. He really showed his class during the home clash with Sheff Wed. He struck on the 72nd and 78th minutes to punish the Owls (who were mired in the drop zone throughout the season). But indiscipline took its toll on the number of appearances he made, though. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
