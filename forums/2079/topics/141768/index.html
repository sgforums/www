            <div class='col-md body'>Wigan Athletic manager Paul Jewell has issued a rallying cry to his players, urging them to prove wrong the critics who expect to see them make an immediate return to the Championship.<br>The Latics' Barclays Premiership campaign begins on August 14 at home to champions Chelsea and Jewell wants the tone to be set that day.<br><br>"When people ask my opinion I say Wigan are one of the favourites to go down on the mere fact that is what happens (more often than not to promoted teams)," said Jewell.<br><br>"But people have written us off without ever seeing us play or what we are about. That is cheap. People don't respect us. People are writing disparaging things about us.<br><br>"I don't like that and I'd love to stuff a few people's words down their throats.<br><br>"It is very exciting times but I don't want us to be going out there on August 14 with our autograph books and wanting to swap shirts.<br><br>"We will respect Chelsea before the game but when it starts it is every man for himself."<br><br>Jewell wants to change Wigan from a club admired for its remarkable rise to the Barclays Premiership to an established top-flight entity that strikes fear into the leading sides in England.<br><br>"We will be everyone's favourite second team this season because everyone thinks they can beat us and we are not a threat - maybe one day we will be disliked," Jewell told Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme.<br><br>"We have that image of pies and flat caps - but I donÂ’t want to play up to that stereotype. I want to take Wigan forward and the best way we can do that is with football.<br><br>"Wigan is a great place and it's buzzing at the moment because the team is in the Premiership.<br><br>"The club has had a meteoric rise. Twenty years ago the club was in the Northern Premier. This is a chance to prove all the people wrong."<br><br>But it will take time. Jewell has missed out on a number of transfer targets during the summer, including England midfielder Scott Parker.<br><br>Wigan offered Chelsea Â£10million for Parker but the midfielder chose Newcastle United.<br><br>Jewell was not at all surprised, but is determined to change the way Wigan are viewed.<br><br>"We bid Â£10million, Peter Kenyon accepted it but if I had the chance as a player to go to Newcastle, Everton or Tottenham I'd go to one of the other three before Wigan.<br><br>"Wigan is about being part of something moving forward. It's a new adventure. No-one thought Wigan would be in the Premiership. But we are there on merit.<br><br>"We are a forward-thinking club that can't go and buy current internationals playing for England - but we can get better players and gradually build a squad up that way."<br><br>Hopefully in the 20 days before we face Chelsea we will get three or four more new faces in."<br><br>But it us unlikely Jewell will bid for Manchester City midfielder Joey Barton, who was sent home early from the club's pre-season trip to Thailand following an off-field incident.<br><br>"Barton is obviously a good player," said Jewell.<br><br>"I don't know what's gone on over there. He is a good player but not one I've thought of at the moment." - premierleague.com<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While Chelsea made Wigan look good.. still, the men of Wigan Ath did tactically well to keep the Chelsea at bay until the dying minutes.<br><br>In football, it's not over till it's over. They have to know it's 100% concentration all the time. Lose that and you will give World-class striker like Crespo a decent chance to score.<br><br>They can still survive the Premiership IF they are consistent with their performance for the whole season. A draw is as good as a win at times. Wigan need a really decent striker to get goals.</div>
