            <div class='col-md body'>I dare to say that shearer really caused the downfall of newcastle. No magpie's manager is able to touch him and that's the problem which led to the sacking of bobby and guillet. the newcastle team under sir bobby is certainly better than souness now.<br><br>shearer really should be out of newcastle a long time ago. he's bigger than the club, u let a club be controlled by a player? Freddy is an idoit and so are newcastle fans. they should've sold shearer to liverpool when there was the chance and get emile mpenza. Any thoughts?</div>

What's more, he is a local boy. When Kevin Keegan played for the Magpies, Shearer ever tried out as goalkeeper but was turned away. He later made a name for himself on the South Coast. A spell at Blackburn followed, and his winning the Golden Boot at Euro '96 convinced Kevin Keegan (now manager) that it was time to bring Shearer back home.</div>
