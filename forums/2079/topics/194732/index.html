Then after 2 months new season, every 2 months comes new season, lol. I am crazy and stupid to suggest this, so is this idiotic Sepp Blatter.</div>

There's only one group of people who decide the make-up of the Premier League and that's the 20 clubs.<br><br>'There is no appetite for them as a collective to reduce the size and FIFA cannot force it on us.<br><br>'We reduced the size of the league from 22 clubs to 20 in 1995-96, and since then UEFA have expanded the Champions League, FIFA have expanded the World Cup and brought in the Confederations Cup and World Club Championship, so it's a bit rich for anyone to talk about reducing the number of matches.<br><br>'We are the only people who have done so.'<br><br>Blatter, who announced he would be standing next year for a third term of office - at the end of which he would be 71 - approved a raft of new proposals in a bid to clean up the game.<br><br>But the issue of cutting numbers in worldwide leagues stood out.<br><br>Like England's Premiership, Spain's Primera Liga, France's Ligue 1 and Italy's Serie A are each made up of 20 teams.<br><br>Blatter explained: 'We now have the green light for 18 teams.<br><br>'Instead of playing 38 matches in the league, the clubs would only play 34.
