They only won 3 times in their entire history! Did u ever see Liverpool boast as much? They won 18 times mind u.<br>Wad i meant was, they're depending on their luck, too much of it. The champions league finals 2 years ago as well as the FA Cup finals last season. I agree that all teams needed luck to win but Liverpool depended too much on it.<br>United didn't loose any talented players. They bought the wrong players.
