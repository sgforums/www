            <div class='col-md body'>xtracted from soccernet.<br><br>LONDON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Arsenal captain Thierry Henry has ended speculation about his future by pledging to remain with the north London team.<br><br>'The truth is I love this club and I have made up my mind to stay,' the France striker was quoted as saying in The Sun newspaper on Saturday.<br><br>'I can say to all my fans and the people who care about me, I want to lead the team out in the new stadium (next season). I'll talk to (manager) Arsene Wenger, to (vice-chairman) David Dein and the board and talk of the future.<br><br>'My mind is to stay and we have to sort this out.'<br><br>Henry's contract ends in 18 months' time and he had previously said that he would not decide whether to sign a new deal until the end of this season, leading to strong links with Spanish champions Barcelona.<br><br>'There was a lot of ridiculous speculation,' Henry told The Sun. 'But the truth is this, I never spoke with or met with a single person from any other club at any time.<br><br>'This will put an end to all the stories. We can move on.'<br><br>Henry, who will be rested when Arsenal host second division Cardiff City in the third round of the FA Cup later on Saturday, said the reaction of the fans played an important role in his decision.<br><br>'Obviously I did think about leaving Arsenal. It's a big decision because I thought if I do commit to this club, it could be for life,' he said.<br><br>'I am still only 28. But when I see the fans and the way they talk to me, it helped make my decision.<br><br>'They didn't boo me or make life difficult for me on the pitch. In other countries you could play for a team for 10 years and if you say, 'can I have time to think about my future?', the fans would go mad.'<br><br>Henry joined Arsenal from Juventus in August 1999 and became the top scorer in the club's history this season.<br><br>There was more good news for Wenger's side when Dutch international striker Robin van Persie agreed a new five-year deal with the club.<br><br>'I am very happy that I have extended my contract to 2011,' the 22-year-old van Persie told Arsenal's website.<br><br>'I am very happy too with my team mates and the boss (Wenger). In fact a lot of my progress is down to him and his faith in me.'<br><br>Arsenal are fifth in the Premier League, 24 points behind leaders Chelsea.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from soccernet<br><br>Updated: Jan. 12, 2006<br>Portsmouth complete triple signing<br><br>Portsmouth boss Harry Redknapp will look at the possibility of signing Glen Johnson on loan from Chelsea after bolstering his squad with Sean Davis, Pedro Mendes and Noe Pamarot from Tottenham.<br><br>Redknapp has spent around Â£12million since co-owner Alexandre Gaydamak's investment at Fratton Park, with Zimbabwe striker Benjani Mwaruwari also brought to the club from French side Auxerre.<br><br>However, Redknapp will continue to look for new players in his bid to keep Pompey in the Barclays Premiership.<br><br>'I'm still looking,' said Redknapp, who returned to the club last month after a year with rivals Southampton.<br><br>'I knew when I first came back the squad needed strengthening and it probably still does.<br><br>'But I'm delighted to have signed three more quality players in one fell swoop and I think we can get them back on track to being outstanding players in the Premiership.'<br><br>Chelsea full-back Johnson, who is also linked with a move to French side Lyon, is a player Redknapp is interested in.<br><br>'Although I would like Glen I'm not sure Chelsea will loan him out to us,' Redknapp said. 'That's something we have to look at after the weekend.'<br><br>Redknapp, however, may now ease off in his search for a new goalkeeper. He has been linked with Middlesbrough's Australia star Mark Schwarzer and Norwich's Robert Green, but Jamie Ashdown is now in training after a back injury.<br><br>Redknapp added: 'If he is fit and can play this weekend or next we should have no problems in that area.<br><br>'But I've had the backing of the board in the deals we've done and without that we couldn't have done them. I'm well pleased.'<br><br>Davis and Mendes are looking for first-team action after finding opportunities limited following the arrival of midfielders Michael Carrick, Edgar Davids and Jermaine Jenas at White Hart Lane.<br><br>Mendes, who won the Champions League with Porto under Jose Mourinho, said: 'I'm very proud Portsmouth think I can help them get out of trouble and it is a big challenge.<br><br>'I've enjoyed my time here but I need this new chance and I'm happy to take it.'<br><br>All three players started the season injured but returned to fitness with Spurs in form and challenging for a Champions League place.<br><br>Davis admitted: 'I had my injury problems including a knee operation but the last three or four months have been a bit of a nightmare training with the reserves and not getting a look-in with the first team.<br><br>'I could have moved in pre-season but I decided to stay on and fight for my place but it never came around and I never got the chance to show why they had bought me in the first place.<br><br>'So when I was given the opportunity to come here and enjoy my day-to-day work I snapped at it. I'm not bitter but it is hard when you obviously don't appeal to the manager. Here I know I can work with a smile on my face.'<br><br>It is Pamarot's second spell at Portsmouth after a brief spell on loan at Fratton Park in 1999 when he played just one league match and then returned to Nice before Spurs eventually signed him for Â£1million in August 2004.<br><br>Pompey face Everton at Fratton Park on Saturday when the new signings - along with on-loan striker Emmanuel Olisadebe - are set for their debuts, although there is a doubt over Mwaruwari's availability because of the African Nations Cup.<br><br>Pompey chairman Milan Mandaric confirmed all three of the signings from Tottenham have penned two-and-a-half year contracts, and conceded: 'Going down now would be financially disastrous - but we are not looking at that.<br><br>'(Alexandre) Sacha Gaydamak is behind what we are doing and and we are supporting Harry Redknapp. Financially it is 50-50 between both of us.<br><br>'Spending a lot of money doesn't guarantee you don't go down but if you don't do anything you've got an even bigger chance of going down.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from soccernet.<br><br>Updated: Jan. 12, 2006<br>Spurs poised to make move for Bridge<br><br>Tottenham will test Chelsea's resolve to hang on to their fringe players by making a Â£6million move for England left-back Wayne Bridge.<br><br>Coach Martin Jol offloaded defender Noe Pamarot along with midfielders Sean Davis and Pedro Mendes to Portsmouth in a Â£7.5million deal and then refused to rule out making a move for the unsettled Bridge.<br><br>Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho has repeatedly insisted nobody will be leaving his Stamford Bridge squad unless they are unhappy and want to quit.<br><br>But that situation may change once Spurs make an official approach for Bridge who is desperate for first-team football ahead of this summer's World Cup finals in Germany.<br><br>England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson has told the former Southampton defender he needs to be playing regularly to stand any hope of being included in his squad for the tournament.<br><br>Bridge has yet to figure in the Barclays Premiership for Chelsea since recovering from the serious ankle fracture he sustained against Newcastle in the FA Cup quarter-final last season.<br><br>Spurs lack cover on the left side and Bridge would help Jol to push Lee Young-Pyo into a more attacking role.<br><br>When quizzed about the possibility of a move for the Chelsea defender, Jol refused to deny their interest in him.<br><br>'We are still working on the left-back but I don't talk about new players,' he said. 'I still feel that if you want to be a top side, you need two players in every position. With the three players going now we have to do something.<br><br>'If Lee is out on the left side, we don't have a left-winger. Andy Reid is fit again but he is not a real wing player.'<br><br>Spurs have also been linked with Udinese striker Vincenzo Iaquinta as a replacement for Grzegorz Rasiak but Jol believes the Â£7million price tag is too expensive for Spurs at the present time.<br><br>Rasiak has not settled at at the club and he was taunted by Spurs fans during their 3-2 FA Cup defeat at the hands of Championship side Leicester on Sunday.<br><br>The club's sporting director Damien Comolli is believed to have flown to Italy to assess the possibility of a deal for Iaquinta who is expected to be part of their World Cup squad this summer.<br><br>The sale of three of their fringe first-team players to Portsmouth represents a nice slice of business for Spurs but it left a sour taste as Jol's man-management style was criticised by former Fulham midfielder Davis.<br><br>Davis claimed Jol's style meant players were frozen out and ignored if they were not part of his regular first-team squad.<br><br>But Jol accepted such criticism comes with the territory of trying to keep such a large squad happy and refused to hit back at Davis.<br><br>'It's a very difficult one because if you never play or you are injured and come back and play occasionally, it is very difficult to keep players happy sometimes,' conceded Jol.<br><br>'I did not speak to him for the last three or four weeks because he was injured. You get this kind of thing but there is no problem.<br><br>'If you ask other players they will say that he is an unbelievable man-manager but if you have 26 or 27 players, you get the same thing in football all the time.<br><br>'If you speak to players all the time they expect to play and sometimes it is impossible. Even with Jermain Defoe, sometimes I have to leave him because if you talk to them all the time, what sort of reaction do you get? It's a reality of football. They haven't played, so they won't be happy with the manager.<br><br>'When they come to me and want to leave I said I would think about it. Stephen Kelly also asked to leave because he wants to play but you can't let everyone go.'<br><br>But Jol will not re-think his policy of having such a large squad despite acknowledging the difficulties of keeping fringe players involved and happy.<br><br>'No, I will not do that,' declared Jol. 'I have a structure with every player mentally but sometimes you cannot talk a lot because, and I'm not saying it is true in this case, you might want to get rid of them.<br><br>'If you talk a lot to them, they might make their minds up and stay,' he joked. 'Sean Davis was not happy at all for the last six months. Pedro Mendes was already out of the team for 12 months and even when you try to make them happy it is impossible because they are not playing and that is the main thing they want to do.'<br></div>

'Clearly, if Gareth had joined Franck Queudrue as long-term injured, it would not have been in the club's best interests to allow Ugo to move on.<br><br>'Thankfully, Gareth's injury doesn't appear to be as serious as first feared. Scans have been taken that do not suggest a fracture. That's clearly great news as I don't need to spell out how important Gareth is to the team.<br><br>'Gareth will rest for the next week, maybe two, and the ankle will be assessed on an ongoing basis. As long as the injury settles down, we will have him back fairly soon.<br><br>'The knock-on effect is that we have now decided to let Ugo's transfer to West Brom go through as originally planned.'<br><br>That will have come as welcome news to Ehiogu, who had grown disillusioned with his lack of opportunities at the Riverside, where he arrived as the club's then-record signing in an Â£8million move from Aston Villa in October 2000.<br><br>He has made 133 appearances for the club and was in the side which lifted the Carling Cup in February 2004.<br><br>However, he has played just 13 times this season, the last of them the 3-3 Premiership draw with Tottenham on December 18.<br><br>McClaren, who has Queudrue out for up to eight weeks, Chris Riggott battling to shake off a dead leg and Emanuel Pogatetz suspended for Saturday's trip to Arsenal, insisted he was right to be cautious with only inexperienced duo Matthew Bates and David Wheater waiting in the wings.<br><br>'It was right for us to be cautious and put the transfer on hold when there was concern that Gareth could be out for an extended period, as we had to do what was right for Middlesbrough,' he told the club's official website.<br><br>'Now we feel it's best for the club and for Ugo that he moves on to pastures new. He has been an outstanding servant to this club over the past four or five years and should be remembered fondly by fans for his part in winning the Carling Cup.<br><br>'But I have explained to him that I can't guarantee him the first-team football he naturally wants at this stage in his career. We have some excellent young players coming through and we want to ensure they fulfil their potential.'<br><br>Today's news will come as a relief to Southgate, who disappointed to have been the indirect cause of his former Villa team-mate's on-off transfer.<br><br>He will now set his sights on returning to action as soon as possible.<br><br>'We don't think there is a stress fracture there, so we are just waiting to see what happens,' he said. 'We will let it settle over the next week or so and take it from there.<br><br>'Normally injuries are black and white and you can put a timescale on them. It could be something that is a couple of weeks, it could be something that is considerably longer than that.<br><br>'The best scenario from my point of view is I am back in a couple of weeks, but that's not certain. You want to be around to help your team-mates but if you are not fit, there is nothing you can do about it.'<br><br></div>

Unfortunately for Walter he has not been playing as much as he would like.<br><br>'He also had the language barrier to contend with to start with but, to be fair to him, he has come on a lot and does understand a hell of a lot now. He has worked extremely hard in trying to breach the language barrier.'<br><br>Cunningham said: 'Walter probably hasn't had as many starts as he would have wanted. With the team having struggled, the manager has been forced to chop and change things and look for that winning formula, so Walter has had to be patient at times.<br><br>'But no-one could doubt his professionalism. He is a very good trainer. He has turned up every day with the right attitude, he trained hard and even when he has been left out and put on the bench, he has always showed the right kind of attitude.'<br><br>Pandiani's departure will provide Bruce with the spending power to try to sign out-of-favour Charlton striker Jason Euell.

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from soccernet.<br><br>Updated: Jan. 13, 2006<br>Dudek desperate to leave Liverpool<br><br>Goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek wants to leave Liverpool 'at whatever cost', insists he will not play another game for the club and has accused manager Rafael Benitez of talking 'rubbish'.<br><br>The 32-year-old was a hero for the Anfield club in last season's Champions League final against AC Milan, playing a key role in the penalty shoot-out as Liverpool lifted the trophy for the fifth time.<br><br>But he has since fallen behind both Jose Reina and Scott Carson in the Anfield pecking order, and wants first team football to protect his place in the Poland team for this summer's World Cup finals in Germany.<br><br>'My time at Liverpool has reached its end. Nothing can change that,' Dudek told The Sun.<br><br>The Pole believes Liverpool want Â£3million for him, but said: 'If someone buys me for Â£3million, Liverpool will have pulled off the transfer deal of the year. I am 33 in March. I have no idea how they came to such an absurd figure.<br><br>'It's the latest lot of rubbish from Benitez. Even if he wants to play me in a Liverpool match, I don't want to play for this club any more.<br><br>'I can't see any point talking further with Benitez. It's a waste of time. I have decided to leave Liverpool at whatever cost and I won't change my mind. Benitez just makes the frustration deeper.<br><br>'I didn't go to play against Luton in the FA Cup last Saturday especially to make it clear to Benitez I am not interested in being the club's second-choice keeper.<br><br>'Why doesn't he behave like a decent person for once in his life and start treating me in a proper way, like I always have him?'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from soccernet.<br><br>Updated: Jan. 13, 2006<br>Birmingham deal for Euell far from done - Curbs<br><br>Charlton manager Alan Curbishley has told Birmingham they must try harder if they are to take want-away striker Jason Euell off his hands.<br><br>The 28-year-old, who was once a club record signing when he was recruited from Wimbledon, is on the transfer list having become frustrated at a lack of first-team football over the past 18 months.<br><br>Birmingham - the Addicks' opponents at The Valley tomorrow - are keen to sign him but not keen enough for Curbishley's liking.<br><br>He said: 'Birmingham are sniffing around but they are not doing enough. In this window everyone is jostling around trying to do things and we are no different, but they are not doing enough at the moment.<br><br>'Jason has made his feelings known and whoever is interested has a couple of weeks to do something about it. If acceptable bids come along we will have to think about it but at the moment none has.'<br><br>Euell has recovered from a shoulder injury but is unlikely even to make the bench tomorrow.<br><br>Curbishley said: 'Jason had a very disappointing year last year. It wasn't all his fault, it wasn't all my fault. Obviously he wants to play, like they all do.<br><br>'His beef with me was that when we were not doing so well I still didn't put him in. We put him on the list and during the summer he had a move to Birmingham that looked like being a go-er until he hurt his shoulder, which was no-one's fault.<br><br>'I can understand his frustration as he hasn't played for the first team in over a year but once that window closes, if no business is done he has got to get on with it.<br><br>'I have got a big squad but I have said to them that if anyone wants to go then we will try to do something about it.'<br><br>One deal Curbishley does not expect to go through is a swap with Newcastle for Lee Bowyer, the former Charlton midfielder who is keen to return to London.<br><br>The Magpies want to exchange him for Danny Murphy, who is fit again following a hamstring problem, but Curbishley insisted the England international was going nowhere.<br><br>He said: 'I have not spoken to Graeme Souness since I signed Darren Ambrose. There is no swap deal with Bowyer.<br><br>'Danny has been unsettled by it all but speculation is part of football, especially in this month when it is so intense.<br><br>'It is no secret that Lee Bowyer wants to come back to London but at the moment I am looking at other areas.'<br><br>Charlton have also been linked with Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink of Middlesbrough and a loan arrangement with Millwall to give out-of-favour striker Jonatan Johansson some first-team action but Curbishley was adamant that neither deal would happen.<br><br>Norway international Thomas Myhre keeps his place in goal tomorrow, which will only intensify the frustration of former number one Dean Kiely, who now wants to leave.<br><br>Curbishley said: 'Dean has never been second choice before and I have had chats with him.<br><br>'He feels he should be our number one but I have said to him I am happy with having three 'keepers so we will have to see how that develops.'<br><br>Birmingham are likely to hand a debut to new signing Chris Sutton as Emile Heskey's strike partner, although the former Celtic man's versatility means that is by no means certain.<br><br>Curbishley said: 'We will have to see where he (Sutton) is playing because obviously he can play at the back as well as up front. But to be fair to Birmingham, they have done a bit of business there when not many clubs have.<br><br>'We have all been talking and jostling around but they have actually gone and done something and that will improve them tomorrow.'<br></div>
