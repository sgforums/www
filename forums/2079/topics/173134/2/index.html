I rate him personally and we are looking at him, yes,' said Wenger.<br><br>But the Arsenal manager insisted: 'It is not at the numbers you suggest because we are not in advanced negotiations at all.<br><br>'Is he available or not? We are not the only club who is after Theo Walcott - but you ask me if I like him, I will say `yes'.'<br><br>Wenger added were an agreement to be struck, that: 'Ideally we would like him to join us straight away.<br><br>'But it would not be a deal breaker if Southampton would say 'listen, we want the player to finish the season with us'.'<br><br>However, Wenger stressed: 'From me liking him, him liking the club and the deal being done, there is still a step to go.'<br><br>On whether talks had actually taken place between the two clubs, the Arsenal manager maintained: 'I wouldn't like to come out with that.<br><br>'If I say yes, it's a yes, if I say no, it's a no.<br><br>'The more secret things like that are, the better it is.'<br><br>It would seem, however, only a matter of time before Arsenal make their interest official.<br><br>The striker has a pre-contract agreement with the Saints to sign a professional contract on his 17th birthday in March.<br><br>However, FIFA rules mean Walcott could sign for another club after his birthday, with the south-coast club entitled to compensation - which could be around Â£500,000 - decided by a tribunal.<br><br>As determined as Saints are to hold on to Walcott, chairman Rupert Lowe accepts there may come a time when it was right for the striker to further his career elsewhere.<br><br>Walcott has scored five goals in 22 appearances so far this season and Wenger has clearly seen enough to believe he has the potential to make an impact at the highest level.<br><br>'I like the timing of his runs, his determined attitude, the fact that he can play in different positions up front; that he is calm in front of goal,' said the Arsenal manager.<br><br>'The composure he shows in decisive moments does not change, whether it is in Division One or Premiership - you have that or you don't have that.<br><br>'His determination as well, and he has electric pace.'<br><br></div>

We are not down, there are a lot of positives to take out of it and I'm sure we will do.'<br><br>Kewell was also involved in the dismissal of Spurs right-back Paul Stalteri in the closing stages when the Canada international was red-carded for a professional foul on the Australian as he attempted to race clear on goal. But Stalteri claims that Kewell went down because he knew he would not get the ball.<br><br>'It was one of those where it was minimal contact,' insisted Stalteri. 'He looked to get in front of me and ran across me.<br><br>'He fell under my feet really and has gone down quickly. He knew he wasn't going to get the ball.'<br><br>Meanwhile Spurs have announced they are to unveil their new club badge on Thursday.<br><br></div>

Possibly, you've got to think of all the alternatives that you are going to come across. I've said from day one that I need to be playing.<br><br>'I don't want to go a full season, look back and think I've made six or seven appearances because that isn't me.

Who in their right mind doesn't want to play football? I'd love to play football here every week.'<br><br>Hendrie added: 'There is nothing I can say to the manager. I can't go in and say `play me' because the gaffer is going to make his decisions. All I can do is keep giving him a headache and let my football do the talking.<br><br>'I don't want to go in there ranting and raving because I've got a good understanding with the gaffer. If we've got a problem, we speak about it and that's the way we have been over the period he's been here.<br><br>'We've not had a fall-out. I've never had a rift with the gaffer. When he came to Villa, he pushed me back to what I was, playing football every week and doing my job, and I respect him for that.<br><br>'But I don't want to be a back-up option at 28.'<br><br></div>

That remains the case and we expect him to be training with us for two or three days, and we will then decide whether we want to pursue a transfer.'<br><br>Ahn has had mixed success since signing for Metz in July, and he has scored just two goals in 15 appearances.<br><br>His agent Yang Myung-Kyu told the Korea Times: 'It was Ahn's own decision not to join Blackburn's training. Ahn seems to think it's not proper to go to England when he can't be sure he'll sign with the club.<br><br>'He wants some clearer conditions about moving.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from soccernet.<br><br>Updated: Jan. 17, 2006<br>Baggies to step up pursuit of Artmedia star Kozak<br><br>West Brom manager Bryan Robson is to step up his efforts to sign Slovakian international Jan Kozak on loan for the remainder of the season. Midfielder Kozak, 25, has impressed Robson during his current trial with Albion. West Brom are hopeful of Kozak becoming their second signing in the January transfer window as central defender Ugo Ehiogu edges closer to completing his loan switch from Middlesbrough. West Brom officials will open negotiations with Kozak's club Artmedia Bratislava after tonight's FA Cup replay with Reading with a view to the midfielder remaining at The Hawthorns for the next five months. Kozak also had trials with Liverpool as a teenager but at the time was unable to secure a work permit. He previously had spells with Sparta Prague and Kosice. Albion also have Charleroi defender Badou Kere on trial and have yet to make a concrete decision on whether to pursue any further interest in acquiring his services. Robson has told unsettled striker Robert Earnshaw to ``get on with his job'' until the club receive any concrete offers for the Wales international. Earnshaw, who has made only four Premiership starts this season, has already had two transfer requests rejected by Robson although the Albion chief may be prepared to sell if the price is right. He said: ``I have had no firm approach about Earnshaw. As far as I am concerned, he is under contract for another couple of years. ``Until we get an offer which is suitable to the club, he has to get on with his job.'' West Brom officials remain confident that 33-year-old Ehiogu will put pen to paper in time for Saturday's home Premiership encounter with Sunderland. Robson originally wanted to sign Ehiogu on a permanent basis but that situation will be reviewed in the summer after it emerged the player still had 18 months to run of a lucrative contract. end<br><br></div>

Only time will tell if we can do that.<br><br>'It is about the clubs getting together. Eirik says he wants to stay here to the end of the season.<br><br>'But if Leeds want us to buy Eirik now or make a commitment like that, he would have to go back because I'm not in a position to do that.'<br><br>O'Leary quite simply has no funds for new signings this month even if he offloads an unsettled player such as Lee Hendrie, Mark Delaney or Ulises de la Cruz.<br><br>He said: 'If anyone does go out, the money won't be used for me to come up with somebody. That's the way things are with the chairman (Doug Ellis). I respect that. He is the boss.'<br><br>Meanwhile, O'Leary is calling for his players to be 'in the faces' of Saturday's opponents Tottenham who defeated Villa 5-1 in the corressponding fixture at White Hart Lane last season.<br><br>The Villa chief is looking for a positive response after Saturday's home reversal by West Ham - only their second defeat in the last 10 league games.<br><br>He said: 'What we can't do is fall down and not roll our sleeves up and be in their faces. We did that to Arsenal but not to Manchester United. We stepped back and said `you are a great team, go and play'.<br><br>'What I want when we play these teams is to be in their faces and then let's see how great they are. If they still beat us then we can hold our hands up after that.'<br><br>O'Leary is also demanding no repeat of last season's mauling which ended Villa's last lingering hopes of securing a UEFA Cup place.<br><br>He said: 'We were poor that day. We gave away too many soft goals and we were too easy to play against. In general, the players have given me everything but they let themselves down then.'<br><br></div>

I feel I am efficient. I play almost all the matches, my future is at Manchester United and that is where I am planning to stay.'<br><br>Silvestre has made 314 appearances for United since his arrival from Inter in 1999, initially at left-back, then alongside Rio Ferdinand in central defence.<br><br>During that time, he has collected three Premiership titles and an FA Cup, although his chances of adding to his haul are now limited to domestic cup competitions following United's early elimination from the Champions League and Chelsea's 16-point advantage in the league.<br><br>Silvestre admits overall performances this season have been no better than average, a situation which is not good enough at a club of United's size.<br><br>'Bowing out from the Champions League before the last 16 was a huge failure,' he said.<br><br>'We are too irregular, we display good performances against big sides and we lack collective spirit against smaller teams.<br><br>'But we have two competitions to win (the FA Cup and the League Cup) on top of doing well in the league.

But nothing is done - and as long as nothing is signed, you cannot talk about it.'<br><br>He told his club's official website: 'However, we are hoping to get a decision in the next 24 hours.'<br><br>Neither Arsenal nor Southampton was today making any official announcements, but it has been widely suggested Walcott will be unveiled by the Gunners at their regular pre-match press conference on Friday.<br><br>As a public limited company, Southampton are obliged to inform the London Stock Exchange when any deal has been completed - and that could happen first thing tomorrow morning.<br><br>Chelsea are said to have offered more than the initial Â£4.5million reported to be on the table from the Gunners, which would rise to around Â£12million based on appearances and the players' development.<br><br>However, it is that opportunity to further his career with regular rather than sporadic tastes of first-team football for Arsenal which may prove key to Walcott's decision.<br><br>A player of his age can sign a deal for a maximum of three years, with the option to extend the contract in the near future.<br><br>Walcott, though, cannot technically sign a professional contract with Gunners until his 17th birthday on March 16.<br><br>Wenger last week admitted allowing the young striker to stay at St Mary's for the rest of the season would 'not be a deal breaker'.<br><br>But latest indications are that such an arrangement is a non-starter, with the Arsenal manager keen Walcott should not to be stretched and risk injury by playing too many Championship matches.<br><br>Arsenal travel to Everton on Saturday when they are likely to face something of a selection crisis in defence.<br><br>England left-back Ashley Cole is reported to have suffered a recurrence of his foot problem, while Pascal Cygan has already been ruled out for around three weeks with a hamstring injury.

He has shown a real hunger to be involved with the Wigan project,' said Jewell.<br><br>'He's a talented lad who can play in a number of positions and he also has an eye for goal.<br><br>'I only believe in bringing players in who add something new to our squad, and in signing David we have done that.<br><br>'With Neil, he will bring us a new dimension, and add competition to the squad which we need at the present time.<br><br>'Neil is a good young striker who is looking for a chance to prove himself again at this level. He is strong, skilful and with an eye for goal.<br><br>'I'm delighted to have both on board.'<br><br>Rovers boss Mark Hughes appreciates Thompson's desire to pursue his career elsewhere, with the Welshman stating: 'It has been difficult for David.<br><br>'He has had a lot of injuries and he was coming to the end of his contract here.<br><br>'We have a lot of options in midfield and it was a case of looking at the balance of the squad and seeing what we need for next year.'<br><br>Thompson's versatility means he can play anywhere across midfield, while Mellor's arrival comes at a time when Wigan have Henri Camara on African Nations' Cup duty with Senegal and David Connolly out with a hamstring injury.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from soccernet.<br><br>Updated: Jan. 20, 2006<br>Walcott completes Highbury deal<br><br>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger believes new signing Theo Walcott can emulate the achievements of Wayne Rooney, the last high-profile teenager to emerge in English football.<br><br>Walcott cannot sign a professional contract until his 17th birthday on March 16 and so will join the Barclays Premiership club as a scholar until then after they paid Southampton an initial fee of Â£5million, which could rise to Â£12million.<br><br>Chelsea were also reported to have been chasing the teenager's signature, but the chance of regular first-team football at Highbury appears to have been key to the player's decision to further his career in north London.<br><br>When asked whether Walcott could be compared to England and Manchester United striker Rooney, Wenger said: 'At his age, yes.<br><br>'Wayne Rooney has achieved a lot, and I want to be cautious with comparisons. But he has the same ingredients at the same age to be a big prospect for England.'<br><br>Wenger accepts it is a risk to sign a player who has made just 23 first-team appearances in the Coca-Cola Championship - but it is one he is prepared to take.<br><br>'It is always a gamble when you take young players. I believe his attitude is what I expect for a young player; his talent is what I expect from a young player - but the rest of it is a gamble,' he added in a press conference televised on Sky Sports News.<br><br>'When you buy any player it is gamble. When he is young it is bigger - but I am willing to take it.'<br><br>Wenger is delighted to have beaten competition from major rivals Chelsea to sign Walcott - and he feels that was down to the way Arsenal conducted their business.<br><br>'We were on the case longer than Chelsea. We monitored him for a couple of years, and emotions are not always rational,' he added.<br><br>'He loves the club; he loves some players here and was always a fan of Arsenal maybe. The facts are he feels he can play here and will get a chance here.'<br><br>Wenger denies he has guaranteed Walcott first-team football, and neither has the youngster asked for it.<br><br>He is also pleased to have signed a young English talent, hitting back at those who criticise him for taking on only foreign players.<br><br>'The young players get a chance here, and we have concrete proof to show that. He will be a part of project to go into a new stadium with some talent, some young English talent,' he said.<br><br>'But you earn your place in the football team. You earn your place through your competitiveness and your quality.<br><br>'We are looking to the future in a very big way, but also the present as well. The boy will be 17 in March, and at 17 you can play.<br><br>'Sometimes I get unjustly tried when I don't play English players. It is important for him [Walcott] to be English, because I think it is interesting to have a good mix of English and foreign players.'<br><br>Wenger has given Walcott some time off to adjust to his move and recover from a gruelling first half of the season with Southampton.<br><br>He also said he was not likely to be making any more moves in the transfer window, having previously signed Vassiriki Abou Diaby from Auxerre and Emmanuel Adebayor from Monaco.<br><br>'At the moment I feel three is just what is needed,' he concluded.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from soccernet.<br><br>Updated: Jan. 20, 2006<br>Stubbs returns to Everton<br><br>Alan Stubbs has returned to his first love, Everton, insisting 'in spirit' he never felt he had left Goodison Park.<br><br>The veteran defender goes into the squad for the home clash against Arsenal with a contract until the end of the season and the hope that he can impress manager David Moyes and get another deal in the summer.<br><br>He said: 'It is what I want, but I will have to show I am worth it.'<br><br>Stubbs moved to Sunderland last summer after captaining Everton to Champions League qualification.<br><br>However, after a row over a new deal, and claims that the Toffees wanted a clause in the new deal that it could be cancelled if there was a recurrence of the testicular cancer he has twice beaten, there was a parting of the ways.<br><br>Now Stubbs, who accepted Everton were prepared to drop the offending clause, is back after the Merseysiders sold Danish international Per Kroldrup to Fiorentina for Â£3.6million.<br><br>Stubbs said: 'It was very difficult to leave in the first place, for whatever reasons, especially after having a great season and qualifying for the Champions League.<br><br>'But that is all in the past now, I have said my apologies for clearly not understanding the things that were said at the time. I now know the club were prepared to wave the clause in the deal they offered me that referred to the testicular cancer issue.<br><br>'It was disappointing but it's in the past now. I'm really looking forward to being back here again and getting into the team.'<br><br>Everton should have Simon Davies and Duncan Ferguson back from injury for the clash against a Gunners side who scored seven past Middlesbrough last weekend.<br><br>Stubbs is relieved to be part of it all again, saying: 'It looks like Everton are turning for the better after five games without a defeat. They look good and are coming into form.<br><br>'That's where we want to be looking now, there are not many points between us and the top 10. If we can keep this run going we will be back up in the top half, starting with a result against Arsenal.<br><br>'No matter what you do in life, you need luck. I'm lucky to have this opportunity to come back.<br><br>'I'm delighted to be here again. It will be difficult to get back in, but there have always been players here to compete with.<br><br>'I do not expect to go straight in, I must prove I am worthy of it and a further contract. That's my aim.'<br><br>Kirkby-born Stubbs, a lifetime Everton fans, added: 'I was aware of all the letters to the local papers saying I should be back. A lot of them were my letters!<br><br>'I was watching the games when I wasn't playing for Sunderland and was very aware of what I had left behind.<br><br>'When I spoke to David Moyes it didn't matter what the manager was offering me, I was ready to jump at the chance to come back.<br><br>'I'm looking forward to getting the team going in the right direction.'<br><br>For Moyes it has been a bitter experience seeing the highly-rated Kroldrup fail to come to terms with the Premiership.<br><br>Moyes said: 'It was the right time for Per Kroldrup to move on. He has been very unfortunate not to have played more.<br><br>'We watched him play for Denmark, we felt he was the right one to come in. But since he was here there have been bits of his play I was not happy about.<br><br>'He is probably more suited to playing in Italy. He's a great lad, I got on really well with him but the opportunity for him to go back to Italy and join Fiorentina was a good one.<br><br>'It was a football decision taken by me and the right thing to do at this time.<br><br>'Alan Stubbs will give us competition, and it's good he's back. He had a difficult spell at Sunderland but we never wanted him to go.'<br></div>

His attitude is first class. He trains well and works hard every day.<br><br>'He has always done a good job for Liverpool, whether at left-back or in left midfield, and it's great news that we can include him in our plans for the coming years.'<br><br></div>
