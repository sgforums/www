West Ham are a big club, I am ambitious and at the end of the day the chance of a swift step up to the Premiership is too good to turn down.<br><br>Â“I spoke to Nigel [Worthington] and the board and told them I wanted to pursue this opportunity. IÂ’d like to thank Norwich for understanding that and allowing myself and my representative to talk to West Ham.Â”<br><br>Worthington also believes the deal is in the best interests of all parties.<br><br>Â“WeÂ’re always committed to trying to keep our best players at the club, but the size of the bid coupled with DeanÂ’s desire to make the move happen meant that after talking it through with the board and the lad himself, weÂ’ve decided to accept this offer.<br><br>Â“If the move goes through, IÂ’d like to place on record my thanks to Dean for his contribution and his professionalism during his time at Norwich and wish him all the very best in his future career.Â”<br></div>

There is absolutely no fear in the dressing room, and a feeling we can win every game.'<br><br>Although Ziegler has a new cause to fight for, on a personal level, the World Cup is on the horizon and he is determined to force his way into coach Kobi Kuhn's plans.<br><br>'I hope to be able to get as many games under my belt as possible because it is my dream to play in the World Cup for Switzerland,' added Ziegler, who has made three appearances for his country.<br><br>'I know if I have a good run between now and May, then of course it will help my chances.<br><br>'For a young player like me in a World Cup year, I am just anxious to play and to show everyone, the Wigan fans, the Wigan manager and the Switzerland manager Kobi Kuhn, what I can do.<br><br>'But at the moment my number one priority is to play well for Wigan, starting against Arsenal if I'm selected.'<br><br>Ziegler, though, has a lot to live up to as Jewell's three other new signings this month in Thompson, Neil Mellor and Paul Scharner have all scored on their debut.<br><br>'It's amazing they've all done that,' said Jewell. 'But he gives us decent cover. He is very good technically and he can play left back or left side of midfield.<br><br>'That's important for us. Lee McCulloch has done a wonderful job for us, but sometimes we lack balance without a natural left-footer.<br><br>'Hopefully, Reto can give us that and give us good competition for places at left back as well.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from soccernet.<br><br>Updated: Jan. 24, 2006<br>England experience in McClaren's favour<br><br>Steve McClaren, many would say, is a man in waiting.<br><br>The Yorkshireman, who turns 45 a month before the World Cup starts, is one of the prime contenders to replace Sven-Goran Eriksson when the Swede stands down after the World Cup.<br><br>He will sit alongside Eriksson on the England bench in Germany this summer and it is a job he covets, although one he believes lies a little further in the future.<br><br>To the powerbrokers at Soho Square he holds appeal, with services already rendered a major plus to his curriculum vitae.<br><br>But McClaren's decision to commit himself to a further four years at Middlesbrough earlier this season is a measure of his loyalty to chairman Steve Gibson, the man who gave him his first chance in management.<br><br>It is a relationship which has proved largely successful for the Teessiders, with McClaren stabilising a club with a reputation for yo-yoing between the top two divisions, picking up a first major trophy - the 2004 Carling Cup - and securing two successive seasons of European football, something Boro had never before achieved.<br><br>However, both men know that, should his country's call come, it would be hard for either to resist. Whether it will remains to be seen, and McClaren may need Boro's form to pick up considerably for the FA to consider him, after their recent slump towards the wrong end of the Barclays Premiership.<br><br>McClaren's affable public front disguises a huge ambition and a hunger to test himself at the highest level, perhaps qualities which attracted Sir Alex Ferguson when he appointed him as his number two.<br><br>He has made no secret of his desire one day to lead his country into battle, and although he is still busily acquiring all the knowledge and experience he can as he continues his own education in the game, he believes he has what it takes to make it at the highest level.<br><br>'I am very ambitious, but I've got to keep achieving at Middlesbrough to maybe get an opportunity later on in my career,' he said.<br><br>'It is flattering to be linked, but international football is so different to domestic football and I know that.<br><br>'I've been working with England for three or four years now. All that experience is useful. I achieved a lot at Manchester United. I always worked with the top players and I have come here and become the first man in 10 years to win a trophy.<br><br>'Those are the credentials I believe I have got.'<br><br>York-born McClaren enjoyed a modest playing career with Hull, Derby and Lincoln before joining Oxford, where he took the first steps on the coaching ladder in the club's youth set-up.<br><br>But it was under the hugely experienced Jim Smith at Derby that he cut his teeth, spending four years as assistant manager before replacing Brian Kidd as number two to Ferguson at Manchester United.<br><br>There he was catapulted into the limelight on a learning curve which has seen him lock horns with the best and come out on top.<br><br>He was at the Scot's side when United landed an unprecedented treble of Premiership, FA Cup and Champions League titles in 1999, and it was in November of the following year he was first asked to lend his blossoming talent to England following Kevin Keegan's departure.<br><br>He and Peter Taylor were in charge for a 1-0 friendly defeat by Italy in Turin, and the newly-appointed Eriksson, apart from a spell during which Ferguson barred him from working with England, has relied upon him ever since.<br><br>It was little wonder McClaren was linked with virtually every management job which came up as his stock rose sharply, but it was Gibson, who allowed him to return to the international fold, who persuaded him to commit his future to Teesside in June 2001.<br><br>There are still some sections of the club's support which have not taken to their manager - although a recent poll carried out by the club's website saw almost half of respondents vote him the best manager in their history - but his achievements are undeniable.<br><br>Not one of his predecessors won a major trophy, or brought European football to the banks of the Tees, and he has done both after implementing a five-year plan which has largely been carried out to the letter.<br><br>McClaren decided a pragmatic approach was needed to stabilise the club and, having made his side difficult to beat, then set about the task of making them interesting to watch, although that remains a work in progress.<br><br>He is meticulous in his preparation and has shown he is not afraid to give youth its chance as the likes of Stewart Downing, Tony McMahon, James Morrison and Matthew Bates have emerged from Boro's academy to establish themselves as genuine first-team players.<br><br>The most frequent criticism of him as a coach is he appears to lack passion on the sidelines - a charge levelled with even more vehemence at Eriksson - although he insists that could not be further from the truth.<br><br>'I am so emotional, so passionate, but I do bottle it up and it does come out in private, as the team will testify and definitely my staff will,' he said.<br><br>'I remember [a match] at Notts County - I had to pay for a door. I opened it a little bit quicker than I should have done, and closed it a little bit quicker too.<br><br>'You are the man at the front and if you keep losing it, I do not think that is what a leader should do.'<br><br>With Eriksson's departure now agreed for the summer, McClaren may get a chance to put that theory to the test on the biggest of stages.<br><br></div>

De la Cruz said: 'It is a frustrating time for me. The manager has not given me the chance to prove myself and yet he has said I can't leave on a free transfer.<br><br>'I only care to leave because of the World Cup and my family. I need the manager to understand my situation and let me leave on a `free'.'<br><br>De la Cruz has won 107 caps for his country but admitted: 'Ecuador have called me and ask why I am not playing for Villa. The World Cup is very important for me.'<br><br>Meanwhile, Villa striker Kevin Phillips has spelled out his desire to play some part in Saturday's FA Cup tie against Port Vale after scoring twice for the reserves against Manchester City last night.<br><br>Phillips has now had two second-team run-outs after a two-month absence with an ankle problem and wants to be involved in the fourth-round tie.<br><br>He said: 'I'm not 100 per cent but I am getting there. It's up to the gaffer to decide whether he thinks I am ready for the Port Vale game - but I want to be involved if possible. I am feeling good in myself.'<br><br></div>

His case was submitted to a panel of Jans Nater, Stuart McUnnes and Jan Paulsson but the Premier League objected to CAS jurisdiction.<br><br>A statement released by the CAS said: 'The CAS Panel noted that the FAPL regulations do not contain any reference to a right of appeal to the CAS.<br><br>'On the contrary, the same regulations state that the decisions of the Appeal Board shall be final.<br><br>'The fact that the FIFA statutes do allow appeals to the CAS against decisions rendered by national federations or leagues is not sufficient to establish the jurisdiction of the CAS if there is no direct reference to CAS arbitration in the regulations of the body whose decision is being appealed against.<br><br>'Consequently, as there was no specific agreement between the parties to submit this matter to the CAS, the panel has declined jurisdiction.<br><br>'As this decision terminates the arbitration procedure, the sanction imposed by the FAPL Appeal Board on Ashley Cole shall stand.'<br><br></div>

But poor form meant he was displaced by Norwegian Thomas Myhre, who has kept his place.<br><br>However, Portsmouth boss Harry Redknapp still considers Kiely to have plenty to offer in the Barclays Premiership.<br><br>Â“Dean seemed to have gone down the order at Charlton, but I think Alan Curbishley will be the first to acknowledge the tremendous service and level of performance he has given to a solid Premier League outfit,Â” said Redknapp.<br><br>Â“His record in the Premier League speaks for itself. It is amazing to have played so consistently - you could count on one hand the number of games he had missed before this season.<br><br>Â“I think in the time he kept goal for Charlton they never finished below 14th, and he has been a virtual ever-present for most of that time.<br><br>Â“At 35, he is just coming into his prime for a goalkeeper.Â”<br><br>Salford-born Kiely made 248 appearances for Charlton, who paid Bury Â£1million for his services, and he helped them to promotion in his first season before later being twice named the clubÂ’s player of the year.<br><br>His Pompey debut could come in SundayÂ’s FA Cup fourth-round tie against Liverpool - because he did not feature for the Addicks in their third-round clash against Sheffield Wednesday.<br><br>Kiely, who first established his reputation at York, may have to bide his time, however - having played no first-team football since CharltonÂ’s 3-0 defeat at Wigan Athletic on December 17.<br><br>Redknapp hopes that, as well as proving a good addition on the playing side, some of KielyÂ’s know-how can rub off on 25-year-old Ashdown.<br><br>Â“Jamie Ashdown has been great for me - and having someone so experienced around can only bring him on because he is a very good young goalkeeper in a difficult situation,Â” said Redknapp.<br><br>Portsmouth have also brought goalkeeping coach David Coles to the club.<br><br>He left Southampton after eight years following the appointment of George Burley in December, when the Scot came in to replace Redknapp.<br><br>Coles served under Redknapp during his unsuccessful year at St MaryÂ’s and declared himself Â“delightedÂ” to renew their working relationship.<br><br>He said: Â“It was time to be moving on and I am pleased to be back working again here at Pompey in the Premier League.Â”<br><br></div>

There is no point just bringing someone in for the sake of it. We have to get someone who can add to the squad because it is squad number we are light on in midfield.<br><br>'But we are exhausting our knowledge of central midfielders in Europe, particularly one we can get on loan.<br><br>'It is impossible really because there is only a week left which is not a lot of time to start negotiating fees and things but we could just run out of time.'<br><br>United have already been linked with out-of-favour AC Milan man Johann Vogel but the desperation with which he needs to move will not be known until the extent of Giggs' latest injury is revealed.<br><br>The Welshman has been plagued by hamstring problems throughout his career and last night's game had barely started before the injury resurfaced.<br><br>'He felt the injury and tried to solider on for a few minutes but it was no use,' said Ferguson.<br><br>'We wanted Ryan to be our leader in midfield because we only had two young lads alongside him in Darren Fletcher and Kieran Richardson,' he said.<br><br>'But the injury put paid to that, which is unfortunate.'<br><br></div>

He is a player I am desperate to keep at the club and a player we are talking to about next year.<br><br>``We have made our position clear and Teddy knows that.<br><br>'We want him to stay next year and maybe extend his role a bit onto the coaching side. I feel he has something to offer. I have suggested it to him before.<br><br>'I am comfortable with Teddy contributing on the coaching here and I have made that clear to him.<br><br>'That is a decision Teddy doesn't want to make yet. At the moment he wants to concentrate on playing and I am fine with that.'<br><br>A new deal would allow Sheringham to play on at West Ham, and most probably in the Barclays Premiership, beyond his 41st birthday.<br><br>Pardew signed Sheringham from Portsmouth in 2004 and he scored 20 goals last season as West Ham won promotion back to the Barclays Premiership.<br><br>He has bagged four in 14 starts this season and faces stiff competition at Upton Park from Bobby Zamora, Marlon Harewood and new Â£7million striker Dean Ashton.<br><br>But Pardew is determined Sheringham has an important role to play in West Ham's pool of strikers.<br><br>Sheringham may lack pace and the years may be against him, but his footballing brain remains as sharp as ever.<br><br>The former England striker played a vital role in West Ham's bright start to the season and he kept Zamora out of the side until he was sidelined by a calf injury before Christmas.<br><br>'I'd have a real problem if I lost Teddy, because that is quality I don't want to lose,' said Pardew.<br><br>'Yes, we have got some fantastic strikers but so have Chelsea, so have Manchester United, so have Spurs.<br><br>``We are happy with our squad and we feel it is managed okay at the moment.'<br><br>Ashton's West Ham debut is set to be delayed as he recovers from a groin problem.<br><br>Pardew does not expect him to be fit in time for Saturday's FA Cup fourth round tie at home to Blackburn.<br><br>Goalkeeper Roy Carroll is definitely out after his ongoing back problem flared up again.<br><br>After ending his six-month search for a new striker by landing Ashton on Monday, Pardew's transfer attentions have now switched entirely to recruiting a new right-back following Tomas Repka's departure to Sparta Prague.<br><br>But he warned Hammers fans that with time running out in the transfer window, West Ham may have to wait until the summer to find a permanent replacement.<br><br>In the meantime, Christian Dailly will fill in at right-back in against Blackburn and Pardew has urged the Hammers fans to give him their full support.<br><br>Dailly's introduction against Fulham on Monday night was greeted by boos from a section of the Upton Park crowd.<br><br>'It is difficult to fill the role Tomas played but I am sure our fans will give him the encouragement to do the job,' said Pardew.<br><br>'We are working on finding a new right-back. We might not get anyone in because there is less than a week remaining in the transfer window, but we are trying hard.'<br><br></div>

It will be nice to get back out at Anfield wearing the red shirt again. Just to walk back out the tunnel will be amazing.<br><br>'You put on the red shirt again and it is just an amazing feeling and I am glad I am going to get that opportunity again.'<br><br>Fowler is ineligible for the FA Cup fourth round tie at Portsmouth tomorrow but could make his comeback against Birmingham on Wednesday.<br><br>Manager Rafael Benitez believes Fowler's passion for Liverpool will act as an example for every other player at the club.<br><br>'He has not been signed just because he loves the club, he has been signed because he is one of the best goalscorers ever to play in the Premiership and he can score goals for us right now,' he told the club's website.<br><br>'He has got a wealth of experience and he gives us more attacking options. He is a different kind of striker to what we have at the club and that is good for the team.<br><br>'People can talk about having a lot of money to buy players but we have just signed a player with a passion and a heart for this club that no amount of money can buy.<br><br>'We are close to a very high level right now but with Robbie we can go even higher.'<br><br>Fowler is not cup tied in Europe so can play in the Champions League when Liverpool resume the defence of their crown against Benfica in the last 16 next month.<br><br>Benitez, who declined to pay Â£16million for Michael Owen at the beginning of the season, has now got one of Liverpool's greatest strikers for nothing.<br><br>'My idea is for Liverpool to take one step forward and I think Robbie can help us make that step,' he added. 'It is a boost for the team, a boost for the supporters and a boost for Robbie himself.<br><br>'I am not sure I have ever seen a player quite so happy to be joining a club before. It's a signing that will lift everyone who loves Liverpool because Robbie is a great finisher who can help us reach a new level.'<br><br>Â• Meanwhile, as reports claim Fowler has taken a salary cut to return to Liverpool, Leeds have confirmed they are still paying the former England striker a wage.<br><br>Fowler had a 14-month spell at Elland Road which ended when Leeds looked to cash in on a saleable asset as they plunged into a financial crisis.<br><br>However as part of the agreement which took him to Manchester City, Leeds agreed to keep paying Fowler a proportion of his wages, to make up for the shortfall which came with moving to Eastlands.<br><br>Leeds chief operating officer Shaun Harvey told the Yorkshire Post that agreement would stand until the summer, the time Fowler's contract at Leeds was originally due to expire.<br><br>Harvey said: 'Our agreement is with Robbie Fowler and as such there will be no change.<br><br>'Leeds are not going to be relieved of any financial burden, the deal was agreed that Leeds would continue to pay Robbie Fowler until the middle of 2006 and that deal stands no matter where he plays.'<br></div>

His job appeared safe but he knew that defeat by League Two Cheltenham would not be good for his health.<br><br>In the end, Newcastle ran out comfortable winners as goals from Michael Chopra and Scott Parker inside two minutes just before half-time won the day.<br><br>However, Â£8million defender Jean-Alain Boumsong was given an uncomfortable afternoon by Nigerian-born striker Kayode Odejayi, who left him for dead four times before the break and with greater composure might have punished Newcastle.<br><br>Odejayi should have ensured a nervy conclusion for Newcastle's multi-millionaires when he escaped once again 13 minutes from time and rounded Shay Given, only to fire wide of an empty net.<br><br>Wednesday night's league trip to Manchester City and the quest for a first Premiership win in six attempts is a big priority for Souness.<br><br>'Our league form has been very up and down this year and we need to try to use this as a platform now to go and produce good results in the league,' said Parker, who made his comeback despite being up since 4am on the day of the game with a stomach bug.<br><br>The former Chelsea midfielder's strike was his first for the club, although he admitted he did not know a great deal about it after defender Jerry Gill blasted the ball straight at him in an attempt to clear.<br><br>'I was very surprised, I wasn't expecting it,' he said. 'I just made the run into the box and Peter (Ramage) put the ball in. The lad went to clear it and it just hit me in the chest. But they all count.'<br><br>Souness will hope the win does provide a platform, while opposite number John Ward has urged his players to take a creditable performance into their fight for promotion.<br><br>'The occasion has been fantastic for the whole town and we hopefully have made people see us in a good light - particularly the locals, whom we'd like to come back and watch us a few more times,' he said.<br><br>'But we need to come in on Monday morning and we have to get our heads around the trip to Peterborough and we have another 17 big efforts in our league.<br><br>'Saturday was our 41st game of the season and our 12th cup tie, so we have had a tremendous run and a tremendous number of games.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from soccernet.<br><br>Updated: Jan. 29, 2006<br>Kenyon warns FA off approach for Mourinho<br><br>Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon has warned the Football Association to forget making an approach for Jose Mourinho as they begin the hunt for the next England manager.<br><br>With Sven-Goran Eriksson due to depart after this summer's World Cup finals, the FA are looking to name his successor before the start of the tournament.<br><br>Understandably, after Mourinho's success with Porto and now Chelsea, the Portuguese is being linked with the job.<br><br>But Kenyon, who hails Mourinho as 'the best manager in Europe,' has claimed he would say 'no way' if the FA came calling.<br><br>'He's made it quite clear he's not interested, and we would make it quite clear we are not interested in letting him go,' confirmed Kenyon, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme.<br><br>'He likes Chelsea, he and his family like London, and he is very happy with what we are planning to do.<br><br>'We think he will be here to fulfil the plans we have all put in place together.<br><br>'He's another six years left on his contract, and we would like him to stay longer that that.'<br><br>It is believed the FA are to sound out Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger as part of their consultation process in recruiting the best man for the job.<br><br>Yet there is a feeling, given their years of success with Manchester United and Arsenal, either would also be suitable to take over from Eriksson.<br><br>However, Kenyon feels they are not approached because 'first and foremost they are happy with where they are with their clubs. That's an important thing.'<br><br>But he did not dismiss the prospect of another overseas appointment, adding: 'You have to look at the contribution foreign managers have made to English football, and therefore you can't rule out foreign managers.<br><br>'What they have to do is get the best manager available, and that's in the interests of everybody in English football.'<br><br>Kenyon, whose club announced on Friday a record-breaking loss of Â£140million, is hopeful Eriksson's claims of Premiership managers taking bungs have no foundation.<br><br>The Premier League last week announced the launch of an inquiry into transfers since January 2004, with their aim to make sure all future deals are transparent.<br><br>'We're supportive, along with the other 19 clubs, to the Premier League investigation,' confirmed Kenyon. 'It is important that all these transfer allegations are looked at, and we operate within a clean environment.<br><br>'Those accusations need to be dealt with, but it's impossible to say whether they will come to nothing. I hope they do for the benefit of the game.'<br><br>Despite Chelsea's staggering financial losses, Kenyon reaffirmed the commitment to breaking even by 2010.<br><br>However, much could depend on whether the club decide to remain at Stamford Bridge, or move to another site, with Earls Court and Olympia reported as likely options.<br><br>'Every bit of space that comes up in London, we get linked with,' added Kenyon. 'We are continually evaluating whether we can increase Stamford Bridge, which is what we would like to do.<br><br>'Those plans and discussions have not yet been exhausted, so until that's done there is no plan to move anywhere else. We would like to increase capacity, but it's difficult, although we have no intention of moving to Milton Keynes to achieve that!<br><br>'The extension to the ground to get capacity to 42,700 was a major achievement. To get it to over 50,000, we are working and evaluating.<br><br>'If we can't then we will evaluate other possibilities, but we are not putting a time frame on it.'<br><br>When asked about Olympia, Kenyon replied: 'It's a site that's close by and would suit, but we haven't looked at it from the large number of issues that it would bring.'<br><br>At least Chelsea's transfer spending has dipped dramatically, with Â£175million spent on players in owner Roman Abramovich's first year, to just under Â£60million.<br><br>Kenyon maintains the aim is to bring on their own players, claiming: 'One of the key aspects of our future business is to spend less on transfers and grow more of our home-grown talent.<br><br>'That's why we recruited Frank Arnesen to what was already a great academy structure. Fundamentally, it is about continuing to not spend those huge sums of money on transfers, and blend that with home-grown talent.<br><br>'We are absolutely committed to having more Chelsea-grown players in our squad.'<br><br>Birmingham chairman David Gold wants FIFA to make it statutory for all football nations to be managed by someone from their own country.<br><br>Gold has repeated his desire for Eriksson's successor to be English.<br><br>He said: 'I wish Sven well over this coming period because nothing would give me greater pleasure for all the fans who have hung in there over the years if we go on and win the World Cup. It would be fantastic.<br><br>'We have the finest England team we have had for 40 years. It is probably a chance of a lifetime. We have got the right players - I think - and we have an opportunity because the finals are in Europe.<br><br>'If Sven goes out on a high and wins the World Cup, we will all forgive him for his `misdemeanours.' But the next manager at the very least needs to be British - and I want him to be English. I believe FIFA should make it a rule that a country cannot be managed by anyone other than a national from that country.<br><br>'I bet if you went to Sweden, they wouldn't want to see an English manager in charge of their team.'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from soccernet.<br><br>Updated: Jan. 29, 2006<br>I'll fight takeover plot, insists Saints chief Lowe<br><br>Under-fire Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe has vowed he will not bow to fan pressure and be forced out of the club.<br><br>Demonstrations followed Wednesday's goalless draw against Crystal Palace at the St Mary's Stadium, with angry fans calling for Lowe to quit.<br><br>The recent departure of rising star Theo Walcott, who signed for Arsenal for a fee that could rise to Â£12million, added fuel to the fire for the supporters.<br><br>With a three-man consortium claiming to be ready to make an offer for the Saints within the next 48 hours, Lowe would appear to be coming under fire from all angles.<br><br>'In any football club, and as chairman, it comes with the territory,' said Lowe. 'What one has to try and do is remember the fans are passionate about the club and they love the club, and I bare no malice to any of the supporters.<br><br>'I can quite understand some of their disappointment, both at results and sadly, due to a loophole in the scholarship agreements, losing Theo Walcott to Arsenal.<br><br>'But I will step down when the board says it is time for me to step down, or when I decide it is time.'<br><br>Lowe is adamant the club are 'getting stronger by the day,' and refutes suggestions it is 'about to fall apart.'<br><br>Lowe is also taking no notice of the consortium planning claiming they are set to seize control, particularly as it appears they are only prepared to offer Â£10million.<br><br>'When, and if, we get a serious investor, or group of investors who want to make an offer for the club, we will look at what they propose,' added Lowe, on BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme.<br><br>'Anybody who thinks they are going to buy a public company that is currently capitalised at Â£10million, is deluding themselves.'<br><br>Entrepreneur Andrew Strode-Gibbons, who heads the consortium, believes that is the figure that would see him and his partners take over.<br><br>'I, along with many people in this city, am fed up with the way the club is being run and we want to see an end to Rupert Lowe's reign,' said Strode-Gibbons, co-founder of The Mortgage Lender company.<br><br>'We are prepared to pay what the club is worth, which is between Â£9-10million, but they have a deluded idea that the club is worth more now in the Championship than it was in the Premiership.'<br><br>If Strode-Gibbons do take over, director of football Sir Clive Woodward would find himself out of a job.<br><br>Strode-Gibbons claims that after speaking with a number of first-team players last week, they have no respect for Woodward.<br><br>'It's very unlikely we would want to keep Sir Clive Woodward,' said Strode-Gibbons. 'I'm sure he deserves a chance, but we feel he is best served in rugby, not football.<br><br>'The way things are working out at Southampton, he doesn't seem to have the respect of the players and people within the club. That's not peaceful harmony.'<br><br>Woodward, who coached England to win the rugby World Cup in 2003, was quick to counter.<br><br>'I think I've been long enough in football and professional sport to take all these things with a pinch of salt. I'm not going to find out who these players are and why they are unhappy because I don't think they are.<br><br>'But if you want to it's not too difficult to find players to say things, especially at the moment in the January window, with players going out and coming in.'<br><br></div>

This is a massive signing at the club.'<br><br>Wolfsburg paid River Plate a club record Â£6.15million for the 24-year-old in 2003 but he ruled out a return to Buenos Aires as his wife is seven months pregnant and currently unable to travel.<br><br>One player leaving Fratton Park before the midnight deadline could be Zvonimir Vukic, who claims he has joined Partizan Belgrade on a six-month loan deal.<br><br>Arsenal have surprisingly allowed Dutch youngster Quincy Owusu-Abeyie to join Spartak Moscow for an undisclosed fee.<br><br>The Gunners offloaded the talented 19-year-old forward, who has signed a permanent deal with the Russian club, after recruiting Emmanuel Adebayor and Theo Walcott recently.<br><br>The Dutch Under-21 international moved to Highbury from Ajax in 2002 and made 23 first-team appearances for Arsenal, most of them in the Carling and FA Cup.<br><br>Fulham have signed midfielder Michael Brown from Tottenham for an undisclosed fee.<br><br>The former Sheffield United player agreed a three-and-a-half-year contract after finding first-team opportunities limited at White Hart Lane.<br><br>Brown told the club's website, www.fulhamfc.com: 'I'm very excited to be joining Fulham at this point in my career and I'm looking forward to the challenges that this new opportunity brings.<br><br>'I enjoyed my time at Spurs and wish the club and its supporters well, as everyone there was really good to me.<br><br>'But if I'm honest my prospects there became very limited, so when a club like Fulham, who play attractive passing football, showed an interest in me, there really was only one decision that I could make, and I'm really looking forward to working with Chris Coleman and the rest of the squad.'<br><br>Brown's point was underlined by the news that Tottenham have completed the signing of Egyptian midfielder Hossam Ghaly on a four-and-a-half-year contract.<br><br>The 24-year-old, who has 19 international caps, arrives at White Hart Lane after two and a half seasons at Feyenoord.<br><br>Sporting director Damien Comolli told the club's website, www.spurs.co.uk: 'I have watched Hossam since he was 17 years old.<br><br>'He is a versatile, very physical and technically gifted midfielder who will offer us a number of playing options.'<br><br>Barcelona midfielder Gabri will not join West Ham after deciding to stay in Catalonia.<br><br>Gabri, who can operate in midfield or at full-back, reportedly held talks with the Hammers after Barca agreed to let him leave, but opted to remain at the Nou Camp until his current deal expires in the summer.<br><br>AC Milan confirmed they have rebuffed renewed interest from Manchester United in Switzerland midfielder Johann Vogel.<br><br>Rossoneri sporting director Ariedo Braida admitted United inquired about the 28-year-old but added they were then told the player will be staying at the San Siro.<br><br>Braida told PA Sport: 'Johann Vogel will remain at AC Milan 100%.<br><br>'It's true that Manchester United showed an interest. But no offer was made because we said from the beginning that we wanted to keep the player.'<br><br>Manchester City could face a frantic fight to keep hold of Joey Barton after the midfielder requested a move.<br><br>Manager Stuart Pearce, though, is determined to keep him and said: 'I wouldn't have done what Joey did after the club stood by him in the summer.<br><br>'I am disappointed, but more for the fans and chairman. But we hope to secure him on a long-term contract. I will talk to him today and I think something will be sorted out.'<br><br>New City striker Georgios Samaras is looking forward to putting a difficult January behind him and start scoring goals for his new club after signing from Heerenveen for Â£6million.<br><br>'It has been a tough month for me but I was pleased that City were interested in me and now I'm really happy to be here,' said the 20-year-old.<br><br>City have also secured the services of Southampton central defender Matthew Mills on a three-and-a-half-year deal.<br><br>Rory Delap has also left Southampton, signing for Sunderland on a two-and-a-half-year deal.

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from soccernet.<br><br>Updated: Jan. 31, 2006<br>Blackburn secure deals for Pongolle, Bentley<br><br>Blackburn have signed striker Florent Sinama Pongolle from Liverpool on loan until the end of the season while also wrapping up a permanent deal for David Bentley.<br><br>The 21-year-old Frenchman has struggled to break into the first team at Anfield this season and now has a chance to challenge for a place up front at Ewood Park.<br><br>Bentley, also 21, who spent the first half of the season on loan with Mark Hughes' side from Arsenal, has now made the move permanent, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract for an undisclosed fee.<br><br>Blackburn boss Mark Hughes is expecting more sparks to fly when his side face Manchester United for the third time in 22 days tomorrow.<br><br>The Carling Cup semi-final showdown with United produced two feisty games, with Sir Alex Ferguson's side emerging 3-2 aggregate winners, and now the two sides go head to head again in the Premiership.<br><br>More notably, though, Robbie Savage ended up stealing the headlines for his clashes with Wayne Rooney and Alan Smith in the first leg at Ewood Park, and then Rio Ferdinand in the return at Old Trafford.<br><br>In the initial encounter three weeks ago, Savage took exception to a Smith lunge which sent him flying, and after Rooney followed in, the midfielder grabbed the United striker in a headlock.<br><br>Referee Rob Styles, who fell as he attempted to intervene, ended up booking all three players.<br><br>Then last Wednesday, and in the words of Hughes, Ferdinand `clipped' Savage as the players made their way off the pitch at half-time.<br><br>That prompted the Welshman into confronting the United centre-back in the tunnel, although with referee Graham Poll making no mention of the incident in his match report, no action will be taken.<br><br>However, the scene is set for another lively encounter, one Hughes is relishing.<br><br>'I hope it would be a similar game because I thoroughly enjoyed the other two,' said the former United striker. 'I thought they were excellent cup ties. I think everybody enjoyed the cut and thrust of games that swung from one side to the other.<br><br>'They were well competed, and if the game tomorrow is played in the same manner then it will be a good one for everybody.'<br><br>Hughes is demanding no let-up from his players in their intensity, adding: 'I would expect all my players to have a spark. We all need that in our play, and I think we've had that for the majority of the season. We expect to compete.<br><br>'But when we have the opportunity to play, we do that as well, as we have proved this year.<br><br>'We have received a lot of plaudits for the way we have approached games, and the attacking play we have shown, and I think that will continue from now until the end of the season.<br><br>'All the players have been playing well up until this point. When they have been doing that you just send them out and tell them to do exactly what they have been doing because they've been effective.'<br><br>But when asked if there were likely to be any repercussions between Savage and Ferdinand, particularly as the latter played in midfield for Sunday's FA Cup win at Wolves, a defiant Hughes replied: 'No.'<br><br>With Rovers out of both cup competitions in the space of four days - as they were also dumped out of the FA Cup at West Ham on Saturday - the goal now is a top-six league finish, and with it a place in next season's UEFA Cup.<br><br>'We want to get into a European spot,' confirmed Hughes, who is again without key strikers Craig Bellamy and Paul Dickov through injury.<br><br>'We've set targets this year and we think they're realistic and obtainable, and we're on track at this moment in time.<br><br>'We have set ourselves a points tally that ordinarily, in most seasons, would get us a European spot. We're working on that basis.<br><br>'We may need more, we may need less. But we're hoping we've picked the right number and we can have a real go. If we can maintain our form then we will go very close.'<br><br>Blackburn have also captured 17-year-old Swedish defender Martin Olsson for 'a small transfer fee' from Hogaborgs BK.<br><br>'Martin is another young player who impressed us during a recent trial and we feel he will go on to prove to be a big asset for Rovers for many years to come,' manager Mark Hughes told www.rovers.co.uk.<br><br>Rovers striker Paul Gallagher has extended his loan at Stoke, however Hughes can recall the 21-year-old in 28 days' time.<br><br></div>

Nonetheless, the Arsenal manager made three signings in six days which could cost the club Â£22 million.<br><br>Abou Diaby's physical stature - if not his callow performances - fill the void Patrick Vieira left.<br><br>Theo Walcott and Emanuel Adebayor add to his attacking options, but it is notable that, despite Arsenal's defensive difficulties, Wenger opted against any additions at the back.<br><br>Poom apart, his signings are made with a typical concern for the long term, but with the need to guarantee Champions League football in the first season at Ashburton Grove, should Wenger have prioritised the present?<br><br>Aston Villa<br>In: None<br><br>Out: Eirik Bakke (Leeds, end of loan), Stefan Postma (Wolves, free), Wayne Henderson (Brighton, Â£35,000)<br><br>Eirik Bakke's significance lies less in his ability as a combative midfielder than as an indication of Doug Ellis' mood and Aston Villa's finances.<br><br>David O'Leary's continual refrain was that, while he lacked the budget for new buys, he hoped to extend Bakke's loan from Leeds. Ellis scotched that, leaving O'Leary with one of the smaller squads in the Premiership. At least the unsettled Lee Hendrie and the transfer-listed Mark Delaney did not reduce the playing staff still further by leaving.<br><br>And in the same month when Villa were mentioned in conjunction with David Beckham; there would have been so much more to report if the fake sheikh was in charge...<br><br>Birmingham City<br><br>In: Chris Sutton (Celtic, free), Martin Latka (Slavia Prague, loan), DJ Campbell (Brentford, Â£500,000)<br><br>Out: Walter Pandiani (Espanyol, Â£1 million), Njazi Kuqi (Blackpool, loan), Andrew Barrowman (Walsall, free)<br><br>A belated reminder of the qualities of his squad seemed to have stifled Steve Bruce. The Birmingham boss initially talked of making three buys, but the return to fitness and form of some of his underachievers coincided with a revival in their home form.<br><br>So his major signing involved a striking upgrade; out, at a Â£2 million loss, went Walter Pandiani, who scored against Liverpool and Manchester United but no-one else; in came Chris Sutton, yet to score but already central to Birmingham's gameplan. In a matter of weeks, he has already shown the catalytic qualities Christophe Dugarry displayed to save Birmingham from relegation three seasons ago.<br><br>Indeed, defensive injuries mean Bruce could benefit from two Suttons; instead, Czech Martin Latka is the late, and short-term addition to his back four while Brentford's FA Cup hero DJ Campbell represents a late impulse buy. Bruce finally got his three arrivals.<br><br>Blackburn Rovers<br><br>In: David Bentley (Arsenal, undisclosed), Florent Sinama-Pongolle (Liverpool, loan), Martin Olsson (Hogaborgs, nominal fee)<br><br>Out: Matt Jansen (Bolton, free), David Thompson (Wigan, free), Garry Flitcroft (Sheffield United, free), Andy Taylor (QPR, loan)<br><br>With a minimum of fuss, Mark Hughes has quietly disposed of three fringe players; it is testament to the consistency of a small squad that none got much of a look-in.<br><br>The one position where he sought to strengthen was in attack where Paul Dickov's shoulder injury and Craig Bellamy's stop-start season have increased their reliance on the game but limited Shefki Kuqi.<br><br>Teddy Sheringham was one target; but a deadline-day double deal made David Bentley's loan deal permanent and introduced Liverpool's speedy striker Florent Sinama-Pongolle. But Bellamy's fragile fitness remains crucial.<br><br>Bolton Wanderers<br><br>Allardyce: Cashflow kept him unusually quiet for a transfer window period.<br><br>In: Matt Jansen (Blackburn, free), Oscar Perez (Cordoba, free)<br><br>Out: Martin Djetou (released), Fabrice Fernandes (released).<br><br>A traditional conclusion to January involves Sam Allardyce frantically faxing the FA with details of his three last-minute recruits. Not this year.<br><br>To some, that is a sign of progress; Bolton no longer need relegation firefighters. For others, however, it is indicative of insufficient resources being made available to Allardyce. Captain Kevin Nolan's call for the board to finance his spending was not heeded.<br><br>The return of the quartet at the African Nations Cup will alleviate a lack of numbers, Oscar Perez provides cover for the injured Ivan Campo and Matt Jansen's versatility provides cover in the three attacking positions, but should Bolton just miss out on a Champions League place they could regret their caution.<br><br>Charlton Athletic<br><br>In: Marcus Bent (Everton, Â£2.5 million)<br><br>Out: Dean Kiely (Portsmouth, Â£750,000), Danny Murphy (Tottenham, Â£2 million), Jonatan Johansson (Norwich, loan)<br><br>Alan Curbishley has doubled his Bent quotient and, like Darren before him, Marcus made an immediate impact with a debut equaliser at Chelsea. With five former Ipswich players in his side, Curbishley may not limit his scouting trips to Portman Road in the future.<br><br>Danny Murphy's descent from automatic choice to fringe player was completed by his late move to Tottenham, removing some of the craft from one of the bigger squads in the division.<br><br>Dean Kiely's departure hardly came as a surprise but, after trying three goalkeepers already this season, it was widely anticipated that the Charlton manager would sign a fourth. He hasn't but the names at the top of his summer shopping list could include Robert Green; consistent clean sheets have eluded Charlton since that excellent start to the season.<br><br>Chelsea<br><br>In: Maniche (Dynamo Moscow, loan)<br><br>Out: Wayne Bridge (Fulham, loan)<br><br>The solitary flaw in Jose Mourinho's theory of two players per position always appeared to lie in midfield. Being reunited with Maniche should provide the remedy and, if the Portuguese is unable to show the stellar form of his Porto days, Mourinho's try-before-you-buy agreement means he will not prove costly.<br><br>Wayne Bridge's star has waned to the extent that he is now third choice left-back; William Gallas' versatility means the England man can be allowed to leave on loan.<br><br>Everton<br><br>In: Alan Stubbs (Sunderland, free)<br><br>Out: Marcus Bent (Charlton, Â£2.5 million), Per Kroldrup (Fiorentina, Â£3 million)<br><br>The sequence of four successive wins, meaning that the threat of relegation has receded, removed the element of panic-buying associated with desperate managers.<br><br>Everton, after rediscovering their form of last season, recaptured the reliable Alan Stubbs while preserving the proceeds of Per Kroldrup's move for the summer.<br><br>A Â£2 million loss on the lesser-spotted Danish defender was, however, an admission of failure and after Marcus Bent's move and the failure to sign Nicolas Anelka, among others, Moyes looks a striker light for the rest of the season. But surely reports of a move for Robbie Fowler were far fetched?<br><br>Fulham<br><br>Wayne Bridge: Now visible in his search for a World Cup place.<br><br>In: Simon Elliott (Columbus Crew, free), Antti Niemi (Southampton, Â£1 million), Wayne Bridge (Chelsea, loan), Michael Brown (Tottenham, undisclosed)<br><br>Out: Liam Fontaine, Adam Green (both Bristol City, loan), Zesh Rehman (Norwich, loan)<br><br>Few have as much to show for their January work as Chris Coleman, despite limited outlay. Benefitting from Jose Mourinho's trust, the Fulham manager has borrowed Wayne Bridge and reunited him with Antti Niemi, regularly among the Premiership's top five keepers and available cheaply once Southampton's prospects of promotion disappeared.<br><br>Enterprising in attack, Fulham's defence has been porous at times, but that could change. The combative Michael Brown joins a midfield marked by a spiky streak but with a willingness to play attacking football.<br><br>Simon Elliott, the fourth addition, is a product of Coleman's scouting in MLS. The Welshman is one of the few to tap in to the American market; perhaps he is looking to add Craven Cottage to Harrods on the tourist trail.<br><br>Liverpool<br><br>In: Jan Kromkamp (Villarreal, swap), Daniel Agger (Brondby, Â£5.8 million), David Martin (MK Dons, undisclosed fee), Paul Anderson (Hull, swap), Robbie Fowler (Manchester City, free)<br><br>Out: Josemi (Villarreal, swap), John Welsh (Hull, swap), Florent Sinama-Pongolle (Blackburn, loan), David Raven (Blackpool, loan), Mark Gonzalez (Real Sociedad, loan)<br><br>Rafael Benitez, we thought, was predictable. Not in his team selections, or his substitutions, but in the transfer market. Signings centred on Spain, much as long balls are aimed at Peter Crouch.<br><br>So what, then, is Robbie Fowler's homecoming - an inspired gamble, a rare show of nostalgia from Benitez or a public rebuke for more profligate strikers?<br><br>Elsewhere, he has concluded his lengthy search for a central defender (Daniel Agger, kept under wraps so far) and appears to have got the better part of a swap deal with Villarreal, trading the ineffective Josemi for Jan Kromkamp.<br><br>But whoever Benitez targets in the summer, the focus will be on Fowler when his short-term deal expires.<br><br>Manchester City<br><br>In: Albert Riera (Espanyol, loan), Georgios Samaras (Heerenveen, Â£6million), Matthew Mills (Southampton, undisclosed)<br><br>Out: Robbie Fowler (Liverpool, free), Jonathan D'Laryea (Mansfield, nominal fee)<br><br>The Premiership is preoccupied with the search for a new Vieira. Stuart Pearce took the rhyming option and added a Riera. The consequences may be felt most by Kiki Musampa after the arrival of another left winger on loan from Spain. Riera has been quickly acquainted with the reality of City - uplifting derby victory followed, almost inevitably, by drab defeat.<br><br>Robbie Fowler bowed out with a salute to Manchester United fans; Pearce seemingly prefers pace in attack. In his place, some of the Shaun Wright-Phillips revenue has been spent on Heerenveen's Georgios Samaras, though, with Pearce forced to virtually double his bid to secure the Greek, an early example of his ability would be timely.<br><br>One talented youngster - centre back Matthew Mills - was secured, but his arrival was overshadowed by Joey Barton's sudden wantaway tendency and an unsuccessful attempt to borrow Wright-Phillips. The midfielder, however, remains in Manchester, the winger in London.<br><br>Manchester United<br><br>Keane: No replacement found. The saga continues at OT.<br><br>In: Nemanja Vidic (Spartak Moscow, Â£7 million), Patrice Evra (Monaco, Â£5.5 million)<br><br>Out: David Bellion (Nice, loan), Sylvain Ebanks-Blake (Royal Antwerp, loan), David Jones (NEC Nijmegan, loan)<br><br>For a manager who has often professed a dislike of mid-season spending, Sir Alex Ferguson has been active, and wishes he could have increased his outlay.<br><br>The arrivals of Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra, besides yielding an uncompromising centre-half and speedy left back, may have rid the defence of complacency, with greater competition for places.<br><br>But injuries to Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and John O'Shea accelerated his hunt for a midfielder; had any been signed, the newcomer would have been burdened by comparisons to Roy Keane.<br><br>But an approach for AC Milan's Johan Vogel failed, and the search will resume in the summer. The sight of a striker and a centre back paired at the heart of midfield at Wolves was both an indictment of previous buys and an indication of the urgency of finding Keane's replacement in the summer.<br><br>Middlesbrough<br><br>In: None<br><br>Out: Szilard Nemeth (Strasbourg, nominal fee), Abel Xavier (released)<br><br>Trapped by the footballing equivalent of negative equity, Steve McClaren is stuck with what he has. Attempts to shift his big earners have failed, and now the Middlesbrough manager has a coterie of disgruntled players in his squad.<br><br>Ugo Ehiogu agreed to join West Brom only for injury-hit Middlesbrough to veto the move while Steve Gibson's demands that McClaren sell before be buys, together with the failure of a late bid for Joey Barton, precluded any arrivals.<br><br>On the plus side, at least the sacking of Abel Xavier will mean he no longer needs to wear sunglasses on the training ground.<br><br>Newcastle United<br><br>In: None<br><br>Out: Laurent Robert (Benfica, free)<br><br>Graeme Souness has had his gold credit card cut up. Without a budget to buy, he made the most optimistic of approaches for Nicolas Anelka - lacking only a transfer fee. But no signings do not mean it has been a quiet month on Tyneside.<br><br>Instead of arrivals, Newcastle have had scarcely-veiled verbal sparring between chairman - conscious of a Â£50 million outlay - and manager, unable to swing the proverbial cat in the vicinity of the treatment table lest he decapitate Kieron Dyer.<br><br>The presumption is that Newcastle would rather extend their overdraft to fund their next manager and not the current incumbent.<br><br>Portsmouth<br><br>Loanee Wayne Routledge will get a chance to put his best foot forward at Pompey.<br><br>In: Benjani (Auxerre, Â£4.1 million), Emmanuel Olisadebe (Panathinaikos, undisclosed), Pedro Mendes, Sean Davis, Noe Pamarot (all Tottenham, combined cost Â£7 million), Wayne Routledge (Tottenham, loan), Dean Kiely (Charlton, Â£750,000), Ognijen Koroman (Terek Groznyi, loan), Andres D'Alessandro (Wolfsburg, loan)<br><br>Out: Laurent Robert (end of loan), John Viafara (Real Sociedad, loan)<br><br>If a computer dating programme never matched Harry Redknapp with a wealthy Russian, it is a wonder. Redknapp, rapidly revisiting his estimate of players required upwards during the month, has enjoyed spending Alexandre Gaydamak's money, though Portsmouth's predicament has restricted him.<br><br>Porto's Benni McCarthy rejected a move to a club with 'no ambitions' while the Celtic pair of Chris Sutton and John Hartson both declined the chance to become the third striker signed in January alone. But Redknapp responded in typical fashion to coach Joe Jordan's suggestion that eight additions were needed. He got nine.<br><br>Benjani is a club record buy, Wayne Routledge rectifies a lack of right-sided players while the other former Tottenham trio strengthen the spine of the side and the dependable Dean Kiely has displaced those bought by Velimir Zajec and Alain Perrin in goal.<br><br>Perhaps the most interesting signing of all is Andres D'Alessandro, a latent talent eyeing the World Cup and signed by the man who revived Paolo di Canio's career. But while Redknapp has recruited extensively - and still laments the 14 that got away - Portsmouth's results have taken a turn for the worse.<br><br>Perhaps buying the players was the easy bit.<br><br>Sunderland<br><br>In: Kevin Smith (Leeds, free), Rory Delap (Southampton, free)<br><br>Out: Mart Poom (Arsenal, free), Alan Stubbs (Everton, free), Carl Robinson (Norwich, Â£50,000)<br><br>Such is Sunderland's predicament that January, usually a last-chance saloon for the relegation-threatened, is less of a concern than detoxing for the Championship.<br><br>Hence just two low-profile additions; Leeds reserve Kevin Smith and Rory Delap, the Southampton squad player who is the replacement for Carl Robinson. while the experienced Alan Stubbs' return to Everton allows Mick McCarthy to give his younger defenders a greater taste of the Premiership.<br><br>The summer, when the vultures may come calling for Julio Arca or Dean Whitehead, may prove the pivotal transfer window.<br><br>Tottenham Hotspur<br><br>In: Danny Murphy (Charlton, Â£2 million), Hossam Ghaly (Feyenoord, undisclosed)<br><br>Out: Pedro Mendes, Sean Davis, Noe Pamarot (all Portsmouth, combined cost Â£7 million), Philip Ifil (Millwall, loan), Reto Ziegler (Wigan, loan), Wayne Routledge (Portsmouth, loan), Michael Brown (Fulham, undisclosed fee)<br><br>Having accumulated 12 midfielders, it was evident that a little pruning of Spurs' squad was in order. Aided by Portsmouth's new-found largesse, Martin Jol now has a trimmer squad and a bigger budget.<br><br>Danny Murphy, who almost joined Spurs instead of Charlton, finally makes the move to White Hart Lane and offers the versatility and technique to fit into any of Jol's many midfield permutations.<br><br>Hossam Ghaly, signed from Feyenoord, is the other new face in the centre of the pitch but the failure of the bid for Jonathan Zebina means the defence is unchanged.<br><br>But Mido's absence in Africa showed Spurs' reliance on the Egyptian to provide an aerial option in attack and Jol's inability to add another striker to strengthen their push for a Champions League place may have been his major regret when the window shut.<br><br>West Bromwich Albion<br><br>In: Williams Martinez (Defensor, loan), Nigel Quashie (Southampton, undisclosed)<br><br>Out: Darren Moore (Derby, Â£500,000), Riccardo Scimeca (Cardiff, free), Rob Earnshaw (Norwich, Â£2.75 million), Lloyd Dyer (Millwall, free)<br><br>As a player, Bryan Robson was noted for the timing of his arrival in the penalty box.<br><br>As a manager, he just beat the transfer deadline to secure the signing of the forceful Nigel Quashie, a belated triumph in a cruel month.<br><br>Because West Brom have haemorrhaged players, even though none were considered a first choice by their manager, while there has only been one other addition.<br><br>That Ugo Ehiogu's on-off transfer resulted in the centre back remaining at the Riverside was a particular frustration. Robert Earnshaw's goals saved West Brom from relegation last year, but there will be no repeat after Robson sold the reserve to Norwich<br><br>West Ham United<br><br>Dean Ashton: A heavy gamble at Â£7million<br><br>In: Dean Ashton (Norwich City, Â£7.25 million), Yaniv Katan (Maccabi Haifa, Â£100,000), Lionel Scaloni (Deportivo la Coruna, loan)<br><br>Out: David Bellion (end of loan), Moses Ashikodi (Rangers, free), Tomas Repka (Sparta Prague, free)<br><br>Few would have imagined that Tomas Repka would prove irreplaceable. He nearly did, though; the search for a replacement for the widely-derided and homeward-bound right back was fruitless until, in the closing minutes of the window, Deportivo la Coruna's Argentine defender Lionel Scaloni squeezed through.<br><br>In attack, however, Alan Pardew now has five forwards and still repelled Spurs' inquiry about Teddy Sheringham. That even his board wondered if he paid over the odds for Dean Ashton, however, means West Ham's record buy has to vindicate his manager's judgment.<br><br>Wigan Athletic<br><br>In: David Thompson (Blackburn, free), Neil Mellor (Liverpool, loan), Reto Ziegler (Tottenham, loan), Paul Scharner (Brann Bergen, Â£2 million)<br><br>Out: None<br><br>Paul Jewell could be forgiven for thinking he has the Midas touch; for three signings to score debut goals within a month is a remarkable success rate.<br><br>It also brought welcome options to a small and injury-hit squad. Scharner, the giant Austrian, has already made his presence felt in both the centre of defence and midfield while the versatile Thompson's combination of competitiveness and incisive passing makes him well-suited to Wigan.<br><br>After also recruiting Henri Camara, Arjan de Zeeuw and Pascal Chimbonda in the summer, Jewell should expect calls from his peers looking for a few tips.<br></div>
