            <div class='col-md body'>the problem is even if he resigns or the club sack him, it's not easy to find someone who has the quality to manage a club like man utd. u need to find someone with excellent track record, and consistency... i dont think any kevin keegan or glen hoddle is good enough to manage man utd. Even if you can find such a manager... does he want to come to man utd? Sir Alex is still the most qualified person to manage man utd, sure, we may think he's not good enough or too old fashion, but can man utd guarantee success just by appointing another manager.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from soccernet.<br><br>Updated: Jan. 23, 2006<br>United defend Â£1.5m payment to Rooney's agent<br><br>Manchester United chief executive David Gill insists the Old Trafford outfit have not paid over the odds in sanctioning a Â£1.5million payment to Wayne Rooney's agent.<br><br>The staggering sum was part of the deal which saw Rooney complete a Â£27million move to United from Everton in August 2004.<br><br>Despite a formal bid from Newcastle, Rooney had made it known that he was only interested in joining the Red Devils, a fact which just makes the cash paid to the player's agent Paul Stretford appear more remarkable.<br><br>Yet Gill, who will this morning confirm a 20 per cent dip in profits to Â£46million, is adamant the money represents the market rate for transfers of this magnitude.<br><br>'These sums represent the market place we operate in and the costs which have to be incurred to secure top talent,' said Gill. 'The agent provides a service. The issue is who pays for it, the player or the acquiring club.<br><br>'But either way, it is not a zero-sum game. In the case of Wayne Rooney, if he had to pay his agent, he would just demand a higher salary. The money has to come from somewhere.'<br><br>Despite United now reverting back to the private ownership of Malcolm Glazer, Gill has opted to continue the tradition of United's PLC days by outlining payments to agents.<br><br>But, by being the only Premier League club to do so, Gill feels United come in for some unfair criticism.<br><br>'We have nothing to hide,' he said. 'We are transparent and publish our figures when no other Premier League club does, so I do not see why we should be castigated or hauled over the coals for it.<br><br>'As a club we believe the whole regulatory system would benefit from universal publication and it would help debunk some of the myths around agents at the moment.'<br><br>But, while he accepts by definition not all agents are 'good', Gill is adamant he has no evidence of a bung culture many believe to be prevalent in the United Kingdom.<br><br>'I have never experienced it,' stated Gill. 'I have heard what people say about it but I have never come across it.<br><br>'In nine years at the club I have been increasingly involved in transfer dealings and I can categorically deny anyone has mentioned anything at all like that to me.<br><br>'Like most things in life, there are good agents and bad agents. The player is the boss and the agent should be carrying out his wishes but I accept sometimes it works the other way round.<br><br>'However, as a club we operate in a very professional manner. We have agreements, everything is registered and all the payments go through the FA.'<br><br>Although Gill confirmed the Â£12million arrivals of Patrice Evra and Nemanja Vidic represent United's last activity during the transfer window, he said money will be made available to Sir Alex Ferguson in the summer to reinforce his midfield.<br><br>There were many who claimed Ferguson's days at Old Trafford were numbered following United's disastrous early exit from the Champions League and failure to keep pace with Chelsea in the Premiership.<br><br>However, Gill, who cited a loss in media revenues as the main reason for the fall in profits, has refuted that theory.<br><br>'Sir Alex has the full support of everyone at the club and will be here for many years to come,' said Gill. 'He has the energy, enthusiasm and appetite to ensure we get back up there challenging for the league.'<br><br>Â• Greater Manchester Police have written to the Football Association and Manchester United to complain over Gary Neville's goal celebrations in the 1-0 win over Liverpool at Old Trafford.<br><br>United skipper Neville ran the length of the pitch to celebrate Rio Ferdinand's match-winning header in front of the opposition fans.<br><br>A statement from GMP read: 'Chief Superintendent Andy Holt has written a letter expressing his concern. No criminal investigation is taking place at this stage.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from soccernet.<br><br>Updated: Jan. 23, 2006<br>United's debts are 'serviceable', insists chief exec Gill<br><br>Chief executive David Gill is adamant Manchester United is in no danger of being crushed by the mammoth level of debt incurred by Malcolm Glazer's takeover.<br><br>While the merits of Glazer's Â£790million buy-out, which took the Old Trafford club back into private hands after 14 years as a publicly-quoted company, continue to be hotly-debated, the issue of debt concerns most fans.<br><br>In total, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers owner borrowed Â£540million to buy United, roughly half of which has been lodged against the club's assets, with the rest sat against his own in the form of hedge funds.<br><br>Chelsea's present undisputable status as the Premiership's top side, coupled with the Red Devils failure to make any real impact in Europe for the past three seasons and a subsequent 20 per cent fall in profits, has led to widespread fears United could eventually end up under the control of the banks who lent Glazer the cash.<br><br>But, speaking about the debt levels for the first time since the takeover, Gill said that neither Glazer's business plan, nor the banks' financing plans, were set at such a high level that United's future was in peril.<br><br>'Manchester United will not implode by finishing third in the Premiership,' he said. 'Neither our internal business plan, nor the bank financing plan is based on first, first, first, cup, cup, cup.<br><br>'It is based on the sensible levels we were following as a PLC, which were fairly conservative and based around finishing fourth in the Premiership and getting into Europe. It is about the same now.'<br><br>While Gill's assertion will be met with disdain by major supporter groups whose protests against Glazer continued prior to yesterday's win over Liverpool by the distribution of 40,000 cards urging fans to join the Manchester United Supporters Trust, he was able to clarify some of the misconceptions he feels have grown around the debt and how it will be repaid.<br><br>'There are two elements to the debt, the hedge funds and the senior debt,' explained Gill.<br><br>'The hedge funds have no security over the club and no influence over it either. Yes, they have to be repaid but that is something the Glazers will do from their own resources or refinancing plans in time.<br><br>'Manchester United is supporting the senior debt, which is around Â£265million-Â£275million.<br><br>'People need to recognise the cost of servicing the interest on that debt is not in excess of the what we were previously paying in dividends and corporation tax as a publicly quoted company.<br><br>'The debt itself is serviceable because our cash generation will improve through the expansion of the stadium and other things.'<br><br>Extra revenue is also anticipated through an increased shirt sponsorship deal following Vodafone's decision to terminate their Â£9million-a-year contract two years early.<br><br>With TV revenues unlikely to rise, United's main other area for immediate expansion appear to be within the overseas market, which amazingly yielded just Â£350,000 of the club's multi-million pound turnover, a figure put down to the relative failure of a second United States tour.<br><br>Prize money is another aspect which could be improved, although the early Champions League exit has scuppered that avenue for this season at least.<br><br>The loss of income sustained by the shock reverse to Benfica could be eased by Sir Alex Ferguson's men at least snatching runners-up spot this season.<br><br>Finishing second rather than third will net United an estimated extra Â£2million from the central Champions League pot, while Ferguson's men remain on target to at least equal their record in domestic cup competitions last term when they reached a final and a semi-final, eventually losing both.<br><br>'This is a new era,' said Gill. 'We didn't have any debt before and now we do but I am quite comfortable about that situation.<br><br>'There is potential for expansion in a number of areas, which will help service the debt but what we need to do is make sure we continue to be successful, which for us is being up there challenging for honours and getting beyond the group stage in Europe.<br><br>'Last year we finished third in the Premiership, lost to the eventual winners in the semi-final of the Carling Cup, got beaten in the FA Cup final and went out of Europe to the Champions League finalists.<br><br>'A lot of teams would say that is a great season. But I agree, Manchester United is not a lot of teams. We want to win trophies, that is the challenge. But in sport, no-one can guarantee that.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from premierleague.com<br><br><strong>VAN DER SAR: MAKE OR BREAK FOR UNITED</strong><br><br>Edwin van der Sar believes the next fortnight could make or break Manchester United's season.<br><br>The Red Devils visit Portsmouth in the Barclays Premiership on Saturday looking to consolidate second spot in the table before embarking on a crucial cup double, starting with a trip to Liverpool in the FA Cup before tackling Wigan Athletic in the Carling Cup final on February 26.<br><br>Van der Sar knows three wins would leave United looking forward to the remainder of the season with some silverware already in the cabinet.<br><br>But a hat-trick of defeats would all but condemn Sir Alex FergusonÂ’s men to back-to-back trophyless campaigns for the first time in 17 years, a thought Van der Sar is not prepared to contemplate.<br><br>Â“These next few games are very important if we are going to get some silverware this season,Â” said the giant Dutchman.<br><br>Â“It is important for this club to be playing in finals and when you are there, you want to bring the trophy back with you.<br><br>Â“Our only two possibilities for trophies at the moment are the Carling Cup and the FA Cup but I am not going to choose between finishing second and winning a cup.<br><br>Â“We still have 13 matches to go and a lot of points to play for. Chelsea do have a lot more than us but we just have to keep winning and try to finish as close to them as we possibly can.Â”<br><br>Van der Sar has been widely regarded as a force for good at Old Trafford this term.<br><br>A Â£2million arrival from Fulham last summer, the 34-year-old has brought vital experience to UnitedÂ’s back four and though he has made some mistakes, they have been far fewer in number than at virtually any stage since the departure of Peter Schmeichel in 1999.<br><br>Unfortunately for the former Ajax man, one of his major errors came at Blackburn Rovers last week when a breakdown in communication with Rio Ferdinand gifted Rovers their crucial second in an Ewood Park win.<br><br>Van der Sar exchanged angry words with the Â£29.1million England man immediately after the incident, but he insists the fall-out was only brief.<br><br>Â“It was very unlucky because I came for it and shouted but Rio did not hear me,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“It did not look good on TV and for a few seconds your frustration takes over and you say a few things.<br><br>Â“But it was nothing vicious and the following morning to have more time to discuss what happened in a more rational manner.Â”<br><br>The mistake is one of the reasons why Van der Sar claims to be only "semi-pleased" with his United performances to date.<br><br>It is an analysis most would regard as harsh but reflects the standards of a man who hopes to captain his country to World Cup glory in Germany this summer.<br><br>In order to achieve that lofty ambition, Van der Sar knows Holland may eventually have to dispose of England at some stage in the competition - and that means finding a way of stopping Wayne Rooney.<br><br>Coming from a country which has spawned the likes of Johan Cruyff, Marco van Basten and Ruud Gullit, Van der Sar knows a player of top quality when he sees one - and Rooney is the real deal.<br><br>Â“He is, quite rightly, very highly regarded in world football,Â” said the veteran 'keeper.<br><br>Â“Even now, I still forget he is only 20. It is unbelievable.<br><br>Â“The best thing about Wayne is that he is not only capable of producing top-class performances, he does it at crucial moments in matches and can score important goals.Â”<br><br>Meanwhile, striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer believes he will need a couple of reserve matches before being ready for first-team duty.<br><br>The 32-year-old is scheduled to appear for the second team on Thursday against Aston Villa following a hamstring strain.<br><br>The injury is not related to the knee problems which have caused him so much misery and meant a 19-month absence from the game.<br><br>Solskjaer told MUTV: Â“I have been training for the past few days. It (the hamstring injury) is one of those things that happen when you have been out for a while.<br><br>Â“After a couple of weeks with the physios again I am ready to get back on the pitch.<br><br>Â“My knee is holding up and doing what I want it to do so I am very pleased.<br><br>Â“But I think I will need a couple of reserve games before I can get back in the first team.Â”<br></div>

Manchester United legend Eric Cantona fears Wayne Rooney's top-flight career could be over within five years.<br>Rooney, 20, is already a key player for United and England but Cantona is worried about his lifestyle.<br><br>He told the Daily Telegraph: "Rooney can be the best in the world at 25 if he knows you need to train hard, go to bed early and be careful what you eat.<br><br>"But he could also be out of the best teams, out of England, out of the best 100 players. Completely out."<br><br>Cantona feels Rooney needs advice now to ensure the longevity of his career.<br><br>He added: "This is very, very important. All the best players in the world knew all the time these kinds of things are very important.<br><br>"I am sure (United boss) Alex Ferguson is very strong and will help. Rooney is still young.<br><br>"But somebody needs to say it to him. The last time I saw him I wanted to say it but I saw him only quickly."<br><br>The former France international, 39, points at Robbie Fowler as an example of a teenage talent who has not fulfilled his full potential.<br><br>He said: "Fowler was so good at 18, and four, five years later, at 23 or 24, finished, not even playing regularly for England, not even for the best teams. Finished.<br><br>"Completely. Out. Why?<br><br>"Clubs should ask why this kind of player is out. They say in England it is very difficult because of the media pressure. But it is not more difficult than in Italy, Spain or Brazil."<br><br></div>
