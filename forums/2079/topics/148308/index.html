As the ball was swept forward, Thomas Kahlenberg found Tomasson out wide.<br><br>But David James, who had replaced Robinson at the break, came sprinting off his line and failed to make contact with the ball.<br><br>Ashley Cole tried to cover but the Stuttgart man was able to cross for Rommedahl who had an easy tap-in.<br><br>Three minutes later, it was 2-0.<br><br>This time Claus Jensen beat the weak challenge of substitute defender Glen Johnson and although his cross was half-cleared by Cole, Tomasson was on hand to head home his 36th international goal.<br><br>England were reeling and conceded a third in 67th minute.<br><br>This time it was substitute Gravgaard who was on target heading in a cross from the right after he managed to squeeze in between Jamie Carragher, another second half substitute, and Steven Gerrard.<br><br>Rooney grabbed a consolation three minutes from the end from an incisive pass from Beckham but Larsen then poked home the fourth for the Danes past a hapless James in stoppage time.<br><br>The defeat gives England plenty to think about ahead of their next World Cup qualifier against Wales in Cardiff on September 3. - AFP /dt<br><br></div>

The game against Chile is only in a fortnight and hope that they'll be in better physical condition and more motivated after training for their respective clubs."<br><br>The wet weather conspired against any slick moving action, the last time Brazil had encountered such conditions, in the Confederations Cup final against Argentina in Frankfurt in June, the stadium roof had kept them dry.<br><br>Brazil made the first move with a Roberto Carlos freekick going close, then Ronaldo stirred the Croatian keeper into action with a shot in the ninth minute.<br><br>Having contained the Brazilians Croatia fought back with skipper Kranjcar putting them in the lead with a shot when his shot hit the post and he pounced on the rebound to foil Brazil keeper Dida.<br><br>But Croatia only held the lead for ten minutes when Ricardinho produced a neat freekick which flew into the back of the hosts' net.<br><br>Parreira brought on Real Madrid's new recruit Robinho in the second half but it was his teammate Ronaldo who fluffed a chance in the 57th minute.<br><br>- AFP/ir<br><br></div>

The striker posed all sorts of problems for the Saudi defence in the first half.<br><br>But even the composed Ahn failed to hit the target although he came close on several occasions.<br><br>The game could have turned out differently if a brilliant shot by Baek Ji-Hoon, a relative newcomer at 20, had found the target and given South Korea an equaliser just eight minutes into the match.<br><br>His finishing was perfect but he was frustrated by a save of rare quality from Saudi goalkeeper Zaid Mabrouk. - AFP /ch<br><br></div>
