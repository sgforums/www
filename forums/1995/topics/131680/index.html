            <div class='col-md body'>Do you think they act on your interest or their own?<br>When you walk into a bank, what they try to do is to SELL you a financial product rather than ADVISE you. The financial Fact finder is designed to always show a need for some knid of financial product.<br>Even if you have all the products and all the money in the world, you are definately short of something...<br>So beware when you meet these people, either as individuals or at Banks.<br>Remember, you need to have money before they are your friends.<br><br>If you don't believe me, try this.<br>When you are approached to buy insurance, try to steer towards Term insurance.... (Term insurance has very low commission to the seller.)<br>They would most probably cite that Life insurance has a return and etc etc.<br>(Also better for them because they get better commission).<br>Once you sign, you sign for life.<br><br>Buy only what you can afford, not based on what you are projected to earn.<br>You should be comfortable with your monthly payments. In today's world, I would suggest less than 3%.<br><br>Any comments</div>
