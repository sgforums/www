              <p>CCK / LCK area is a bit haunted place for me, especially LCK.. Fyi, my sec sch, CCKSS, was once a malay cemetery? Btw, some of the teachers &amp; the janitors in my sch KNOWS that there ARE ghosts lurking around our sch. Ive olso encountered once..</p>
              <p>During recess time, i stayed back in the class coz i wasnt feeling well that day. Since every1 had left the class (including other classes), i played games in my HP. Suddenly, i smelt something fragant, like a mixture smell of roses &amp; stuffs... It was coming at the right side of the window of my class (direction where the army camp is). I immediately stopped playing my HP &amp; looked outside the army camp. The smell was too damn strong until i coughed very hard, until got abit of blood at my mouth <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif">.. As i looked outside, suddenly, I saw this 'janitor' at the camp with long, white &amp; frizzy hair, sweeping the floor when its alreadyy cleaned up.. i was like <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"> coz it really CREEP ME OUT! Without knowing, suddenly, the 'janitor' dropped her broom &amp; she just stood there like a statue. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"> I kept staring at her; wanting to know wat shes gonna do next. I immediately <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SCREAMED</strong></span> like MAD when suddenly the 'janitor' dissapeared to thin air!!!!

Really cant believe it &amp; when i said this story to my frens, they <strong>EVEN</strong> encountered the <strong>SAME</strong> story like mine, but at a diff location. Most of my frens said that they saw that 'janitor' near a medium-sized tree at the school..</p>
              <p>That encounter olso teached me a lesson - Dont be alone in class during recess time..</p>

              <p>So, maybe we could come down and do some investigations. Is it CCKSS near the mosque? And can you pin-point the exact location where the windows was facing and where you saw her?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>My colleague saw a pochong and a pontianak there at night. He sent his buddy to pick up his car there in the area, the new road behind the Autobay next to the SAF driving circuit. So that's why my group went there to check it out.</div>

              <p>So, maybe we could come down and do some investigations. Is it
                  CCKSS near the mosque? And can you pin-point the exact location
                  where the windows was facing and where you saw her?</p>

              <p>Im really nt sure btw, but since the beginning of this yr, that 'janitor' is nowhere to be found already. The 1 tht ive encountered is last yr. So, its nt that 'scary' already since many ppl had forgotten the 'janitor' incident.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the information SMB. No matter what, we will try to get a coverage on that incident of yours. Hopefully we'll find some evidence of the 'Janitor's existence.Â </p>

              <p>CCK / LCK area is a bit haunted place for me, especially LCK..
              Fyi, my sec sch, CCKSS, was once a malay cemetery? Btw, some of the
              teachers &amp; the janitors in my sch KNOWS that there ARE ghosts
              lurking around our sch. Ive olso encountered once..</p>
              <p>During recess time, i stayed back in the class coz i wasnt
              feeling well that day. Since every1 had left the class (including
              other classes), i played games in my HP. Suddenly, i smelt
              something fragant, like a mixture smell of roses &amp; stuffs... It
              was coming at the right side of the window of my class (direction
              where the army camp is). I immediately stopped playing my HP &amp;
              looked outside the army camp. The smell was too damn strong until i
              coughed very hard, until got abit of blood at my mouth <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif">.. As
              i looked outside, suddenly, I saw this 'janitor' at the camp with
              long, white &amp; frizzy hair, sweeping the floor when its alreadyy
              cleaned up.. i was like <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"> coz
              it really CREEP ME OUT! Without knowing, suddenly, the 'janitor'
              dropped her broom &amp; she just stood there like a statue.
              <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"> I kept staring at her; wanting to know wat shes
              gonna do next. I immediately <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SCREAMED</strong></span> like MAD when
              suddenly the 'janitor' dissapeared to thin air!!!! WTFOMG <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif">. Really cant believe it &amp; when i said
              this story to my frens, they <strong>EVEN</strong> encountered the
              <strong>SAME</strong> story like mine, but at a diff location. Most
              of my frens said that they saw that 'janitor' near a medium-sized
              tree at the school..</p>
              <p>That encounter olso teached me a lesson - Dont be alone in class
              during recess time..</p>
