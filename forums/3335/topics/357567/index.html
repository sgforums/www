              <p>CCK / LCK area is a bit haunted place for me, especially LCK.. Fyi, my sec sch, CCKSS, was once a malay cemetery? Btw, some of the teachers &amp; the janitors in my sch KNOWS that there ARE ghosts lurking around our sch. Ive olso encountered once..</p>
              <p>During recess time, i stayed back in the class coz i wasnt feeling well that day. Since every1 had left the class (including other classes), i played games in my HP. Suddenly, i smelt something fragant, like a mixture smell of roses &amp; stuffs... It was coming at the right side of the window of my class (direction where the army camp is). I immediately stopped playing my HP &amp; looked outside the army camp. The smell was too damn strong until i coughed very hard, until got abit of blood at my mouth <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif">.. As i looked outside, suddenly, I saw this 'janitor' at the camp with long, white &amp; frizzy hair, sweeping the floor when its alreadyy cleaned up.. i was like <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"> coz it really CREEP ME OUT! Without knowing, suddenly, the 'janitor' dropped her broom &amp; she just stood there like a statue. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"> I kept staring at her; wanting to know wat shes gonna do next. I immediately <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SCREAMED</strong></span> like MAD when suddenly the 'janitor' dissapeared to thin air!!!!

              <p>So, maybe we could come down and do some investigations. Is it CCKSS near the mosque? And can you pin-point the exact location where the windows was facing and where you saw her?</p>

              <p>So, maybe we could come down and do some investigations. Is it
                  CCKSS near the mosque? And can you pin-point the exact location
                  where the windows was facing and where you saw her?</p>

              <p>Im really nt sure btw, but since the beginning of this yr, that 'janitor' is nowhere to be found already. The 1 tht ive encountered is last yr. So, its nt that 'scary' already since many ppl had forgotten the 'janitor' incident.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the information SMB. No matter what, we will try to get a coverage on that incident of yours. Hopefully we'll find some evidence of the 'Janitor's existence. </p>

              <p>CCK / LCK area is a bit haunted place for me, especially LCK..
              Fyi, my sec sch, CCKSS, was once a malay cemetery? Btw, some of the
              teachers &amp; the janitors in my sch KNOWS that there ARE ghosts
              lurking around our sch. Ive olso encountered once..</p>
              <p>During recess time, i stayed back in the class coz i wasnt
              feeling well that day. Since every1 had left the class (including
              other classes), i played games in my HP. Suddenly, i smelt
              something fragant, like a mixture smell of roses &amp; stuffs... It
              was coming at the right side of the window of my class (direction
              where the army camp is). I immediately stopped playing my HP &amp;
              looked outside the army camp. The smell was too damn strong until i
              coughed very hard, until got abit of blood at my mouth <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif">.. As
              i looked outside, suddenly, I saw this 'janitor' at the camp with
              long, white &amp; frizzy hair, sweeping the floor when its alreadyy
              cleaned up.. i was like <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"> coz
              it really CREEP ME OUT! Without knowing, suddenly, the 'janitor'
              dropped her broom &amp; she just stood there like a statue.
              <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"> I kept staring at her; wanting to know wat shes
              gonna do next. I immediately <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SCREAMED</strong></span> like MAD when
              suddenly the 'janitor' dissapeared to thin air!!!! WTFOMG <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif">. Really cant believe it &amp; when i said
              this story to my frens, they <strong>EVEN</strong> encountered the
              <strong>SAME</strong> story like mine, but at a diff location. Most
              of my frens said that they saw that 'janitor' near a medium-sized
              tree at the school..</p>
              <p>That encounter olso teached me a lesson - Dont be alone in class
              during recess time..</p>
