There are many paths to the shrine, we are using the easiest path known.<br>Objective : To know the route to the shinto shrine during this recce, and to lay down the route using reflective cordon tape on tree barks and/or thru' GPS methods, so that a camp can be planned later<br>Interested : Please email in advance at least 1 week before, subtleknife89@gmail.com<br><br>The shinto shrine is a WW II relic and is located in the mcritchie forest, can read up more on the net about it [:)]<br><br>We have to do a day recce first. I have went there before twice, and I should be able to lead the way.<br><br>The day recce is to be held with minimal equipment ( but with sufficient fluids in case get lost, though highly unlikely with a compass ), and the next weekend a 2 days 1 night camp there, leaving around mid-day after staying the night there.<br><br>Terrain is not tough for experienced &amp; normal trekkers, since we are using a new route.<br><br>I am an ex-JC student, now serving NS, was from a paranormal research organisation but quited because there was no evidence of the paranormal despite us going in very small groups and exploring exotic palces. I do this kind of things pretty often i.e. going into the wilderness without a path. There is a slight path in this case, but easy to get lost because the path is not clear ( covered by vegetation, etc ).<br><br>The recce should be easy. In the past we ( paranormal research organisation ) went thru' a "no-path" way passing thru' knee-deep swamp and climbing over fallen trees and got ourselves all soaked and drenched, not to mention 50 scratches on each hand due to thorny vegetation.<br><br>But now we have a route which has some sort of a path, even partially cordoned on barks and landmarks by some kind soul ( we didn't know about its existence earlier )<br><br>The 2 day camp will involve some make-shift tentage, with pre-packed food and fluids to last us the night. I do not think a camp fire would be required.<br><br>A basic trauma and resuscitation bagpack will be brought to tackle any emergencies during the 2 day camp.

              sure :)
              
              day recce is held on 30th may, we enter at 0930 hours and leave asap once we reach location, do a brief note of the terrain at the shinto shrine area and take some photos.
              
              for the camp, 
              
              The safest option : enter in the morning, set up camp there. and explore the whole place, ending at sunset. leave the next morning ( safest option ) . by leaving as early as possible, we reduce the risk of being stuck inside &amp; lost at night.

              regd supernatural occurences, spi does have. in fact they published on it. but as you know, spi like to exaagerate and probably cook up stories? I'm not too sure and cant say much as don't know about spi. heard it s very spooky at night, and even to the point of outright scary. i dont know. i have been to many places like och, ocb, mcritchie, all the coloured houses, devils bend, pasir ris mangrove swamp, ulu sembawang, even in small groups or just with a girl-friend, nothing wrong. lol.
              
              So please email me your 3 buddies details so that we do a preliminary recce first, email name, IC, handphone no. and any significant medical history. or can just PM me. its just for record purposes.
              
              Regd the camp, do you guys have tents or any camping equipment? What about paranomral research devices? I have some like laser non-contact thermometer, advanced tactical lights, etc

              I do have equipment too for ghost-hunting such as non-contact laser-aimed infrared thermometer, high powered lasers and tactical torches, digital camera, night vision device, camcorder, digital camera and hygrometer and compass.
              
              Regarding the recce, there will be a camp instead and no recce. This is due to the ease of location. The date of the camp is 20th June ( Confirmed ) , meeting at McRitchie Carpark at 10am, further details TBA. 
              
              Please RVSP your attendance :)
