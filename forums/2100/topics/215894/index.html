It is based in Singapore and has 47 members, including Japan, Britain and the US.<br><br>Some people used to laugh when his work with toilets was first written about. Well, he's having the last laugh now because:<br>National Geographic channel is to show a documentary on the WTO.<br>Harvard University is writing a case study on it.<br>And Mr Sim has been named Social Entrepreneur of the Year by the Schwab Foundation of Switzerland, jointly with the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports.<br><br>Armed with a vision and a sense of humour, he works for good sanitation across the world, lobbying for funds to build toilets in developing countries.<br><br>Mr Sim said there are 2.6 billion people in the world who have no toilets.<br><br>'The story of Singapore's economic progress runs parallel to its toilet development,' he said.<br><br>'From no toilets to disgusting toilets... to professional restroom specialists. Singapore is the model for the world to follow.'<br><br>And now, Mr Sim's story will be made into a documentary and shown worldwide next year.<br><br>Earlier this year, Mr Sim got a call from local documentary maker Viswa Sadasivan of The Right Angle.<br><br>Mr Sadasivan told him they were pitching the idea of a documentary on the WTO to National Geographic Channel and asked if he was game.<br><br>The veteran journalist and the crusading toilet builder met and took a few months to put together a pitch, which convinced the channel that it was worth funding.<br><br>Said Mr Sadasivan: 'I found Jack to be a man of exceptional foresight with the courage to confront a dirty issue... a global revolutionary in his own right.'<br><br>More recently, Harvard University got in touch with Mr Sim to say it wants to write a case study about the WTO. Mr Sim, who owns a building materials company with a turnover of $10 million a year, laughs along when anyone makes a joke about taking toilets as seriously as he does.<br><br>After all, he knows that a bit of 'toilet humour' is sometimes the best way to get people interested in the subject.<br><br>And for that, he has Thailand's Mr Mechai Viravaidya, - better known as Mr Condom - to thank.<br><br>Mr Mechai, who chairs the Population and Community Development Association of Thailand, is famous for educating the public there about family planning and safe sex.<br><br>'Toilets, like condoms, are taboo. I reckoned that if he can do it with condoms, I should learn from him,' said Mr Sim. 'He taught me a very important lesson: Don't take yourself too seriously. People will laugh at you. You must laugh with them. And after that, they'll listen to your real messages.'<br><br>They became friends and Mr Mechai is now on the WTO advisory board.<br><br>Mr Sim's interest in toilets began around 1962, when he was growing up in a village in Lorong Ong Lye.<br><br>'My mother told me I was old enough to use the village common toilet. But I did not rejoice. The sanitation in our village worked on the bucket system,' he said.<br><br>'The bucket gets real ugly after breakfast and also those giant green houseflies were very annoying for a 5-year-old.'<br><br>He ended up using the chamber pot in the privacy of their house.<br><br>In 1996, then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said: 'Let the cleanliness of our public toilets be a measurement of our social graciousness.'<br><br>Mr Sim said: 'I started asking myself many questions: Why do people behave badly in public toilets but not at home?<br><br>'I've always wanted to do volunteer work and thought, 'Perhaps the toilet is my calling!' Gradually, I decided to do something about it. I finally got the Restroom Association of Singapore officially registered in 1998.'<br><br>In 1999, he read in a Japanese magazine that there was a Japan Toilet Association, so he contacted the officers, who invited him to their Asia-Pacific Toilet Symposium in Kitakyushu.<br><br>'I asked them where was the world's HQ for discussing the toilet but was told there was none,' said Mr Sim.<br><br>And so he started the WTO, a non-profit organisation that aims to provide clean public toilets without additional stress on the environment.<br><br>It organises conferences, does research and runs disaster relief projects. Members are from restroom associations or like-minded bodies from around the world.<br><br>'I am so glad to be able to depart from the rat race, and to find peace with myself and the world,' said Mr Sim.<br><br>'Many people wish to do the same... Well, they should have a long think about it. It's no secret where I do my best thinking.'</div>
