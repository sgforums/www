              <h1 class="clr">Lack of toilets putting millions at risk: UN</h1>
              <p>GENEVA (AFP) - - It is a subject that polite society might prefer to
              avoid, but in the developing world, lack of access to toilets is a
              serious issue that puts lives at stake, two UN agencies said Thursday.</p>
              <p>About two in every five people still have no access to a proper
              toilet, said the World Health Organisation and the UN Childrens Fund
              (UNICEF), warning that the lack of sanitation is putting 2.6 billion
              people at risk of disease.</p>
              <p>"In the world today, there are 15
              million deaths caused by infectious diseases," said David Heyman, WHO's
              assistant director general for health security and environment.</p>
              <p>"If
              we had good sanitation today, and good water supplies, we could
              decrease that immediately by two million -- those children who are
              dying unnecessarily from diarrhoea diseases."</p>
              <p>The United Nations
              has declared 2008 the International Year of Sanitation, and it made use
              of International Water Day -- Thursday -- to highlight the issue.</p>
              <p>"People
              don't like to talk about sanitation," said Jon Lane, executive director
              of the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council, a UN-mandated
              organisation that works for better sanitation in poor communities.</p>
              <p>"It's a subject that is not spoken about in conventional polite society -- and that's been a problem for a long time."</p>
              <p>In
              a survey by the British Medical Journal of 11,000 health professionals,
              sanitation was cited as the most important medical advancement since
              1840, ahead of vaccines and anaesthesia.</p>
              <p>But Lane said that some governments approach the issue in the wrong way.</p>
              <p>"They've
              been using top-down, centralised, supply-driven, subsidy-driven
              approach," he said. "They've been building toilets for people who don't
              want them and use them as bicycle stores and cow sheds and so forth."</p>
              <p>Too much time was also being wasted on trying to get the private sector involved in sanitation facilities.</p>
              <p>"The
              big multinational companies who were perceived as coming into the water
              sector don't want to come and manage utilities in developing countries
              because they have a profit motive which cannot be met in those
              countries," he said.</p>
              <p>As a result, in Africa, six in 10 people
              have no access to what development agencies call "an improved
              sanitation facility which separates human waste from human contact".</p>
              <p>Lack
              of sanitation not only increases the risk of disease, but also gives
              rise to safety issues, particularly for women and children who "risk
              sexual harassment and assault when defecating at night and in secluded
              areas".</p>
              <p>Between 1990 and 2004, sanitation access improved for 1.2
              billion people. But if current trends continue, there will still be 2.4
              billion people without toilets in 2015.</p>
              <p>UN-Water chairman
              Pasquale Steduto said: "The entire UN system has a shared
              responsibility in mobilizing concrete actions towards its achievement;
              investments must increase immediately."</p>
              <p>WHO estimates that, on average, one US dollar spent on sanitation will wind up 9.10 dollars later.</p>
              <p>In
              Peru, it cost 800 million dollars to respond to a cholera outbreak in
              1991 -- far more than the amount needed to improve sanitation and thus
              prevent such an outbreak from occurring.</p>
