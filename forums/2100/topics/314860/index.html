              <h1 class="clr">Catholic High Primary turns toilets into works of art</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE : Catholic High Primary School has transformed its toilets
              into works of art, as part of Earth Day, which falls on April 22.</p>
              <p>Now known as ’Happy Toilets’, they are also meant to to inspire good washroom habits.</p>
              <p>The toilets now come in various themes, with some taking users on an underwater adventure or even to fairytale land.</p>
              <p>But the toilets are not just good to look at; they also serve to inform users of proper washroom habits.</p>
              <p>Teo
              Xue Heng, Primary 5 Student, Catholic High Primary, said, "There are
              also signs to tell people how they should wash their hands and flush
              the toilet after use. When people go into the toilet, sometimes the
              designs get them attracted as well. They see the posters at the same
              time, so they will take notice of them and practise (good washroom
              habits) in their daily lives."</p>
              <p>It took 10 boys to transform each of the four toilets, and they worked on this project for three months.</p>
              <p>That translates to three hours of painting after school each week.</p>
              <p>Xue
              Heng explained, "We had to sketch out a part. At one point, our sketch
              went missing, so we had to do it again. It was tiresome, but quite fun,
              because all of us actually cooperated to design this toilet."</p>
              <p>The
              teacher in charge, Eugenia Ong, elaborated, "The boys actually did the
              brainstorming in class during art lesson, and then they sketched out
              their designs on paper.</p>
              <p>"After that, the parents and the teachers
              helped by making the ideas more feasible, and creating the design on
              the cubicle doors itself. Then the boys came in; they stayed back after
              curriculum hours to do the general background and simple painting."</p>
              <p>Less than S$300 was spent on this project and the money came from a special fund under the National Environment Agency (NEA).</p>
              <p>The
              revamped toilets are part of the Happy Toilet School Education
              Programme, which was launched in 2005. And since then, about 220
              schools have recreated their toilets.</p>
              <p>Tan Puay Hoon, President of
              the Restroom Association, said, "If you want to do something well, it
              is important for you to love the things. So you need to let the kids
              love the toilets. Once they love the toilets, they will know how to
              take care of the toilets."</p>
              <p>The Restroom Association has awarded Catholic High Primary the ’Gold Award’ for their ’Happy Toilets’.</p>
              <p>Ms Tan revealed that the Restroom Association has plans to widen the scale of the Happy Toilets School Education Programme.</p>
              <p>It will launch the nationwide ’Loo Campaign’, starting in June.</p>
              <p>The aim is for all toilets in Singapore to be cleaned up by 2010, in time for the Youth Olympic Games. — CNA/ms</p>
