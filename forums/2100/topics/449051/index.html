              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> SINGAPORE: The National Environment Agency (NEA) will step up 
              enforcement efforts at dirty toilets in coffeeshops and food outlets 
              islandwide.</span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT">Currently, NEA inspectors check on the toilets in these places once a month.</span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT">This comes as the 
              Restroom Association of Singapore (RAS) released its latest toilet 
              survey results, which show that toilets in coffeeshops are still the 
              dirtiest.<br><br>NEA said operators who chalk up 24 demerit points for 
              poorly maintained toilets will have their food outlet suspended, until 
              hygiene and cleanliness standards of the premises, including toilets, 
              are satisfactory.<br><br>Members of the public can also play a role in contributing towards cleaner public toilets.<br><br>NEA is inviting the public to send pictures of dirty toilets via its mobile app, myENV. <br><br>Action will be taken against operators who fail to keep their toilets clean and provide the basic amenities.<br><br>The public can also continue to send pictures to Contact_NEA@nea.gov.sg.<br><br>A
               revised Code of Practice for Environmental Health is expected to come 
              into effect for all new food outlet licensees early 2013 following a 
              consultation with stakeholders from June.<br><br>The code stipulates a 
              set of basic toilet design requirements, such as the provision of 
              adequate number of sanitary fittings, basic amenities and ventilation 
              systems, before NEA issues a licence to food outlets. <br><br>NEA said 
              it will work with industry representatives including architects, 
              developers and operators to look specifically into design and 
              infrastructure elements that make it easier to keep the toilets clean.<br><br>Examples
               include the mandatory provision of automatic sensor taps and 
              installation of hand-wash basins, soap dispensers and hand-drying 
              facilities at a common location.<br><br>NEA is also encouraging more 
              food outlets to join the Happy Toilet Programme which is a voluntary 
              system to help grade toilets and improve the cleanliness standards of 
              toilets.<br><br>The number of coffeeshop chain operators achieving 
              certification under the programme has increased from 58 in last November
               to 103 in February this year.<br><br>The RAS submitted its five 
              recommendations to the government this week, which include a mandatory 
              rating scheme for toilets; continued government intervention and 
              enforcement; specialised training of restroom attendants; higher toilet 
              design guidelines; and effective public awareness &amp; engagement.<br><br>RAS said eight in 10 survey respondents wanted a mandatory rating system for toilets.<br><br>The
               RAS also recommended stricter toilet design guidelines. 43.6 per cent 
              of the respondents found cubicle space too tight and most preferred 
              toilets with seats over squatting ones.<br><br>According to the survey, 
              toilet users said they want modesty boards next to urinals, and a 
              one-stop washing basin where people can wash their hands, dry them, and 
              dispose of their litter all in one place.<br><br>They also recommend 
              more specialised training for toilet attendants and more hard-hitting 
              messages to the public to remind them the public awareness campaigns on 
              toilet cleanliness.<br><br>The Association also wants to remind the public that toilet and food hygiene are interlinked. <br><br>About two-thirds of people said they are fine with dirty toilets in food outlets - as long as they sell good food.<br><br>- CNA/ck/fa</span></p>
