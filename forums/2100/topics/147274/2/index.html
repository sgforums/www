As I was sitting nicely and listening to the yellow waterwalls, someone opened the door. I saw a head of some young arab and screamed Moment!!!! , he opened the door even more, put his head in and with a broad smile said Sooorryyy! After seeing me, the queen sitting on the throne and reigning and making a surprised face, he closed the door and for the sake of his dignity I hope he found the male toilet fast enough.</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
