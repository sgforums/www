              <h1 class="clr">Thai school gets transvestite bathrooms</h1>
              <p>BANGKOK, Thailand - For teen boys who prefer to dress as girls at one
              rural high school in Thailand, taking a bathroom break no longer means
              choosing between "male" and "female" restrooms. There's now a
              "transvestite toilet."</p>
              <p>The Kampang School in northeastern Thailand conducted a survey last
              term that showed more than 200 of the school's 2,600 students
              considered themselves transgender, said school director Sitisak
              Sumontha.</p>
              <p>So, when classes resumed in May, the school unveiled a
              unisex restroom designated by a human figure split in half _ part man
              in blue and part woman in red. Below it are the words "Transvestite
              Toilet."</p>
              <p>Three transgender students praised the new restroom as
              they plucked their eyebrows and applied face powder in front of the
              mirror outside the stalls.</p>
              <p>"I'm so happy about this," Vichai
              Sangsakul, a teenager with a pixie hairdo pulled back with a pink
              barrette, told Thailand's PBS news channel on Tuesday. "It looks bad
              going to female restrooms. What would other people think?"</p>
              <p>Most
              rural Thais are conservative in many ways, but the trailblazing toilet
              initiative at the school in northeastern Sisaket province reflects
              another aspect of Thai society: its tolerance of the country's very
              visible transgender community. The term describes a wide range of
              identities including cross-dressers, transvestites, transsexuals and
              those born with the physical characteristics of both sexes.</p>
              <p>"These
              students want to be able to go to the restroom in peace without fear of
              being watched, laughed at or groped," said school director Sitisak
              Sumontha.</p>
              <p>He said the concept reflected a growing need at Thai schools and universities.</p>
              <p>Kampang
              is not Thailand's first educational institution to set up unisex
              washrooms, though Sitisak said he believed it was a first for a
              secondary school. A 1,500-student technical college in the northern
              province of Chiang Mai set up a "Pink Lotus Bathroom" for its 15
              transvestite students in 2003.</p>
              <p>Deputy Education Minister Boonlue
              Prasertsopar recently said the ministry plans to count the number of
              transgender university students.</p>
              <p>He said he was not promoting
              transgender interests, "but if there are a lot of them in a university
              and it's a problem, we may have to consider building toilets and
              dormitories for them."</p>
              <p>Transgenders are regularly seen on TV soap
              operas and throughout Bangkok, working at department store cosmetics
              counters, popular restaurants, in office jobs and in the capital's
              red-light districts. Thailand also has transgender beauty pageants.</p>
