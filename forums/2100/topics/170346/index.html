I finally thought of another topic to keep this forum alive... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>A friend of mine (Bedok) got a ceiling leakage problem at both his toilets about a year ago. His own ceiling was not leaking, but his toilet floor leaked to his lower floor neighbour.<br><br>The lower floor floor neighbour reported the defect to HDB. Then an officer from the Branch Office went to the lower &amp; upper floor floor to inspect the leak. There was a scheme offered by HDB called the Goodwill Repair Assistance Notification (GRAN) scheme to subsidise the cost of repairs.<br><br>The lower &amp; upper floor will only pay 25% of the basic repair cost done by HDB's term contractor. The remaining 50% is absorbed by HDB. Basic cost means the cost to hack the entire toilet floor, rescreed &amp; waterproof, lay new floor tiles provided the term contractor and replace with a new WC (taking 4 working days per toilet). But my friend got additional charges to pay to the contractor (on top of HDB basic cost) - eg take down &amp; reinstall his existing toilet doors for repair access, demolish his long-bath, etc.<br>Basic cost payable to HDB : (25%) - about $180++ per toilet<br>Additional charge to contractor : A few hundred dollars per toilet!!!!<br><br>And a few months after completion: Guess what happens??<br>There's no more leak problem recurring, but - the toilet floor tiles offered by HDB term contractor was super horrible! Tiles colour began to fade off! The cement pointing (gap between the tiles) are easily stained and unable to be removed even using chemicals. The contractor actually used silicone to seal the bottom of the WC (ie between the floor &amp; WC)! That's why the silicone turned from white to BLACK!! SO HORRIBLE LOOKING !!!! I heard that if white cement is used to seal the gap instead of silicone, it won't turn black.<br><br>My friend was very disapppointed. He paid alot to downgrade his toilet. His long-bath was demolished to make way for repair access also.<br><br>My friend said the HDB supervisor went to his house during repair to inspect the work, but he felt very funny - in spite of such supervision, why no one bothered to improve the work quality etc? are these officers sleeping???<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
